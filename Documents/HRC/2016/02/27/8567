<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism contains summaries of 
communications transmitted to Governments as well as replies received between 1 January 
and 31 December 2010. In addition, the report covers press releases issued in 2010. 
</p>
<p>2. During the period under review the Special Rapporteur corresponded with 
Governments, either separately or jointly with other Special Procedures mandate-holders, in 
18 communications and he issued three press releases, relating to a total of 12 countries.  
</p>
<p>3. During the course of 2010, the Special Rapporteur received 10 replies from 7 
Governments in response to communications sent in 2009 and 2010 (the former are 
reflected in the previous report, A/13/37/Add.1). Many of the Governments offered detailed 
substantive information on the allegations received. The Special Rapporteur underlines that 
it is crucial that Governments share their information and views with him on the allegations 
received. The Special Rapporteur encourages cooperation from those Governments which 
have not yet provided replies to his communications. Replies received after 31 December 
2010 will be reflected in a future report to the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur acted upon information received from reliable sources 
concerning individual cases of alleged breaches of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
in the context of countering terrorism. In addition, he also took action with respect to 
legislative developments and proposals undertaken by a number of Member States. The 
Special Rapporteur recognizes that problems concerning human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in the context of countering terrorism are not only confined to the countries 
mentioned.   
</p>
<p><b> II. Communications transmitted, replies received and 
statements made to the press 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Bahrain 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>5. On 20 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, and the then Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent a joint urgent appeal concerning 
the situation of Dr. <b>Abduljalil Al Singace</b>, Director and Spokesperson of the Human 
Rights Bureau of the Haq Movement for Civil Liberties and Democracy, Mr. <b>Abdul Ghani 
Al Kanja</b>, Spokesperson of the National Committee for Martyrs and Victims of Torture, 
Mr. <b>Jaffar Al-Hessabi</b>, a Bahraini human right activist who had been living in the United 
Kingdom (UK) for 15 years where he advocated for the release of political prisoners, Mr. 
<b>Mohammed Saeed</b>, a board member of the non-governmental organization Bahrain Centre 
for Human Rights, as well as <b>Sheikh Mohammed Al-Moqdad</b>, <b>Sheikh Saeed Al-Nori</b>, 
<b>Sheikh Mirza Al-Mahroos</b> and <b>Sheikh Abdulhadi Al-Mukhuder</b>, who are four religious 
and political activists. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>6. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>On 13 August 2010, Mr. Abduljalil Al Singace was reportedly arrested at 
Bahrain International Airport on his way back from the UK with his family, 
following his participation on 5 August in a seminar on the human rights situation in 
Bahrain held at the House of Lords, during which he denounced the alleged 
deterioration of the human rights and environmental situation in the country. During 
his stay in the UK, Mr. Al Singace took the opportunity to meet with a number of 
international human rights organizations. According to reports, Mr. Al Singace, who 
is disabled and requires the use of a wheelchair, was forcefully apprehended by the 
authorities. On the same day, a peaceful demonstration in solidarity took place in 
front of Mr. Al Singace&#8217;s house, and was violently repressed by security forces 
using tear-gas, sound bombs and rubber bullets. Several demonstrators were injured 
in the course of the operation. 
</p>
<p>On 15 August 2010, security forces raided Mr. Abdul Ghani Al Kanja&#8217;s 
home, arrested him and confiscated his computer and mobile phones. 
</p>
<p>It was reported that Messrs. Al Singace and Al Kanja were accused of 
&#8220;forming an organized network aiming at weakening the security and the stability of 
the country&#8221; under the Anti-Terrorism Law and the Criminal Code. According to Mr 
Al Singace&#8217;s lawyer who spoke to the Public Prosecution Office, case numbers were 
yet to be assigned and Mr. Abduljalil Al Singace was to face charges of sedition and 
making unauthorised contact with foreign bodies. Both Messrs Al Singace and Al 
Kanja were reportedly denied access to their lawyer and to their families. Their 
whereabouts remained unknown as of 20 August 2010.  
</p>
<p>On 16 August 2010, Mr. Jaffar Al-Hessabi was arrested at Bahrain 
International Airport on his way back from Iran, following his participation in 
peaceful protests in London. 
</p>
<p>On 17 August 2010, Mr. Mohammed Saeed was arrested at his home. 
</p>
<p>Finally, between 15 and 17 August 2010, Messrs Sheikh Mohammed Al-
Moqdad, Sheikh Saeed Al-Nori, Sheikh Mirza Al-Mahroos and Sheikh Abdulhadi 
Al-Mukhuder were arrested following their recent participation in peaceful protests 
calling for the release of political prisoners. 
</p>
<p>7. The mandate holders expressed serious concerns that the arrest and detention of 
Messrs Abduljalil Al Singace, Abdul Ghani Al Kanja, Jaffar Al-Hessabi, Mohammed 
Saeed, Sheikh Mohammed Al-Moqdad, Sheikh Saeed Al-Nori, Sheikh Mirza Al-Mahroos 
and Sheikh Abdulhadi Al-Mukhuder, and the charges brought against some of them, may 
have been linked to their peaceful activities in defence of human rights, while exercising 
their right to freedom of opinion and expression. In view of the incommunicado detention 
of Messrs Abduljalil Al Singace and Abdul Ghani Al Kanja, and possibly of Messrs Jaffar 
Al-Hessabi, Mohammed Saeed, Sheikh Mohammed Al-Moqdad, Sheikh Saeed Al-Nori, 
Sheikh Mirza Al-Mahroos and Sheikh Abdulhadi Al-Mukhuder, further concerns were 
expressed for their physical and psychological integrity, most notably for Abduljalil Al 
Singace who is disabled and needs assistance to walk. Finally, concern was expressed about 
the excessive use of force against participants of the peaceful protest in front of Mr. 
Abduljalil Al Singace&#8217;s house. 
</p>
<p>8. The mandate holders appealed to the Government of Bahrain to take all necessary 
measures to guarantee their right not to be deprived arbitrarily of their liberty and to fair 
proceedings before an independent and impartial tribunal, in accordance with articles 9 and 
10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 9 and 14 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also referred the Government to the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>fundamental principles set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of 
Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state 
that &#8220;everyone has the right individually or in association with others, to promote and to 
strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the 
national and international levels&#8221; and that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility and duty to 
protect, promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by 
adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social, 
economic, political and other fields, as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that 
all persons under its jurisdiction, individually and in association with others, are able to 
enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice&#8221;. Furthermore, they brought to the attention 
of the Government articles 5, point a), 6, points b) and c), and 12, paras. 2 and 3, of the 
Declaration. They also stressed that the principle of legality in criminal law, enshrined in 
several international human rights instruments such as article 15 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and made non-derogable in times of public 
emergency, implies that the requirement of criminal liability is limited to clear and precise 
provisions in the law, so as to respect the principle of certainty of the law and ensure that it 
is not subject to interpretation which would broaden the scope of the proscribed conduct. In 
view of the mandate holders, at the national level, the specificity of terrorist crimes is 
defined by the presence of two cumulative conditions: (1) The means used, which can be 
described as deadly or otherwise serious violence against members of the general 
population or segments of it, or the taking of hostages; and (2) the intent, which is to cause 
fear among the population or the destruction of public order or to compel the government or 
an international organisation to doing or refraining from doing something. It is only when 
these two conditions are fulfilled that an act may be criminalized as terrorist. Further, they 
stressed that each Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental 
integrity of all persons, which is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. With regard to 
the allegations on the violent repression by security forces of the peaceful gathering in front 
of Mr. Al Singace&#8217;s house, including the use of tear-gas, sound bombs and rubber bullets, 
the mandate-holders drew the Government&#8217;s attention to Principle 4 of the UN Basic 
Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Officials, which provides that, &#8220;Law 
enforcement officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent 
means before resorting to the use of force and firearms.&#8221;  Furthermore, Principle 5 provides 
that, &#8220;Whenever the use of force and firearms is unavoidable law enforcement officials 
shall, (a) Exercise restraint in such use and act in proportion to the seriousness of the 
offence and the legitimate object to be achieved; (b) Minimize damage and injury, and 
respect and preserve human life; (c) Ensure that assistance and medical aid are rendered to 
any injured or affected persons at the earliest possible moment and (d) Ensure that relatives 
or close friends of the injured or affected person are notified at the earliest possible 
moment.&#8221; They also appealed to the Government of Bahrain to take all necessary steps to 
ensure the right of peaceful assembly as recognized in article 21 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also appealed to the Government to take all 
necessary steps to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with 
fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>9. The mandate holders requested the Government to provide details and results of any 
investigation, medical examinations, and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to 
this case and asked for clarification regarding the legal basis of the arrest and detention of 
Messrs Abduljalil Al Singace, Abdul Ghani Al Kanja, Jaffar Al-Hessabi, Mohammed 
Saeed, Sheikh Mohammed Al-Moqdad, Sheikh Saeed Al-Nori, Sheikh Mirza Al-Mahroos 
and Sheikh Abdulhadi Al-Mukhuder; the legal basis and the nature of the charges brought </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>against some of them; and the legal basis of the excessive use of force against participants 
of the peaceful protest in front of Mr. Abduljalil Al Singace&#8217;s house. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Reply</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government 
</b></p>
<p>10.  By letter dated 12 October 2010, in response to the communication of 20 August 
2010, the Government reported the following: The eight suspects have been arrested 
because evidence has emerged that they are allied in a structured network aimed at 
compromising national security and abusing the country&#8217;s stability. Namely, this network 
aims to overthrow and change the political system of the country, dissolve the constitution 
and obstruct the enforcement of its provisions, inciting and planning terrorist acts, inciting 
hatred and contempt against the regime, threatening public order and endangering the safety 
and security of the Kingdom.  
</p>
<p>11. This network has spread disorder in the country by recruiting youths and juveniles 
and inciting them to compose sabotage groups to commit acts of riot, violence and 
vandalism, disturbance of civil peace, attacking security personnel, nationals and foreigners 
residing in Bahrain, terrorizing them and damaging their private properties. 
</p>
<p>12. All such acts are punishable crimes pursuant to Law No. 58 of 2006 with respect to 
Protecting the Community from Terrorist Acts. The suspects were arrested under this law 
and not under Bahrain&#8217;s Code of Criminal Procedure which provides that suspects must be 
brought before the Public Prosecution within 48 hours of arrest. According to Article 27 of 
Law No. 58 of 2006, Judicial Officers are granted the right, subject to the emergence of 
sufficient evidence, to issue a protective custody order for a period not exceeding five days, 
and if necessary, permission may be obtained from the Public Prosecution to extend the 
custody to a period not exceeding 10 days. Such permission is strictly granted if the Judicial 
Officer provides sufficient evidence that the extension of the custody is essential for the 
continuation of the investigations. Following this period of 10 days, the suspects were duly 
referred to the Public Prosecution. 
</p>
<p>13. As a principal division of the judicial authority, the Public Prosecution have 
commenced and handled criminal proceedings. Working in its capacity as an investigation 
and indictment authority, and, following intensive investigations by prosecutors into the 
clandestine terror network, the eight suspects were laid with 12 charges under the Penal 
Code No. 15 of 1976, Law No. 58 of 2006 with respect to Protecting the Community from 
Terrorist Acts and Law No. 4 of 2001 with respect to Countering Money Laundering and 
Financing of Terrorism. The charges include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Founding, organising and managing an outlawed organisation with the aim of 
violating the law and disrupting provisions of the constitution and to prevent public 
authorities from exercising their duties, using terrorism; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Creation and establishment of an organization with the objective of overthrowing the 
regime, changing the statutes and using illegal violent means such as arson and 
vandalism; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Taking part in acts of sabotage, destruction and arson with terrorist attempt; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Raising funds for an organization that is involved in terrorist acts inside the country, 
willingly and knowingly; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Disseminating hatred and mockery of the political system through public speeches 
and the internet; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Agreeing and inciting to destroy public property; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Spreading provocative propaganda, news and false statements to destabilize public 
security and cause damages to public interests; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Publicly instigating sectarian hatred which disturbs civil peace; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Inciting others through public speeches and the Internet to disregard the law; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Inciting participation in public congregations with the purpose of committing arson, 
vandalism, and confronting the security authorities; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Unlawfully using force and violence to compel a public servant to abstain from his 
duty. 
</p>
<p>14. It is clear that all charges are on terror crimes, use of force and instigation to it. In 
this regard, it should be mentioned that all guarantees relevant to the suspects&#8217; rights have 
been respected during the investigations. 
</p>
<p>15. With regard to the reasons for the suspects&#8217; arrest, the Government would like to 
emphasize that the arrests were based purely on security measures, and were not motivated 
by nor linked to their peaceful activities in defence of human rights, but had been in the 
light of the existence of confirmed information, investigations and evidence that they are 
part of a structured network aimed at compromising national security and abusing the 
country&#8217;s stability. 
</p>
<p>16. The suspects, along with all citizens of Bahrain, preserve their right to work 
legitimately and peacefully in defence of human rights, as enshrined by the Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders. They also preserve the right of freedom of expression and 
opinion, as enshrined in the Constitution of Bahrain which provides that everyone has the 
right to express his opinion and publish it by word of mouth or in writing under the rules 
and conditions laid down by law, provided that the fundamental beliefs of Islamic doctrine 
are not infringed, the unity of the people is not prejudiced, and discord or sectarianism is 
not aroused. Legal action is only exercised against those who deviate from the scope of the 
legitimate and peaceful work in the defence of human rights and freedom of expression and 
recourse to the execution of acts amounting to the abuse of law.  
</p>
<p>17. Following the arrest of the eight suspects, they have all confessed that they were 
indeed involved in forming sabotage groups and instructed them to carry out rioting, arson, 
vandalism and attacking security men. Abduljalil Al-Singace confessed that he supported 
the groups financially to purchase necessary equipment and materials to undertake such 
sinful acts. He also admitted in details that he, along with the other seven suspects, incited 
openly and secretly to spread chaos in the country and to carry out sabotage acts, along with 
fund raising from citizens and businessmen under the guise of religion, charity and support 
for the families of prisoners and alleged martyrs and victims of torture.  
</p>
<p>18. Further, security authorities have arrested individuals who carried out arsons and 
rioting in varying incidents and in various areas, all of whom have confessed that Abduljalil 
Al-Singace was their main supporter and inciter for those acts. 
</p>
<p>19. In relation to the concern regarding whether the acts shall be criminalised as 
terrorist, the first two conditions (means used and intent) put forward will be demonstrated. 
Firstly, with respect to the means used. The sabotage groups have been committing acts of 
violence, rioting, vandalizing private and public properties, carrying out arsons, blocking 
highways and crippling all forms of life activities. These groups have added violence to 
their acts by using Molotov bombs, homemade bombs and sharpened iron bars. Molotov 
bombs are considered as improvised incendiary weapons and are primarily intended to set 
targets ablaze and destroy them. In fact, two police were killed in two separate horrific 
attacks by Molotov bombs: a policeman, and an innocent Pakistani passer-by, father of five, 
let alone the casualties and sufferers of such acts, be them members of security authorities 
or of the general population. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>20. Secondly, concerning the intent behind the aforementioned attacks, it may be seen 
from these acts of violence that the sabotage groups are aiming at the destruction of public 
order. They intend to cause fear among the general population and they chose to undertake 
their terrorist acts at night to spread even greater terror in the hearts of the general public. 
Some of the suspects have confessed that this intent was present while inciting the sabotage 
groups to commit acts of destruction to public order. 
</p>
<p>21. Hence, having seen that the means used by the sabotage groups can be described as 
deadly and of serious violence against members of the general population; and, having 
regard that the intent is to cause fear among the population along with destructing public 
order, one may fairly deduce that the bold presence of these two conditions cumulatively 
fulfil these acts to be criminalised as terrorist. 
</p>
<p>22. Last but not least, elucidation shall duly be made on the allegations on the violent 
repression by security forces of the peaceful protest in front of Abduljalil Al-Singace&#8217;s 
house. Principally, the Government has taken all necessary steps to ensure the right of 
peaceful assembly. Acting in accordance with article 21 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, the Government recognizes that no restrictions may be placed on 
this right other than those imposed inconformity with the law and which are necessary in 
the interest of national security of public safety, public order or the protection of the rights 
and freedoms of others. In this connection, participants in the protest in front of Al-
Singace&#8217;s house have resorted to violence for realization of the purpose for which they have 
assembled (release Al-Singace), causing their peaceful demonstration to be deemed as a 
riot. Security forces have exercised their authority granted by article 180 of the Penal Code 
and ordered the demonstrators to disperse. Should the order come to no avail, security 
forces shall be empowered to take the necessary measures for dispersing those who have 
not complied with the order by arresting them and may use force within reasonable limits 
against any person resisting said order. They may not use firearms except in extreme 
necessity or when someone&#8217;s life is in danger. The demonstrators have continued rioting 
despite receiving orders from security forces to disperse. Having ignored such orders, and, 
having regard to the interest of public order, security forces were compelled to use force to 
confront and terminate the mounting violence and disperse the rioters. In this connection, 
security forces have exerted force in accordance with the provisions of the public security 
forces law. Namely, article 13 has regulated the use of force in dispersing demonstrators 
and rioters. Force is only exerted following the failure of non-violent means, warning of 
resorting to the use of force and being the only remaining means of separation, along with 
resorting to force in order to obstruct an assault or resistance from demonstrators or rioters. 
</p>
<p>23. In this connection, mention shall be duly made that these rioters and protesters, who 
were initially incited by the suspects, have been camouflaging their acts of violence by 
labeling them as human rights activism or peaceful demonstrations or protests. It goes 
without saying that committing acts of riot, violence and vandalism under the disguise of 
promoting and protecting human rights reflects nothing but a solid violation of article 3 of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which stipulates that everyone has the right to 
life, liberty, and security of person. The Government of Bahrain is bound to protect 
individuals and groups against the abuse of these fundamental rights. 
</p>
<p>24. The Government of Bahrain reaffirms its adherence to the provisions stipulated in 
the UN body of Principles for the Protection of all Persons under any form of Detention or 
Imprisonment. All persons under any form of detention are treated in a humane manner 
with respect for their physical and psychological integrity and inherent dignity of the 
human person. Most notably, with regard to the disability of Abduljalil Al-Singace, he has 
been provided with a wheelchair and is always assisted when walking. Any arrest, detention 
or imprisonment is only carried out strictly in accordance with the provisions of the law and 
by competent officials or persons authorized for that purpose. Convinced that the adoption </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>of this Body of Principles would make an important contribution to the protection of human 
rights, Bahrain has prohibited by law any act contrary to the rights and duties contained 
therein. 
</p>
<p>25. It is also worth stressing that the recent arrests have no relation whatsoever with the 
parliamentary elections scheduled to take place on 23 October 2010. All suspects do not 
recognize these elections. They never participated in them, and not only did they boycott 
the elections, but they called for a boycott ever since the re-birth of parliamentary elections 
in 2002. 
</p>
<p>26. In conclusion, the Government of Bahrain reaffirms its guarantee to provide all 
necessary measures to ensure that all suspects are not deprived arbitrarily of their liberty 
and are entitled in full equality to fair proceedings before an independent and impartial 
tribunal. Bahrain also reaffirms its respect to the observance of the purposes and principles 
of, inter alia, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. Bahrain recognizes the relation between peace and security and 
the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and is mindful that the absence 
of peace and security does not excuse non-compliance. Bahrain also acknowledges the 
important role of the Human Rights Council in the contribution to the effective elimination 
of all violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms of peoples and individuals, and 
fully supports its efforts in promoting universal respect for human rights along with its 
determination to examine thoroughly all the cases brought to its attention. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>27. On 15 October 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders sent a joint urgent appeal concerning the arrest and detention of Mr. <b>Ali 
Abdulemam</b>. Mr. Abdulemam is the creator and manager of the www.bahrainonline.org 
news website, and a blogger who regularly wrote articles regarding media freedom and 
freedom of expression in Bahrain. 
</p>
<p>28. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>On 4 September 2010 at approximately 9 p.m., Mr. Abdulemam was arrested 
following a summons, via a telephone call, for questioning by the National Security 
Apparatus (NSA). Since his arrest, Mr. Abdulemam was denied access to legal 
representation, and doubts existed as to whether or not he had been presented before 
the Public Prosecutor within the time limits proscribed by law. He was denied access 
to family members until 29 September 2010. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s arrest was reportedly declared by the Ministry of Interior 
to form part of an investigation into an alleged &#8220;terrorist network accused of 
planning and executing a campaign of violence, intimidation and subversion in 
Bahrain&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>According to article 27 of the 2006 &#8220;Law to Protect Society from Acts of 
Terrorism&#8221;, which was invoked by the authorities in the arrests of Mr. Abdulemam 
and various other human rights defenders, a suspect may be detained for a maximum 
of 15 days before either being brought before the Public Prosecutor who must 
question the suspect within three days and either order him remanded or released. 
Government officials claimed that Mr. Abdulemam was presented before the Public 
Prosecutor soon after his arrest. On 22 September 2010 it was announced by 
officials that, beginning on 27 September 2010, all detained human rights activists 
would be allowed to receive visits from their families. Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s brother, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>Mr. Hossein Abdulemam, visited the Office of the Public Prosecutor in order to 
apply for permission to visit Mr. Abdulemam in detention. He was, however, 
subsequently informed by an official at said Office that Mr. Abdulemam had not 
been brought before the Public Prosecutor and that there is neither any record of, nor 
personal number assigned to him, at the Office.   
</p>
<p>Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s initial 15-day detention period expired on 19 September 
2010; if true, the aforementioned lack of knowledge regarding the case at the Office 
of the Public Prosecutor would suggest that Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s detention continues 
in contradiction of said legislation. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s wife was allowed to visit him in detention for the first 
time on 29 September 2010; however, Mr. Abdulemam had yet to be granted access 
to his lawyer.  
</p>
<p>The Ministry of the Interior allegedly denied that Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s arrest 
was in any way related to his political views. However, since 5 September 2010 - the 
day following Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s arrest - the BahrainOnline.org website was 
unavailable both within Bahrain and abroad. Furthermore, it was feared that Mr. 
Abdulemam had been compelled to reveal the password for his Internet service.  
</p>
<p>29. Concern was expressed that the arrest and detention of Mr. Abdulemam may be 
related to his peaceful and legitimate work in defence of human rights, particularly with 
respect to freedom of expression. Furthermore, mindful of the allegation that Mr. 
Abdulemam had yet to be granted access to his lawyer and brought before the Public 
Prosecutor, serious concern was expressed for his physical and psychological integrity. 
</p>
<p>30. The mandate holders appealed to the Government of Bahrain to take all necessary 
measures to guarantee his right not to be deprived arbitrarily of his liberty and to fair 
proceedings before an independent and impartial tribunal, in accordance with articles 9 and 
10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 9 and 14 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As the arrest and detention of Mr. Ali Abdulemam 
may have been related to his role as creator and manager of the www.bahrainonline.org 
news website and a blogger, they also appealed to the Government to take all necessary 
steps to secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with 
fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. Moreover, in relation to the allegation that the BahrainOnline.org website 
had been unavailable both within Bahrain and abroad since 5 September 2010, the mandate 
holders wished to reiterate the principle enunciated by Human Rights Council resolution 
12/16, which calls on States - while noting that article 19, paragraph 3, of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that the exercise of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression carries with it special duties and responsibilities - to refrain from 
imposing restrictions which are not consistent with paragraph 3 of that article, including on 
(iii) access to or use of information and communication technologies, including radio, 
television and the Internet. They also stressed that the principle of legality in criminal law, 
enshrined in several international human rights instruments such as article 15 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and made non-derogable in times of 
public emergency, implies that the requirement of criminal liability is limited to clear and 
precise provisions in the law, so as to respect the principle of certainty of the law and 
ensure that it is not subject to interpretation which would broaden the scope of the 
proscribed conduct. In view of the mandate holders, at the national level, the specificity of 
terrorist crimes is defined by the presence of two cumulative conditions: (1) The means 
used, which can be described as deadly or otherwise serious violence against members of 
the general population or segments of it, or the taking of hostages; and (2) the intent, which 
is to cause fear among the population or the destruction of public order or to compel the 
government or an international organization to doing or refraining from doing something, in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>the advancement of a political, religious or ideological cause. It is only when these two 
conditions are fulfilled that an act may be criminalized as terrorist. The mandate holders 
further referred the Government to the fundamental principles set forth in the Declaration 
on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote 
and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and in 
particular articles 1; 2; 6, points b) and c); 9, para.1; and 12, paras. 2 and 3. They further 
referred to the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, in particular principle 8, according 
to which all arrested, detained or imprisoned persons shall be provided with adequate 
opportunities, time and facilities to be visited by and to communicate and consult with a 
lawyer, without delay, interception or censorship and in full confidentiality. Such 
consultations may be within sight, but not within the hearing, of law enforcement officials. 
They further drew the Government&#8217;s attention to principle 5, which provides that 
Governments shall ensure that all persons are immediately informed by the competent 
authority of their right to be assisted by a lawyer of their own choice upon arrest or 
detention or when charged with a criminal offence, and principle 7, which states that 
Governments shall further ensure that all persons arrested or detained, with or without 
criminal charge, shall have prompt access to a lawyer, and in any case not later than forty-
eight hours from the time of arrest or detention. 
</p>
<p>31. The mandate holders asked for clarification concerning the legal grounds for the 
continued detention of Mr. Ali Abdulemam, allegedly without access to legal representation 
or being brought before the Public Prosecutor, and how these measures were compatible 
with international norms and standards as stipulated, inter alia, in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also requested an indication whether and how 
the requirements of the principle of legality were observed in relation to the definition of 
the crime that reportedly formed the basis of the arrest and detention of Mr. Ali 
Abdulemam. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>32. In a letter dated 15 November 2010, the Government responded to the joint urgent 
appeal of 15 October 2010 and underlined that it has not, and does not, target or prosecute 
any individuals based on their peaceful views or opinions. Further, Bahrain is committed to 
the rule of law, and to following the proper legal and constitutional procedures designed to 
protect the rights of all in society. In the case of Mr. Abdulemam, the summary set out in 
the communication is inaccurate. Mr. Abdulemam was arrested on 4 September on the basis 
of evidence of his membership of a terrorist network. Investigations have found the 
network to be responsible for inciting and planning terrorist acts, inciting hatred and 
contempt against the Government, threatening public order and endangering the safety and 
security of the Kingdom. The aim of the network is to overthrow and change the political 
system of the country by force, dissolve the Constitution and obstruct the enforcement of its 
provisions. The network recruited nationals and foreigners, youngsters and adults, and 
incited them to commit acts of riot, violence and vandalism, disturbance of civil peace, 
attacking security personnel, nationals and foreigners residing in Bahrain, terrorizing them 
and damaging their private property. All such acts are punishable crimes pursuant to Law 
No. 58 of 2006 with respect to Protecting the Community from Terrorist Acts. This law 
grants Judicial Officers the right - subject to the emergence of sufficient evidence - to issue 
a protective custody order for a period not exceeding five days, and if necessary, 
permission may be obtained from the Public Prosecution to extend the custody to a period 
not exceeding 10 days. Such permission is strictly granted if the Judicial Officer provides 
sufficient evidence that the extension of the custody is essential for the continuation of the 
investigations. Given the nature of Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s suspected crimes, he was arrested 
under this Law No. 58 of 2006 with respect to Protecting the Community from Terrorist </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>Acts, and not under Bahrain&#8217;s Code of Criminal Procedure which provides that suspects 
must be brought before the Public Prosecution within 48 hours of arrest.  
</p>
<p>33. Prior to the elapse of the period of protective custody of five days, Mr. Abdulemam 
was duly referred to the Public Prosecution on 9 September 2010, which commenced and 
handled criminal proceedings. Following intensive investigations by prosecutors, Mr. 
Abdulemam was charged under the Penal Code No. 15 of 1976 and Law No. 58 of 2006 
with respect to Protecting the Community from Terrorist Acts. He is currently facing the 
following charges: Joining an outlawed organization with the aim of violating the law and 
disrupting provisions of the Constitution and to prevent public authorities from exercising 
their duties, using terrorism and violence; inciting to acts of sabotage, destruction and 
arson; publicly instigating sectarian hatred which disturbs civil peace; and spreading 
provocative propaganda, news and false statements to destabilize public security and cause 
damages to public interests.  
</p>
<p>34. Contrary to the fears expressed in the Communication, on 23 September, the Public 
Prosecution gave permission for the families of the defendants in this case to visit those in 
custody, and Mr. Abdulemam&#8217;s family subsequently visited him on 29 September. In 
relation to the concern regarding whether the acts shall be criminalized as terrorist, the first 
two conditions (means used and intent) put forward were met according to the Government: 
Firstly, with respect to the means used, the sabotage groups have been committing acts of 
violence, rioting, vandalizing private and public property, carrying out arsons, and blocking 
highways. These groups have added violence to their acts by using Molotov bombs 
(Molotov cocktails), homemade bombs and sharpened iron bars. Molotov bombs are 
considered as improvised incendiary weapons and are primarily intended to set targets 
ablaze and destroy them. In fact, two deaths occurred in two separate attacks by Molotov 
bombs, in which a policeman, and a civilian Pakistani passer-by, father of five, were killed. 
Secondly, the intent of these acts was to undermine public order, and to cause fear among 
the general population, for example, by carrying out their attacks at night to spread even 
greater fear among the general public.  Indeed, some of the suspects have admitted that this 
was their intent. Therefore, given that the acts of the groups in question clearly amount to 
serious (sometimes deadly) violence, and given that their intent was to cause fear among 
the population and to disrupt public order, it can clearly be seen that the activities amount to 
acts of criminal terrorism.  
</p>
<p>35. It is worth mentioning that Mr. Abdulemam, along with other members of the 
network, has sought to label the acts of violence as human rights activism or peaceful 
demonstrations or protest. Inciting to acts of riot, violence and vandalism under the guise of 
promoting and protecting human rights is a flagrant violation of article 3 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights which stipulates that everyone has the right to life, liberty and 
security of person. The Government of Bahrain is bound to protect individuals and groups 
against the abuse of these fundamental rights. Mr. Abdulemam is the creator of the 
www.bahrainonline.org website, which he has managed for many years. He provided that 
he has created this forum to instigate sectarian hatred and to spread provocative 
propaganda, news and false statements to destabilize public security and damage public 
interest. The leaders and members of the terrorist network have used this website, with the 
knowledge and observance of Mr. Abdulemam, to incite acts of sabotage, violence and 
terrorism. Furthermore, this website is known to praise such acts by posting footage and 
photos of the destruction and damage caused by those groups, along with glorifying them as 
heroes. Mr. Abdulemam has confirmed that he was funded by leaders of the terrorism 
network for doing so. 
</p>
<p>36. With regard to the concern expressed with respect to the physical and psychological 
integrity of Mr. Abdulemam, it is underlined that the Government of Bahrain fully 
reaffirms its adherence to the provisions stipulated in the UN Body of Principles for the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>Protection of all Persons under any form of Detention or Imprisonment. All persons under 
any form of detention are treated in a humane manner and with respect for their physical 
and mental integrity and inherent dignity of the human person. Any arrest, detention or 
imprisonment is only carried out strictly in accordance with the provisions of the law and 
by competent officials or persons authorized for that purpose. Convinced that the adoption 
of this Body of Principles would make an important contribution to the protection of human 
rights, Bahrain has prohibited by law any act contrary to the rights and duties contained 
therein. 
</p>
<p>37. Mr. Abdulemam is charged with criminal offences. He preserves his right to be 
presumed innocent and is treated as such until proved guilty in a public trial according to 
law, at which he has all the guarantees necessary for his defence. Bahrain restates its 
commitment to preserving the suspect&#8217;s right to fair proceedings before an independent and 
impartial tribunal to determine the criminal charges against him. The law guarantees the 
independence of the judiciary and the probity and impartiality of judges. In this context, 
attention is drawn to article 104 of the Constitution of Bahrain, which stipulates &#8220;No 
authority shall prevail over the judgment of a judge, and under no circumstances may the 
course of justice be interfered with.&#8221; Mr. Abdulemam has exercised his constitutional and 
legal rights with regards to his legal representation. Although he has refused to appoint a 
counsel for himself and no counsel has taken the initiative to represent him, he was legally 
represented in the first court hearing that was held publicly on 28 October 2010. As 
provided by the relevant legislation, if a suspect does not have legal counsel, one will be 
assigned to him by the court at its expense. Further, judgments of the criminal court may be 
challenged before the courts of Appeal, while the Courts of Cassation can examine the 
compliance of the judgments of the foregoing courts with the law.  
</p>
<p>38. Leaders and members of the terrorist network, along with all citizens of Bahrain, 
preserve their right of the legitimate and peaceful work in the defence of human rights, as 
enshrined in the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. They also preserve the right of 
freedom of expression and opinion, as enshrined in the Constitution of Bahrain which 
provides that everyone has the right to express his opinion and publish it by word of mouth 
or in writing under the rules and conditions laid down by law, provided that the 
fundamental beliefs of Islamic doctrine are not infringed, the unity of the people is not 
prejudiced, and discord or sectarianism is not aroused. Legal action is only exercised 
against those who deviate from the scope of the legitimate and peaceful work in the defence 
of human rights and freedom of expression and recourse to the execution of acts amounting 
to the abuse of law. 
</p>
<p>39. In conclusion, the Government of Bahrain reaffirms its guarantee to provide all 
necessary measures to ensure that Mr. Ali Abdulemam is not deprived arbitrarily of his 
liberty and is entitled in full equality to fair proceedings before an independent and 
impartial tribunal. Bahrain acknowledges the significant role of the Human Rights Council 
in the contribution to the effective elimination of all violations of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of peoples and individuals, and fully supports its efforts in 
promoting universal respect for human rights along with its determination to examine 
thoroughly all the cases brought to its attention. The Government underlined its 
appreciation of its ongoing cooperation with the United Nations human rights machinery 
and special procedures and assured of its desire to continue and develop this relationship in 
an open and transparent manner. </p>

</p>
<p><b> B. Canada 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>40. On 13 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Rapporteur 
on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent a letter to 
the Government of Canada informing it that the mandate holders had been approached by 
third parties in the case of Mr. <b>Omar Khadr</b>, a Canadian citizen, who was understood to 
still be detained at Guant&#225;namo Bay. Omar Khadr was 15 years old when he was arrested 
and 16 years at the time he was transferred to Guant&#225;namo Bay. Information received 
indicated that Mr. Khadr had been subjected to prolonged and severe sleep deprivation by 
U.S. officials in order to enhance the extraction of information from him during 
interrogations conducted by Canadian officials in 2004 when he was 17 years old. Military 
commission proceedings against Mr. Khadr were scheduled to recommence in July 2010 at 
Guant&#225;namo Bay.  
</p>
<p>41. In a 29 January 2010 decision, Canada&#8217;s Supreme Court reasoned that violations of 
Mr. Khadr&#8217;s rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were ongoing as the 
information obtained by Canadian officials during the course of their interrogations, 
conducted when Mr. Khadr was a minor without access to legal counsel or habeas corpus 
and had been subjected to improper treatment by the U.S. authorities at the time of the 
interview in March 2004, may form part of the case currently being held. In light of this 
decision, the mandate holders remained seriously concerned that Mr. Khadr will continue to 
be tried in military commission proceedings that do not adhere to international fair trial 
standards.  
</p>
<p>42.  The mandate holders referred the Government to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on 
his mission to the United States of America (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3) that highlighted serious 
situations of incompatibility between international human rights obligations and the 
counter-terrorism law and practice of the United States. Concerns highlighted in that report 
relate mainly to proceedings conducted by military commissions, which have not been fully 
addressed by the adoption of the 2009 U.S. Military Commissions Act, and the use of 
evidence obtained under torture or by coercion. Furthermore, they referred to the report of 
the then Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the then 
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the then Special Rapporteur 
on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the then Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, and the then Special Rapporteur on the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health 
on the situation of detainees at Guant&#225;namo Bay (E/CN.4/2006/120) that revealed a series 
of human rights violations of the detainees and recommended that terrorism suspects be 
detained and tried in accordance with criminal procedure that respects safeguards enshrined 
in relevant international law. 
</p>
<p>43. In view of Mr. Khadr&#8217;s prolonged and abusive detention at Guant&#225;namo Bay, the 
perpetuated violation of his rights under domestic law and international human rights law, 
and given that he will most likely not be afforded with a trial according to international fair 
trial standards, the mandate holders urged the Government to take appropriate remedial 
action in accordance with the recent Supreme Court decision and international standards. 
Given the ongoing violation of Mr. Khadr's rights, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s were of the 
opinion that repatriation to Canada, where he would be either released or prosecuted by a 
court of law in accordance with international fair trial standards, would pose the most 
suitable and effective option.  In their view, the sending of a diplomatic note to the 
Government of the United States formally seeking assurances that any evidence or 
statements shared with U.S. authorities as a result of the interviews of Mr. Khadr by 
Canadian agents and officials in 2003 and 2004 not be used against him by U.S. authorities </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>in the context of proceedings before the Military Commission or elsewhere, does not 
constitute an effective remedy for the human rights violations he was subjected to. 
</p>
<p>44. The mandate holders wished to reiterate their deep interest that the violations of Mr. 
Omar Khadr&#8217;s rights come promptly to an end and highlighted their availability for 
consultations on this matter. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>45. By a letter of 10 May 2010, the Government of Canada responded to the letter of 13 
April 2010 and indicated that it had taken many steps to address the interests of Mr. Khadr 
in respect of his detention by the United States in Guantanamo Bay. Canadian government 
observers have been present at his hearings before the Military Commission in Guantanamo 
Bay and the Court of Military Commission Review in Washington, D.C. Furthermore, 
officials of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada have carried out regular visits 
with Mr. Khadr and will continue to do so. The visits allow access to Mr. Khadr to assess 
his welfare and treatment, and to obtain information about his mental and physical 
condition. 
</p>
<p>46. Canada has consistently sought to ensure that Mr. Khadr receives the benefits of due 
process, including access to Canadian counsel of his choice. More examples of the 
Government of Canada&#8217;s actions in respect of  Mr. Khadr are outlined in the dissenting 
reasons of Justice Nadon of the Federal Court of Appeal (2009 FCA 246 at paragraph 88) 
which and can be viewed at http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/en/2009fca246/2009fca246.html. 
</p>
<p>47. Mr. Khadr was arrested in 2002 by U.S. Forces in the context of his alleged 
involvement in the armed conflict in Afghanistan following his alleged recruitment and use 
as combatant by al Qaeda, and was later transferred to Guantanamo Bay by the Americans. 
Mr. Khadr&#8217;s presence in this conflict was not the result of actions by Canada and at no time 
since his arrest has he fallen under Canadian jurisdiction. Mr. Khadr has been detained by 
the United States, has remained under U.S. jurisdiction continuously since then, and now 
faces serious changes pursuant to U.S. legislation. Therefore, while the mandate holders&#8217; 
letter raises important issues, most of them would be more properly addressed to the 
Government of the United States. 
</p>
<p>48. It is important to note that the Government of Canada at no time requested that the 
United States subject Mr. Khadr to any form of mistreatment. To the contrary, the 
Government of Canada has consistently asked the Government of the United States to 
ensure that Mr. Khadr be treated humanely and in a manner consistent with his age. With 
respect to the allegation of sleep deprivation, it is important to bear in mind the particular 
facts as to when and how the allegation was brought to Canada&#8217;s attention. In those 
circumstances, the decision of a Canadian official to proceed with the final interview did 
not amount to Canadian acquiescence in such treatment. 
</p>
<p>49. On 22 January 2009, the Honourable Barack Obama, President of the United States, 
issued an Executive Order ordering that the Guantanamo Bay detention facilities be closed 
no later than one year from that date and that the status of each Guantanamo detainee be 
immediately reviewed. As a result of this review, on 13 November 2009, Mr. Eric Holder, 
Attorney General of the United States, announced that the United States will proceed to 
trial against Mr. Khadr by way of a military commission trial. This choice of mechanisms 
put in place to try detainees is a matter for the U.S. authorities. 
</p>
<p>50. In the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; correspondence, it was also referred to the decision of 
the Supreme Court of Canada in Mr. Khadr&#8217;s appeal. The Government notes that, in its 
ruling, the Supreme Court recognized the constitutional responsibility of the executive to 
make decisions on matters of foreign affairs, given the complex and ever-changing 
circumstances of diplomacy, and the need to take into account Canada&#8217;s broader interests. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>In response to the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling, the Government of Canada delivered a 
diplomatic note to the Government of the United States on 16 February 2010, formally 
seeking assurances that any evidence or statements shared with U.S. authorities as a result 
of the interviews of Mr. Khadr by Canadian agents and officials in 2003 and 2004 not be 
used against him by U.S. authorities in the context of proceedings before the Military 
Commission or elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>51. The Government of Canada was not prepared at that time to discuss with the Special 
Rapporteurs the question of whether it should seek the repatriation of Mr. Khadr to Canada 
as this matter was again the subject of litigation before the courts. 
</p>
<p><b> C. India 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>52. On 22 January 2010, the Special Rapporteur addressed a letter of allegation to the 
Government of India concerning the arrest of <b>Mr. Andrea Pagnacco</b> on 11 January 2010 
in the Indian state of Rajasthan. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>53. Mr. Pagnacco, who is an active environmental campaigner, was detained for 
illegally using a satellite phone. He was subsequently ordered detention for 14 days 
pending investigation under Indian anti-terrorism legislation as well as for violating Indian 
wireless and telegraphy laws. Mr. Pagnacco was granted bail and was free to travel while 
further investigations on the aforementioned charges were pending. 
</p>
<p>54. While being conscious of the fact that States, as part of their obligation to promote 
and protect human rights, are required to undertake a number of measures for the effective 
fight against terrorism, the Special Rapporteur underlined that States must ensure that any 
measure taken to combat terrorism complies with their obligations under international law, 
in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law. In connection with 
the arrest of Mr. Pagnacco and with particular respect to the adequate criminalization of the 
crime of terrorism, the Special Rapporteur took the opportunity to recall the cumulative 
characterization of terrorist crimes as elaborated by the Security Council in its resolution 
1566 (2004). Here, he in particular stressed the first two of those criteria, according to 
which an act, in order to be classified as terrorist, must have been (i) committed against 
members of the general population, or segments of it, with the intention of causing death or 
serious bodily injury, or the taking of hostages, and, (ii) committed for the purpose of 
provoking a state of terror, intimidating a population, or compelling a Government or 
international organization to do or abstain from doing any act. Together, these conditions 
reflect the principle that terrorism should be defined through its inexcusable methods of 
violence and against bystanders and its intention to create fear among the general 
population rather than through political or other aims, which may overlap with the aims of 
social movements that have nothing to do with terrorist acts. (see, for example, 
A/HRC/6/17, paragraph 73). 
</p>
<p>55.  In connection with the latter, the Special Rapporteur reiterated the fundamental right 
pertaining to freedom of expression, as established in article 19 of the Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. While acknowledging that the need to effectively counter terrorism 
may imply legitimate restrictions on actions connected to the enjoyment of this right, he 
recalled that all such limitations must be applied in accordance with precise criteria 
established by law and according to the principles of proportionality and necessity. By no 
means should counter-terrorism measures be used to limit rights that are fundamental for a 
democratic society. In the absence of any information regarding Mr. Pagnacco&#8217;s 
involvement in activities related to terrorism, the Special Rapporteur highly appreciated if 
the Government of India could reassure him that the charges are not related to his activities </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>for the protection of the environment and provide him with detailed substantive information 
on (i) which are the acts that form the basis for the specific charges on national security in 
the case referred to above; (ii) which is the legal basis for and what are the corresponding 
punishments for the charges under investigation; and how does Indian legislation define the 
crime of terrorism and related offences? 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>56.  After having acknowledged receipt of the communication by letter dated 29 January 
2010, the Government of India, by letter dated 7 October 2010, conveyed that the allegation 
had been investigated by the Government and found to be inaccurate. While it is true that 
Mr. Andrea Pagnacco was detained for illegally using a satellite phone in India without the 
necessary permission from Indian authorities, it is inaccurate to state that he was arrested, 
detained or charged under Indian anti-terrorism legislation. He was brought before the 
Court on charges under Indian wireless and telegraphy legislations and was released after 
the payment of a fine. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Iraq 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>57. On 11 May 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, the then Special Rapporteur 
on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the then 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, sent a joint urgent 
appeal to the Government of Iraq regarding <b>the arrest of a group of between 400 and 700 
men by the Iraqi Army in the Mosul region and their further transfer and abusive 
treatment in a secret detention facility near Baghdad</b>. 
</p>
<p>58. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>From September to December 2009, between 400 and 700 men would have 
been arrested and detained by the Iraqi Army in the course of an operation in the 
Mosul area and transferred to a secret detention facility near Baghdad, at the old 
Muthanna airport. Since their arrest, the whereabouts of these detainees were 
allegedly unknown and family members have reportedly been filing missing person 
reports with the Government. In April 2010, 431 of these men would have been 
found in the Al Rusafa Detention Centre.  While being held in the Old Muthanna 
airport facility, this group of men would have been subject to torture and various 
forms of ill-treatment, including beatings, whipping, intentional wounding with 
firearms, breaking of limbs and teeth, suffocation, electric shocks, extraction of 
fingernails and toenails, acid and cigarette burns, rape by interrogators, detainees 
being forced to rape other detainees and threatened with rape of members of 
immediate family, humiliation, and denial of urgent medical treatment leading to, at 
least, one reported death in custody. 
</p>
<p>The alleged conditions of detention in the mentioned facility were reportedly 
inadequate, including overcrowding and poor holding facilities. Detainees would 
have been intentionally denied access to medical care, family, and legal 
representatives. Further, according to the information received, no registry and/or 
records of the detention in such facility were kept. Detainees were allegedly forced 
to sign false confessions of terrorist crimes.  
</p>
<p>59. The mandate holders expressed grave concern about the fact that the fate and 
whereabouts of 431 men detained in the course of this operation were unknown between 
September-December 2009 and April 2010 as well as about their physical and mental </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>integrity. Very serious concern was expressed about the fact that fate and whereabouts of a 
number of detainees, which could amount to over 200 men, remained unknown. Serious 
concern was also expressed about the allegations of torture and ill-treatment which may 
have led to, at least, one case of death while in custody.  Further, concern was expressed 
about the alleged conditions of detention as well as about the allegations of denial of 
medical treatment, legal counselling and family contacts. 
</p>
<p>60. On the allegations of torture and ill-treatment, the mandate holders stressed that each 
Government has the obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all 
persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the latter of which Iraq 
had pledged to ratify in the context of the Universal Periodic Review Process. The mandate 
holders drew the attention of Iraq&#8217;s Government to paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 8/8 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and 
in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all Governments to 
implement fully the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment.&#8221; In addition, they referred to paragraph 7(c) of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 8/8 of 18 June 2008, which reminds all States that &#8220;Prolonged incommunicado 
detention or detention in secret places may facilitate the perpetration of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute a form of 
such treatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, 
security and the dignity of the person.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>61. Regarding the allegation of intentional denial of medical treatment which may had 
led to at least one death while in custody, the mandate holders drew Government&#8217;s attention 
to the fundamental principles applicable under international law to these cases. More 
specifically, article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which 
Iraq is a party, provides that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; Further, article 6 of the Covenant states that no one 
shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her life. When the State detains an individual, it is 
held to a heightened level of diligence in protecting that individual&#8217;s rights. When an 
individual dies as a consequence of injuries sustained while in State custody, there is a 
presumption of State responsibility (see, for instance, the Human Rights Committee&#8217;s views 
in the case of Dermit Barbato v. Uruguay, communication no. 84/1981 (21/10/1982), 
paragraph 9.2). In order to overcome the presumption of State responsibility for a death 
resulting from injuries sustained in custody, there must be a &#8220;thorough, prompt and 
impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary 
executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest 
unnatural death in the above circumstances&#8221; (Principle 9 of the Principles on the Effective 
Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions). This 
principle was reiterated by the Human Rights Council in resolution 8/3, stating that all 
States have &#8220;to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&#8221;. The Council added that this includes the 
obligations &#8220;to identify and bring to justice those responsible, &#8230;, to grant adequate 
compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and to adopt all 
necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to bring and end to 
impunity and prevent the recurrence of such executions&#8221;. These obligations to investigate, 
identify those responsible and bring them to justice arise also under articles 7 and 12 of the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment.  
</p>
<p>62.  They further brought to the attention of the Government, the Standard Minimum 
Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, as approved by the Economic and Social Council by </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>resolutions 663 C (XXIV) of 31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 1977, and in 
particular Rules 22(2) and 25(1), as well as the Body of Principles for the Protection of All 
Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment adopted by General Assembly 
resolution 43/173 of 9 December 1988. The Committee against Torture and the Human 
Rights Committee have consistently found that conditions of detention can amount to 
inhuman and degrading treatment. The mandate holders also drew the Government&#8217;s 
attention to paragraph 6(b) of  Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8, which urges States 
&#8220;To take persistent, determined and effective measures to have all allegations of torture or 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment promptly and impartially 
examined by the competent national authority, to hold those who encourage, order, tolerate 
or perpetrate acts of torture responsible, to have them brought to justice and severely 
punished, including the officials in charge of the place of detention where the prohibited act 
is found to have been committed, and to take note in this respect of the Principles on the 
Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Principles) as a useful tool in efforts to 
combat torture&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>63. Regarding the alleged forced confessions by the detainees in relation to terrorist 
crimes, the mandate holders referred the Government to article 15 of the Convention 
against Torture, which provides that, &#8220;Each State Party shall ensure that any statement 
which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as 
evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the 
statement was made.&#8221; They also recalled that paragraph 6c of Human Rights Council 
resolution 8/8 of 2008 urges States &#8220;to ensure that no statement established to have been 
made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a 
person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made&#8221;. In addition to being a 
crucial fair trial guarantee, this principle is also an essential aspect of the non-derogable 
right to physical and mental integrity set forth, inter alia, in article 7 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>64. Concerning the persons whose fate and whereabouts were still unknown, the 
mandate holders wished to recall the United Nations Declaration on the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearances which sets out necessary protection by the State, 
including in articles 2 (no State shall practice, permit or tolerate enforced disappearances); 
3 (each State shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to 
prevent and terminate acts of enforced disappearance in any territory under its jurisdiction); 
6 (no order or instruction of any public authority, civilian, military or other, may be 
invoked to justify an enforced disappearance); 7 (no circumstances whatsoever, whether a 
threat of war, a state of  war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, 
may be invoked to justify enforced disappearances); 9 (right to a prompt and effective 
judicial remedy to determine the whereabouts of persons deprived of their liberty); 10 (right 
to access of competent national authorities to all places of  detention; to be held in an 
officially recognized place of detention, in conformity with national law and to be brought 
before a judicial authority  promptly after detention; to accurate information on the 
detention of persons and their place of detention being made available to their family, 
counsel or other persons with a legitimate interest); and 12 (right to the maintenance in 
every place of detention of official  up-to-date registers of all detained persons). 
</p>
<p>65. The mandate holders requested clarification from the Government of Iraq, inter alia, 
on details on the measures taken to find out and monitor the whereabouts of this group of 
men after their arrest and detention as well as their physical and mental condition. If the 
fate and whereabouts of a number of these men were still unknown, the Government was 
asked to provide details on any investigation or other inquiries which may have been 
carried out. The mandate holders further requested an indication from the Government 
whether the continued detention of the concerned individuals was subject to judicial </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>oversight by a competent judge, and information about the allegation that, at least, one 
person detained during this operation died while in custody. They requested details on the 
investigations and any prosecutions that may have been conducted, and whether penal, 
disciplinary or administrative sanctions had been imposed on the alleged perpetrators. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>66. As at 31 December 2010, there had been no response to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
correspondence. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>67. By letter dated 1 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent 
a letter of allegation on the situation of suspects detained in Iraq on terrorism-related 
charges and on the issue of secret detention. The mandate holders wished to bring to the 
attention of the Government information they had received, which originated from 
Government files of the United States of America, and had, subsequently, become publicly 
dubbed &#8220;the Wikileaks Iraq War logs&#8221;, relating to the alleged torture and ill-treatment of 
Iraqi citizens by Iraqi security forces. The mandate holders informed the Government of 
Iraq that a similar letter was addressed to the Government of the United States of America. 
</p>
<p>68. According to the information received, there was extensive abuse of detainees by 
Iraqi security forces over a five-year period between 2004 and 2009. The allegations of 
torture and ill-treatment were documented by forces of the United States of America. The 
information also suggested that such acts were conducted with impunity and appears to go 
normally unpunished. It was alleged that the vast majority of detainees are Sunni Arabs 
from central, western and north-western Iraq, held on suspicion of involvement in or 
supporting the Sunni armed groups that had fought against the Iraqi Government and US 
forces. The information received also pointed out that many hundreds of Shi&#8217;a Muslims 
suspected of supporting the al-Mahdi Army - followers of the radical religious figure 
Muqtada al-Sadr - who until recently before had engaged in armed activities against Iraqi 
and US forces, mainly in Baghdad and southern Iraq, formed a sizable part of the detainee 
population. Most of the detainees were held on suspicion of terrorism-related offences on 
the basis of the 2005 Iraqi Anti-Terrorism Law, but without trial or charges being brought 
against them, and in some cases detained incommunicado or in secret detention facilities, 
for several years. The Anti-Terrorism Law defines terrorism broadly as &#8220;any criminal act 
carried out by an individual or an organized group targeting an individual, a group of 
individuals, national or private institutions and causing damage to private or public 
properties with the aim of affecting the safety or security situation or national unity, or to 
terrorise and scare people or spread disturbance in order to achieve terrorist aims.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>69. Thousands of Iraqi nationals who had been detained by US forces were handed over 
from US to Iraqi custody between early 2009 and July 2010 under a November 2008 US-
Iraq agreement that contained no provisions for safeguarding the detainees&#8217; physical and 
mental integrity after the transfer. Article 4(3) of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), 
taking effect at midnight on 31 December 2008, only stated in broad terms that: &#8220;It is the 
duty of the United States Forces to respect the laws, customs, and traditions of Iraq and 
applicable international law.&#8221; It is alleged that tens of thousands of detainees were still 
being held by Iraqi authorities without trial, despite a 2008 Amnesty Law that provided for 
the release of all uncharged detainees after six months of detention if they had not been 
brought before an investigative judge, and after one year of detention if they had not been 
referred to a specialized court. </p>

<p>71. The mandate holders sought clarification of the circumstances regarding the torture 
and ill-treatment described in the document. They stressed that each Government has the 
obligation to protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. This right is 
set forth inter alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Concern was expressed about the 
allegation of torture and ill-treatment by Iraqi security forces. The mandate holders drew 
the Government&#8217;s attention to paragraph 1 of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8 which 
&#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever 
and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all Governments to implement fully the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; 
They recalled the obligations of the Government of Iraq under article 1 of the Convention 
against Torture which not only prohibits torture and requires States to refrain from acts of 
torture but also place an obligation to &#8216;prevent acts of torture&#8217;, as well as under article 6 of 
the Convention against Torture, which requires State Parties to establish their jurisdiction 
over acts of torture if they are committed in any territory under its jurisdiction; when the 
alleged offender is a national of that State and when the victim is a national of that State if 
that State considers it appropriate. It also requires State Parties to establish their jurisdiction 
over acts of torture in cases where the alleged offender is present in their territory. Article 7 
goes on to provide that State Parties must either extradite alleged offenders or submit the 
case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution. 
</p>
<p>72. With regards to impunity, investigations and prosecution alleged in this letter, the 
mandate holders drew the Government&#8217;s attention to article 12 of the Convention against 
Torture, which requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial 
investigation wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been 
committed, to its article 7, which requires State parties to prosecute suspected perpetrators 
of torture; and to paragraph 6b of Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8, which urges 
States &#8220;To take persistent, determined and effective measures to have all allegations of 
torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment promptly and 
impartially examined by the competent national authority, to hold those who encourage, 
order, tolerate or perpetrate acts of torture responsible, to have them brought to justice and 
severely punished, including the officials in charge of the place of detention where the 
prohibited act is found to have been committed, and to take note in this respect of the 
Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Principles) as a useful tool in 
efforts to combat torture&#8221;. Furthermore, the mandate holders pointed out that, insofar as 
international humanitarian law is applicable, under the Fourth Geneva Convention, Iraq is 
required to provide effective penal sanctions for grave breaches such as torture or inhuman 
treatment and to &#8220;take measures necessary for the suppression of all [other] acts contrary to 
the provisions of [GC IV]&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>73. Additionally, the Government&#8217;s attention was drawn to General Comment No. 2 of 
the United Nations Committee against Torture of 24 January 2008 (UN Doc.CAT/C/GC/2, 
para.18) which reiterates that &#8220;where State authorities or others acting in official capacity or 
under colour of law, know or have reasonable grounds to believe that acts of torture or ill-
treatment are being committed by non-State officials or private actors and they fail to 
exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish such non-State officials 
or private actors consistently with the Convention, the State bears responsibility and its 
officials should be considered as authors, complicit or otherwise responsible under the 
Convention for consenting to or acquiescing in such impermissible acts. Since the failure of 
the State to exercise due diligence to intervene to stop, sanction and provide remedies to 
victims of torture facilitates and enables non-State actors to commit acts impermissible 
under the Convention with impunity, the State&#8217;s indifference or inaction provides a form of 
encouragement and/or de facto permission.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>74. They further recalled article 2(2) of the Convention against Torture, which provides 
that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, 
internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a 
justification of torture. In this regard, they noted paragraph 2 of Resolution 8/8 of the 
Human Rights Council, which &#8220;Condemns in particular any action or attempt by States or 
public officials to legalize, authorize or acquiesce in torture under any circumstances, 
including on grounds of national security or through judicial decisions.&#8221; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>23 
</b></p>
<p>75. As regards the allegation that detainees were held incommunicado for several years, 
the mandate holders drew the attention of the Government to paragraph 12 of General 
Assembly Resolution A/RES/61/153 of 14 February 2007, which &#8220;reminds all States that 
prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places may facilitate the 
perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and 
can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect the 
safeguards concerning the liberty, security and dignity of the person.&#8221; As regards the 
allegations that some of the detainees were held in secret detention, they further referred to 
the Joint Study on Global Practices in relation to Secret Detention in the Context of 
Countering Terrorism of the Special Rapporteur, the then Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Working Group on 
Arbitrary Detention represented by its Vice-Chair, and the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances represented by its Chair (UN Doc. A/13/42, 19 February 
2010), in which the mandate holders concluded that &#8220;[s]ecret detention as such may 
constitute torture or ill-treatment for the direct victims as well as for their families&#8221; (para. 
289), and that &#8220;[t]he generalized fear of secret detention and its corollaries, such as torture 
and ill-treatment, tends to effectively result in limiting the exercise of a large number of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms&#8221; (para. 290). 
</p>
<p>76. Concerning the 2005 Anti-Terrorism Law, subject to which it is alleged that most of 
the detainees were held, the mandate holders stressed that the principle of legality in 
criminal law, enshrined in several international human rights instruments such as article 15 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and made non-derogable in 
times of public emergency, implies that the requirement of criminal liability is limited to 
clear and precise provisions in the law, so as to respect the principle of certainty of the law 
and ensure that it is not subject to interpretation which would broaden the scope of the 
proscribed conduct. In their view, at the national level, terrorist crimes should be defined by 
the presence of two cumulative conditions: (1) The means used, which can be described as 
deadly or otherwise serious violence against members of the general population or 
segments of it, or the taking of hostages; and (2) the intent, which is to cause fear among 
the population or the destruction of public order or to compel the government or an 
international organization to doing or refraining from doing something, in the advancement 
of a political, religious or ideological cause. It is only when these two conditions are 
fulfilled that an act may be criminalized as terrorist. 
</p>
<p>77.  The mandate holders urged the Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned persons, whose identities 
could not be established, and of several hundreds of others whose allegations of systematic 
torture and ill-treatment had been recorded by US personnel, are respected and that 
accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured and requested that it 
adopts effective measures to prevent the recurrence of these acts. They further requested 
clarification as to what measures the Government had taken to suppress the commission of 
torture and other ill-treatment by US, Coalition or Iraqi forces and information on action, 
including interventions, investigations or prosecution of acts of torture or ill-treatment 
alleged in the letter. They asked what measure the Government had taken to investigate or 
prosecute members of Iraqi forces and/or civilian authorities who were alleged to have 
committed or been complicit in the commission of torture, and whether and how the 
requirements of the principle of legality had been observed in relation to the definition of 
the crime of terrorism that reportedly formed the basis of the arrest and detention of most of 
the above-mentioned detainees. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Reply from the Government

<p>78. As at 31 December 2010, no reply by the Government of Iraq had been received to

</p>
<p><b> 5.  Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>79. On 17 December 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, sent a joint urgent appeal regarding a 
statement made by the Minister of Interior that about <b>39 detainees suspected of having 
links with al-Qa&#8217;ida linked groups were to be executed</b>.  
</p>
<p>80. According to information received: 
</p>
<p>On 2 December 2010, the Ministry of Interior convened a press conference 
where Government officials paraded about 39 detainees suspected of having had 
rejoined al-Qa&#8217;ida linked groups after their release from prison. Some of those 
detained were suspected of having links with Iraq&#8217;s al-Qa&#8217;ida branch known as 
&#8220;State of Iraq&#8221; (ISI), including Mr. Azim al-Zawi, reportedly the third-highest leader 
of the ISI, Mr. Ahmed Hussein &#8216;Ali, known as the &#8220;Mufti of Anbar&#8221; and Mr. Abdul 
Razzaq, the organization's alleged media chief.  
</p>
<p>It was alleged that at the press conference, the Minister of Interior was quoted 
to have had said &#8220;today, we will send these criminals and the investigation results to 
the courts that will sentence them to death. Our demand is not to delay the carrying 
out of the executions against these criminals [in order] to deter terrorist and criminal 
elements.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>81. The mandate holders brought to the attention of the Government of Iraq that 
although international law does not prohibit the death penalty, it nonetheless mandates that 
it must be regarded as an exception to the fundamental right to life, and must as such be 
applied in the most restrictive manner. It is essential that capital punishment, whenever it is 
resorted to, should fully respect all fair trial standards contained in international human 
rights law in the relevant proceedings with the sentence being pronounced only following a 
regular judicial process. They were concerned about the alleged statements made by the 
Minister of Interior which seemed to prejudge the outcome of the trial. The mandate 
holders also drew the attention of the Government to article 14(2) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Iraq had ratified on 25 February 1971. The 
provision states that &#8220;Everyone charged with a criminal offense shall have the right to be 
presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law&#8221;. This provision is fundamental in 
capital punishment cases as provided under article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights that &#8220;this penalty can only be carried out pursuant to a final judgment 
rendered by a competent court&#8221;. Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees 
distinguishes capital punishment as possibly permitted under international law from a 
summary execution, which by definition violates human rights standards. They therefore 
urged the Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that the rights under 
international law of the accused persons are fully respected. Were it true that the Minister 
of Interior had in advance of the trial pronounced himself of its outcome, including the 
sentence of death, the mandate holders took the view that only through full respect for the 
right to a fair trial and through excluding the use of capital punishment in the 39 cases in 
question could Iraq reach compliance with its international human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>82. Concerning the allegation that the 39 detainees were suspected of having links with 
al-Qa&#8217;ida associated groups, which had apparently formed the factual basis of the terrorism-
related charges that were reportedly brought against them, the mandate holders stressed that 
the principle of legality in criminal law, enshrined in several international human rights 
instruments such as article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and made non-derogable in times of public emergency, implies that the requirement of 
criminal liability is limited to clear and precise provisions in the law, so as to respect the 
principle of certainty of the law and ensure that it is not subject to interpretation which 
would broaden the scope of the proscribed conduct. In their view, at the national level, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>25 
</b></p>
<p>terrorist crimes should be defined by the presence of two cumulative conditions: (1) The 
means used, which can be described as deadly or otherwise serious violence against 
members of the general population or segments of it, or the taking of hostages; and (2) the 
intent, which is to cause fear among the population or the destruction of public order or to 
compel the government or an international organization to doing or refraining from doing 
something, usually in the advancement of a political, religious or ideological cause. It is 
only when these two conditions are fulfilled that an act may be criminalized as terrorist. 
</p>
<p>83. The mandate holders requested the Government, inter alia, to provide information on 
the exact charges that had been made against the 39 detainees, what measures were put in 
place to ensure that due process guarantees are respected in accordance with international 
fair trial standards, including the right to presumption of innocence, and whether and how 
the requirements of the principle of legality had been observed in relation to the definition 
of the terrorism-related offences with which the 39 detainees had reportedly been charged. 
</p>
<p><b> 6.  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>84. As at 31 December 2010, there had been no response to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
correspondence. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Kazakhstan 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1.  Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>85. On 2 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the then Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
pursuant, sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of Kazakhstan regarding Mr. 
<b>Ershidin Israel</b>, 38 years, ethnic Uyghur of Chinese nationality, held at the Pretrial 
Investigation Center No. 1 of Almaty, Seifulina Street. 
</p>
<p>86. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>Mr. Israel fled the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China to 
Kazakhstan in September 2009 after he had provided information to Radio Free 
Asia&#8217;s Uyghur Service about the alleged torture to death of a Uyghur detainee and 
the subsequent arrest of two individuals whom the Chinese authorities accused of 
providing information on the case to the same radio station.  
</p>
<p>After his arrival in Kazakhstan, Mr. Israel applied for refugee status from the 
office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Almaty, 
which he was granted in mid-March 2010. Mr. Israel also made an application to the 
Kazakh authorities for asylum, which was still pending. At the end of March 2010, 
UNHCR had secured a resettlement offer for Mr. Israel from Sweden. Mr. Israel was 
scheduled to depart to Sweden on 1 April 2010.   
</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Kazakh authorities denied Mr. Israel&#8217;s application for an 
exit visa, indicating that his name appeared on Interpol&#8217;s terrorism watch list. Prior 
to that, the Chinese authorities had made an extradition request based on terrorism 
allegations against Mr. Israel.  
</p>
<p>The authorities agreed that Mr. Israel live in a &#8216;safe place&#8217;/apartment 
designated by UNHCR and that Mr. Israel be accompanied by representatives of 
UNHCR to interviews that have been conducted by the authorities repeatedly over 
the previous months and were focused on his background and how he crossed the 
border into Kazakhstan. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>26</b> 
</p>
<p>On 23 June 2010, Mr. Israel was arrested by the authorities with a view to his 
possible extradition to China. A court hearing took place on 25 June and the court 
upheld and sustained the arrest in relation to the possible extradition. Mr. Israel 
appealed that court decision; the appeals proceedings were expected for 2 July 2010. 
Information received indicated that in case the appellate court upholds the lower&#8217;s 
court decision, the office of the Prosecutor-General was likely to request more 
information from the Chinese authorities in relation to the extradition request. 
</p>
<p>87. Concern was expressed about the possible forcible return of Mr. Israel to China 
where he was at risk to be arrested and tried on terrorism charges in relation to the 
aforementioned information provided by him to Radio Free Asia.  Further concern was 
expressed about Mr. Israel&#8217;s physical and mental integrity if returned to China. The 
mandate holders underlined that General Assembly resolution 59/191, in its paragraph 1, 
stresses that: &#8220;States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies with 
their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee 
and humanitarian law&#8221;, as do Security Council resolutions 1456 (2003) and 1624 (2005) in 
paragraphs 6 and 4 respectively. They stressed that each Government has the obligation to 
protect the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. This right is set forth inter 
alia in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ratified by Kazakhstan in 2005) and the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (accession by Kazakhstan in 
1998). They further drew the Government&#8217;s attention to article 3 of the Convention against 
Torture, which provides that no State party shall expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), or extradite a 
person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person 
would be in danger of being subjected to torture. Paragraph 9 of General Comment 20 of 
the Human Rights Committee on the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, states that State parties &#8220;must not expose individuals to 
the danger of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment upon return to 
another country by way of extradition, expulsion or refoulement&#8221;. Furthermore, paragraph 
9 of General Assembly resolution 61/253 urges States &#8220;not to expel, return (&#8220;refouler&#8221;), 
extradite or in any other way transfer a person to another State where there are substantial 
grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture&#8221;. The 
Special Rapporteur noted in paragraph 70 of his report A/62/263 to the General Assembly 
&#8220;that the listing of terrorists may also have bearing upon international protection.&#8221; Being 
conscious of the fact that the listing may be carried out on the basis of national practices or 
based on decisions by international bodies, the Special Rapporteur also underlined that 
&#8220;persons included in terrorist lists remain within the ambit of human rights law, the 
principle of non-refoulement being applicable and in need of particular attention.&#8221; The 
Special Rapporteur dealt with further limitations, criteria and safeguards necessary in such 
listing procedures in a previous report to the General Assembly (A/61/267, paras. 30-41). 
</p>
<p>88. In relation to Mr. Israel&#8217;s arrest by the authorities of Kazakhstan, the mandate 
holders appealed to the Government to take all necessary measures to guarantee his right 
not to be deprived arbitrarily of his liberty and to fair proceedings before an independent 
and impartial tribunal, in accordance with articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. In connection to the right to fair proceedings before an independent and impartial 
tribunal, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment, in his report on his visit to Kazakhstan in 2009, stated that &#8220;Whereas 
Kazakhstan is a party to the Convention relating to the status of refugees of 1951 and works 
closely with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the 
domestic legislation does not contain provisions implementing the principle of non-
refoulement stipulated by article 3 of the Convention against Torture. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur also expressed concern that &#8220;although under the law any decision of a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>27 
</b></p>
<p>State body can be challenged in the court, in reality, clear procedures regarding full access 
to justice in extradition and deportation proceedings are lacking&#8221; (A/HRC/10/39/Add.3, 
para. 44). 
</p>
<p>89. Regarding the information provided by Mr. Israel to Radio Free Asia, the mandate 
holders appealed to the Government to take all necessary steps to secure the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with fundamental principles as set forth in 
article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides that 
&#8220;Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to 
seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either 
orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>90. The mandate holders sought clarification from the Government, inter alia, on what 
procedures were in place to guarantee fair and independent proceedings in relation to Mr. 
Israel&#8217;s arrest and possible extradition to China, what substance there was to the use of the 
notion of &#8220;terrorism&#8221; in the consideration of extraditing Mr. Israel to China, rather than 
allowing his resettlement to Sweden, and on how the actions undertaken by public officials 
regarding this case were compatible with the international norms and standards of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>91. As at 31 December 2010, there had been no response by the Government of 
Kazakhstan to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s correspondence.

traitement subi par Mme <b>Doha Aboutabit </b>dans le cadre de sa garde &#224; vue dans les 
installations de la police judiciaire de Casablanca suite &#224; son arrestation le 3 d&#233;cembre 
2009.  Mme Aboutabit aurait &#233;t&#233;, depuis juillet 2009, Chef de service &#224; l&#8217;h&#244;pital A&#239;t-Qamra 
dans la r&#233;gion d&#8217;Al-Hoceima. 
</p>
<p>93. Selon les informations re&#231;ues : 
</p>
<p>Le 3 d&#233;cembre 2009, Mme Aboutabit aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233;e au domicile de ses 
parents &#224; Rabat et aurait &#233;t&#233; emmen&#233;e au poste de police d&#8217;Al-Maarif &#224; Casablanca. 
Mme Aboutabit serait rest&#233;e d&#233;tenue douze jours dans les locaux des services de 
s&#233;curit&#233;, soit la dur&#233;e l&#233;gale maximum de garde &#224; vue pr&#233;vue dans le cadre d&#8217;une 
enqu&#234;te pr&#233;liminaire en cas d&#8217;infraction terroriste. Le juge d&#8217;instruction de la Cour 
d&#8217;appel de Rabat l&#8217;aurait plac&#233;e sous mandat de d&#233;p&#244;t &#224; la prison de Sal&#233; o&#249; elle 
serait toujours d&#233;tenue.  
</p>
<p>Mme Aboutabit serait accus&#233;e d&#8217;avoir &#171; financ&#233; le terrorisme &#187; pour avoir, il 
y a quelques ann&#233;es, pr&#234;t&#233; une somme d&#8217;argent &#224; son fr&#232;re. Celui-ci se serait par la 
suite rendu en Irak o&#249;, selon les autorit&#233;s, il aurait trouv&#233; la mort en 2008. 
</p>
<p>Selon les informations re&#231;ues, durant sa garde &#224; vue, Mme Aboutabit aurait 
subi de graves tortures psychologiques commises par des policiers. En l&#8217;occurrence, 
ceux-ci l&#8217;auraient menac&#233; de br&#251;ler son visage avec un briquet, ainsi que de ne plus 
revoir son enfant si elle ne reconnaissait pas les actes dont on l&#8217;accusait. Suite &#224; ces 
menaces, elle aurait confirm&#233; les aveux sugg&#233;r&#233;s par la police.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1

</p>
<p>Tout au long de sa garde &#224; vue, Mme Aboutabit n&#8217;aurait pas eu la possibilit&#233; 
de communiquer avec un avocat, pas m&#234;me quarante-huit heures apr&#232;s la premi&#232;re

(art. 66) et par la loi en mati&#232;re d&#8217;infraction terroriste au Maroc. 
</p>
<p>94. Les mandataires ont exprim&#233; leurs craintes s&#233;rieuses pour l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; physique et 
mentale de Mme Aboutabit. Ils ont attir&#233; l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement du Maroc sur les 
dispositions suivantes. Selon l&#8217;article 9(1) du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et 
politiques, &#171; [t]out individu a droit &#224; la libert&#233; et &#224; la s&#233;curit&#233; de sa personne. Nul ne peut 
faire l&#8217;objet d&#8217;une arrestation ou d&#8217;une d&#233;tention arbitraire. &#187; L&#8217;article 9(3) du Pacte 
international dispose que &#171; [t]out individu arr&#234;t&#233; ou d&#233;tenu du chef d&#8217;une infraction p&#233;nale 
sera traduit dans le plus court d&#233;lai devant un juge ou une autre autorit&#233; habilit&#233;e par la loi &#224; 
exercer des fonctions judiciaires, et devra &#234;tre jug&#233; dans un d&#233;lai raisonnable ou lib&#233;r&#233;. 
Enfin, le droit de quiconque, se trouvant priv&#233; de sa libert&#233; par arrestation ou d&#233;tention, 
d&#8217;introduire un recours devant un tribunal est pr&#233;vu &#224; l&#8217;article 9(4) du m&#234;me Pacte. Dans 
son Observation g&#233;n&#233;rale No. 29 de 2001, le Comit&#233; des droits de l&#8217;homme a confirm&#233; que 
ce droit est prot&#233;g&#233; en toutes circonstances, en raison notamment du r&#244;le crucial jou&#233; par 
les garanties de proc&#233;dure visant &#224; garantir la conformit&#233; avec le droit, non-susceptible de 
d&#233;rogation, de ne pas &#234;tre soumis &#224; la torture, ni &#224; des peines ou traitements cruels, 
inhumains ou d&#233;gradants, pr&#233;vu &#224; l&#8217;article 7 du Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et 
politiques. Enfin, le Comit&#233; des droits de l&#8217;homme, dans ses observations finales 
concernant le Maroc, a consid&#233;r&#233; comme excessive la p&#233;riode de garde &#224; vue &#8211; 48 heures 
(renouvelables une fois) pour les crimes ordinaires et 96 heures (renouvelables deux fois) 
pour les crimes li&#233;s au terrorisme &#8211;, p&#233;riode pendant laquelle un suspect peut &#234;tre d&#233;tenu 
sans &#234;tre pr&#233;sent&#233; devant un juge (para. 15, CCPR/CO/82/MAR). 
</p>
<p>95. Les mandataires ont aussi attir&#233; l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement sur le paragraphe 7b de 
la R&#233;solution 8/8 du Conseil des droits de l&#8217;homme de juin 2008 laquelle rappelle aux &#201;tats 
que &#171; [l]es mesures d&#8217;intimidation ou les pressions vis&#233;es &#224; l&#8217;article premier de la 
Convention contre la torture, notamment les menaces graves et cr&#233;dibles contre l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; 
physique de la victime ou d&#8217;une tierce personne, ainsi que les menaces de mort, peuvent 
&#234;tre assimil&#233;es &#224; un traitement cruel, inhumain ou d&#233;gradant ou &#224; la torture. &#187; 
</p>
<p>96. Par ailleurs, ils ont &#233;galement rappel&#233; au Gouvernement les dispositions de la 
R&#233;solution 61/153 dans laquelle l&#8217;Assembl&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale &#171; rappelle &#224; tous les &#201;tats qu&#8217;une 
p&#233;riode prolong&#233;e de mise au secret ou de d&#233;tention dans des lieux secrets peut faciliter la 
pratique de la torture et d&#8217;autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants et 
peut en soi constituer un tel traitement, et demande instamment &#224; tous les &#201;tats de respecter 
les garanties concernant la libert&#233;, la s&#233;curit&#233; et la dignit&#233; de la personne. &#187; 
</p>
<p>97. De plus, ils ont attir&#233; l&#8217;attention du Gouvernement sur le fait qu&#8217;en vertu de l&#8217;article 
12 de la Convention contre la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou 
d&#233;gradants les autorit&#233;s comp&#233;tentes doivent assurer qu&#8217;une enqu&#234;te impartiale aura lieu 
chaque fois qu&#8217;il y a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu&#8217;un acte de torture a &#233;t&#233; commis. 
Ils ont rappel&#233; au Gouvernement que l&#8217;article 7 de la Convention demande aux &#201;tats 
d&#8217;assurer que ceux qui sont suspects de commettre des actes de torture soient traduits en 
justice.   
</p>
<p>98. Ils ont &#233;galement rappel&#233; au Gouvernement l&#8217;article 13 de la Convention contre la 
torture, qui exige que &#171; [t]out &#201;tat partie assure &#224; toute personne qui pr&#233;tend avoir &#233;t&#233; 
soumise &#224; la torture sur tout territoire sous sa juridiction le droit de porter plainte devant les 
autorit&#233;s comp&#233;tentes dudit &#201;tat qui proc&#233;deront imm&#233;diatement et impartialement &#224; 
l&#8217;examen de sa cause. [&#8230;]&#187;  Dans ce contexte, ils ont aussi rappel&#233; les paragraphes 6 b et e 
de la R&#233;solution 8/8 du Conseil des droits de l&#8217;homme de juin 2008, qui exhorte les &#201;tats  &#171; 
b) &#192; prendre des mesures durables, d&#233;cisives et efficaces pour que toutes les all&#233;gations de

</p>
<p><b> G.  Pakistan 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1.  Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>106. On 5 February 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter of allegation to the 
Government of Pakistan concerning Messrs. <b>Umar Farooq, Waqar Khan, Ahmed Minni, 
Aman Hassan Yemer </b>and <b>Ramy Zamzam, </b>aged between 19 and 24, United States 
citizens, who were detained on suspicion of terrorism in the city of Sarghoda. The 
Government was informed that a letter on this case was also being sent to the Government 
of the United States of America.  
</p>
<p>107. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>The five men were arrested on 7 December 2009 in Sarghoda, Punjab 
Province and charged with plotting terror attacks in Pakistan as well as with having 
links to Al-Qaida and seeking to join militants fighting United States troops across 
the border in Afghanistan. The most serious of the charges was conspiracy to carry 
out a terrorist act, which could carry life imprisonment depending on what the act is. 
The five men have, allegedly, confessed their intention to carry out &#8220;jihad&#8221; and to 
fight against the war on terror. Following their appearance before a special 
antiterrorism court during a closed session on 18 January 2010, the men reportedly 
shouted out allegations of having been subjected to torture before being transported 
back to the prison. According to the information received, a court order from the 
same court session confirmed that the men in question &#8220;made a complaint that they 
have been tortured in the custody of police&#8221; and that, consequently, the judge 
ordered medical examinations for the men. Allegedly, none of them was allowed to 
be represented by their lawyer of own choice.  
</p>
<p>108. While being conscious of the fact that States&#8217; obligation to protect and promote 
human rights requires them to take effective measures to combat terrorism, the Special 
Rapporteur underlined that General Assembly resolution 59/191, in its paragraph 1, stresses 
that: &#8220;States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies with their 
obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and 
humanitarian law&#8221;, as do Security Council resolutions 1456 (2003) and 1624 (2005) in 
paragraphs 6 and 4 respectively. 
</p>
<p>109. The Special Rapporteur wished to recall in particular the non-derogable nature of the 
prohibition against torture or any other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment, as established in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
which Pakistan signed on 17 April 2008. The Human Rights Committee in its General </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>31 
</b></p>
<p>Comment on states of emergency (article 4 of the Covenant) has stated that there is a close 
connection between the prohibition of torture in article 7 and the right of all persons 
deprived of their liberty to human treatment and respect for the inherent dignity of the 
human person as established in article 10 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. In relation to this, the Human Rights Committee has interpreted article 10 
(1) as a norm of international law that is not subject to derogation 
(CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.11, paragraph 13(a). 
</p>
<p>110. Furthermore, with regard to the right to a fair trial, article 14 (3) of the Covenant 
establishes a number of minimum guarantees, which shall be granted to every person 
charged of a crime, and in its section (g) stipulates that no one shall be compelled to testify 
against himself or to confess guilt. Hence, any direct or indirect physical or undue 
psychological pressure on the accused for these purposes constitutes a violation of this 
right, and consequently the Human Rights Committee states that &#8220;it is unacceptable to treat 
an accused person in a manner contrary to article 7 of the Covenant in order to extract a 
confession&#8221; (CCPR/C/GC/32, paragraph 41). In addition to recalling the general obligation 
of all States to offer an effective remedy through prompt and impartial investigations by a 
competent authority when torture complaints have been filed, the Special Rapporteur took 
the opportunity to stress, with the words of the Human Rights Committee in its General 
Comment No. 32, paragraph 33, on article 14 of the Covenant,  that &#8220;in cases of a claim 
that evidence was obtained in violation of article 7 of the Covenant, information about the 
circumstances in which such evidence was obtained must be made available to allow an 
assessment of such claim&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>111. The Special Rapporteur sought clarification from the Government on the legal basis 
for the detention of the five detainees; the specific acts that they were accused of; what 
evidence had been presented against the suspects in the case; what measures had been taken 
in order to secure that the men had regular access to and were allowed to communicate in 
private with a lawyer of their own choice; what measures had been taken by the executive 
branch to investigate the torture complaints made in the case; and what impact such 
measures had according to the law upon the judicial proceedings against the five detainees. 
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>112. As at 31 December 2010, there had been no response by the Government of Pakistan 
to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter of allegation. 
</p>
<p><b> 3.  Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>113. On 9 March 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of the 
Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and the then Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent a joint urgent appeal 
concerning Mr. <b>Charuh Buranov</b>, aged 21, citizen of Uzbekistan.  
</p>
<p>114. According to the information received,  
</p>
<p>Mr. Buranov was held at the secret service headquarters in Islamabad in 
connection with terrorism-related suspicions and under imminent threat of being 
repatriated to Uzbekistan. It was unclear whether he had access to any judicial 
review regarding the refoulement.  
</p>
<p>One of his brothers was imprisoned in Uzbekistan in connection with 
terrorism charges, but allegedly rather for his religious convictions.  
</p>
<p>115.  The mandate holders drew the Government&#8217;s attention to the right to physical and 
mental integrity of Mr. Charuh Buranov. This right is set forth in the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights; it is also proclaimed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment, to both of which Pakistan is a signatory. The right to physical 
and mental integrity encompasses the principle of non-refoulement, reflected in article 3 of 
the Convention against Torture, which provides that no State party shall expel, return 
(&#8220;refouler&#8221;), or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for 
believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture. Furthermore, 
paragraph 6d of Human Rights Council resolution 8/8 urges States not to expel, return 
(refouler), extradite or in any other way transfer a person to another State where there are 
substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to 
torture and; the Council recognizes in this respect that diplomatic assurances, where used, 
do not release States from their obligations under international human rights, humanitarian 
and refugee law, in particular the principle of non-refoulement. 
</p>
<p>116.  The mandate holders reminded the Government of the report on the visit to 
Uzbekistan of the then Special Rapporteur on Torture (E/CN.4/2003/68/Add.2), which 
stated that &#8220;torture or similar ill-treatment is systematic as defined by the Committee 
against Torture [and that] torture and other forms of ill-treatment appear to be used 
indiscriminately against persons charged for activities qualified as serious crimes such as 
acts against State interests, as well as petty criminals and others&#8221;, and of the then Special 
Rapporteur on Torture&#8217;s annual follow-up reports A/HRC/4/33/Add.2, paras. 668-670, and 
A/HRC/7/3/Add.2, paras 751-752, where reference is made to previous statements about 
the situation in Uzbekistan.  
</p>
<p>117.  The mandate holders appealed to the Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee Mr. Charuh Buranov&#8217;s right not to be deprived arbitrarily of his liberty and to fair 
proceedings before an independent and impartial tribunal, in accordance with articles 9 and 
10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They drew the attention of the 
Government to a report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (A/HRC/4/40, para. 
47), in which it argued that &#8220;[t]he principle of non-refoulement remains [&#8230;] relevant also 
with regard to arbitrary detention. Where there are substantial grounds for believing that 
there is a real risk that the person to be removed from the territory will be deprived of his or 
her liberty in the receiving State (as is often the case when the ground for removal is a 
suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities), the sending State should examine whether 
such detention would be arbitrary within the meaning of the three categories of arbitrary 
detention identified in the Working Group&#8217;s methods of work&#8230;&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>118. The mandate holders asked the Government for clarification, inter alia, about 
whether Mr. Buranov was in detention in Pakistan at the time, and if he was, to indicate the 
legal basis for his arrest and detention and how these measures were compatible with 
applicable international human rights norms and standards as stipulated, inter alia, in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They also asked for information on whether he 
had had access to judicial remedies regarding his detention and his possible return to 
Uzbekistan, and to legal counsel. Since Mr. Buranov&#8217;s detention was allegedly based on 
terrorism-related suspicions, the Government was further asked to clarify what was the link 
with terrorism and what law was applicable to this case, including by providing the specific 
legal provisions.

<p><b> H. Peru 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Comunicado de prensa del Relator Especial 
</b>120. El 8 de septiembre de 2010, tras su visita oficial al Per&#250; del 1 al 8 de septiembre de 
2010, el Relator Especial public&#243; un comunicado de prensa en el cual se informaba que el 
objetivo de su misi&#243;n era estudiar el marco legislativo e institucional peruano, as&#237; como las 
pol&#237;ticas en la lucha contra el terrorismo, y su cumplimiento conforme al derecho 
internacional de los derechos humanos. El Relator Especial quisiera agradecer al Gobierno 
peruano y a todos sus dem&#225;s interlocutores por la positiva cooperaci&#243;n que permiti&#243; la 
realizaci&#243;n de una misi&#243;n exitosa. 
</p>
<p>121. Durante su misi&#243;n el Relator Especial visit&#243; Lima, Ayacucho y Cusco. Se reuni&#243; 
con el Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores y el Ministro de Defensa, as&#237; como con 
funcionarios de los Ministerios de Relaciones Exteriores, Justicia y del Interior. Tambi&#233;n se 
reuni&#243; con funcionarios de la Fiscal&#237;a, las Fuerzas Armadas, la Polic&#237;a y los servicios de 
inteligencia. Adem&#225;s se reuni&#243; con parlamentarios, jueces de la Corte Suprema y otros 
miembros del Poder Judicial, la Defensora del Pueblo y sus representantes regionales, el 
Presidente de la Comisi&#243;n de la Verdad y Reconciliaci&#243;n, y con autoridades regionales y 
locales en Ayacucho y en Cusco. Tambi&#233;n se reuni&#243; con representantes de la sociedad civil, 
incluyendo organizaciones no gubernamentales, acad&#233;micos, abogados, representantes de 
comunidades locales e ind&#237;genas y de desplazados, v&#237;ctimas del terrorismo, y v&#237;ctimas de 
violaciones de derechos humanos cometidas por el Estado, y con miembros de las 
comisiones de reparaciones. 
</p>
<p>122. El Relator Especial, durante sus reuniones como tambi&#233;n mediante otros m&#233;todos de 
investigaci&#243;n, recaud&#243; informaci&#243;n sobre las cuestiones pr&#225;cticas y las consecuencias de las 
medidas contra el terrorismo del Per&#250;. Los abogados de los acusados de delitos de 
terrorismo, como tambi&#233;n miembros de las fuerzas de seguridad, de las cuales algunos de 
sus miembros supuestamente cometieron violaciones de derechos humanos en el contexto 
de la lucha contra el terrorismo, aportaron perspectivas y experiencias valiosas. En el Penal 
Miguel Castro Castro en Lima y en el Penal de Yanamilla en Ayacucho pudo entrevistarse 
en privado con procesados y sentenciados por delitos de terrorismo. El Relator Especial 
asimismo visit&#243; una comunidad reasentada de desplazados internos y se reuni&#243; con l&#237;deres 
de comunidades retornadas. 
</p>
<p>123. El Relator Especial fue informado de la violencia y del conflicto armado interno que 
afect&#243; al Per&#250; desde 1980 a 2000, y del tr&#225;gico sufrimiento de la poblaci&#243;n, en particular de 
las comunidades ind&#237;genas y campesinas como consecuencia del terrorismo, igual que de 
las actividades contra el terrorismo realizadas por el Estado. Alaba la labor exhaustiva de la 
Comisi&#243;n de la Verdad y la Reconciliaci&#243;n Nacional establecida en 2001, que culmin&#243; en 
un importante informe final en agosto de 2003. Varios representantes de distintos niveles 
del Gobierno le informaron acerca de los esfuerzos y los desaf&#237;os al implementar las 
recomendaciones de la Comisi&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>124. En sus anteriores trabajos tem&#225;ticos y por pa&#237;ses acerca del derecho a un juicio justo 
en la lucha contra el terrorismo, el Relator Especial ha recalcado la importancia del 
principio de la normalidad, es decir su firme preferencia por abordar el terrorismo como 
delito grave, sujeto a un proceso ordinario ante tribunales ordinarios. El Per&#250; aporta 
lecciones importantes en ese sentido tras haber prescindido de los &#8220;tribunales sin rostro&#8221;. 
Sin embargo, el Relator Especial sigue preocupado porque el Per&#250; es uno de los pocos 
pa&#237;ses que reiteradamente ha recurrido a la declaraci&#243;n del estado de emergencia, y a 
derogar algunas de sus obligaciones de derechos humanos debido al terrorismo. 
</p>
<p>125. Como dimensi&#243;n de las pol&#237;ticas de lucha contra el terrorismo de decenios 
anteriores, cabe destacar el enjuiciamiento de una gran cantidad de personas por terrorismo, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>aunque los juicios no cumplieron con las normas internacionales de derechos humanos por 
el uso, entre otras cosas, de los llamados &#8220;tribunales sin rostro&#8221;. A ra&#237;z de un fallo de la 
Corte Constitucional de 2003 que declar&#243; la inconstitucionalidad de varios elementos del 
marco jur&#237;dico que se aplicaba anteriormente, se llevaron a cabo nuevos juicios, que dio pie 
a la absoluci&#243;n de la mayor parte de los acusados que hab&#237;an sido condenados 
equivocadamente por delitos de terrorismo. El proceso de rejudicializaci&#243;n y de 
absoluciones se ha convertido en un elemento importante del proceso de reconciliaci&#243;n, y 
de la restauraci&#243;n del estado de derecho en el pa&#237;s. Igual de importante ha sido el hecho de 
que el Sr. Alberto Fujimori Fujimori, antiguo Presidente del Per&#250;, y varios de sus 
colaborados gubernamentales y militares m&#225;s cercanos, hayan sido llevados ante la justicia, 
en un muy aclamado juicio, por las graves violaciones de derechos humanos cometidas 
durante los a&#241;os en que la Constituci&#243;n y sus garant&#237;as fueron suspendidas o pasadas por 
alto. 
</p>
<p>126. Sin embargo, aunque reconoce la complejidad de estos casos y de una gran cantidad 
de otros casos en curso, el Relator Especial se preocupa porque el juicio y el castigo de 
funcionarios del estado por violaciones de derechos humanos, incluyendo matanzas de la 
poblaci&#243;n civil, avanzan muy lentamente y pueden toparse con obst&#225;culos legales, tanto 
antiguos como nuevos. La percepci&#243;n de un clima de impunidad, que ya existe, se ha 
reforzado recientemente mediante el nuevo Decreto legislativo no. 1097, que parecer&#237;a 
someter a prescripci&#243;n los procesos penales contra perpetradores de delitos de lesa 
humanidad cometidos en el Per&#250; antes del 9 de noviembre de 2003, aunque tanto la Corte 
Interamericana de Derechos Humanos como el Tribunal Constitucional del Per&#250; han 
exigido que se lleven a juicio dichos delitos independientemente de un plazo l&#237;mite. El 
Decreto legislativo no. 1097 tiene otra disposici&#243;n que parecer&#237;a imponer un plazo estricto 
irrazonable para el manejo de casos de delitos de lesa humanidad, lo que a juicio del 
Relator Especial probablemente dar&#225; pie a violaciones del derecho internacional. Muchos 
de los interlocutores del Relator Especial opinan que el Decreto legislativo no. 1097 es 
inconstitucional y no debe ser aplicado por los tribunales peruanos. 
</p>
<p>127. El Decreto legislativo no. 1095 de reciente adopci&#243;n relativo al uso de la fuerza por 
las fuerzas armadas en territorio nacional parecer&#237;a basarse en una premisa equivocada de 
que una decisi&#243;n interna para autorizar a las fuerzas militares a ejercer los poderes del 
Estado en una zona dentro del territorio peruano generar&#237;a la aplicaci&#243;n del derecho 
humanitario, con posibles consecuencias adversas para los derechos humanos. La 
definici&#243;n de &#8220;grupos hostiles&#8221;, que seg&#250;n la ley se supone act&#250;an como parte a un 
conflicto armado es tan lata que podr&#237;a abarcar a movimientos de protesta social que no 
llevan armas de fuego consigo. El Relator Especial recalca que el derecho humanitario 
internacional solamente es aplicable cuando los hechos objetivos en el terreno demuestran 
la existencia de un conflicto armado en curso entre partes identificables, las cuales son 
capaces de llevar a cabo hostilidades armadas y se organizan para ello. 
</p>
<p>128. El Relator Especial celebra que el gobierno peruano haya adoptado la Ley N&#250;mero 
28592 en el a&#241;o 2005 sobre el Plan Integral de Reparaciones, que contempla reparaciones 
individuales y colectivas para las v&#237;ctimas del conflicto armado interno. El Relator Especial 
se&#241;ala como elemento de mejores pr&#225;cticas el hecho de que los planes de reparaci&#243;n no 
hacen diferenciaci&#243;n alguna entre las v&#237;ctimas de la violencia terrorista y las victimas de 
abusos de las autoridades militares y policiales del Estado, sino que tratan de brindar 
justicia a todas las v&#237;ctimas de la violencia en pie de igualdad. 
</p>
<p>129. Los cr&#237;menes terroristas cometidos durante el periodo de 1980 a 2000 afectaron en 
gran medida a la poblaci&#243;n en las zonas rec&#243;nditas del pa&#237;s, que se caracterizan por la 
ausencia y la falta de protecci&#243;n de las autoridades estatales, y por ello afectaron 
mayormente a las comunidades ind&#237;genas y rurales excluidas, indigentes y discriminadas. 
El Relator Especial considera de capital importancia que la aplicaci&#243;n de los programas </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>35 
</b></p>
<p>colectivos de reparaci&#243;n se lleven a cabo mediante la participaci&#243;n efectiva de los 
beneficiarios de los mismos. Esto concierne en particular a los pueblos ind&#237;genas y a 
mujeres que a menudo se hallaron en el fuego cruzado del conflicto violento. Aunque 
reconoce la importancia de la labor de la Comisi&#243;n Multisectorial de Alto Nivel (CMAN) 
para integrar a los gobiernos regionales y locales en el proceso de implementaci&#243;n, 
manifiesta su preocupaci&#243;n porque hasta la fecha se ha dado muy poca consideraci&#243;n a la 
participaci&#243;n de la mujer. Esto qued&#243; muy claro en sus conversaciones con varios 
interlocutores que frecuentemente no pudieron identificar elementos espec&#237;ficos de g&#233;nero 
en la implementaci&#243;n de los programas de reparaci&#243;n. Adem&#225;s, el Relator Especial se 
preocupa porque la obligaci&#243;n de consultar con los pueblos ind&#237;genas, tal como lo requiere 
el Convenio n&#250;mero 169 de la OIT, ratificado por el Per&#250;, no se tiene debidamente en 
cuenta en la implementaci&#243;n de los programas colectivos de reparaciones. La potenciaci&#243;n 
debe ser un elemento central dentro del proceso de reconciliaci&#243;n. Adem&#225;s el Relator 
Especial quiere recalcar que la participaci&#243;n efectiva ayuda a evitar a que haya m&#225;s 
episodios de injusticia social, y a que se corra el riesgo de fomentar caldos de cultivo para 
nuevas oleadas de terrorismo. A su juicio, la piedra angular para la construcci&#243;n de una 
sociedad sin terrorismo es la participaci&#243;n de las mujeres, los pueblos ind&#237;genas y las 
comunidades rurales en el dise&#241;o y la implementaci&#243;n de programas de reparaciones. 
</p>
<p>130. Durante su misi&#243;n, el Relator Especial busc&#243; informaci&#243;n sobre las formas y las 
amenazas actuales del terrorismo en el Per&#250;. Se le inform&#243; que los remanentes de la 
organizaci&#243;n Sendero Luminoso, principal perpetrador de las atrocidades contra la 
poblaci&#243;n civil y otros delitos terroristas durante el periodo entre 1980 a 2000 actualmente 
operan principalmente en la regi&#243;n del VRAE, en una alianza con grupos de crimen 
organizados que se dedican al narcotr&#225;fico. No queda claro hasta qu&#233; punto &#233;sto constituye 
una real amenaza de una nueva oleada de terrorismo, en comparaci&#243;n con otros tipos de 
crimen organizado. El Relator Especial fue informado de casos de rebrote de actividades 
ideol&#243;gicas y de propaganda, incluyendo en algunos centros docentes, que recuerdan los 
lemas de Sendero Luminoso, pero que no parecen estar vinculados con esa organizaci&#243;n o 
con actos reales de terrorismo. 
</p>
<p>131. El Relator Especial, aunque reconoce el derecho y el deber del Estado de luchar 
contra el terrorismo, y consciente del espantoso sufrimiento de grandes partes de la 
poblaci&#243;n durante los decenios de violencia y conflicto armado interno, recalca que el 
terrorismo solamente se puede combatir cumpliendo con las normas internacionales de 
derechos humanos. El principio de la legalidad no permite definiciones excesivamente 
amplias y latas de los cr&#237;menes relacionados con el terrorismo. El derecho a un examen 
judicial eficaz en relaci&#243;n a cualquier tipo de detenci&#243;n tiene que ser efectivo igualmente en 
casos basados en acusaciones de terrorismo. La independencia del poder judicial es 
indispensable en una lucha contra el terrorismo que sea efectiva y respetuosa de la ley. El 
Relator Especial se preocupa por informaci&#243;n que se le suministr&#243; en Ayacucho acerca de 
un juez que modific&#243; un mandato de detenci&#243;n, emitido en un proceso relacionado con el 
terrorismo, en una orden de comparecencia, y cuya destituci&#243;n del poder judicial por el 
&#243;rgano competente de control se estar&#237;a solicitando exclusivamente por esta raz&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>132. El Relator Especial se preocupa por la formulaci&#243;n amplia de la definici&#243;n b&#225;sica 
del delito de terrorismo en el Art&#237;culo 2 del Decreto-ley no 25475 que no ha sido 
enmendado oficialmente, aunque el Tribunal Constitucional haya emitido en su fallo de 
2003 unas directrices sobre la interpretaci&#243;n de esta disposici&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>133. Reitera su posici&#243;n de que el terrorismo debe definirse en funci&#243;n de los medios 
injustificables a los que recurre, a saber violencia letal o, sino violencia f&#237;sica grave, contra 
miembros de la poblaci&#243;n civil o segmentos de la misma, o la toma de rehenes. 
Conjuntamente con la intenci&#243;n de sembrar el miedo en la poblaci&#243;n, o de obligar a un 
gobierno a hacer algo, este umbral de violencia es suficiente para distinguir el terrorismo de </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>36</b> 
</p>
<p>cualquier otro tipo de delito, o de la protesta social por ello. El Relator Especial opina que 
la definici&#243;n peruana es excesivamente lata ya que no se basa en semejante umbral de 
violencia. 
</p>
<p>134. Igualmente, el Relator Especial sigue preocupado porque el art&#237;culo 4 del mismo 
Decreto-ley parecer&#237;a tipificar como colaboraci&#243;n con el terrorismo aquellas acciones cuyos 
&#8220;objetivos&#8221; coincidan con los que persiguen los terroristas, en vez de exigir v&#237;nculos 
f&#225;cticos con actos espec&#237;ficos de terrorismo o con personas que perpetran esos actos. 
</p>
<p>135. El Relator Especial durante su misi&#243;n, debido a la naturaleza lata de estas 
disposiciones, busc&#243; informaci&#243;n acerca de episodios en que se hubiera recurrido a 
detenciones o enjuiciamientos por delitos de terrorismo en relaci&#243;n a casos que constituyan 
protesta social y no terrorismo. Se convenci&#243; de que semejante tendencia de hecho existe 
tambi&#233;n en el Per&#250;, aunque huelga decir que la vigilancia de un poder judicial 
independiente puede contrarrestarla debidamente. En Cusco se le inform&#243; de un incidente 
en el que la polic&#237;a hab&#237;a identificado equivocadamente una manifestaci&#243;n de la comunidad 
local como partidaria de Sendero Luminoso. En Ayacucho le llam&#243; la atenci&#243;n conocer en 
el Penal de Yanamilla a dos l&#237;deres comunitarios ind&#237;genas en detenci&#243;n preventiva por 
delitos de terrorismo aunque pareciera que solamente estaban manifestando de manera 
pac&#237;fica las reclamaciones leg&#237;timas de sus comunidades, incluso algunas relativas al 
Convenio no. 169 de la OIT. Adem&#225;s ha manifestado su preocupaci&#243;n al gobierno peruano 
por una investigaci&#243;n por delitos de terrorismo contra 35 activistas ind&#237;genas y ambientales 
que se opon&#237;an a proyectos mineros en Piura. Igualmente fue informado que los medios de 
comunicaci&#243;n o algunos pol&#237;ticos locales utilizan el concepto de terrorismo para 
estigmatizar las expresiones de protesta. 
</p>
<p>136. El Relator Especial recomienda el examen de los art&#237;culos 2 y 4 del Decreto-ley No. 
25475 y otras disposiciones que definen lo que constituyen cr&#237;menes terroristas para lograr 
un cumplimiento estricto con el requisito de la legalidad. Es consciente de que la aplicaci&#243;n 
de las disposiciones existentes est&#225; limitada por directrices que dimanan del fallo del 
Tribunal Constitucional de 2003. Sin embargo, recomienda una reforma legislativa para 
contrarrestar cualquier tentaci&#243;n hacia una aplicaci&#243;n m&#225;s amplia. Seg&#250;n &#233;l, la perspectiva 
de redactar y adoptar una ley apropiada contra el terrorismo es una oportunidad para 
alejarse de los Decretos-ley, es decir, leyes adoptadas por el ejecutivo mediante la 
delegaci&#243;n de la autoridad, y para reforzar el estado de derecho mediante la creaci&#243;n a 
trav&#233;s de la legislaci&#243;n parlamentaria de un marco apropiado para las medidas contra el 
terrorismo. 
</p>
<p>137. Durante su misi&#243;n el Relator Especial fue informado de que una Comisi&#243;n de 
expertos ha preparado un proyecto de nueva ley contra el terrorismo que sustituir&#237;a el 
Decreto-ley no. 25475. La nueva ley tambi&#233;n tendr&#237;a en cuenta el marco de las obligaciones 
internacionales del Per&#250; con arreglo a distintos convenciones y protocolos contra el 
terrorismo, y resoluciones del Consejo de Seguridad. El Relator Especial celebra este plan y 
la oferta que se le curs&#243; durante la misi&#243;n a ser consultado acerca del proyecto de ley en un 
futuro cercano. 
</p>
<p>138. El Relator Especial fue informado de que actualmente en el Per&#250; hay cientos de 
casos que han sido clasificados como conflictos sociales, con frecuencia relacionados al 
disfrute efectivo de derechos humanos o a elementos de subsistencia, es decir agua, energ&#237;a, 
educaci&#243;n, servicios de salud o tierras agr&#237;colas. Recalca que dichos conflictos no pueden 
resolverse confundiendo la protesta con la subversi&#243;n, o mediante la detenci&#243;n e 
imputaci&#243;n por delitos de terrorismo a los l&#237;deres de las mism&#237;simas comunidades que m&#225;s 
padecieron durante los decenios de violencia y de conflicto interno armado, las cuales 
siguen marginalizadas y sujetas a la discriminaci&#243;n. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1

<p> <b>37 
</b></p>
<p>139. El Relator Especial se&#241;ala que aunque el Per&#250; es parte de la Convenci&#243;n contra la 
Tortura y, desde 2006, de su protocolo facultativo (OPCAT), a&#250;n no ha creado un 
mecanismo nacional independiente para visitar todos los sitios de detenci&#243;n, aunque haya 
una propuesta para confiar esta funci&#243;n a la Defensora del Pueblo. La creaci&#243;n de un 
mecanismo nacional independiente de visitas es una de las principales obligaciones de 
tratado con arreglo al OPCAT y es particularmente importante en el contexto de la lucha 
contra el terrorismo, pues las personas detenidas como sospechosas de terrorismo corren 
frecuentemente el riesgo agravado de tortura, y por ello un mecanismo efectivo de 
prevenci&#243;n es necesario para eliminar cualquier tentaci&#243;n de recurrir a medios prohibidos 
de interrogaci&#243;n durante la investigaci&#243;n de casos de terrorismo. 
</p>
<p>140. El Relator Especial quisiera agradecer a todos sus interlocutores por su cooperaci&#243;n 
constructiva en la preparaci&#243;n de la misi&#243;n, como tambi&#233;n durante la misma, en particular 
al Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores por la excelente facilitaci&#243;n de la visita. Asimismo 
manifiesta su agradecimiento a la Coordinadora Residente de las Naciones Unidas y a las 
agencias de la ONU en el Per&#250;, como tambi&#233;n a la Oficina del Alto Comisionado de los 
Derechos Humanos y su competente y comprometida delegaci&#243;n, integrada por dos 
asistentes y dos int&#233;rpretes.

<p><b> 1.  Comunicaci&#243;n enviada por el Relator Especial al Gobierno 
</b>141. El 26 de noviembre de 2010, el Relator Especial, envi&#243; una carta al Gobierno, junto 
con el Relator Especial sobre la tortura y otros tratos o penas crueles, inhumanos o 
degradantes, en relaci&#243;n a la posible extradici&#243;n del Sr. <b>Ali Aarrass</b>. 
</p>
<p>142. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida: 
</p>
<p>El Consejo de Ministros de Espa&#241;a habr&#237;a otorgado la aprobaci&#243;n final en 
una petici&#243;n del Reino de Marruecos para extraditar al Sr. Ali Aarrass por cargos de 
terrorismo. 
</p>
<p>El Sr. Ali Aarrass habr&#237;a sido detenido el 28 de marzo de 2010, en Melilla 
con base en una orden de detenci&#243;n internacional solicitada por el Reino de 
Marruecos. Se alega que el Sr. Aarrass habr&#237;a sido detenido junto con el Sr. 
Mohammed el Bay, quien tambi&#233;n habr&#237;a sido objeto de una orden de b&#250;squeda y 
captura internacional, y que ambos se encontrar&#237;an detenidos desde el 1 de abril de 
</p><p>2008. El Sr. Ali Aarrass estar&#237;a siendo buscado en Marruecos por cargos 
relacionados con el terrorismo y estar&#237;a acusado de pertenecer a una red terrorista 
dirigida por el Sr. Abdelkader Belliraj. A ra&#237;z de las decisiones judiciales del 21 de 
noviembre 2008 y 23 de enero de 2009, y de una garant&#237;a del Gobierno de 
Marruecos de que el Sr. Ali Aarrass no ser&#237;a condenado a la pena de muerte o a 
cadena perpetua sin libertad condicional, el Gobierno espa&#241;ol habr&#237;a autorizado su 
extradici&#243;n el 19 de noviembre de 2010. El Gobierno espa&#241;ol habr&#237;a negado la 
solicitud de extradici&#243;n del Sr. el Bay, quien tendr&#237;a doble ciudadan&#237;a espa&#241;ola y 
marroqu&#237;. El 24 de noviembre, la Audiencia Nacional habr&#237;a enviado una carta a 
Interpol y al Director del Centro Penitenciario de Algeciras solicit&#225;ndoles que 
facilitaran la extradici&#243;n del Sr. Aarrass a la mayor brevedad posible. 
</p>
<p>Desde el a&#241;o 2006, el Sr. Aarrass habr&#237;a sido investigado por la Audiencia 
Nacional espa&#241;ola por cargos relacionados con el terrorismo. El 16 de marzo de 
2009, el tribunal habr&#237;a cerrado provisionalmente la investigaci&#243;n por falta de 
pruebas. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1

<p><b>38</b> 
</p>
<p>143. Se expresa temor por el hecho de que el Sr. Ali Aarrass pueda ser sometido a 
torturas y malos tratos en caso de ser extraditado a Marruecos. Individuos detenidos en 
Marruecos y acusados de estar vinculados a la &#8220;C&#233;lula Belliraj&#8221; han alegado haber sido 
sometidos a torturas por miembros de la Direcci&#243;n de Vigilancia del Territorio (Direction 
de la surveillance du territoire, DST), un organismo de inteligencia, durante su detenci&#243;n en 
r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n en el centro de detenci&#243;n de T&#233;mara. 
</p>
<p>144. Los Relatores se permitieron hacer un llamamiento al Gobierno para buscar una 
clarificaci&#243;n de los hechos para asegurar que el derecho a la integridad f&#237;sica y mental de la 
persona mencionada sean protegidos de conformidad, entre otros, a la Declaraci&#243;n 
Universal de los Derechos Humanos, el Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y 
Pol&#237;ticos, la Declaraci&#243;n sobre la Protecci&#243;n de todas las Personas contra la Tortura y Otros 
Tratos o Penas Crueles, Inhumanos o Degradantes y la Convenci&#243;n contra la Tortura. 
</p>
<p>145. Al  mismo tiempo, recordaron al Gobierno el principio fundamental enunciado en el 
art&#237;culo 5 de la Declaraci&#243;n Universal de los Derechos Humanos y reiterado en el art&#237;culo 7 
del Pacto internacional relativo a los derechos civiles y pol&#237;ticos, que estipula que nadie 
ser&#225; sometido a torturas ni a penas o tratos crueles, inhumanos o degradantes. El Comit&#233; de 
los derechos humanos indic&#243; en su Observaci&#243;n general n&#176; 20 sobre el art&#237;culo 7 que &#8220;los 
Estados Partes no deben exponer a las personas al peligro de ser sometidas a torturas o a 
penas o tratos crueles, inhumanos o degradantes al regresar a otro pa&#237;s tras la extradici&#243;n, la 
expulsi&#243;n o la devoluci&#243;n&#8221; Asimismo, llamaron su atenci&#243;n al art&#237;culo 3 de la Convenci&#243;n 
contra la tortura y otros tratos o penas crueles, inhumanos o degradantes seg&#250;n el cual 
&#8220;Ning&#250;n Estado Parte proceder&#225; a la expulsi&#243;n, devoluci&#243;n o extradici&#243;n de una persona a 
otro Estado cuando haya razones fundadas para creer que estar&#237;a en peligro de ser sometida 
a tortura&#8221;. Los Relatores indicaron que era de su opini&#243;n que el principio contenido en la 
Observaci&#243;n del Comit&#233; de los derechos humanos y en la disposici&#243;n de la Convenci&#243;n 
contra la tortura representa un elemento inherente a la obligaci&#243;n fundamental de evitar 
contribuir de una manera u otra a la violaci&#243;n de la interdicci&#243;n de someter toda persona a  
torturas o otros tratos o penas crueles, inhumanos o degradantes. 
</p>
<p>146. Tambi&#233;n recordaron al Gobierno que el Relator Especial sobre la Tortura, en su 
informe A/60/316, se&#241;al&#243; que &#8220;las garant&#237;as diplom&#225;ticas no son dignas de cr&#233;dito y son 
ineficaces para proteger de la tortura y los malos tratos: por lo general, se trata de obtener 
ese tipo de garant&#237;as de los Estados donde la pr&#225;ctica de la tortura es sistem&#225;tica; donde los 
mecanismos de seguimiento posterior a la devoluci&#243;n han demostrado que no ofrecen 
ninguna garant&#237;a contra la tortura; donde las garant&#237;as diplom&#225;ticas no son jur&#237;dicamente 
vinculantes, por lo que carecen de efectos jur&#237;dicos y no cabe exigirse responsabilidad si no 
se cumplen; y donde la persona a la que las garant&#237;as tienen por objeto proteger carece de 
recursos si se violan esas garant&#237;as. Por consiguiente, el Relator Especial opina que los 
Estado no pueden recurrir a las garant&#237;as diplom&#225;ticas como salvaguardia contra la tortura y 
los malos tratos cuando haya razones fundadas para creer que una persona estar&#237;a en peligro 
de ser sometida a tortura o malos tratos a su regreso&#8221; y exhort&#243; &#8220;a los gobiernos a observar 
escrupulosamente el principio de la no devoluci&#243;n y a no expulsar a ninguna persona a 
fronteras o territorios donde puedan correr el riesgo de ser objeto de violaciones de los 
derechos humanos, independientemente de que se haya reconocido oficialmente su 
condici&#243;n de refugiado.&#8221; (p&#225;rr. 51 y 52).

<p>154. Los Relatores solicitaron al Gobierno espa&#241;ol que informara sobre los motivos por 
los cuales habr&#237;a aceptado extraditar al Sr. Ali Aarrass por cargos relacionados con 
terrorismo al Reino de Marruecos si, el 16 de marzo de 2009, la Audiencia Nacional 
Espa&#241;ola habr&#237;a cerrado provisionalmente la investigaci&#243;n en su contra por cargos 
relacionados con terrorismo; as&#237; mismo, solicitaron informaci&#243;n sobre la forma en que el 
Gobierno de Espa&#241;a se asegura de que el Sr. Ali Aarrass no sea extraditado, si existe un 
riesgo real de tortura u otros tratos o penas crueles, inhumanos o degradantes, en 
contravenci&#243;n a la obligaci&#243;n legal internacional de no devoluci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Comunicaci&#243;n del Gobierno 
</b></p>
<p>155. Por medio de carta de fecha de 7 diciembre de 2010, el Gobierno indic&#243; que los 
representantes del Sr. Ali Aarrass han planteado su queja de forma simult&#225;nea en, al menos, 
tres instancias internacionales diferentes: procedimientos especiales; Comit&#233; de Derechos 
Humanos de Naciones Unidas y, aunque no tiene constancia formal, el Gobierne indica 
tener informaci&#243;n de que se ha presentado una demanda ante el Tribunal Europeo de 
Derechos Humanos (demanda inicialmente inadmitida aunque ha sido reiterada 
posteriormente).  
</p>
<p>156. El Gobierno puso de manifiesto que el Sr. Ali Aarrass no fue detenido en la fecha 
que se indica en la carta enviada por ambos Relatores Especiales, sino que fue detenido con 
anterioridad, encontr&#225;ndose en situaci&#243;n de prisi&#243;n provisional a la espera de extradici&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>157. Respecto a la alegaci&#243;n realizada sobre posible riesgo de tortura o malos tratos en el 
caso de la entrega del Sr. Ali Aarrass a Marruecos, el Gobierno indic&#243; que, durante el 
procedimiento de extradici&#243;n, esta alegaci&#243;n fue analizada, debatida y resuelta por los 
Tribunales espa&#241;oles. En este sentido, en el auto de 21 de noviembre de 2008, la Secci&#243;n 
Segunda de la Sala de lo Penal de la Audiencia Nacional rechaz&#243; tales alegaciones, 
se&#241;alando lo siguiente: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;La denuncia de la situaci&#243;n de las c&#225;rceles marroqu&#237;es adolece de 
generalidad apoyada en informaciones de medios de publicaci&#243;n en Internet no 
contrastadas, estando por tanto hu&#233;rfana de toda acreditaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>En cuanto a la posibilidad de imposici&#243;n de la pena de prisi&#243;n perpetua, el 
art. 4.6 de la LExP establece que no procede la extradici&#243;n cuando el Estado 
requirente no diera garant&#237;a de que la persona reclamada no ser&#225; sometida a tratos 
inhumanos o degradantes. La cuesti&#243;n, no obstante, ya ha sido resuelta tanto por la 
jurisprudencia d&#233;l TEDH (SS. 7 de julio de 1.989, caso Soering vs Reino Unido, y 
de 16 de noviembre de 1.999, caso TYV vs Reino Unido) y nuestro Tribunal 
Constitucional, (SS 91/2000, de 30 de marzo y 148/2004, de 13 de septiembre) al 
establecerse que en el caso de que le fuera impuesta la pena de cadena perpetua, se 
establezca la condici&#243;n de que el cumplimiento de la misma no ser&#225; 
indefectiblemente de por vida, consider&#225;ndose tal condici&#243;n, de conformidad con la 
jurisprudencia citada,, garant&#237;a necesaria y suficiente de salvaguarda, de los 
derechos a la vida, integridad f&#237;sica y prohibici&#243;n de tortura o tratos inhumanos o 
degradantes en el &#225;mbito extradicional. En conclusi&#243;n cabe indicar como, en todos 
los pa&#237;ses de nuestro entorno cultural y civilizaci&#243;n, la reclusi&#243;n perpetua no se 
impone de tal forma que suponga la extinci&#243;n f&#237;sica en prisi&#243;n de la vida del 
condenado. Basta, por ello, establecer la condici&#243;n de que si se impone la pena de 
prisi&#243;n perpetua ser&#225; limitada. 
</p>
<p>Conviene tener presente que el art. 11 del Tratado de Extradici&#243;n, prev&#233; para 
los supuestos de condena a la pena capital; que la misma ser&#225; sustituida por la pena 
prevista para los mismos hechos por la legislaci&#243;n del estado requerido&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>41 
</b></p>
<p>158. Por otro lado, se indic&#243; que el Auto de 23 de enero de 2009 del Pleno de la misma 
Sala, que resuelve el recurso interpuesto contra el auto referido anteriormente, rechaza que 
exista riesgo de violaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos que se alega: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;F) Y respecto a la conculcaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos, en los folios 266 
a 269 obra aportado un informe de Amnist&#237;a Internacional sobre los Derechos 
Humanos en el mundo, y m&#225;s concretamente en Marruecos, haci&#233;ndose referencia al 
empleo de torturas para extraer confesiones, a los malos tratos infligidos por los 
guardadores penitenciarios y por las fuerzas de seguridad, a la falta de acceso a los 
cuidados m&#233;dicos y a las restricciones a las visitas de familiares. 
</p>
<p>Tales vulneraciones denunciadas no pueden reputarse como sistem&#225;ticas y 
generalizadas, al no existir acreditaci&#243;n sobre ello; como tampoco existe prueba 
alguna, ni siquiera indiciaria, sobre concreta y real exposici&#243;n del reclamado a tratos 
inhumanos o degradantes en el supuesto de que se acceda a su extradici&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>En otro orden de cosas, el Tribunal de instancia resuelve la cuesti&#243;n sobre la 
prohibici&#243;n de aplicaci&#243;n al reclamado de la pena de muerte mediante la imposici&#243;n 
de la condici&#243;n consistente en el compromiso que ha de adquirir el Estado 
requeriente acerca de que la pena a imponer no ser&#225; indefectiblemente de por vida. 
Sin embargo, esta Sala en Pleno estima m&#225;s ajustada a la normativa del Convenio 
bilateral de 1997, modificar la aludida condici&#243;n por la prevista para los mismos 
hechos por la legislaci&#243;n del Estado requerido&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>159. El Gobierno inform&#243; que el Auto del Pleno de la Sala estima en parte el recurso, 
estableciendo como garant&#237;a que para determinar la pena aplicable se aplique la legislaci&#243;n 
espa&#241;ola.  
</p>
<p>160. Respecto a la apreciaci&#243;n por los Tribunales espa&#241;oles del riesgo alegado por el Sr. 
Ali Aarrass, el Gobierno precis&#243; que han de distinguirse dos aspectos distintos referidos al 
riesgo invocado. Por una parte, el que se refiere a las condiciones en las que pueda llevarse 
a cabo la investigaci&#243;n penal en Marruecos y la situaci&#243;n personal del extraditado en ese 
per&#237;odo. Al respecto, el Gobierno indic&#243; que el Pleno de la Sala de lo Penal de la Audiencia 
Nacional ha se&#241;alado que las &#8220;vulneraciones denunciadas no pueden reputarse como 
sistem&#225;ticas y generalizadas, al no existir acreditaci&#243;n sobre ello; como tampoco existe 
prueba alguna, ni siquiera indiciaria, sobre concreta y real exposici&#243;n del reclamado a tratos 
inhumanos o degradantes en el supuesto de que se acceda a su extradici&#243;n.&#8221;. En este 
sentido, el Gobierno indic&#243; que no se ha considerado que haya quedado suficientemente 
acreditado dicho riesgo concreto de un potencial sometimiento a tortura o tratos inhumanos 
o degradantes.  
</p>
<p>161. En segundo lugar, se hace referencia a las garant&#237;as exigibles, en caso de que el 
extraditado fuera condenado. En este sentido el Gobierno se&#241;ala que la Sala de lo Penal de 
la Audiencia Nacional impuso como condici&#243;n para la entrega, que la pena a imponer sea la 
prevista para los mismos hechos en la legislaci&#243;n espa&#241;ola. Subrayando que, esta no es una 
mera &#8220;garant&#237;a diplom&#225;tica&#8221; sino que es una previsi&#243;n expresa del Convenio bilateral de 
extradici&#243;n de la que han decidieron hacer uso las autoridades espa&#241;olas. 
</p>
<p>162. En cuanto a las aclaraciones sobre el archivo de la investigaci&#243;n penal desarrollada 
en Espa&#241;a, el Gobierno manifest&#243; que: 1&#176; En primer lugar debe resaltarse que, como se&#241;al&#243; 
la Sala de lo Penal de la Audiencia Nacional, no nos encontramos ante dos investigaciones 
penales por los &#8220;mismos hechos&#8221;. En efecto, los hechos que est&#225;n en el origen de la 
demanda de extradici&#243;n presentada por Marruecos son los siguientes:  
</p>
<p>El reclamado fue reclutado para formar parte del Movimiento de los 
Muyaidin de Marruecos por Abdelkader Bellirej, que formaba parte de dicho grupo 
desde finales del a&#241;o 1982. Este, tras una reuni&#243;n en Par&#237;s con los responsables de la </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>42</b> 
</p>
<p>organizaci&#243;n, conoci&#243; al l&#237;der, Abdelaziz Nouamani, que le inst&#243; a reclutar a varias 
personas, entre las que finalmente figur&#243; el reclamado, quien se convirti&#243; en un 
elemento activo de la misma, con disposici&#243;n para establecer relaciones con otros 
grupos terroristas para la ejecuci&#243;n de sus planes. Se informa que solicit&#243; a 
Abdelkader Bellirej y a un colaborador argelino que intervinieran a su favor ante los 
l&#237;deres del Grupo Salafista para la Predicaci&#243;n y el Combate de Argelia, con el 
objetivo de coordinar la instalaci&#243;n de un campamento yihadi en ese pa&#237;s para los 
voluntarios marroqu&#237;es del Movimiento de los Muyahidine de Marruecos bajo las 
&#243;rdenes del Grupo Salafista. El viaje de Abdelkader Bellirej a Argelia con el 
mencionado fin se produjo en 2005. 
</p>
<p>163. Se informa tambi&#233;n que las diligencias previas seguidas ante el Juzgado Central de 
Instrucci&#243;n n&#176; 5 de la Audiencia Nacional, se dirigieron a investigar los siguientes hechos, 
tal como resultan  descritos en el Auto del Pleno de la Sala de lo Pena de la Audiencia 
Nacional: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seg&#250;n los autos de prisi&#243;n y de declaraci&#243;n como bastante de la fianza 
carcelaria por cuant&#237;a de 24.000 euros prestada en nombre del aqu&#237; reclamado, 
dictados el 6 y el 7-11-2006 por el Juzgado Central de Instrucci&#243;n n&#176; 5 (folios 149 a 
151), al reclamado por Marruecos se le persigue en Espa&#241;a por haber supuestamente 
facilitado la entrada en aquel pa&#237;s de un Kalashnikov, una pistola, un rev&#243;lver y 
municiones en 2001 para la c&#233;lula terrorista liderada por Abderrazak Soumah, a 
trav&#233;s de Mohamed El Haraoui, para su entrega a Mohamed Nougaoui, emir de la 
c&#233;lula yihadista de Nador, adscrito al movimiento salafista yihadista marroqu&#237;; 
armas que habr&#237;an sido facilitadas desde B&#233;lgica, en donde el imputado resid&#237;a&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>164. 2&#176; El Gobierno inform&#243; que en consecuencia, los hechos investigados en Espa&#241;a no 
son los mismos que est&#225;n en el fundamento de la petici&#243;n de extradici&#243;n. En Espa&#241;a se 
investig&#243; el posible tr&#225;fico de armas por el territorio espa&#241;ol con destino a un grupo 
terrorista en Marruecos. Por su parte, los hechos por los que se solicita la extradici&#243;n son la 
pertenencia del reclamado a una organizaci&#243;n terrorista, realizando actividades de contacto 
y colaboraci&#243;n con diferentes personas en Argelia, con el objetivo de coordinar la 
instalaci&#243;n de un campamento yihadi en ese pa&#237;s para los voluntarios marroqu&#237;es del 
Movimiento de los Muyahidine de Marruecos bajo las &#243;rdenes del Grupo Salafista. 
</p>
<p>165. El Gobierno inform&#243; que se tratar&#237;a, por tanto, de hechos diferentes aunque puedan 
estar relacionados con una misma organizaci&#243;n terrorista, de pertenecer a la cual es acusado 
el Sr. Ali Aarrass. 
</p>
<p>166. 3&#176; A continuaci&#243;n, el Gobierno inform&#243; que el procedimiento seguido ante el 
Juzgado Central de Instrucci&#243;n n&#176; 5 de la Audiencia Nacional se refiere exclusivamente a 
los hechos relacionados con el tr&#225;fico de armas a trav&#233;s de Espa&#241;a, y es sobre tales hechos 
sobre los que se ha dictado Auto de sobreseimiento provisional (archivo provisional) del 
procedimiento, se&#241;alando lo siguiente: 
</p>
<p>&#8221;En el transcurso de la investigaci&#243;n de la presente causa, se han practicado 
cuantas diligencias se han estimado necesarias para la comprobaci&#243;n del delito 
investigado, no habi&#233;ndose podido concluir en la comisi&#243;n del mismo por parte de la 
persona imputada (&#8230;) procede alzar las mismas y acordar el Sobreseimiento 
Provisional de las presentes diligencias&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>167. Se informa que dicho sobreseimiento provisional se acuerda al amparo de art&#237;culo 
641.2&#176; de la Ley de Enjuiciamiento Criminal (LECrim). Tal declaraci&#243;n judicial procede 
cuando &#8220;resulte del sumario haberse cometido un delito y no haya motivos suficientes para 
acusar a determinada o determinadas personas como autores, c&#243;mplices o encubridores&#8221;. 
Por tanto, de acuerdo con le LECrim, la resoluci&#243;n judicial constata la existencia de un 
hecho delictivo, pero concluye que no hay pruebas suficientes para acusar del delito de </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>43 
</b></p>
<p>tr&#225;fico de armas con fines terroristas al Sr. Ali Arras. El Gobierno indic&#243; que este tipo de 
sobreseimiento (archivo provisional) no produce efecto de cosa juzgada, ni excluye que el 
sospechoso sea investigado en otro pa&#237;s por otros hechos o, incluso, por los mismos hechos. 
</p>
<p>168. 4&#176; Finalmente el Gobierno inform&#243; que no habr&#237;a contradicci&#243;n alguna entre las 
decisiones tomadas por las autoridades espa&#241;olas ya que no hay identidad entre los hechos 
investigados en Espa&#241;a y los que est&#225;n en el fundamento de la petici&#243;n de extradici&#243;n a 
Marruecos. Por otro lado, se informa que no existe contradicci&#243;n porque la decisi&#243;n de 
archivo provisional dictada en Espa&#241;a est&#225; justificada por la falta de pruebas suficientes 
para dirigir la acusaci&#243;n de tr&#225;fico de armas contra el Sr. Ali Aarrass y no excluye que los 
hechos pudieran ser investigados en otro Estado en el que pueda existir otro material 
probatorio.

<p>172. Le dernier jour de sa visite officielle en Tunisie, du 22 au 26 janvier 2010, le 
Rapporteur Sp&#233;cial des Nations Unies pour la promotion et la protection des droits de 
l&#8217;homme et des libert&#233;s fondamentales dans la lutte antiterroriste, M. Martin Scheinin, a 
publi&#233; la d&#233;claration suivante :  
</p>
<p>173. &#171; J&#8217;aimerais exprimer ma reconnaissance au Gouvernement de la Tunisie, qui m&#8217;a 
apport&#233; sa coop&#233;ration pendant ma mission. J&#8217;ai pu discuter longuement et en toute 
transparence avec de nombreux interlocuteurs repr&#233;sentant les autorit&#233;s et la soci&#233;t&#233; civile 
J&#8217;ai men&#233; des entretiens fructueux avec le Ministre des Affaires Etrang&#232;res, le Ministre de 
la Justice et des Droits de l&#8217;Homme, les repr&#233;sentants du minist&#232;re de l&#8217;int&#233;rieur, des juges, 
des parlementaires et le Comit&#233; Sup&#233;rieur des Droits de l&#8217;Homme et des Libert&#233;s 
Fondamentales. J&#8217;ai &#233;galement rencontr&#233; les repr&#233;sentants de la communaut&#233; internationale, 
des avocats, des universitaires et des organisations non-gouvernementales, y compris les 
organisations des droits de l&#8217;homme et des organisations de d&#233;fense des victimes du 
terrorisme. Au sujet de la loi et de la pratique anti-terroriste du pays. Par ailleurs, j&#8217;ai visit&#233; 
les locaux de garde &#224; vue de la police &#224; Bouchoucha ainsi que la prison de Mournaguia, o&#249; 
j&#8217;ai pu m&#8217;entretenir avec plusieurs personnes soup&#231;onn&#233;es ou convaincues de crimes 
terroristes. Je tiens &#224; remercier tous mes interlocuteurs, y compris les d&#233;tenus, ainsi que les 
victimes d&#8217;actes terroristes et leurs familles qui ont bien voulu me parler. Tout cela m&#8217;a </p>

</p>
<p>permis de conna&#238;tre la situation pour &#233;valuer d&#8217;une mani&#232;re objective le respect des droits 
de l&#8217;homme dans le contexte anti-terroriste en Tunisie. 
</p>
<p>174. Chaque Etat a l&#8217;obligation de prot&#233;ger la vie et l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; de ses citoyens et r&#233;sidents 
et de les mettre &#224; l&#8217;abri de menaces &#233;manant du terrorisme. Mais en m&#234;me temps, les 
normes internationales en mati&#232;re de droits de l&#8217;homme doivent &#234;tre enti&#232;rement 
respect&#233;es, y compris les droits des personnes soup&#231;onn&#233;es d&#8217;&#234;tre impliqu&#233;es dans des 
crimes terroristes. La Tunisie a souvent r&#233;p&#233;t&#233; ses engagements &#224; cette fin, notamment en 
ratifiant la plupart des Conventions internationales ayant trait aux droits de l&#8217;homme et au 
terrorisme. L&#8217;invitation qui m&#8217;a &#233;t&#233; faite est, me semble-t-il, un pas important dans cette 
voie. Je remettrai un rapport complet &#224; l&#8217;une des sessions &#224; venir du Conseil des Droits de 
l&#8217;Homme. Voici quelques-unes des observations essentielles &#224; la fin de ma visite. 
</p>
<p>175. Cadre juridique : S&#8217;agissant du cadre juridique, je salue quelques amendements 
apport&#233;s r&#233;cemment &#224; la loi, en particulier une r&#233;daction plus pr&#233;cise des dispositions 
concernant l&#8217;incitation, l&#8217;abolition des &#171; juges sans visages &#187; et le renforcement des 
garanties li&#233;es &#224; la prolongation de la garde &#224; vue. Cependant la loi anti-terroriste de 2003 
comporte encore certaines lacunes qui, &#224; l&#8217;instar de nombreux autres pays, sont imputables 
&#224; la d&#233;finition du terrorisme : les normes internationales exigent que tous les &#233;l&#233;ments d&#8217;un 
crime soient exprim&#233;s explicitement et avec pr&#233;cision dans les d&#233;finitions juridiques. Je l&#8217;ai 
toujours soulign&#233;, la violence &#224; issue fatale ou toute autre violence physique grave contre 
tout ou une partie du grand public devrait &#234;tre au c&#339;ur de toute d&#233;finition du terrorisme 
Article 15 du Pacte international sur les droits civils et politiques ; E/CN.4/2006/98 ;. Ce 
n&#8217;est pas le cas en Tunisie : dans la majorit&#233; des cas depuis 2003, de simples intentions sont 
punies, qu&#8217;il s&#8217;agisse de &#171; planification &#187; ou &#171; d&#8217;appartenance &#187;, cette derni&#232;re notion 
renvoyant &#224; des organisations ou groupes vaguement d&#233;finis. On m&#8217;a parl&#233; de nombreux 
cas de jeunes hommes, et j&#8217;en ai vu quelques-uns, dont le principal crime &#233;tait d&#8217;avoir 
t&#233;l&#233;charg&#233; ou regard&#233; certaines &#233;missions en ligne, ou de s&#8217;&#234;tre r&#233;unis avec d&#8217;autres pour 
discuter de questions religieuses.  
</p>
<p>176. Les autorit&#233;s ne m&#8217;ont toujours pas remis de statistiques pr&#233;cises sur le nombre 
d&#8217;affaires pour terrorisme jug&#233;es dans les tribunaux tunisiens ces derni&#232;res ann&#233;es. Le 
terrorisme n&#8217;est pas un ph&#233;nom&#232;ne courant en Tunisie, et cependant il semble que le champ 
d&#8217;application des dispositions anti-terroristes est beaucoup trop large et devrait &#234;tre limit&#233;. 
Comme dans d&#8217;autres pays, je vois l&#224; un risque de &#171; pente savonneuse &#187;, qui non seulement 
aboutit &#224; la condamnation de personnes pour terrorisme, qui ne m&#233;ritent pas d&#8217;&#234;tre ainsi 
stigmatis&#233;es, mais met &#233;galement en p&#233;ril l&#8217;efficacit&#233; de la lutte anti-terroriste en banalisant 
le ph&#233;nom&#232;ne.  
</p>
<p>177. La loi tunisienne interdit la torture, et le pays est Partie &#224; la Convention contre la 
torture. Cependant, il n&#8217;existe apparemment pas de disposition claire exigeant des juges 
qu&#8217;ils entament une instruction &#171; ex-officio &#187; lorsque des all&#233;gations de torture sont faites 
devant les tribunaux, ni qu&#8217;ils motivent le rejet d&#8217;une plainte pour torture ou qu&#8217;ils excluent 
toute preuve ou aveu obtenus sous la torture. Ces carences du cadre juridique peuvent &#233;riger 
un bouclier d&#8217;impunit&#233; pour les auteurs de torture ou de mauvais traitements.  
</p>
<p>178. Ecart entre la loi et la r&#233;alit&#233; : L&#8217;exp&#233;rience la plus troublante que j&#8217;ai faite pendant 
ma mission &#233;tait de constater de graves incoh&#233;rences entre la loi et ce qui se passait dans la 
r&#233;alit&#233;, selon les informations que j&#8217;ai re&#231;ues. Je continuerai de coop&#233;rer avec le 
Gouvernement pour r&#233;diger un rapport complet, mais dans l&#8217;intervalle j&#8217;ai d&#233;cid&#233; 
d&#8217;exprimer quelques-unes de mes principales pr&#233;occupations :  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Il semblerait, et les autorit&#233;s l&#8217;ont admis, que la date d&#8217;arrestation peut &#234;tre 
postdat&#233;e, ce qui revient &#224; contourner les r&#232;gles relatives &#224; la dur&#233;e permissible 
d&#8217;une garde &#224; vue, constituant ainsi la d&#233;tention au secret et la disparition de la 
personne;  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>45 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Le recours fr&#233;quent aux aveux comme &#233;l&#233;ment de preuve devant les tribunaux, en 
absence d&#8217;enqu&#234;te appropri&#233;e sur les all&#233;gations de torture ou d&#8217;autres mauvais 
traitements;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Les garanties inappropri&#233;es contre la torture, comme par exemple l&#8217;acc&#232;s &#224; un 
examen m&#233;dical ind&#233;pendant et l&#8217;acc&#232;s &#224; un avocat d&#232;s l&#8217;arrestation, plut&#244;t qu&#8217;apr&#232;s 
la premi&#232;re comparution devant le juge d&#8217;instruction; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Le nombre excessivement faible de poursuites ou d&#8217;autres conclusions pr&#233;cises 
relatives &#224; la torture par rapport &#224; la fr&#233;quence des all&#233;gations.  
</p>
<p>179. Il est vrai qu&#8217;&#224; bien des &#233;gards, les autorit&#233;s tunisiennes ont agi en toute transparence 
pendant ma visite, n&#233;anmoins on m&#8217;a refus&#233; l&#8217;acc&#232;s aux locaux d&#8217;interrogatoire de la Police 
Judiciaire (notamment la Sous-direction pour les affaires criminelles), toujours connue 
comme &#8220;Direction de la S&#233;curit&#233; d&#8217;Etat&#8221;, et ce en d&#233;pit de mes nombreuses demandes. Ceci 
est d&#8217;autant plus troublant que les all&#233;gations de torture ou de mauvais traitements 
concernent le r&#244;le de la police judiciaire avant l&#8217;enregistrement officiel de la garde &#224; vue, 
pendant l&#8217;instruction/interrogatoire, ou lorsqu&#8217;un d&#233;tenu en attente de proc&#232;s est sorti de la 
prison pour les besoins de l&#8217;enqu&#234;te. 
</p>
<p>180. Strat&#233;gie de lutte contre le terrorisme : Je suis convaincu que la d&#233;marche &#224; piliers 
multiples pour pr&#233;venir le terrorisme gr&#226;ce aux mesures sociales, d&#8217;enseignement et de non-
discrimination, adopt&#233;es par la Tunisie est un excellent exemple qui m&#233;rite r&#233;flexion. Je 
crains cependant que l&#8217;acquis de ces politiques ind&#233;niablement positives soit ais&#233;ment 
compromis par les violations de la loi qui, comme toujours, hypoth&#232;quent le succ&#232;s de la 
lutte contre le terrorisme. 
</p>
<p>181. Je reprends &#224; mon compte les recommandations de quelques m&#233;canismes des 
Nations Unies en mati&#232;re de droits de l&#8217;homme r&#233;cemment adress&#233;es &#224; la Tunisie, tout en 
l&#8217;encourageant &#224; continuer d&#8217;investir dans le domaine de l&#8217;enseignement, &#224; combler le foss&#233; 
social et &#224; combattre la pauvret&#233;. J&#8217;esp&#232;re coop&#233;rer comme par le pass&#233; avec le 
Gouvernement au cours des mois &#224; venir pour mettre au point le rapport complet de la 
mission. &#187;

<p> <b>L.  Turkey 
</b></p>
<p> <b>1.  Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>182. On 7 January 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, sent an urgent appeal regarding Mr.<b> Muharrem Erbey </b>and the<b> Human Rights 
Association (Insan Haklari Dernegi &#8211; IHD)</b>. Mr. Erbey is a human rights lawyer, the 
General Vice-Chairperson of IHD and the Chairperson of IHD&#8217;s Branch in Diyarbakir 
Province. The Human Rights Association (Insan Haklari Dernegi &#8211; IHD) works on, inter 
alia, the right to life and enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>183. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>On 24 December 2009, Mr. Erbey, along with several Kurdish opposition 
members, journalists and civil society activists, was arrested by police officers 
during an operation launched by the anti-terrorism branch of the police in several 
provinces following an order issued by the Diyarbakir Chief Public Prosecution 
Office. On the same day, the premises of the IHD in Diyarbakir were allegedly 
raided by the police. The police officers, who initially had not had a warrant, finally 
obtained a court order to search the offices. During the raid, computers and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>46</b> 
</p>
<p>documents including archives on cases of enforced disappearance and torture and 
other human rights violations were allegedly confiscated. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Erbey was remanded in custody at the Diyarbakir D Type Prison. On 26 
December 2009, he was allegedly accused of being the international affairs 
representative of the illegal armed group &#8220;the Community of Kurdish Society&#8221; 
(Koma Civaken Kurdistan &#8211; KCK) and consequently charged with &#8220;being a member 
of an illegal organization&#8221; pursuant to Articles 314 and 220/6 of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>It was alleged that the arrest and the charges against Mr. Erbey could have 
been linked to his participation in the preparations of a workshop held in Diyarbakir 
in September 2009 to debate constitutional amendments relating to minorities&#8217; 
rights, his statement on the rights of the Kurdish minority before the Belgian, 
Swedish and English Parliaments and his participation in the &#8220;Kurdish Film 
Festival&#8221; in Italy in 2009. 
</p>
<p>184. Concern was expressed that the arrest of Mr. Erbey and the raid of the IHD&#8217;s 
premises could have been directly related to their legitimate work in defense of human 
rights.  
</p>
<p>185. The mandate holders referred the Government to the fundamental principles set forth 
in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of 
Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms (hereinafter the Declaration), and in particular its articles 1; 5, points b) and c); 
and 6, points b) and c). In its resolution 7/12, the Human Rights Council urged 
Governments to take steps to provide adequate protection to witnesses of enforced or 
involuntary disappearances, human rights defenders acting against enforced disappearances 
and the lawyers and families of disappeared persons against any intimidation or ill-
treatment to which they might be subjected. They mandate holders urged the Government 
to take all necessary measures to guarantee that the rights and freedoms of Mr. Erbey are 
respected, including his right to freedom of opinion and expression, in accordance with 
fundamental principles as set forth in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>186. They sought clarification form the Government on, inter alia, the legal basis for the 
detention of Mr. Erbey, in particular on how the charges were compatible with applicable 
international human rights norms and standards, on how it is established whether an 
organization is illegal, and whether there were any procedures in place to appeal such a 
designation. 
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>187. As at 31 December 2010, there had been no response by the Government of Turkey 
to the mandate holders&#8217; joint urgent appeal.

<p>188. On 23 June 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression addressed a 
joint allegation letter concerning continued prosecutions against and sentencing of 
journalists under the Law to fight terrorism, Act 3713, as amended, (henceforth Anti-Terror 
Act), in particular article 7 which prohibits &#8220;spreading propaganda relating to a terrorist 
organization&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>189. According to information received:  
</p>
<p>On 4 June 2010, Mr. Irfan Aktan was sentenced to one year and three months 
imprisonment for an article he wrote regarding the strategy of the Kurdistan </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>47 
</b></p>
<p>Workers&#8217; Party (PKK) entitled &#8220;Weather Conditions in the Region and in Qandil: No 
Solution without Fighting&#8221;, which was published in the Express magazine on 15 
October 2009. Mr. Merve Erol, editor of the magazine, was sentenced to a fine of 
16,000 Turkish Lira. Both were found guilty of dispersing propaganda material 
relating to a terrorist organization in violation of article 7(2) of the Anti-Terror Act.  
</p>
<p>In a separate trial held on the same day, Mr. Filiz Kocali, former publisher of 
Gunluk, and Mr. Ramazan Pekgoz, its editor, and Mr. Ziya Cicekci, its owner, were 
sentenced to seven and a half years in prison each under the same article of the Anti-
Terror Act for reports published on 8 and 9 August 2009. These reports allegedly 
contained interviews carried out in Northern Iraq with Murat Karayylan, the top 
commander of the PKK. 
</p>
<p>On 10 June 2010, Mr. Ragip Zarakolu, who had been on trial since May 2009 
on charges of violation of article 7(2) of the Anti-Terror Act for publishing a novel 
entitled &#8220;More Difficult Decisions than Death&#8221; written by Mr. Mehmet Guler, was 
acquitted. However, at the same trial, Mr. Mehmet Guler was convicted to a fifteen 
month prison term for &#8220;spreading propaganda&#8221; of the PKK.  
</p>
<p>190. While the mandate holders welcomed the acquittal of Mr. Zarakolu, concern was 
expressed that repeated and frequent use of the Anti-Terror Act against journalists whose 
writings are unfavourable to the Government stifles the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression in the country. They noted that a total of 103 people, including 15 journalists, 
were arraigned in the first four months of 2010 alone on charges related to the Anti-Terror 
Act.  
</p>
<p>191. With a view to the overly broad application of the term terrorism in the Anti-Terror 
Act, the Special Rapporteur, in his report on the visit to the country in 2006 
(A/HRC/4/26/Add.2, paras. 14, 18, and 28-33), expressed his concern about prosecutions 
for acts related to freedom of expression, association and assembly in relation to the notion 
of terrorism. In this report, he also highlighted that there are elements both in the Anti-
Terror Act which may put severe limitations on the legitimate expression of opinions 
critical of the Government or State institutions, on the forming of organizations for 
legitimate purposes, and on the freedom of peaceful assembly. 
</p>
<p>192. The mandate holders appealed to the Government to take all necessary steps to 
secure the right to freedom of opinion and expression in accordance with fundamental 
principles as set forth in article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. In addition, they deemed it appropriate to make reference to Human Rights Council 
Resolution 12/16, para. 5 o), which calls upon States to refrain from using counter-
terrorism as a pretext to restrict the right to freedom of opinion and expression in ways that 
are contrary to their obligations under international law. They also drew the Government&#8217;s 
attention to resolutions of the Human Rights Council (13/26, para. 1) and of the General 
Assembly (64/168) which reaffirmed that States must ensure that any measure taken to 
combat terrorism comply with their obligations under international law, in particular 
international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>193. The mandate holders requested from the Government of Turkey, inter alia, to 
provide details of the prosecution against and/or sentencing of Mr. Irfan Aktan, Mr.<b> </b>Merve 
Erol, Mr. Filiz Kocali, Mr. Ramazan Pekgoz, Mr. Ziya Cicekci, and Mr. Mehmet Guler, 
and how they were compatible with the international norms and standards of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression and the related right to peaceful assembly and 
association. In particular, they requested information on how the prosecutors or judges 
argued that the publication of the above-mentioned items both showed intent to incite to 
terrorism and carried an objective danger that one or more terrorist acts would be carried 
out as a consequence of their publication. The Special Rapporteurs also asked for </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>48</b> 
</p>
<p>clarification on how the Anti-Terror Act, in particular its article 7, is compatible with the 
international norms and standards on the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p><b> 4.  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>194. As at 31 December 2010, there had been no response by the Government of Turkey 
to the mandate holders&#8217; joint letter of allegation. 
</p>
<p> <b>M.  Uganda 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1.  Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>195. On 23 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Chair-Rapporteur 
of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence 
of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right 
to freedom of opinion and expression, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of Uganda on the arrest and 
situation at the time of Mr. <b>Al-Amin Kimathi</b>, of Kenyan nationality and Executive 
Coordinator of Muslims Human Rights Forum (MHRF), and Mr. <b>Mbugua Mureithi</b>, of 
Kenyan nationality and a human rights lawyer. Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi had worked to expose 
and document human rights violations, arbitrary detention and unlawful renditions in the 
context of counter-terrorism operations in the East and Horn of Africa. Mr. Mbugua 
Mureithi represented the families of Kenyan suspects transferred to Uganda on allegations 
of involvement in the 11 July 2010 bombings in Kampala. 
</p>
<p>196. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>On 16 September 2010, the Ugandan police arrested the two Kenyan human 
rights defenders at the Entebbe International Airport. Both men were travelling to 
Kampala for the court hearing of Kenyan suspects arrested in connection with the 
bombings that killed 70 people in Kampala on 11 July 2010.  
</p>
<p>According to reports received, the two human rights defenders were 
transferred to the Rapid Response Unit headquarters in Kireka, a suburb of 
Kampala, where they were reportedly held incommunicado and had no access to a 
lawyer.  
</p>
<p>It was reported that, on 18 September 2010, Mr. Mbugua Mureithi had been 
released from police custody in Kampala and immediately expelled to Kenya. Mr. 
Al-Amin Kimathi had reportedly been held incommunicado at the Ugandan police&#8217;s 
Rapid Response Unit Headquarters in Kireka, Kampala, without charges or access to 
legal representation, until 21 September. On this date, Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi was 
brought before a judge and remanded to the Luzira Maximum Security Prison on 
charges of murder and attempted murder as well as terrorism-related charges in 
connection with the bombings that took place in Kampala in July 2010. 
</p>
<p>Due to their arrest, detention and, in the case of Mr. Mureithi, expulsion, the 
two men had not had a chance to meet with their clients, who were charged with 
offences including murder and terrorism, punishable by death under Ugandan law. 
The court case involving their clients had continued in their absence. 
</p>
<p>197. Concern was expressed at the arrest of Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi and Mr. Mbugua 
Mureithi and at allegations received that their arrest could have been linked to their work, 
respectively as human rights lawyer and in denouncing and documenting unlawful practices 
by the authorities in counter-terrorism operations. Further concern was expressed about 
allegations indicating that Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi had had no access to a lawyer since the 
time of his arrest and until he was remanded to the Luzira Maximum Security Prison.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>49 
</b></p>
<p>198.  The mandate holders appealed to the Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee their right not to be deprived arbitrarily of their liberty and to fair proceedings 
before an independent and impartial tribunal, in accordance with articles 9 and 10 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 9 and 14 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights. They also referred the Government to the Basic Principles on 
the Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of 
Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990, and 
in particular principles 16, which stipulates that Governments shall ensure that lawyers (a) 
are able to perform all of their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, 
harassment or improper interference; (b) are able to travel and to consult with their clients 
freely both within their own country and abroad; and (c) shall not suffer, or be threatened 
with, prosecution or administrative, economic or other sanctions for any action taken in 
accordance with recognized professional duties, standards and ethics. Furthermore, they 
drew the attention of the Government to principle 18, which provides that lawyers shall not 
be identified with their clients or their clients&#8217; causes as a result of discharging their 
functions. 
</p>
<p>199. The mandate holders also stressed that the principle of legality in criminal law, 
enshrined in several international human rights instruments such as article 15 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and made non-derogable in times of 
public emergency, implies that the requirement of criminal liability is limited to clear and 
precise provisions in the law, so as to respect the principle of certainty of the law and 
ensure that it is not subject to interpretation which would broaden the scope of the 
proscribed conduct. In their view, at the national level, the specificity of terrorist crimes is 
defined by the presence of two cumulative conditions: (1) The means used, which can be 
described as deadly or otherwise serious violence against members of the general 
population or segments of it, or the taking of hostages; and (2) the intent, which is to cause 
fear among the population or the destruction of public order or to compel the government or 
an international organization to doing or refraining from doing something, in the 
advancement of a political, religious or ideological cause. It is only when these two 
conditions are fulfilled that an act may be criminalized as terrorist. 
</p>
<p>200. The mandate holders further referred the Government to the fundamental principles 
set forth in the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and 
Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms, and in particular articles 1 and 2 which state that &#8220;everyone has the 
right individually or in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection 
and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international 
levels&#8221; and that &#8220;each State has a prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote and 
implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting such steps as 
may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social, economic, political and 
other fields, as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its 
jurisdiction, individually and in association with others, are able to enjoy all those rights 
and freedoms in practice&#8221;. They also brought to the attention of the Government the 
following provisions of the Declaration: article 9, para. 3, point c) which provides that 
everyone has the right, individually and in association with others to offer and provide 
professionally qualified legal assistance or other relevant advice and assistance in defending 
human rights and fundamental freedoms; and article 12, paras 2 and 3 of the Declaration 
which provide that the State shall take all necessary measures to ensure the protection by 
the competent authorities of everyone, individually and in association with others, against 
any violence, threats, retaliation, de facto or de jure adverse discrimination, pressure or any 
other arbitrary action as a consequence of his or her legitimate exercise of the rights 
referred to in the Declaration. In this connection, everyone is entitled, individually and in 
association with others, to be protected effectively under national law in reacting against or </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>50</b> 
</p>
<p>opposing, through peaceful means, activities and acts, including those by omission, 
attributable to States that result in violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as 
well as acts of violence perpetrated by groups or individuals that affect the enjoyment of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms.  
</p>
<p>201. Inter alia, the mandate holders requested information on the reason for the arrest and 
detention of Mr. Mbugua Mureithi and Mr. Al-Amin Kimathi, and to specify the charges 
brought against Mr. Kimathi. They further requested that the Government provide 
information regarding the allegations that Mr. Kimathi had had no access to a lawyer since 
the time of his arrest and until he was remanded to the Luzira Maximum Security Prison 
and on the basis for the expulsion of Mr. Mbugua Mureithi to Kenya, in particular whether 
any anti-terrorism related legislation was invoked. Finally, they asked what measures had 
been taken, if any, to protect the work of human rights defenders in the country, including 
lawyers.  
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>202. As at 31 December 2010, there had been no response by the Government of Uganda 
to the mandate holders&#8217; joint urgent appeal. 
</p>
<p><b> N.  United States of America 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1.  Communication to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>203. On 27 April 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Rapporteur 
on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent a letter to 
the Government of the United States of America, advising it that the mandate holders had 
been approached by third parties in the case of <b>Omar Khadr</b>, a Canadian citizen, who was 
understood to still be detained at Guant&#225;namo Bay. Omar Khadr was 15 years old when he 
was arrested and 16 years at the time he was transferred to Guant&#225;namo Bay. Information 
received indicated that Mr. Khadr had been subjected to prolonged and severe sleep 
deprivation by U.S. officials in order to enhance the extraction of information from him 
during interrogations conducted also by Canadian officials in 2004 when he was 17 years 
old. Military commission proceedings against Mr. Khadr were scheduled to recommence in 
July 2010 at Guant&#225;namo Bay.  
</p>
<p>204. In a 29 January 2010 decision, the Supreme Court of Canada reasoned that 
violations of Mr. Khadr&#8217;s rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were 
ongoing as the information obtained by Canadian officials during the course of their 
interrogations, conducted when Mr. Khadr was a minor without access to legal counsel or 
habeas corpus and had been subjected to improper treatment by the U.S. authorities at the 
time of the interview in March 2004, may form part of the case upon which he was held.  
</p>
<p>205. The Special Rapporteur remained seriously concerned that Mr. Khadr will continue 
to be tried in military commission proceedings that do not adhere to international fair trial 
standards. 
</p>
<p>206. They referred to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on his mission to the United States 
of America (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3) that highlighted serious situations of incompatibility 
between the international human rights obligations and the counter-terrorism law and 
practice of the United States. Concerns highlighted in that report relate particularly to the 
use of military commissions to try terrorist suspects (A/HRC/6/17/Add.3, paras. 19-32).  
</p>
<p>207. While noting the Government&#8217;s efforts to address some of the concerns outlined in 
report A/HRC/6/17/Add.3 by the adoption of the 2009 Military Commissions Act 
(henceforth 2009 MCA), the mandate holders reiterated their continuing preoccupations </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>51 
</b></p>
<p>with the impact of the amended Act on the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms which mainly relate to 1) the jurisdiction of military commissions, 2) their 
composition, 3) the use of evidence, 4) the limited scope of the appellate review, and 5) the 
death penalty. They understood that the last-mentioned item does not apply in the case of 
Mr Khadr. 
</p>
<p>208. First, according to &#167; 948c of the 2009 MCA, &#8220;any alien unprivileged enemy 
belligerent&#8221; is subject to trial by military commissions. While noting that the term of 
&#8220;unlawful enemy combatant&#8221; was abandoned by the amended Act, the definition of &#8220;alien 
unprivileged enemy belligerent&#8221;, as contained in &#167; 948a (7) of the MCA, does not exclude 
the possibility of civilians being tried by military commissions. Furthermore, as already 
highlighted in the above-mentioned report, offences listed in &#167; 950v (24)-(29) of the 2009 
MCA (terrorism, providing material support for terrorism, wrongfully aiding the enemy, 
spying and conspiracy) go beyond offences under the law of war. In addition, the amended 
Act did not address the serious concern of the retroactive applicability of criminal law by 
military commissions, to the extent that the offences listed had not been covered by the law 
applicable at the time of the commission of the actual acts, which is in breach of article 15 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and universally 
acknowledged principles of law. 
</p>
<p>209. Second, given that the provisions for the composition of military commissions were 
not amended in substance, the Special Rapporteurs reiterated their concern about the lack of 
independence and impartiality, including the lack of appearance of impartiality of the 
commissions, which mainly result from the principle that members in a military 
commission are selected for each trial by the convening authority, which forms part of the 
executive branch, and the fact that there was still no prohibition against the selection of 
members of a commission who fall within the same chain of command. 
</p>
<p>210. However, some positive development could be contained in &#167; 948k (c) (2) of the 
2009 MCA which provides that the Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations for the 
appointment and performance of defense counsel in capital cases. Depending on the content 
of these regulations, this amendment may somewhat strengthen the role of the defense in 
capital punishment cases which call for rigorous adherence to fair trial guarantees. 
However, at the same time this feature of the 2009 MCA again highlights the fact that the 
applicable law is being drafted several years after the facts and possibly tailored to address 
specific known cases. 
</p>
<p>211. Third, the mandate holders welcomed the important amendments made in relation to 
the exclusion of statements by the accused (&#167; 948r of the 2009 MCA). In comparison to the 
2006 MCA that only excluded statements obtained by torture, the amended provisions 
exclude &#8220;any statement obtained by the use of torture or by cruel, inhuman, or degrading 
treatment, as defined by section 1003 of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005&#8221; to be 
admissible in a military commission. Furthermore, &#167; 948r (c) (2) (B) of the 2009 MCA 
requires in relation to other statements, that the statement be made &#8220;voluntarily&#8221;. The 
Special Rapporteurs noted that in the determination of the &#8220;voluntariness&#8221;, the military 
judge is required to consider the circumstances defined in &#167; 948r (d) of the 2009 MCA. It 
should, however, be noted that this new &#8220;voluntariness&#8221; protection contained in the new Act 
is subject to exceptions regarding statements made at the point of capture or during closely 
related active combat engagement, provided the interest of justice be best served by 
admission of the statement into evidence. 
</p>
<p>212. The Special Rapporteurs regretted that hearsay evidence is still admissible under &#167; 
949a (b) (3) (d) of the 2009 MCA, noting, nonetheless, that this applies now within stricter 
limits than previously under the 2006 MCA.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>52</b> 
</p>
<p>213. Regarding classified information, they welcomed the amendment made in &#167; 949p-1 
(b) of the 2009 MCA that prescribes that any information admitted into evidence pursuant 
to any rule, procedure, or order by the military judge shall be provided to the accused which 
is likely to strengthen the equality of arms in the proceedings.  
</p>
<p>214. Last, the mandate holders referred to &#167; 950g (d) of the 2009 MCA, which provides 
that the scope of review applies only to the findings and sentences as approved by the 
convening authority and as affirmed or set aside as incorrect in law by the United States 
Court of Military Commission Review. Furthermore, pursuant to this amended provision, 
the exclusive appellate jurisdiction (&#167; 950g (a) of the 2009 MCA), the United States Court 
of Appeals for the District of Colombia Circuit, shall take action only with respect to 
matters of law. While the Special Rapporteurs positively noted the explicit inclusion of the 
&#8216;sufficiency of evidence to support the verdict&#8217; within the scope of review, they remained 
concerned that the limitation of appeal rights subsequent to conviction remain limited to 
matters of law, which is incompatible with article 14, paragraph 5, of the ICCPR.  
</p>
<p>215. In sum, concerns highlighted above let the mandate holders conclude that, while 
several improvements had been made in comparison to the 2006 MCA, the 2009 MCA still 
contains provisions which may have a significant negative impact on the enjoyment of 
human rights, in particular international fair trial guarantees.  
</p>
<p>216. Applied to the case of Omar Khadr, the above mentioned concerns were exacerbated 
by the fact that he was a minor at the time of the commission of the alleged offence and of 
the interrogation that had taken place in 2004.  
</p>
<p>217. In view of the above and Mr. Khadr&#8217;s prolonged and abusive detention at 
Guant&#225;namo Bay that contravenes the legal obligations of the United States under various 
international instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (CAT), the mandate holders urged that the charges brought against Mr. Khadr 
in the military commissions proceedings be dropped and he be repatriated to Canada or 
transferred to a U.S. federal court for prosecution in accordance with international fair trial 
standards. In particular, no information extracted by torture or other forms of cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment may be used in these proceedings, as 
stipulated by Article 15 CAT and Article 7 ICCPR. 
</p>
<p>218. The Special Rapporteurs wished to express our deep interest that the violations of 
Mr. Omar Khadr&#8217;s rights come promptly to an end and that he be provided with 
compensation for any violations experienced, in accordance with international standards. 
They highlighted their availability for consultations on this matter. 
</p>
<p>219. As the case of Mr. Khadr also relates to Canada, the Government of the United 
States of America was informed that the mandate holders shared their concerns with the 
Canadian Government in a separate letter. 
</p>
<p>220. <i>Acknowledgements.</i> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the subsequent invitation, 
by letter dated 2 August 2010, from the Government to observe the trial phase of the 
Military Commission proceedings against Omar Khadr. As a plea arrangement was reached 
on 13 October 2010 and the trial was reduced to sentencing hearings during the week of 25 
October 2010, the Special Rapporteur chose not to follow this invitation. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>221. By letter dated 30 June 2010, the Government of the United States responded to a 
joint urgent appeal sent on 2 October 2009 by the Special Rapporteur, together with the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the then Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>53 
</b></p>
<p>regarding the case of Mr. <b>Mustafa Setmariam Nassar </b>(see A/HRC/13/37/Add.1, para. 
125). In response, the Government indicated that while it is not in a position to comment on 
the specific allegations referred to, it would like to take this opportunity to emphasise that 
the United States is committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all individuals at home and abroad and to share specific steps 
taken by the Obama administration that relate to the broader concerns expressed in the 
correspondence. 
</p>
<p>222. During his second full day in office, President Obama issued three Executive Orders 
providing for comprehensive review and reform of U.S. detention, interrogation and 
transfer policies. These Executive Orders reaffirmed that all persons in U.S. custody must 
be treated humanely as a matter of law. For example, it is required that the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) be given notice and timely access to any individual 
detained in any armed conflict in the custody or under the effective control of the United 
States Government, consistent with Department of Defense regulations and policies. 
</p>
<p>223. One of the orders, Executive Order 13491, created a Special Task Force on 
Interrogation and Transfer Policies. Following a review of U.S. transfer policies, on 24 
August 2009, the Task Force made a number of recommendations to the President in order 
to ensure that U.S. transfer practices comply with the domestic laws, international 
obligations, and policies of the United States and do not result in the transfer of individuals 
to other nations to face torture or otherwise to undermine or circumvent the obligations of 
the United States to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in its custody or control. 
These recommendations have been accepted by the President. 
</p>
<p>224. As President Obama reiterated to the General Assembly in September [2009], 
&#8220;living our values doesn&#8217;t make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes us stronger.&#8221; We 
look forward to continuing to work closely with U.N. Member States and to remaining in 
an open dialogue with the Special Procedures mandate holders to advance this collective 
goal. 
</p>
<p><b> 3.  Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>225. On 5 February 2010, the Special Rapporteur addressed a letter of allegation to the 
Government of the United States of America regarding Messrs. <b>Umar Farooq</b>, <b>Waqar 
Khan</b>, <b>Ahmed Minni</b>, <b>Aman Hassan Yemer</b> and <b>Ramy Zamzam</b>, all United States 
citizens, aged between 19 and 24, who were allegedly detained on suspicion of terrorism in 
the city of Sarghoda in Pakistan. The Government was informed that a letter on this case 
was also being sent to the Government of Pakistan. 
</p>
<p>226. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>The five men reportedly travelled to Pakistan in November 2009, from their 
homes in the northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., area. They were arrested on 7 
December 2009 in Sarghoda, Punjab Province, and had been charged with plotting 
terror attacks in Pakistan as well as with having links to Al-Qaida and seeking to 
join militants fighting United States troops across the border in Afghanistan. The 
most serious of the charges was conspiracy to carry out a terrorist act, which could 
carry life imprisonment depending on what the act is. 
</p>
<p>United States Assistant Secretary of State Philip Crowley reportedly said that 
Pakistani authorities contacted the United States embassy in Islamabad following the 
arrests. He further appeared to have said that an embassy team, including at least one 
agent from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and an officer from the State 
Department&#8217;s regional security office, met the five detainees. Confirming that &#8220;... we 
are trying to talk to them, find out ... what they were up to, what the implications 
are&#8221;, Crowley, furthermore, stated that &#8220;we should let the investigation go forward </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>54</b> 
</p>
<p>before we draw any conclusions.&#8221; Similarly, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 
earlier told reporters that United States officials had &#8220;had access&#8221; to the five. It 
remained unclear whether the United States Government will negotiate with 
Islamabad for the purpose of having the five men extradited or returned to the 
United States. 
</p>
<p>Allegedly, the five American citizens confessed their intention to carry out 
&#8220;jihad&#8221; and to fight against the war on terror. Following their appearance before a 
special antiterrorism court during a closed session on 18 January 2010, the men 
reportedly shouted out allegations of having been subjected to torture before being 
transported back to the prison. According to reports, a court order from the same 
court session confirmed that the men in question &#8220;made a complaint that they have 
been tortured in the custody of police&#8221; and that, consequently, the judge ordered a 
medical examination for the men. Allegedly, none of them was allowed to be 
represented by their lawyer of own choice. 
</p>
<p>227. The Special Rapporteur underlined that General Assembly resolution 59/191, in its 
paragraph 1, stresses that: &#8220;States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism 
complies with their obligations under international law, in particular international human 
rights, refugee and humanitarian law&#8221;, as do Security Council resolutions 1456 (2003) and 
1624 (2005), in paragraphs 6 and 4 respectively. 
</p>
<p>228. He further recalled in particular the non-derogable nature of the prohibition against 
torture or any other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as established in 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Human Rights Committee in 
its General Comment on states of emergency (article 4 of the Covenant) has, furthermore, 
established that there is a close connection between the prohibition of torture in article 7 
and the right of all persons deprived of their liberty to human treatment and respect for the 
inherent dignity of the human person as established in article 10 (1) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In relation to this, the Human Rights Committee 
has interpreted article 10 (1) as a norm of international law that is not subject to derogation.  
Furthermore, with regard to the right to a fair trial, article 14 (3) of the Covenant establishes 
a number of minimum guarantees, which shall be granted to every person charged of a 
crime, and thereby, in section (g) stipulates that no one shall be compelled to testify against 
himself or to confess guilt. Hence, any direct or indirect physical or undue psychological 
pressure on the accused for these purposes constitutes a violation of this right, and 
consequently the Human Rights Committee states that &#8220;it is unacceptable to treat an 
accused person in a manner contrary to article 7 of the Covenant in order to extract a 
confession&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> 4.  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>229. By letter dated 30 June 2010, the Government of the United States responded to the 
letter of allegation dated 5 February 2010, indicating that the United States is committed to 
the promotion of human rights at home and abroad. Therefore, it shares the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s concern that all persons deprived of their liberty be treated humanely. As 
President Obama has said, &#8220;we need not sacrifice our security for our values, nor sacrifice 
our values for our security.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>230. The Government is well aware of the situation involving these American citizens 
and has worked consistently to provide them every available consular assistance and 
service. It notes that the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s correspondence contains allegations related 
to torture and access to legal counsel. The United States takes seriously all reports of abuse 
and torture and has raised those reports with officials from the Government of Pakistan. It 
has also visited the prisoners regularly throughout their detention, and consular staff has 
been present at the U.S. citizens&#8217; hearings. With regard to the five individuals&#8217; access to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>55 
</b></p>
<p>legal counsel consular officers routinely provide a list of attorneys qualified to assist U.S. 
citizens in local legal proceedings during consular visits to detained U.S. citizens overseas. 
It has been publicly reported that all five individuals are represented by private attorneys in 
the ongoing legal proceedings in Pakistan. The Government stated that the Special 
Rapporteur can appreciate that privacy considerations preclude it from discussing further 
details related to this case. 
</p>
<p>231. With respect to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s inquiry regarding U.S. law enforcement, 
the Government cannot provide detailed information regarding an open law enforcement 
matter, including information regarding circumstances under which any U.S. law 
enforcement personnel may have the opportunity to question individuals. The Government 
can, however, confirm that the United States is in full compliance with its international 
obligations and domestic law concerning treatment of the five individuals named in the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter. Specifically, pursuant to international treaties to which it is a 
party and its domestic law, U.S. officials are prohibited from engaging in torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment both within and outside the territory 
of the United States. 
</p>
<p><b> 5.  Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>232. On 23 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Rapporteur 
on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent a joint 
urgent appeal to the Government of the United States of America regarding the repatriation 
to Algeria of one man, <b>Mr. Abdul Aziz Naji, </b>from a group of six men of Algerian 
nationality being held at the U.S. Military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, since 2002. The 
Government&#8217;s attention was drawn to the fact that their situation had already been the 
object of a communication sent by the then Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment to the Government on 16 July 2010.  
</p>
<p>233. According to new information received: 
</p>
<p>Mr. Abdul Aziz Naji was repatriated against his will to Algeria where he 
would have reportedly faced a real and serious risk of being subject to torture or ill-
treatment. The risk would allegedly come from Algerian security services and non-
State actors. This was reportedly the first involuntary transfer of a detainee out of 
Guantanamo by the Obama administration.   
</p>
<p>234. Concern was expressed about the physical and psychological integrity of Mr. Abdul 
Aziz Naji. The mandate holders stressed that each Government has the obligation to protect 
the right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment. They sought clarification from the Government 
whether the Government had used diplomatic assurances provided by the Algerian 
authorities instead of, or as part of, the risk assessment for the repatriation of Mr. Abdul 
Aziz Naji. They further requested an indication on how the Government intended to 
effectively monitor the compliance of such assurances on the part of the Algerian 
authorities, and on how this repatriation was in conformity with the principle of non-
refoulement as provided for by international law. The mandate holders also asked for 
details of any investigation and judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case.  
</p>
<p><b> 6.  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>235. By a letter dated 13 August 2010, the Government of the United States responded to 
the joint urgent appeal of 23 July 2010, and also to the communication sent by the then 
Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>56</b> 
</p>
<p>punishment to the Government on 16 July 2010. It reiterated its deep commitment to 
ensuring that transfers from Guantanamo conform to its post-transfer humane treatment 
policies and welcomed this opportunity to respond. On his second full day in office, 
President Obama ordered Guantanamo closed. His commitment to doing so has not 
wavered, even as closing Guantanamo has proven to be an arduous and painstaking process. 
A task force comprised of representatives from six federal agencies scrupulously 
considered each Guantanamo detainee&#8217;s case to assess whether the detainee could be 
transferred or repatriated consistent with U.S. national security, the interests of justice, and 
the Government&#8217;s policy not to transfer individuals to countries where they would more 
likely than not face torture or, in appropriate cases, where the individual has a well-founded 
fear of persecution. The United States considers detainee transfers on a case-by-case basis, 
taking into account a wide variety of information from a range of sources - including 
submissions received from the detainee and/or his counsel - regarding the particular 
circumstances of the transfer, the proposed receiving country (including both its general 
human rights record and its record in handling previously-transferred detainees), the 
individual concerned and any concerns about serious mistreatment that may arise in the 
context of the transfer, whether form Governmental or private actors. 
</p>
<p>236. Since the beginning of the Obama Administration, the United States has transferred 
64 detainees to 25 different destinations. More than half of these 64 detainees were resettled 
in third countries because the U.S. Department of State, working together with the other 
five agencies, determined that they could not be returned to their country of origin due to 
humane treatment concerns. The Government is not aware of any credible reports of 
mistreatment occurring in the aftermath of any of these transfers. 
</p>
<p>237. The United States has applied the aforementioned policies and practices in 
determining whether particular Algerian detainees held at Guantanamo could be 
appropriately repatriated to Algeria. Due to restrictions related to litigation involving some 
of these individuals, the Government limits its discussion here to the cases of Abdul Aziz 
Naji and Saiid Farhi. Both individuals alleged generalized fears of mistreatment by either 
the Government of Algeria or terrorist groups in Algeria. In considering whether these fears 
were credible, the United States considered not only the claims asserted by these two 
individuals, but also whether there were any credible allegations of serious mistreatment 
related to past transfers to Algeria. In particular, the Government considered the fact that 
ten detainees previously have been repatriated from Guantanamo to Algeria without any 
credible allegations brought to our attention of post-transfer mistreatment, and that neither 
Mr. Naji nor Mr. Farhi presented treatment concerns in a manner that suggested any 
particularized likelihood of harm that would set their cases apart from the previously 
repatriated Algerian detainees. Upon reviewing and considering all of the concerns they 
raised in this context, the United States concluded that both Mr. Naji and Mr. Farhi could 
be repatriated consistent with the aforementioned policies on post-transfer humane 
treatment. 
</p>
<p>238. Both Mr. Naji and Mr. Farhi filed several motions in U.S. federal courts to stop their 
transfer to Algeria. Mr. Naji&#8217;s motions were considered and denied by two U.S. federal 
district court judges, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. 
Circuit), and the U.S. Supreme Court. Mr. Farhi, sought and obtained from the district court 
an injunction barring his transfer to Algeria, but the D.C. Circuit reversed that decision, and 
the U.S. Supreme court declined to block his transfer. In reaching these decisions, the 
courts have relied upon the policy of the United States not to transfer detainees where it 
determines that they are more likely than not to be tortured, and the determination of the 
Department of State that Mr. Naji and Mr. Farhi can be repatriated to Algeria consistent 
with that policy. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>57 
</b></p>
<p>239. The United States transferred Mr. Naji to the custody of the Government of Algeria 
on 18 July 2010. He was held for questioning in accordance with Algerian law, which 
allows terrorism suspects to be held in detention for up to twelve days before appearing in 
court. Reports that Mr. Naji has been indicted are inaccurate. He was released on 25 July 
after appearing before a magistrate, who opened criminal proceedings against Mr. Naji and 
ordered that the report to the local police station on a weekly basis pending further 
investigation of this case. As indicated in numerous press reports, as well as a statement 
issued by his lawyers, Mr. Naji is at home with his family. He has indicated that he was 
treated well by the Government of Algeria during the initial period of detention. Mr. Farhi 
currently remains at Guantanamo. 
</p>
<p>240. The United States has and will continue to apply its post-transfer humane treatment 
policies to all detainee transfers, including any future transfers to Algeria. In the event the 
Government determines that a particular Algerian national cannot be appropriately 
repatriated to Algeria consistent with these policies, either because of information that 
comes to light about the general treatment of transferred Guantanamo detainees, or because 
of particularized concerns, then the repatriation will not occur until such concerns are 
addressed.  
</p>
<p><b> 7.  Communication sent to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>241. On 26 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the Special 
Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, sent 
a letter of allegation to the Government of the United States of America concerning 
information they had received, which originated from the Government&#8217;s own files, and had 
become publicly dubbed &#8220;the Wikileaks Iraq War logs&#8221; relating to the alleged complicity in 
the torture and ill-treatment of Iraqi citizens by forces of United States of America in Iraq. 
The mandate holders informed the Government that they had addressed a similar letter to 
the Government of Iraq. 
</p>
<p>242. According to the information received: 
</p>
<p>There was extensive abuse of detainees by Iraqi security forces over a five-
year period between 2004 and 2009. United States authorities had knowledge of the 
systematic use of torture and other ill-treatment by Coalition, Iraqi and private 
security officials; and, in most cases, failed to intervene to prevent and/or investigate 
hundreds of reports of systematic abuse and torture. The information also suggested 
that such acts were conducted with impunity and appeared to go normally 
unpunished. The information contained allegations that US forces acting under 
&#8220;fragmentary orders,&#8221; &#8220;Frago 242&#8221; and &#8220;Frago 039&#8221; were required to make no 
intervention in cases of abuse and/or torture involving Iraqis if the US troops were 
not initially involved. The orders also required US forces to report abuse to the US 
command but not to conduct any further investigation or take any further action to 
stop abuse or torture unless instructed to do so by higher order.  
</p>
<p>The mandate holders drew the Government&#8217;s attention to three examples 
from &#8220;the war logs&#8221; as illustrations of several hundred allegations of systematic 
torture and ill-treatment recorded by US personnel.

<p>In addition, information had been received that thousands of Iraqi nationals 
who had been detained by US forces were handed over from US to Iraqi custody 
between early 2009 and July 2010 under a November 2008 US-Iraq agreement that 
contains no provisions for safeguarding the detainees&#8217; physical and mental integrity 
after the transfer. Article 4(3) of the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), taking 
effect at midnight on 31 December 2008, only states in broad terms that: &#8220;It is the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>59 
</b></p>
<p>duty of the United States Forces to respect the laws, customs, and traditions of Iraq 
and applicable international law.&#8221; Many of the detainees transferred into Iraqi 
custody are suspected of terrorism-related offences on the basis of the 2005 Iraqi 
Anti-Terrorism Law. 
</p>
<p>243. The mandate holders stressed that each Government has the obligation to protect the 
right to physical and mental integrity of all persons. This right is set forth inter alia in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment. They were concerned that the US authorities handed over 
thousands of detainees to Iraqi security forces who US authorities knew were continuing to 
torture and abuse detainees. They drew the Government&#8217;s attention to paragraph 1 of 
Human Rights Council Resolution 8/8 which &#8220;Condemns all forms of torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which are and shall remain 
prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls 
upon all Governments to implement fully the prohibition of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; The Special Rapporteurs recalled the 
obligations of the Government under article 1 of the Convention against Torture which not 
only prohibits torture and requires States to refrain from acts of torture but also place an 
obligation to &#8216;prevent acts of torture&#8217;.  
</p>
<p>244. Additionally, the mandate holders pointed out that the United Nations Committee 
against Torture has stated that &#8220;if a person is to be transferred or sent to the custody or 
control of an individual or institution known to have engaged in torture or ill-treatment, or 
has not implemented adequate safeguards, the State is responsible, and its officials subject 
to punishment for ordering, permitting or participating in this transfer contrary to the 
State&#8217;s obligation to take effective measures to prevent torture in accordance with article 2, 
paragraph 1. The Committee has expressed its concern when States parties send persons to 
such places without due process of law as required by articles 2 and 3.&#8221; (General Comment 
No. 2, 24 January 2008, UN Doc. CAT/C/GC/2, para.19). Similarly, they drew the 
Government&#8217;s attention to article 6 of the Convention against Torture, which requires State 
Parties to establish their jurisdiction over acts of torture if they are committed in any 
territory under its jurisdiction; when the alleged offender is a national of that State and 
when the victim is a national of that State if that State considers it appropriate. It also 
requires State Parties to establish their jurisdiction over acts of torture in cases where the 
alleged offender is present in their territory. Article 7 goes on to provide that State Parties 
must either extradite alleged offenders or submit the case to its competent authorities for 
the purpose of prosecution. 
</p>
<p>245. With regard to fragmentary orders 242 and 039, the mandate holders were concerned 
that US officials failed to investigate thousands of cases of abuse, torture, rape and murder. 
They drew the Government&#8217;s attention to article 12 of the Convention against Torture, 
which requires the competent authorities to undertake a prompt and impartial investigation 
wherever there are reasonable grounds to believe that torture has been committed, and 
article 7 of the Convention against Torture, which requires State parties to prosecute 
suspected perpetrators of torture, as well as to paragraph 6b of Human Rights Council 
Resolution 8/8. Further, under the Fourth Geneva Convention, the US is required to provide 
effective penal sanctions for grave breaches such as torture or inhuman treatment and to 
&#8220;take measures necessary for the suppression of all [other] acts contrary to the provisions of 
[GC IV]&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>246.  Additionally, the Government&#8217;s attention was drawn to General Comment No. 2 of 
the United Nations Committee against Torture which reiterates that &#8220;where State authorities 
or others acting in official capacity or under colour of law, know or have reasonable 
grounds to believe that acts of torture or ill-treatment are being committed by non-State </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>60</b> 
</p>
<p>officials or private actors and they fail to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, 
prosecute and punish such non-State officials or private actors consistently with the 
Convention, the State bears responsibility and its officials should be considered as authors, 
complicit or otherwise responsible under the Convention for consenting to or acquiescing in 
such impermissible acts. Since the failure of the State to exercise due diligence to intervene 
to stop, sanction and provide remedies to victims of torture facilitates and enables non-State 
actors to commit acts impermissible under the Convention with impunity, the State&#8217;s 
indifference or inaction provides a form of encouragement and/or de facto permission.&#8221; 
(General Comment No. 2, 24 January 2008, UN Doc. CAT/C/GC/2, para.18). 
</p>
<p>247. The mandate holders further recalled article 2(2) of the Convention against Torture, 
which provides that no exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a 
threat of war, internal political in stability or any other public emergency, may be invoked 
as a justification of torture. It was noted that paragraph 2 of Resolution 8/8 of the Human 
Rights Council &#8220;Condemns in particular any action or attempt by States or public officials 
to legalize, authorize or acquiesce in torture under any circumstances, including on grounds 
of national security or through judicial decisions.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>248.  With regards to the information that US forces witnessed and documented torture by 
Iraqi force, the Human Rights Committee has systematically recognised the extraterritorial 
application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights for cases of effective 
control over foreign territory. In its previous Concluding Observations concerning the 
United States, the Committee recommended that &#8220;[t]he State party should review its 
approach and interpret the Covenant in good faith, in accordance with the ordinary meaning 
to be given to its terms in their context, including subsequent practice, and in the light of its 
object and purpose. The State party should in particular (a) acknowledge the applicability 
of the Covenant with respect to individuals under its jurisdiction but outside its territory, as 
well as its applicability in time of war; (b) take positive steps, when necessary, to ensure the 
full implementation of all rights prescribed by the Covenant; and (c) consider in good faith 
the interpretation of the Covenant provided by the Committee pursuant to its mandate.&#8221; 
(UN Doc. CCPR/C/USA/CO/3/Rev.1, 18 December 2006, para. 10). In its General 
Comment No. 31, the Committee stated that &#8216;a State Party must respect and ensure the 
rights [&#8230;] to anyone within the power or effective control of that state party, even if not 
situated within the territory of the state party.&#8217; It continues by saying that &#8216;this principle also 
applies to those within the power or effective control of the forces of a state party acting 
outside its territory, regardless of the circumstances in which such power or effective 
control was obtained.&#8217; (General Comment No. 31, 29 March 2004, UN Doc. 
CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13, para.10).  
</p>
<p>249. The mandate holders urged the Government to take all necessary measures to 
guarantee that the rights and freedoms of the aforementioned persons, whose identities 
could not be established, and of several hundreds of others whose allegations of systematic 
torture and ill-treatment have been recorded by US personnel, are respected and that 
accountability of any person guilty of the alleged violations is ensured. They requested 
information from the Government, inter alia, on measures taken to suppress the commission 
of torture and other ill-treatment by US, Coalition or Iraqi forces, including on action such 
as interventions, investigations or prosecution of acts of torture or ill-treatment alleged in 
the communication. Additionally, it was asked to provide clarification about alleged 
&#8220;fragmentary orders&#8221; requiring US forces to take no actions in cases involving torture or 
where there has been an allegation of torture, if US forces are not initially involved. 
Further, the Special Rapporteurs asked about measures taken by the Government to 
investigate or prosecute members of the US forces who were alleged to have committed or 
been complicit in the commission of torture and of those authorities who instructed or 
allowed the US military personnel to transfer detainees to Iraqi jurisdiction in spite of 
knowing that those detainees would run a high risk of being tortured. Finally, they </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/51/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>61 
</b></p>
<p>requested information on measures taken to address concerns that US forces handed over 
detainees to Iraqi custody despite a clear risk of torture. 
</p>
<p><b> 8.  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>250. As at 31 December 2010, there had been no response by the Government of the 
United States of America to the mandate holders&#8217; communication of 26 November 2010. 
</p>
<p><b> 9.  Press statement 
</b></p>
<p>251. On 21 July 2010, the Special Rapporteur, together with the then Special Rapporteur 
on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, issued a press 
statement on their concerns about the fate of Guant&#225;namo detainees and called on the 
Obama administration to ensure that it does not forcibly transfer anyone to another State 
where the person could be subject to torture. They expressed their worries that the lives of 
two Algerian detainees could be put in danger without a proper assessment of the risks they 
could face if returned against their will to their country of origin, drawing attention to two 
decisions by the US Supreme Court, which had paved the way for the transfer of two of the 
Algerian detainees held at Guant&#225;namo Base, Cuba. They continued by appreciating the 
efforts of the authorities to close the Guant&#225;namo detention facility, however, stressed that 
the risk assessment should be a meaningful and fair process, and that courts should be part 
of it. Both detainees feared that, if returned to Algeria, they could be subject to torture or 
other forms of ill-treatment by the security services or non-State actors. These two men 
were part of a group of six Algerian nationals held in Guant&#225;namo, all in a similar situation.
