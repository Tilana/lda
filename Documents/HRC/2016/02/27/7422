<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights undertook an official visit to 
</p>
<p>Viet Nam from 18 to 29 November 2013 at the invitation of the Government. 
</p>
<p>The purpose of the visit was to assess, in a spirit of cooperation and dialogue, both 
</p>
<p>the achievements of Viet Nam and the challenges remaining in the implementation of 
</p>
<p>cultural rights, understood as rights of all persons to express their identity and to have 
</p>
<p>access to, participate in and contribute to cultural life, without hindrance or fear. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur focused on three issues, namely, history teaching, artistic freedoms and 
</p>
<p>the impact of development and tourism policies on the enjoyment of cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>Viet Nam has made remarkable progress towards achieving the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals and realizing a range of economic, social and cultural rights. In 
</p>
<p>particular, considerable efforts are under way to enlarge access to education and culture, 
</p>
<p>including in rural areas and remote regions. 
</p>
<p>The top-down approach in the design and implementation of government policies in 
</p>
<p>the area of culture, however, coupled with restrictions on the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>expression, are significant obstacles to the implementation of cultural rights in the country.

</p>
<p>Allowing a plurality of voices in history teaching and in the arts is necessary. There 
</p>
<p>is more space for the enjoyment of artistic freedoms in Viet Nam than in past decades; 
</p>
<p>however, many challenges remain, largely due to the multiplicity of regulations in the area 
</p>
<p>of artistic expression, which curtail artistic freedom, and a system of prior and post 
</p>
<p>censorship of the arts. 
</p>
<p>Many of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations are grounded in the principle 
</p>
<p>that communities should fully participate in all decision-making affecting them, in 
</p>
<p>particular in cultural heritage matters. Their participation in the identification, 
</p>
<p>interpretation, development and management of cultural heritage should be ensured, and 
</p>
<p>government policies should unequivocally support an informed, open and participatory 
</p>
<p>debate with and within communities.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural 
</p>
<p>rights visited Viet Nam from 18 to 29 November 2013. She visited Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh 
</p>
<p>City, Hoi An and Sa Pa, as well as villages in the Da Nang, Quang Nam and Lao Cai 
</p>
<p>provinces. The Special Rapporteur met with government officials responsible for culture, 
</p>
<p>tourism, education, information and communication and ethnic minorities, at the national 
</p>
<p>and local levels, as well as officials from people&#8217;s committees and the Central Commission 
</p>
<p>for Propaganda and Education of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Viet 
</p>
<p>Nam. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur met representatives of the National 
</p>
<p>Assembly and various unions. She also met artists, academics, teachers, directors and staff 
</p>
<p>working in research institutes or cultural institutions, representatives of civil society, 
</p>
<p>members of ethnic communities, people involved in the tourism industry and 
</p>
<p>representatives of United Nations agencies.  
</p>
<p>2. Thorough discussions were held with all interlocutors on the successes and 
</p>
<p>challenges in implementing cultural rights in the country, particularly the rights of people to 
</p>
<p>enjoy the arts, to freedom of artistic expression and creativity, to manifest their cultural 
</p>
<p>identity and to access and enjoy their own cultural heritage and that of others. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur also addressed issues relating to history teaching in schools and the impact of 
</p>
<p>tourism on the enjoyment of cultural rights, with a view to assisting the Government and 
</p>
<p>other relevant actors in their efforts to address the challenges and obstacles in that context. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Viet Nam for its invitation, as 
</p>
<p>well as all the people she met, for their time and expertise. She regrets, however, that in 
</p>
<p>many instances, it proved difficult to speak to people freely, owing to the presence of 
</p>
<p>government officials. Many people preferred to meet with her discreetly, for fear of 
</p>
<p>reprisals. She encourages the Government to continue to invite special procedures to visit 
</p>
<p>the country, in accordance with the terms of reference for fact-finding missions by Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteurs (E/CN.4/1998/45, appendix V), and to allow people, in particular civil society 
</p>
<p>actors, to meet mandate holders freely, without fear of reprisals.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General context and framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International framework  
</b></p>
<p>4. Viet Nam is a party to United Nations instruments protecting cultural rights, 
</p>
<p>including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and to important United Nations 
</p>
<p>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) conventions, such as the 
</p>
<p>Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, the 
</p>
<p>Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage and the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions.  
</p>
<p>5. In recent years, Viet Nam has enhanced its cooperation with human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. It became a member of the Human Rights Council in 2014 and has regularly 
</p>
<p>invited special procedures to visit the country.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Constitutional and legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p>6. On 28 November 2013, during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, Viet Nam adopted its 
</p>
<p>new Constitution, which came into force on 1 January 2014.  
</p>
<p>7. The text of the new Constitution was substantively debated in Viet Nam. The draft, 
</p>
<p>which the Government had made publicly available, elicited over 26 million comments, 
</p>
<p>largely focused on chapter II relating to human and citizens&#8217; rights. The Constitutional 
</p>
<p>Drafting Committee carefully studied those inputs before submitting the text to the National 
</p>
<p>Assembly. 
</p>
<p>8. Civil society interlocutors confirmed that certain consultation processes had been 
</p>
<p>put in place, which indicated the opening of some space for discussion. Some of the 
</p>
<p>greatest issues of contention around the draft Constitution were the leadership role 
</p>
<p>attributed to the Communist Party, possible restrictions on the enjoyment of human rights, 
</p>
<p>which were deemed to be too broad, and recognition of multiple forms of ownership of 
</p>
<p>land. &#8220;Petition 72&#8221;, which was signed by 72 intellectuals, scholars, writers and artists, drew 
</p>
<p>considerable attention to those issues. Publicly supported by 15,000 signatures, the petition 
</p>
<p>was officially submitted to the Constitutional Drafting Committee and circulated online.1  
</p>
<p>9. Despite their impact on the debate, many of the key proposals put forward in the 
</p>
<p>petition did not materialize in the new Constitution, which retains many features of the old 
</p>
<p>one unchanged, notably the absence of a multiparty system. Some advances should be 
</p>
<p>noted, however, and the Special Rapporteur hopes that the new constitutional framework 
</p>
<p>will facilitate enhanced implementation of human rights, in particular cultural rights,2 in 
</p>
<p>Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p>10. Chapter II of the new 2013 Constitution is entirely dedicated to human rights and 
</p>
<p>citizens&#8217; rights and duties, giving greater pre-eminence to human rights issues. Civil, 
</p>
<p>political, economic, social and cultural rights are included, in particular rights of significant 
</p>
<p>importance in the field of culture, such as the rights to freedom of expression and freedom 
</p>
<p>of religion, to education, to engage in artistic creation and to participate in cultural life.  
</p>
<p>11. Under article 14 (2) of the Constitution, human rights and citizen&#8217;s rights shall only 
</p>
<p>be restricted in imperative circumstances for reasons of national defence, national security, 
</p>
<p>social order and safety, social morality and community well-being. Article 15 (4) states that 
</p>
<p>the exercise of human rights and citizens&#8217; rights shall not infringe upon national interests 
</p>
<p>and the rights and legitimate interests of others. The undefined and broad reference to 
</p>
<p>&#8220;national interests&#8221; raises some concerns, for example that it may possibly allow 
</p>
<p>restrictions to human rights beyond those provided for in international standards. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur hopes that those provisions will be interpreted in a restrictive manner 
</p>
<p>and in accordance with international standards and that the opinions of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights will be taken into 
</p>
<p>consideration in that regard. 
</p>
<p>12. In accordance with article 46 of the Constitution, citizens have certain duties, 
</p>
<p>including that of safeguarding &#8220;social order&#8221; and observing the &#8220;rules of public life&#8221;. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur stresses the importance of interpreting those provisions in a way that is 
</p>

<p>respectful of the rights to freedom of expression, to participate or not to participate in 
</p>
<p>specific manifestations of cultural life, and to manifest one&#8217;s own cultural practices.   
</p>
<p>13. Other provisions are also noteworthy, in particular article 5 relating to the right of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;every ethnic group to use its own spoken and written language to preserve its own identity 
</p>
<p>and to promote its fine customs, practices, traditions and culture&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>14. Many civil society interlocutors considered the new Constitution as a chance for 
</p>
<p>Vietnamese society to address key aspects of its governmental system, but also as a &#8220;lost&#8221; 
</p>
<p>opportunity to adopt a more progressive and open system of governance.  
</p>
<p>15. In the area of human rights, many interlocutors indicated that the most important 
</p>
<p>issue was not so much the text of the Constitution, as its potential implementation in 
</p>
<p>conjunction with existing laws and decrees. One widely shared concern of civil society 
</p>
<p>actors was that, most often, the authorities themselves reportedly did not respect the legal 
</p>
<p>framework in place.  
</p>
<p>16. Viet Nam has adopted numerous laws and decrees relating to culture, artistic 
</p>
<p>creation and science (see below). The resolution of the 5th Plenum of the Central 
</p>
<p>Committee of the Communist Party (8th tenure) on building an advanced Vietnamese 
</p>
<p>culture imbued with national identities guides government policies in the field of culture. 
</p>
<p>The resolution is aimed at developing ideology, ethics, lifestyles and cultural life in society, 
</p>
<p>and underscores that a healthy lifestyle should be established within grassroots units and 
</p>
<p>residential areas to meet the diverse and increased cultural demand of the people.3  
</p>
<p><b> C. General context 
</b></p>
<p>17. Viet Nam is a country of great cultural diversity. The State recognizes 54 distinct 
</p>
<p>ethnic groups, with seven language systems and unique religious, linguistic and cultural 
</p>
<p>characteristics and identities. According to the 2009 census, the Kinh constitute the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s ethnic majority, accounting for 85.7 per cent of the population; numerous ethnic 
</p>
<p>minorities constitute the remaining 14.3 per cent. Five ethnic minority groups have 
</p>
<p>populations of over one million: the Tay, Thai, Muong, Khmer and Hmong. Another five 
</p>
<p>ethnic groups have populations of less than 1,000 people each.4 Issues relating to linguistic 
</p>
<p>rights, ways of living and identities are thus challenging. 
</p>
<p>18. In 1986, Viet Nam introduced the Doi Moi (&#8220;renovation&#8221;) reform policy, geared 
</p>
<p>towards establishing a socialist-oriented market economy. Many interlocutors referred to 
</p>
<p>the Doi Moi policy as a turning point. Viet Nam has made remarkable progress towards 
</p>
<p>achieving the Millennium Development Goals and realizing a range of economic, social 
</p>
<p>and cultural rights. In particular, the poverty rate fell from nearly 60 per cent in the early 
</p>
<p>1990s to 20.7 per cent in 2010, which means that an estimated 30 million Vietnamese 
</p>
<p>people have been lifted out of poverty in the past 20 years.5 Challenges remain, however, 
</p>
<p>including, notably, addressing the high poverty rate in rural areas and remote regions and 
</p>
<p>ensuring robust participation by people, which would strengthen cultural rights.6  
</p>
<p>19. The monopolistic position of the Communist party has important implications for 
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of cultural rights. Persons working in the fields of education, culture and

<p>science, such as those holding positions at universities or in publishing houses, reportedly 
</p>
<p>are required to be party members. The need to maintain party membership to avoid possible 
</p>
<p>consequences, such as losing one&#8217;s position, limits the possibilities for creating a forum for 
</p>
<p>people to exchange ideas and express themselves freely in the fields of education, culture 
</p>
<p>and science.  
</p>
<p>20. The judicial system is not visible in the governance architecture with respect to the 
</p>
<p>implementation of cultural rights. It is unfortunate that judicial processes have not helped to 
</p>
<p>clarify the parameters of specific laws.  
</p>
<p>21. Enquiring about the reasons for such a situation, the Special Rapporteur was 
</p>
<p>informed that people do not dare approach the courts and few believe that the judiciary is 
</p>
<p>independent. Many interlocutors mentioned the emblematic case of Cu Huy Ha Vu, a 
</p>
<p>lawyer who was charged under article 88 of the Penal Code and, in 2011, sentenced to 
</p>
<p>seven years&#8217; imprisonment for suing various government or people&#8217;s committee officials, 
</p>
<p>including the Prime Minister, in relation to issues such as minority rights, protection of 
</p>
<p>cultural heritage sites, extraction of bauxite in the Central Highlands and other land-related 
</p>
<p>issues, including the case of the Con Dau parish (see para. 86 below), as well as the 
</p>
<p>prohibition of class-action petitions. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, Mr. Vu 
</p>
<p>was still in detention; he has since been released and now lives in exile. According to 
</p>
<p>information received, people in Viet Nam cannot freely appoint a lawyer of their choice; 
</p>
<p>lawyers must obtain a licence from courts on a case-by-case basis to represent their clients.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Realizing cultural rights in Viet Nam: specific issues 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Government and civil society appear to be constantly engaged in redefining the 
</p>
<p>contours of the space available for a diversity of voices on a number of issues. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur encourages the Government to widen that space, in accordance with the  
</p>
<p>Constitution and international standards. Currently, the political and governmental 
</p>
<p>structure, together with various unions, which mainly act as vehicles for transmitting 
</p>
<p>government decisions, leaves little space for civil society to express itself, in particular 
</p>
<p>academics, artists and others who may be critical of the Government&#8217;s policies.  
</p>
<p><b> A. History teaching 
</b></p>
<p>23. The teaching of history is a core area where more space is needed to allow for a 
</p>
<p>plurality of voices, in particular on how to interpret and address the past.  
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur was informed that comprehensive education reform has 
</p>
<p>been scheduled for 2015, together with the ongoing pedagogical reform, to foster critical 
</p>
<p>thinking and participatory education. She encourages the Government and all actors in the 
</p>
<p>education system, in particular teachers, to continue their efforts in that direction.  
</p>
<p>25. History teaching should promote critical thinking, analytic learning and debate, and 
</p>
<p>enable a comparative and multiperspective approach, in particular through the use of a wide 
</p>
<p>array of teaching materials, including textbooks from a range of publishers (A/68/296, 
</p>
<p>paras. 88 (a) and (d)). At present, only one history textbook per grade is used in schools. 
</p>
<p>26. According to information provided by the Government, the teaching of history is 
</p>
<p>based on the idea that the &#8220;scientific purpose of history&#8221; should always be respected. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur agrees that history teaching should treat history as an academic 
</p>
<p>discipline, but stresses that the notion that there is always one objective truth concerning 
</p>
<p>past events is a misconception. While facts must be treated as facts, there must always be 
</p>
<p>room for interpretation of the causes of events, their consequences and the responsibilities </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>involved. It is important to hear and acknowledge the narratives of all sides of a conflict in 
</p>
<p>order to better promote mutual understanding, and thereby reconciliation, and also to enable 
</p>
<p>contemporary challenges of exclusion and violence to be addressed. 
</p>
<p>27. In her discussions with officials, the Special Rapporteur noted that the objectives of 
</p>
<p>history teaching, especially in secondary schools, were several and seemingly of equal 
</p>
<p>importance: learning about and understanding events that took place in the past; preserving 
</p>
<p>the traditions, moral values and cultural identity of the Vietnamese people; preserving Viet 
</p>
<p>Nam as a nation; and promoting patriotism. For example, family traditions are integrated in 
</p>
<p>history teaching with a view to minimizing the divorce rate and fostering care for family 
</p>
<p>elders. Connections between pupils/students and the military are promoted through, for 
</p>
<p>example, exchanges with military schools and activities for students to engage with military 
</p>
<p>officers and cadets (trainees). In that regard, the Special Rapporteur draws the attention of 
</p>
<p>the Vietnamese authorities to her recommendation (A/68/296, para. 88 (a)) that history 
</p>
<p>teaching should not serve the purpose of strengthening patriotism, fortifying national 
</p>
<p>identity or shaping the young in line with the official ideology. Such purposes are not in 
</p>
<p>keeping with history being taught as an academic discipline. 
</p>
<p>28. History teachers in Viet Nam do try to find new ways of teaching history so as to 
</p>
<p>make it more interesting and relevant for students, focusing less on remembering dates and 
</p>
<p>offering greater possibilities to access reliable additional information. Efforts are under way 
</p>
<p>to foster the use of cultural heritage as a resource in education and training, including by 
</p>
<p>means of visits to historical sites, thanks to a 2013 agreement between the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Culture and the Ministry of Education. Teachers are encouraged to use the Internet to 
</p>
<p>access additional materials and to motivate students to find supplementary information 
</p>
<p>through library reference books and online research. The Special Rapporteur welcomes 
</p>
<p>those steps and encourages the Government to increase its efforts in that direction.  
</p>
<p>29. As teachers are expected to guide students regarding where to find reliable 
</p>
<p>additional information, a crucial question is whether teachers themselves have access to a 
</p>
<p>sufficiently wide array of such information, and how do they help students to distinguish 
</p>
<p>between what is reliable and what is not.  
</p>
<p>30. In Ho Chi Minh City, the Special Rapporteur was informed that history teachers 
</p>
<p>were expected to keep themselves up to date. School teachers meet on a monthly basis and 
</p>
<p>report narratives that conflict with what is considered to be the historical truth to the City 
</p>
<p>History Council under the City Department of Education and Training. The Department, 
</p>
<p>which is composed of former and experienced history teachers with close relationships with 
</p>
<p>academia, ensures the harmonization of history teaching in all schools. Although there are 
</p>
<p>debates amongst teachers on historical narratives, teachers follow the official curricula and 
</p>
<p>use official government-recognized historical sources. 
</p>
<p>31. The participation of teachers in the elaboration and development of the history 
</p>
<p>programme and lessons seems limited, but the Government has launched a programme for 
</p>
<p>teachers to post their history lessons on the Internet. Delegations from the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Education go to schools to gather teachers&#8217; feedback on textbooks. Some teachers indicated 
</p>
<p>that they could report flaws in official textbooks and share their assessment of the online 
</p>
<p>library provided by the Ministry of Education. Discussions with teachers do not seem to 
</p>
<p>indicate, however, that this is well implemented in practice. 
</p>
<p>32. The school curriculum requires that a certain amount of time be devoted to local 
</p>
<p>history. While this is important, it does not guarantee the introduction of a multiperspective 
</p>
<p>approach. Some interlocutors complained that history teaching focused on the history of the 
</p>
<p>Kinh majority and disregarded the history and cultural heritage of groups and minorities 
</p>
<p>such as the Cham, the Khmer people of the Mekong Delta (who also sometimes self-
</p>
<p>identify as Khmer Krom) and groups in the Central Highlights, commonly referred to as </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Montagnards. Reportedly, the histories of minorities are mainly highlighted in geography 
</p>
<p>lessons, civic education or extra-curricular activities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Artistic freedoms 
</b></p>
<p>33. According to article 40 of the new Constitution, everyone has the right to conduct 
</p>
<p>scientific or technological research, to engage in literary or artistic creation and to enjoy the 
</p>
<p>benefits of those activities. Article 25 protects the rights to freedom of opinion and speech 
</p>
<p>and freedom of the press, to access information, to assemble, to form associations and to  
</p>
<p>hold demonstrations, and states that the exercise of those rights shall be prescribed by law.  
</p>
<p>34. A number of artists believe that, compared with the past, there is more space for the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of artistic freedoms in Viet Nam. For example, exchanges with foreign artists 
</p>
<p>are now possible, enabling access to foreign contemporary works and connections with 
</p>
<p>international artistic trends. Since the implementation of the Doi Moi policy and the 
</p>
<p>introduction of the Internet, artists have gained a stronger voice and have expressed their 
</p>
<p>need for greater space more forcefully.   
</p>
<p>35. Artists notably enjoy more freedom regarding the methodology they use: since the 
</p>
<p>Doi Moi policy, they can more freely use methodologies other than the Gorky methodology 
</p>
<p>or socialist realism and can express their creativity through new styles and different 
</p>
<p>approaches. Nevertheless, some artists stressed that socialist realism remained the dominant 
</p>
<p>approach because it was favoured by the Government, which led to self-censorship and 
</p>
<p>significant constraints on artistic expression.  
</p>
<p>36. Difficulties arise from the multiplicity of regulations that have been adopted in the 
</p>
<p>area of artistic expression, which curtail artistic freedom and institute a system of prior and 
</p>
<p>post censorship of the arts. Each art sector has its own regulations. In many areas of artistic 
</p>
<p>creation, especially music, literature and cinema, committees have been tasked with 
</p>
<p>reviewing, commenting on and approving artworks. Many artists complained about the lack 
</p>
<p>of clearly defined specifications of what was acceptable or not and an overall climate of 
</p>
<p>arbitrariness.  
</p>
<p>37. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur about its policy to create 
</p>
<p>favourable conditions for creativity, while ensuring that artworks reaching the public are in 
</p>
<p>conformity with social values. Therefore, while creativity is free, publication is not and is 
</p>
<p>subject to censorship. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that such a system 
</p>
<p>necessarily affects creativity and leads to wide self-censorship, as confirmed by artists.  
</p>
<p>38. The Government has adopted a number of measures to support artists and, since 
</p>
<p>1995/96, has allowed wider participation of private business actors in cultural life, thereby 
</p>
<p>widening the sources of artistic production.7  
</p>
<p>39. The State extends support to artists in the form of subsidies, but its art policies seem 
</p>
<p>to reflect a desire to promote a particular world vision, while simultaneously blocking other 
</p>
<p>visions. Hence, artists benefiting from State subsidies are expected to promote a good 
</p>
<p>image of the country, its people and societal role models. Artists cannot adopt an approach 
</p>
<p>deemed to be too critical nor introduce ideologies considered unsuitable for society nor 
</p>
<p>produce work that, in the words of government officials, &#8220;harm the culture and humanistic 
</p>
<p>values&#8221;. One fallout is that independent artists who have no access to public audiences fear 
</p>
<p>that there is a widening gap in knowledge and understanding of contemporary art among 
</p>
<p>the general public. 
</p>

<p><b> 1. Government support for the arts and for </b>people&#8217;s<b> right to enjoy the arts 
</b></p>
<p>40. Financial assistance to art and artists is provided by various means. Creative houses 
</p>
<p>or artist residencies, fully funded by the Government, operate in three areas of the country. 
</p>
<p>The Government has established a bank dedicated to financing cinema and has supported 
</p>
<p>the construction of new cinema houses. The Government also supports mobile cinemas 
</p>
<p>that, with more than 300 mobile cinema teams, serve 11 to 12 million people in remote 
</p>
<p>areas.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur discussed with relevant authorities the selection process for 
</p>
<p>government support. She was informed that the selection process was carried out in 
</p>
<p>collaboration with professional associations and other experts, who compiled a list of artists 
</p>
<p>based on their work and talents, taking into consideration the project being proposed. The 
</p>
<p>National Art Council, which is differently constituted depending on the art sector, makes 
</p>
<p>the final decision. Two thirds of the Council membership are artists appointed by the 
</p>
<p>professional associations; academics also sit in the Council.    
</p>
<p>42. Government representatives stressed the difficulties encountered in supporting the 
</p>
<p>arts, while ensuring their free development. The Special Rapporteur agrees that it is a 
</p>
<p>challenge. However, she feels that it is important that governments support the art sector 
</p>
<p>without constraining it, while at the same time encouraging private actors to contribute 
</p>
<p>freely to the arts. The Special Rapporteur is concerned by reports that, in practice, only 
</p>
<p>artists who support the Government receive funding and that the work of artists in 
</p>
<p>residency programmes is reviewed and censored, with the residency manager deciding 
</p>
<p>which artworks should be made available to the public.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Censorship 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Grounds for censorship 
</i></p>
<p>43. Article 11 of the 2006 Law on Cinematography illustrates the censorship system that 
</p>
<p>is in place in many areas of artistic expression. Some of the reasons for the restrictions in 
</p>
<p>that provision are in accordance with international standards, for example, incitement to 
</p>
<p>wars of aggression, to hatred among nations and peoples, and to violence.  
</p>
<p>44. However, article 11 also lists grounds that are not in compliance with international 
</p>
<p>standards, with the effect of prohibiting free expression on numerous legitimate issues. Of 
</p>
<p>particular concern are the prohibitions on spreading propaganda against the State; 
</p>
<p>undermining the national unity; spreading reactionary ideas, an obscene and depraved 
</p>
<p>lifestyle, social evils and superstition; undermining fine traditional habits and customs; 
</p>
<p>distorting historical truths, negating revolutionary achievements; offending the nation, 
</p>
<p>national great persons and heroes; and slandering and offending the prestige of agencies 
</p>
<p>and organizations &#8212; a vast array of grounds for possible restrictions. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur notes that article 11 of the  Cinematography Law does not refer to the strict 
</p>
<p>tests of necessity and proportionality with regard to implementing restrictions, as required 
</p>
<p>under article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,8 nor does it 
</p>
<p>envisage forms of restrictions other than outright prohibition. Article 10 of the 2012 Law on 
</p>
<p>Publishing contains similar provisions, as does article 8 of Decree 113/2013 on art 
</p>
<p>activities. 
</p>
<p>45. In practice, legislation relating to artistic expression is implemented in ways that 
</p>
<p>prevent artists from being too critical with regard to &#8220;sensitive issues&#8221; such as corruption, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8  See also Human Rights Committee general comment No. 34 (2011) on the freedoms of opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression, para. 22.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>land rights and development projects or from criticizing policies, strategies and activities of 
</p>
<p>the Government or the Communist Party and the bauxite exploitation in the Central 
</p>
<p>Highlands. Furthermore, artists who make reference to violence, sex, drugs or general 
</p>
<p>social problems are often considered to be promoting them and/or giving the country a bad 
</p>
<p>image, jeopardizing positive social values, undermining the spirit of the people and the 
</p>
<p>harmony between groups and negatively affecting youth. Literary works set in 
</p>
<p>contemporary times around contemporary issues and actors are at greater risk of being 
</p>
<p>prohibited, but expressions considered as conveying &#8220;distortions of historical truth&#8221;, or as 
</p>
<p>being too critical of historical figures, such as Ho Chi Minh, Lenin and Marx, are also 
</p>
<p>censored.   
</p>
<p>46. The practice of not clearly indicating the reasons for censoring artworks and the lack 
</p>
<p>of transparency in the parameters used is a constant issue of concern for artists. On the 
</p>
<p>positive side, an ongoing discussion on those issues between artists and the authorities is 
</p>
<p>evident, which some believe indicates some openness on the part of the Government, and 
</p>
<p>recognition, albeit slow, that artists may engage in social and political issues. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur stresses that the discussion is an important process for moving forward and 
</p>
<p>recalls that, beyond providing aesthetic pleasure, artists contribute to social debates, 
</p>
<p>including through counter-discourses, that are a vital part of democratic societies. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, definitions of truth, humanity or beauty are always subject to discussion, and 
</p>
<p>artists, that is, all people who express themselves through the arts, whether professionals or 
</p>
<p>amateurs, have an important role to play in voicing their views.  
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned at testimonies and reports indicating 
</p>
<p>that a number of artists have been under surveillance, harassed or detained. Artists have 
</p>
<p>been convicted under article 88 of the Criminal Code for &#8220;conducting propaganda against 
</p>
<p>the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam&#8221;,9 which is not a legitimate ground for restriction of 
</p>
<p>artistic freedom under international standards. In 2012, intellectuals in Viet Nam asked for 
</p>
<p>the removal of article 88 from the Criminal Code as being too vague. 
</p>
<p>48. Of particular concern to the Special Rapporteur is the general government policy of 
</p>
<p>directing and controling the content of academic research. For example, Decision 97, issued 
</p>
<p>by the Prime Minister, which came into effect in September 2009, limits scientific and 
</p>
<p>technical research to 317 approved topics. That seriously curtails the freedom that is 
</p>
<p>indispensable for scientific research and creative activity, as set out in article 15, paragraph 
</p>
<p>3, of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Vietnam 
</p>
<p>Institute of Development Studies, an independent think tank, decided to close down rather 
</p>
<p>than be subjected to such restrictive rules and additional impediments.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Prior and post censorship  
</i></p>
<p>49. Viet Nam has established a system of prior and post censorship for a wide range of 
</p>
<p>artistic expressions. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the steps taken to reduce the scope 
</p>
<p>of prior censorship, but is concerned that legislative advances have not materialized in 
</p>
<p>practice and that censorship is still widely practised through various mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>50. In the area of cinema, for example, given the enormous human and financial 
</p>
<p>investments required to produce a film, directors, producers and investors prefer to submit 
</p>
<p>scripts in advance to the Cinema Board of Censorship rather than run the risk of facing a 
</p>
<p>possible restriction after completing the movie. That situation is reinforced by the fact that 
</p>
<p>motivations for possible prohibition, as explained above, are very wide and have a chilling 
</p>
<p>effect on cinema productions. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 See A/HRC/23/51, p. 32, case No. VNM 5/2012. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>51. Recently, a number of movies produced by local film-makers faced prohibition  
</p>
<p>before being released, which created much public debate. In 2013, the movie &#8220;Chinatown 
</p>
<p>Dust&#8221;, by Director Charlie Nguyen, a martial art movie situated in contemporary Ho Chi 
</p>
<p>Minh City was not released. The reason invoked was that the movie showed scenes of 
</p>
<p>violence without the authorities or other social forces taking any action, and hence did not 
</p>
<p>reflect the true society of Ho Chi Minh City. The Special Rapporteur recalls that movies, 
</p>
<p>being fiction, need not reflect society as it is. It is important to understand the use of the 
</p>
<p>imaginary and fiction as a crucial element of the freedom indispensable for creative 
</p>
<p>activities. Representations of the real must not be confused with the real, which means, for 
</p>
<p>example, that what a character says in a novel cannot be equated with the author&#8217;s personal 
</p>
<p>views. Hence, artists should be able, for example, to represent crimes or what some may 
</p>
<p>consider as &#8220;immorality&#8221;, without being accused of promoting them.10 The Cinema Board 
</p>
<p>may also suggest changes and cuts to a film during its production or before its release.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur appreciates article 5 of the 2012 Law on Publishing, which 
</p>
<p>stipulates that the State shall not censor works prior to their publication. However, 
</p>
<p>numerous interlocutors stressed that editors of publishing houses conduct very rigorous and 
</p>
<p>strict prior censorship processes: every three or six months, publishing houses submit a 
</p>
<p>tentative list of books to be published, with short summaries, to the Department of 
</p>
<p>Publishing of the Ministry of Communication and Information. The Department may ask to 
</p>
<p>read the full manuscript of books that, in its view, may potentially contravene article 10 of 
</p>
<p>the Law on Publishing, which provides for a number of restrictions (see para. 44 above). 
</p>
<p>Government officials explained that the process was for information purposes only and not 
</p>
<p>for approval before publication, since editors-in-chief now have full responsibility for their 
</p>
<p>publications. The Special Rapporteur nevertheless considers that editors, being under 
</p>
<p>government control, cannot make independent choices. Hence, delegating the duty to 
</p>
<p>censor to the editors is problematic.   
</p>
<p>53. The censorship system also lacks transparency. There is a 10-day period after a book 
</p>
<p>is printed, during which the authorities can prohibit its release on the market. When 
</p>
<p>&#8220;sensitive&#8221; books reach the market despite that procedure, the director of the relevant 
</p>
<p>publishing house may be sanctioned and copies of the book taken off the market. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was informed that in 2013 that was the case for a Vietnamese 
</p>
<p>translation of George Orwell&#8217;s <i>Animal Farm</i>. Some local writers also face censorship of 
</p>
<p>some of their publications.  
</p>
<p>54. Decree 113/2013 on art activities describes the procedures to be followed for the 
</p>
<p>organization of artistic exhibitions, which entail obtaining approval from the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Culture, Sport and Tourism or the Provincial People&#8217;s Committee, depending on whether 
</p>
<p>the exhibition is of an international, national or local dimension. That is also a system that 
</p>
<p>allows for prior censorship. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Independent publishers and cinema studios 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur learned of a number of cases in the area of literature, poetry, 
</p>
<p>cinema and the visual arts which indicate that there are numerous impediments to 
</p>
<p>independent production and publishing.  
</p>
<p>56. The publishing system in Viet Nam is strictly regulated by the Government. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur heard many reports that editors of publishing houses must follow the 
</p>
<p>policy of the Central Board for Propaganda of the Communist Party and that those wishing 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 10 A/HRC/23/34, para. 37. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>to make a more diverse range of writings accessible to the public enjoy a very thin <i>marge 
</i></p>
<p><i>de manoeuvre</i>. Crossing the lines could have many important personal consequences.  
</p>
<p>57. One small window available to publishers and writers to avoid prior censorship is 
</p>
<p>publishing e-books. Restrictions on the Internet, online censorship and control also have an 
</p>
<p>impact on artistic freedom. Internet Decree 72/2013, requiring Internet companies and 
</p>
<p>providers to cooperate with the Government in enforcing the prohibition of certain content 
</p>
<p>and the filtering of such content, raises particular concern in that respect.  
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at information that people trying to establish 
</p>
<p>independent private publishing houses have faced harassment and arrest. Their family 
</p>
<p>members have been kept under special surveillance without any explanation and they, 
</p>
<p>themselves, cannot travel abroad as their passports have been retained. For example, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was informed of the case of Bui Chat, poet, publisher and founder of 
</p>
<p>the Open Mouth Group, who received the International Publishers Association 2011 
</p>
<p>Freedom to Publish Award in Buenos Aires, and was detained briefly after his return.  
</p>
<p>59. People engaged in cinema and visual arts encounter many difficulties in creating and 
</p>
<p>running independent studios. Procedures to obtain a licence to screen films or organize 
</p>
<p>exhibitions are reportedly lengthy and involve numerous government departments, creating 
</p>
<p>many opportunities for corruption. It is reportedly easier to exhibit in a commercial space 
</p>
<p>than in an independent cultural institution, and licences are only granted to institutions 
</p>
<p>under the umbrella of the Government. Many stakeholders see licensing as a major 
</p>
<p>problem.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. </b>The &#8220;<b>c</b>ultural police&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>60. According to various concurrent sources of information, a specific unit under the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Public Security is in charge of influencing and monitoring the publishing press, 
</p>
<p>academics and artists, to ensure that they follow existing policies and the official ideology.  
</p>
<p>It is widely referred to in Vietnamese society as the &#8220;cultural police&#8221;, although this is not its 
</p>
<p>official name. Reportedly, its modus operandi includes the checking of licences, phone calls 
</p>
<p>and threats to artists, academics or curators organizing exhibitions considered unsuitable. 
</p>
<p>They operate without submitting any written document or details regarding the grounds for 
</p>
<p>their interventions. The Special Rapporteur believes that she herself was under scrutiny by 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;cultural police&#8221; during her visit. She regrets that, despite her request, officials from the 
</p>
<p>unit referred to as the &#8220;cultural police&#8221; were not available to meet with her. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Preserving and promoting cultural heritage 
</b></p>
<p>61. Viet Nam is very proud of its rich tangible and intangible cultural heritage. Law 
</p>
<p>28/2001 on Cultural Heritage provides the legal framework for the protection and 
</p>
<p>promotion of cultural heritage; it is complemented by numerous decrees, directives and 
</p>
<p>programmes, including for the development of cultural activities in remote areas. Indeed, 
</p>
<p>policies and guidelines have been developed for the protection of the cultural heritage of 
</p>
<p>minority groups, including their languages. In Lao Cai, for example, numerous festivals, 
</p>
<p>ceremonies and sports fairs are organized to foster social participation in cultural activities 
</p>
<p>and promote the games of minority groups in remote areas.  
</p>
<p>62. There is increased focus on cultural heritage as a resource for development and 
</p>
<p>poverty reduction through, for example, developing tourism and festivals, or re-establishing 
</p>
<p>and further developing the production of craftwork for export. The Government is 
</p>
<p>conscious of the need to protect and safeguard cultural heritage, in particular from the 
</p>
<p>possible negative impact of tourism policies and the commercialization of culture.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Unity and diversity 
</b></p>
<p>63. The challenges are numerous, especially in view of the remoteness of many areas. 
</p>
<p>The official policy of Viet Nam is to promote the &#8220;unification&#8221; of the country, based on its 
</p>
<p>cultural diversity. The Special Rapporteur welcomes that goal, provided that unity is not 
</p>
<p>equated with uniformity, and stresses that such a goal can only be achieved by ensuring the 
</p>
<p>effective participation of relevant groups in the identification, interpretation, development 
</p>
<p>and management of cultural heritage.  
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur notes the information provided by the authorities to the 
</p>
<p>effect that that local people participate in the management of cultural heritage. She stresses, 
</p>
<p>however, that while peoples&#8217; committees are local, they do not necessarily represent the 
</p>
<p>local people, and steps must be taken to open spaces for discussion and to ensure 
</p>
<p>participation beyond mere formalities and unidirectional conveying of information.  
</p>
<p><i> (a) Top-down approach in the area of culture 
</i></p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s overall assessment is that government policies in the area 
</p>
<p>of culture follow a top-down approach. The media, as well as mass political organizations 
</p>
<p>and social organizations, such as unions, are considered as essential communication tools to 
</p>
<p>disseminate the voice of the authorities regarding steps to be taken and behaviours to be 
</p>
<p>adopted to protect and promote the culture, fine traditions and cultural identity of the 
</p>
<p>Vietnamese people.  
</p>
<p>66. Communications are disseminated in the languages of ethnic minorities to ensure 
</p>
<p>that all groups understand the Government&#8217;s policy. The Special Rapporteur is concerned, 
</p>
<p>however, that government policies to enhance the skills of officials in minority languages 
</p>
<p>are perceived by many stakeholders not as a sign of openness, but as a way for the 
</p>
<p>Government to tighten control over communities. That government policies in the field of 
</p>
<p>culture are viewed with suspicion by some groups should be seen as a worrying indicator, 
</p>
<p>and steps must be taken to overcome the distrust. 
</p>
<p>67. The prevailing top-down approach does not allow sufficient space for discussion. At 
</p>
<p>present, culture is still largely seen as a means of fostering societal development in certain 
</p>
<p>specific directions, compatible with government policies and objectives, such as following 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;model example of Ho Chi Minh&#8221; in their daily lives. Certain practices and ways of life, 
</p>
<p>deemed to be favourable to development, security, the environment and the general welfare 
</p>
<p>of society, are promoted in ways that discourage divergent viewpoints and lively debate.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern about the negative impact such an 
</p>
<p>approach has on people&#8217;s right to participate in the cultural life of their choice, to conduct 
</p>
<p>their own cultural practices and to freely develop their cultural heritage. She recalls, in that 
</p>
<p>regard, that the right to participate in cultural life includes the right not to participate and to 
</p>
<p>be part of the discussion to determine which cultural practices are to be eliminated or 
</p>
<p>transformed, and how.  
</p>
<p>69. Concepts such as model &#8220;cultural families&#8221; and &#8220;cultural villages&#8221; are also widely 
</p>
<p>promoted to encourage particular social patterns. Selected annually as models to emulate, 
</p>
<p>cultural families and cultural villages receive small financial rewards. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur understands that such concepts are used to combat problems such as domestic 
</p>
<p>violence and school drop-out, but remains concerned that the overall aim is to ensure strict 
</p>
<p>compliance with government policies in terms of particular ways of life and cultural 
</p>
<p>practices.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur notes in that respect the specific role attributed to women as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;good mothers&#8221; who are expected to build &#8220;happy families&#8221; which are patriotic, progressive 
</p>
<p>and live in harmony. In many countries, women are too often tasked with reproducing the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>dominant culture of their communities.11 Women must be encouraged to be not merely 
</p>
<p>guardians, but creators of cultural values and new family traditions. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Good and bad practices  
</i></p>
<p>71. One challenge concerns the implementation of article 22 of Law 28/2001 on 
</p>
<p>Cultural Heritage, which states that positive customs, ways of life and lifestyles of the 
</p>
<p>nation shall be preserved, while &#8220;outdated customs that harm the people&#8217;s cultural life shall 
</p>
<p>be abolished&#8221;. The Government seems to have a strong propaganda apparatus to promote 
</p>
<p>good values and eliminate bad practices through advocacy rather than prohibition. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur is concerned, however, about reports that, in March 2014, seven ethnic 
</p>
<p>Hmong followers of the Duong Van Minh faith in Tuyen Quang were sentenced to prison 
</p>
<p>terms. They had built &#8220;funeral homes&#8221;, which the authorities consider an &#8220;evil practice&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>The funeral homes were destroyed by the authorities and those who objected were beaten 
</p>
<p>and arrested.   
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur discussed at length with government officials how &#8220;bad 
</p>
<p>practices&#8221; and &#8220;superstition&#8221; were defined and identified. She was informed that research 
</p>
<p>bodies mandated by local governments identify bad practices, elicit the views of relevant 
</p>
<p>communities through discussions and make proposals to the relevant ministries. Many 
</p>
<p>workshops are held before a decision is adopted.  
</p>
<p>73. Conversations with various stakeholders suggested that &#8220;bad practices&#8221; are those 
</p>
<p>considered to be detrimental to the development of a modern society grounded in 
</p>
<p>Vietnamese traditions, values and culture. They include practices detrimental to people&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>health, their rights or their general well-being. Examples mentioned to the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur included early marriages, funeral practices which raised concerns in term of 
</p>
<p>health and hygiene, and expensive wedding ceremonies. The Special Rapporteur is of the 
</p>
<p>view that the term &#8220;bad practices&#8221; needs to be clarified and defined as practices that are in 
</p>
<p>contradiction with human rights or that undermine human dignity.  
</p>
<p>74. According to interlocutors, policies to combat &#8220;bad practices&#8221; are conceived and 
</p>
<p>implemented with some level of stigmatization of remote minorities, premised on the 
</p>
<p>widespread view that their traditions are outdated and can hinder the development of 
</p>
<p>modern society. However, some officials stressed the need to respect &#8220;the advanced values&#8221; 
</p>
<p>of those communities. Such a &#8220;selective&#8221; approach may have grave consequences; unless 
</p>
<p>there is meaningful consultation and engagement with the communities concerned, such an 
</p>
<p>approach imposes an outsider&#8217;s viewpoint on what is good or bad. Some communities view 
</p>
<p>the fight against bad practices as a cover for assimilation policies. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Linguistic diversity 
</b></p>
<p>75. Article 21 of Law 28/2001 on Cultural Heritage, as amended by article 1, paragraph 
</p>
<p>6, of the Amended Law 32/2009/QH12 on Cultural Heritage, provides for the protection of 
</p>
<p>the spoken and written languages of ethnic groups in Viet Nam. 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Scripts  
</i></p>
<p>76. Only 25 minority languages in Viet Nam have scripts. Some have several scripts &#8212; 
</p>
<p>ancient and contemporary versions. The Government recognizes that some ethnic languages 
</p>
<p>are difficult to express in the Vietnamese script. It has taken steps to retrieve, select or 
</p>
<p>develop minority scripts, in consultation with the relevant communities, and to promote the 
</p>
<p>teaching and learning of the scripts of ethnic minority languages.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 11 A/67/287, para. 19. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to continue to support the 
</p>
<p>development of minority scripts, while ensuring greater participation of researchers and 
</p>
<p>academics from the communities concerned in the decision-making processes. That would 
</p>
<p>help to address concerns raised by members of relevant communities regarding the script 
</p>
<p>used by some groups in Viet Nam. For example, the Hmong script created in 1962 is 
</p>
<p>reportedly not widely used amongst the Hmong population, who prefer to use a newer 
</p>
<p>script developed in Thailand and the United States of America.  
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur also expressed concern that the Government-developed 
</p>
<p>Cham script for education affects the Cham language itself owing to imports from 
</p>
<p>Vietnamese syntax into the Cham language. People reported that the traditional Cham 
</p>
<p>language and script have been modified and adapted to the framework of the Vietnamese 
</p>
<p>language. According to information received, most Cham scholars wish to revert to the 
</p>
<p>traditional script, but cannot make their voices heard. The Special Rapporteur notes the 
</p>
<p>comment from the Government that there is no policy to encourage imports of Vietnamese 
</p>
<p>syntax into the Khmer language and that there is a natural convergence of languages in the 
</p>
<p>Mekong Delta. She nevertheless suggests that an independent body be established to assess 
</p>
<p>the matter and take into consideration the concerns of scholars and the people affected.  
</p>
<p>79. Khmer people also complain about distortions created by the phonetic transcription 
</p>
<p>of Khmer names into Vietnamese script, as a result of which, people feel they cannot use 
</p>
<p>indigenous names for their children or for places. Reportedly, changes in the administrative 
</p>
<p>structure of the territory have had a significant impact on topographical names, and Khmer 
</p>
<p>family names and the names of localities and institutions, such as pagodas, have been 
</p>
<p>replaced by Vietnamese names. Other groups, such as the Montagnards in the Central 
</p>
<p>Highlands, similarly complain about policies to change tribal names into Vietnamese ones. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Teaching of and in minority languages  
</i></p>
<p>80. The Government encourages different groups to use and preserve their languages in 
</p>
<p>addition to the national language, and has taken steps to promote the teaching of those 
</p>
<p>languages and their scripts. 
</p>
<p>81. At the time of her visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that 20 provinces and 
</p>
<p>cities had introduced language education for seven languages, as well as six bilingual 
</p>
<p>education programmes. In the school year 2013/14, in 688 schools with 4,764 classes, 
</p>
<p>108,000 students were being taught minority languages. The Special Rapporteur welcomes 
</p>
<p>those achievements and encourages the Government to step up its efforts in that area. 
</p>
<p>Overall, however, minority languages are still taught in schools on a very small scale. 
</p>
<p>82. Steps taken, supported or authorized by the Government in the area of bilingual 
</p>
<p>education are promising. In particular, a United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) pilot 
</p>
<p>research project, conducted in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Training, 
</p>
<p>promotes bilingual education for the Hmong, Jarai and Khmer &#8212; three of the largest 
</p>
<p>minority groups &#8212; at the preschool and primary school levels, in three provinces. 
</p>
<p>Significantly, research demonstrates that students benefiting from such programmes 
</p>
<p>perform better than unilingual students in national tests.  
</p>
<p>83. However, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the reported arrest, in 2013, of 
</p>
<p>a group of Khmer-Krom Buddhists from the province of Soc Trang, who had opened a 
</p>
<p>Khmer-language school in their pagoda for Khmer Buddhist children. The arrest took place 
</p>
<p>following a confrontation with the authorities, who opposed the opening of the school<b>. </b>On 
</p>
<p>27 September 2013, two Buddhist monks and seven other people were sentenced to prison 
</p>
<p>terms. The Special Rapporteur has not received sufficient details from the authorities on 
</p>
<p>this case, and stresses the obligation of Viet Nam, under article 13, paragraphs 3 and 4, of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, regarding the liberty 
</p>
<p>of individuals and bodies to establish and direct educational institutions.  
</p>
<p>84. Beyond the issue of the language of instruction, establishing a multicultural 
</p>
<p>environment in schools is crucial. The Special Rapporteur visited a boarding school in Sa 
</p>
<p>Pa which hosts students from six ethnic groups living in the district. The school emphasizes 
</p>
<p>the importance of the preservation of cultural heritage, through, for example, traditional 
</p>
<p>games in sports, traditional songs in music lessons and traditional dances and costumes. 
</p>
<p>Small programmes on local literature, poems and stories, and/or local traditional 
</p>
<p>knowledge, such as agricultural techniques, have also been introduced. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur encourages further steps in that direction, including the development of 
</p>
<p>adequate teaching materials. She stresses the importance of such measures in a context 
</p>
<p>where students, including children at a young age, are placed in boarding schools and 
</p>
<p>therefore removed from the cultural life of their families and communities.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Development and tourism policies  
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Development projects 
</i></p>
<p>85. The Government, as well as multiple actors in Vietnamese society, recognizes that 
</p>
<p>conflicts are arising from the priority given to industrialization and development, and 
</p>
<p>acknowledges the need to safeguard tangible and intangible cultural heritage. The 
</p>
<p>detrimental impacts of development programmes on the cultural rights of ethnic minorities 
</p>
<p>and local communities are of particular concern.  
</p>
<p>86. Also of particular concern to the Special Rapporteur, is the fate of communities 
</p>
<p>whose ways of life and culture have been completely disrupted by development 
</p>
<p>programmes. During and after her visit, she raised the case of Con Dau parish near Da 
</p>
<p>Nang, where residents were subjected to forced evictions from land that they had 
</p>
<p>traditionally tilled for years, to make way for the development of a private mega housing 
</p>
<p>scheme.12 While thanking the Government for its response to a joint communication,13 the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur recommends that the cultural rights of the communities concerned be 
</p>
<p>fully taken into consideration in the planning and implementation of all private and public 
</p>
<p>development programmes. She is concerned about the many reported cases of forced 
</p>
<p>evictions of communities and of the reported violence by the police against those resisting 
</p>
<p>eviction. 
</p>
<p>87. More generally, land seizure and its impact on the livelihoods and cultural life of 
</p>
<p>people are major issues. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, discussions were under way 
</p>
<p>about the new Land Law, adopted on 29 November 2013. According to the law, individual 
</p>
<p>people and communities do not own land, but may be allocated or leased land for use. 
</p>
<p>Article 16 gives the State the power to recover land in a number of cases, in particular for 
</p>
<p>the purpose of socioeconomic development in the national or public interest. In such a case, 
</p>
<p>land users shall be entitled to compensation, support and resettlement, as prescribed by law.  
</p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur is concerned, however, that people are only given 90 days&#8217; 
</p>
<p>notice (for agricultural land) or 180 days&#8217; notice, prior to the recovery of the land, and that 
</p>
<p>a preponderant role is attributed to people&#8217;s committees in the process. That cannot be 
</p>
<p>considered proper consultation with the communities concerned. Given the allegedly high 
</p>
<p>level of corruption amongst local officials, people have expressed fear that the system is 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12 See A/HRC/27/72, p. 19, VNM 3/2014.  
</p>
<p> 13 Ibid. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>tantamount to land grabbing and exposes farming communities to grave violations of their 
</p>
<p>rights.  
</p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur notes with interest the State responsibility to adopt policies 
</p>
<p>to provide ethnic minorities with land for residences and community activities, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with their customs, practices and cultural identities and the practical conditions 
</p>
<p>of each region; and to facilitate the acquisition of agricultural land by ethnic minorities 
</p>
<p>directly engaged in rural agricultural production.  
</p>
<p>90. Government support for development programmes, for example in the Central 
</p>
<p>Highlands, is welcome, but would be more effective with the participation of local 
</p>
<p>communities and the use of their knowledge, including their traditional knowledge. In 
</p>
<p>villages that experience regular floods, for instance, traditional houses elevated on pillars 
</p>
<p>are more appropriate than those constructed on the ground under government schemes. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur appreciates the promotion of traditional architecture in the construction 
</p>
<p>of communal houses for community gatherings, but regrets that the concept was not 
</p>
<p>integrated into the building or upgrading of residential housing: flooding causes greater 
</p>
<p>damage in the new houses.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Development of the tourism industry 
</i></p>
<p>91. Like all countries eager to develop their tourism industry, Viet Nam is confronted 
</p>
<p>with important challenges in ensuring that serious harm is not done to the environment and 
</p>
<p>cultural heritage.  
</p>
<p>92. The authorities see culture as a resource for developing tourism, which creates new 
</p>
<p>job opportunities and sources of income for local communities, and simultaneously enables 
</p>
<p>them to showcase their culture and develop their own identities through various festivals 
</p>
<p>and performances. Training programmes have been established to build the capacity of 
</p>
<p>local communities with respect to the tourism industry so as to ensure that they, too, access 
</p>
<p>and benefit from this new market. Villages receive support to develop their traditional 
</p>
<p>products and crafts for markets. That has enabled communities to participate in the 
</p>
<p>economic development of their region, while enabling the Government to promote a more 
</p>
<p>multicultural image of the country.  
</p>
<p>93. Many challenges remain, however. In Sa Pa and surrounding villages, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur noted that, although tourism has provided a supplementary source of livelihood 
</p>
<p>for the local people, unfortunately, they are not the primary beneficiaries of tourism-
</p>
<p>generated revenue. It is difficult for local people to run their own businesses and preserve 
</p>
<p>the specificity of their landscape and environment. The Special Rapporteur was informed 
</p>
<p>that the Montagnards in the Central Highlands face similar problems. Another example is 
</p>
<p>the Dragon Boat Festival organized by the Mekong Delta Khmer people, which has become 
</p>
<p>a tourist attraction but which reportedly does not financially benefit the Khmer community.  
</p>
<p>94. It is encouraging that schemes have been proposed or put in place to ensure that the 
</p>
<p>benefits of tourism are redistributed, for example, selling tickets to enter old towns and 
</p>
<p>market places, the proceeds of which are redistributed amongst all stakeholders. Another 
</p>
<p>idea under discussion is that local people not participating in the tourism industry should 
</p>
<p>still receive at least 50 per cent of the income generated by tourists wishing to experience 
</p>
<p>their ways of life. Other proposals include identifying circles of stakeholders, in particular 
</p>
<p>individual artists and the wider local community or village, to share in the benefits, and 
</p>
<p>establishing a tourism committee as a representative organization responsible for 
</p>
<p>negotiating and signing contracts with tourism entrepreneurs.  
</p>
<p>95. The Special Rapporteur is concerned by situations that may push people to perform, 
</p>
<p>rather than live their own cultures, either by artificially retaining specific aspects of cultural 
</p>
<p>practices or modifying those practices to satisfy tourist demand, such as altering food or </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>accommodation patterns, or foreshortening their customs. Selling tickets for participation  
</p>
<p>in cultural events also has an impact.  
</p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur notes that under Decision 39/2001/QD-BVHTT of 
</p>
<p>the Minister of Culture and Information on the organization of festivals, no 
</p>
<p>admission tickets to festivals may be sold, but tickets may be sold within the 
</p>
<p>festival areas, if games, exhibitions and cultural shows are held, and prices must 
</p>
<p>comply with the provisions of competent financial agencies. She is concerned, 
</p>
<p>however, that the Khmer traditional Bay Nui bull race in some provinces of southern 
</p>
<p>Viet Nam has reportedly been turned into a commercial event for which tickets are 
</p>
<p>sold, and that, consequently, most of the local Khmer people can no longer afford to 
</p>
<p>attend the race. The authorities should ensure compliance with the above-cited 
</p>
<p>decision. In addition, reportedly, many aspects of the race have been changed: it has 
</p>
<p>been shortened to make it television-friendly; the clothes of the racers and musicians 
</p>
<p>display the names of sponsors; and most of the animals for the race have been 
</p>
<p>crossbred to give them an edge.14  
</p>
<p>97. Another example relates to the Cong Chieng gongs that is played by many 
</p>
<p>communities in the Central Highlands and officially recognized by UNESCO as intangible 
</p>
<p>cultural heritage. The Cong Chieng is considered a sacred instrument that is used only on 
</p>
<p>specific occasions. Today,  in some places, it is played for tourists on demand and has lost 
</p>
<p>its original cultural significance. The use of the gongs for commercial purposes has also 
</p>
<p>created a situation in which people from outside the communities, such as government 
</p>
<p>officials, influence the way the Cong Chieng is played. In addition, professional artists from 
</p>
<p>outside the community play the instrument in ways that do not follow the tradition. 
</p>
<p>98. The challenges to the preservation of cultural heritage are numerous, as it is neither 
</p>
<p>possible nor desirable to prevent the evolution of cultural practices that inevitably occurs 
</p>
<p>over time. Innovation is an integral part of creativity and the freedom of individual artists to 
</p>
<p>depart from tradition should be respected. However, the Special Rapporteur believes that 
</p>
<p>the consent of communities should always be sought as to whether, how, when and where 
</p>
<p>to perform and share aspects of their particular cultural heritage. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Viet Nam stands at an important juncture. It has made remarkable progress 
</b></p>
<p><b>towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and realizing a range of 
</b></p>
<p><b>economic, social and cultural rights. In particular, considerable efforts are under way 
</b></p>
<p><b>to enlarge </b>people&#8217;s <b>access to education and culture, including in rural areas and 
</b></p>
<p><b>remote regions. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>The Government is eager to promote cultural heritage as a resource for 
</b></p>
<p><b>development and poverty reduction, while simultaneously mitigating the possible 
</b></p>
<p><b>negative impact of development and tourism policies on cultural heritage. More needs 
</b></p>
<p><b>to be done in that area, however. In particular, it is crucial that the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>support cultural heritage as a living practice, which can only happen in an 
</b></p>
<p><b>environment enabling the free development and expression of culture.  
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>A major challenge for the Government is to replace its top-down approach in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the field of culture, too frequently used to steer individual and collective behaviours in 
</b></p>
<p><b>directions considered compatible with government policies and objectives. It is 
</b></p>
<p><b>essential that sufficient space be provided for divergent viewpoints and debates, 
</b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/57/Add.1

<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>especially regarding the definition, interpretation, content and value of the diverse 
</b></p>
<p><b>and vivid cultural heritage of the country. Meaningful debate and discussion on those 
</b></p>
<p><b>issues can only occur if freedom of expression is fully respected and guaranteed. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  History teaching</b>15<b> 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to open spaces to foster 
</b></p>
<p><b>critical thought, analytic learning and debate in history teaching. She encourages Viet 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nam to focus on the teaching of history understood as an academic discipline. Official 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards should determine the goals and outcomes of history teaching without 
</b></p>
<p><b>prescribing the content of teaching material. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The first and immediate step in that direction is to allow a wide array of 
</b></p>
<p><b>textbooks by a range of publishers to be accredited, and permit teachers to choose 
</b></p>
<p><b>from amongst them. Guidelines for writing textbooks should be developed to enable 
</b></p>
<p><b>authors to offer various interpretations and diverse perspectives in textbooks. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur welcomes the information received that in November 2014, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>National Assembly passed a resolution to develop a general education programme 
</b></p>
<p><b>with a wide array of textbooks. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>The Government should increase efforts to encourage teachers to provide 
</b></p>
<p><b>students with additional materials and to motivate them to look for supplementary 
</b></p>
<p><b>information. It is important that the curriculum allocate sufficient time (ideally, at 
</b></p>
<p><b>least 30 per cent of the time allocated to the teaching of history) for teachers to 
</b></p>
<p><b>introduce supplementary materials, in particular authentic historical sources, without 
</b></p>
<p><b>prior ministerial approval. 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Concerted efforts should be made to ensure that history teaching includes the 
</b></p>
<p><b>various histories of minority groups. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Artistic freedom</b>16<b> 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>There is more space for the enjoyment of artistic freedom in Viet Nam today 
</b></p>
<p><b>than in past decades. Many challenges remain, however, owing to the multiplicity of 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulations in the area of artistic expression, and the maintenance of a system of prior 
</b></p>
<p><b>and post censorship. While artists strive to redefine the line of what can or cannot be 
</b></p>
<p><b>expressed, the Government seems to hesitate between opening the space for artistic 
</b></p>
<p><b>expression and restricting it. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address the concerns expressed by artists, in accordance with article 19 of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 15 of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Government is encouraged to continue supporting artists and developing 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes to enhance access to the arts, in particular in remote areas, but to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that such support is not used as a tool for controlling the content of artistic expression. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Various systems of State support can be envisaged. In particular, the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>should establish a system whereby decisions on funding are delegated to independent 
</b></p>
<p><b>peer-review bodies acting in conformity with transparent terms of reference and rules 
</b></p>
<p><b>of procedure. Associations of artists participating in such peer-review bodies should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be fully independent of the Government and the Communist Party.

<p><b> (g) Abolish the </b>&#8220;<b>cultural police</b>&#8221;<b>, as well as the surveillance and harassment

<p><b>  Tourism, development policies and the protection and promotion of

<p><b>cultural heritage 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the cultural rights of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities concerned be fully taken into consideration in planning and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementing development programmes.  
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The Government should ensure greater flexibility in its policies and meaningful 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultations with the communities concerned when developing programmes. A 
</b></p>
<p><b>practice needs to be developed that enables people to contribute to the design of 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes that significantly affect their way of life. When extending support for 
</b></p>
<p><b>housing, for example, the Government should offer them real choices with regard to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the architectural design </b>&#8212;<b> traditional, modern or mixed </b>&#8212;<b> for building their 
</b></p>
<p><b>personal houses.  
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The Government should ensure the effective participation of relevant groups in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the identification, interpretation, development and management of cultural heritage. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Inventories of tangible and intangible cultural heritage should be community based, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular for smaller groups. The Special Rapporteur stresses that the role attributed 
</b></p>
<p><b>to p</b>eople&#8217;s committees at the local level cannot <b>be considered to be proper 
</b></p>
<p><b>consultation of local communities. 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>The new Land Law of 2013 should be implemented in a manner that protects 
</b></p>
<p><b>the collective use of land for communities wishing to retain and develop their 
</b></p>
<p><b>traditional ways of life, which are most often based on agriculture, forest husbandry </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/57/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b>or fishing. Forced evictions carried out in contradiction of international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards should cease. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur draws the attention of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Government to article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cultural Rights, general comment No. 7 (1997) of the Committee on Economic, Social 
</b></p>
<p><b>and Cultural Rights on forced evictions, and the guiding principles on security of 
</b></p>
<p><b>tenure for the urban poor suggested by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing 
</b></p>
<p><b>(A/HRC/25/54, para. 5). 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>Measures are needed to ensure that the people whose cultural heritage is used 
</b></p>
<p><b>to promote tourism are empowered to manage such activities to their best advantage. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Innovative measures should be tested and implemented to ensure that local 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities have a significant share in the benefits generated by the tourism 
</b></p>
<p><b>industry. The Special Rapporteur also strongly recommends that the prior and 
</b></p>
<p><b>informed consent of the communities concerned be sought on whether, how, when and 
</b></p>
<p><b>where to perform and share aspects of their cultural heritage, including traditional 
</b></p>
<p><b>sports.  
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>It is particularly important that the Government ensure that tourism does not 
</b></p>
<p><b>lead to the mere folklorization of the cultures of its peoples, which would be 
</b></p>
<p><b>tantamount to pigeon-holing communities according to the manifestation of their 
</b></p>
<p><b>culture. Enabling communities to freely develop their cultures, including outside of 
</b></p>
<p><b>touristic areas, is important. The Government should complement its support for 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural performances and crafts for tourists with programmes developed in 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation with the communities concerned, including for continuing their cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices, should this be their wish.  
</b></p>
<p>115. The terms &#8220;bad&#8221;<b>, </b>&#8220;outdated&#8221; or &#8220;depraved&#8221; <b>practices should be clarified and 
</b></p>
<p><b>redefined as practices that contradict human rights or undermine human dignity. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Provisions such as article 22 of Law 28/2001 on Cultural Heritage should be amended 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordingly. The Special Rapporteur stresses that identifying exactly which cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices should be considered as contrary to human rights is not a simple task. It 
</b></p>
<p><b>requires policies that unequivocally support an informed, open and participatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>debate within communities, which would enable such practices to be challenged from 
</b></p>
<p><b>within. It also requires an independent judiciary that is able to make decisions on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>basis of an explicitly human rights legal framework, taking into consideration 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights law and practice.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Languages and multicultural environment in schools 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes achievements in the area of minority 
</b></p>
<p><b>languages education in Viet Nam but stresses that much still needs to be done. She 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommends that the Government continue to support the UNICEF pilot research 
</b></p>
<p><b>project promoting bilingual education for the Hmong, Jarai and Khmer communities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and expand it into a national policy.  
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>The Government should continue to support the development of minority 
</b></p>
<p><b>scripts, so as to ensure more effective participation of researchers and academics from 
</b></p>
<p><b>the communities concerned in the decision-making processes. It should address the 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerns expressed by many communities regarding their right to use their own 
</b></p>
<p><b>languages in naming their children, topographical sites and institutions. 
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that further steps be taken to ensure a 
</b></p>
<p><b>multicultural environment in schools, including boarding schools, and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>development of adequate teaching materials reflecting the diversity of the population, </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation with relevant communities to ensure that the focus is not on folklore only.
