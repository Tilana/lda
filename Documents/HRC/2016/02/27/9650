Support of the Human Rights Council for the recovery process in Haiti 
after the earthquake of 12 January 2010: a human rights approach 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>,  
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing</i> its sincere condolences and deepest sympathy and solidarity for all 
victims and their families, including all United Nations personnel, as well as for the 
Government and the people of Haiti, affected by the devastating earthquake of 12 January 
2010, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> its previous outcomes on the situation of human rights in Haiti, in 
particular the President&#8217;s statements, PRST/6/1 of 28 September 2007 and PRST/9/1 of 24 
September 2008, 
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned</i> by the dire human and material losses and suffering sustained as a result 
of the earthquake, and by its impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights in the 
affected country, 
</p>
<p> <i>Concerned also</i> that the effects of the earthquake have further exacerbated existing 
challenges to the full enjoyment of all human rights in Haiti, and expressing concern at the 
medium- and long-term consequences of the disaster, including its social, economic and 
development aspects, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reiterating</i> that the promotion and protection of all human rights &#8212; economic, civil, 
social, political and cultural rights, including the right to development &#8212; are indispensable 
elements for peace, stability and development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> the extraordinary situation in Haiti, particularly in Port au Prince, 
L&#233;ogane and Jacmel, which requires an equally extraordinary response led by the 
Government of Haiti, in collaboration with the international community, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing</i> its appreciation for the prompt response, solidarity and assistance 
provided by the United Nations system, through United Nations agencies, programmes and 
funds, and the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, as well as by States Members 
of the United Nations, the international community, civil society, the private sector and 
individuals, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reiterating</i> the need for the United Nations system to respond swiftly to the requests 
for assistance from the affected country and to ensure that the assistance provided is timely, 
adequate, effective and coherent and coordinated among all development actors, in 
particular the Government of Haiti, 
</p>
<p> <i>Underscoring</i> the need for the long-term and sustainable support of the international 
community for the Government of Haiti to promote respect for human rights, the rule of 
law and good governance, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the primary responsibility and competence of the Government of Haiti 
with regard to the promotion and protection of all human rights in the country, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-13/2

</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> that the tragedy has obliterated the ongoing efforts of the 
Government of Haiti to prepare the national report to be presented to the Council at the 
eighth session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, 
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> of General Assembly resolution 64/250 of 22 January 2010, 
 1. <i>Calls upon</i> the international community to continue to ensure adequate and 
coordinated support for the Government and the people of Haiti in their efforts to overcome 
the challenges arising from the earthquake, keeping in mind the importance of integrating a 
human rights approach; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Reaffirms</i> the sovereignty of Haiti and its territorial integrity, and stresses the 
central role of the Government of Haiti in establishing national priorities for the recovery 
process; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Underscores</i> the importance of a renewed and sustainable commitment to 
address the existing and additional challenges to promote and protect all human rights in 
Haiti, and encourages the Government of Haiti to continue its efforts to promote and protect 
all human rights in the country; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Expresses</i> its concern about the present human rights situation in Haiti, in 
particular the vulnerable situation of children, women, internally displaced persons, the 
elderly, persons with disabilities and the wounded; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Underlines</i> the need to address the additional obstacles arising from the 
devastation in such areas as access to food, adequate housing, health care, water and 
sanitation, education, work and the civil registry; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Emphasizes</i>, in this context, the importance of reconstructing national 
institutions and of providing cooperation, capacity-building and technical assistance to the 
Government and the people of Haiti, in accordance with the needs and requests made by the 
concerned country; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Welcomes and further encourages</i> the responses provided by the United 
Nations system and the international community at large to assist the Government of Haiti 
to promote and protect all human rights in Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake, such as, 
inter alia, those resources aimed at providing cash and food for work, as well as those 
aimed at securing the full protection of the rights of all persons in vulnerable situations, 
especially women and children; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Underlines</i> the importance of protecting children from any violence, injury or 
abuse, maltreatment or exploitation, and of ensuring that separated or unaccompanied 
children reunite with their families and that those left orphaned receive immediate attention 
and necessary protection and, in this context, underscores the need for cooperation and 
assistance to the Government of Haiti from all States Members of the United Nations and 
relevant organs and bodies of the United Nations system, in particular, the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Emphasizes</i> the need to apply a gender-based approach to the recovery 
process; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Decides</i> to act favourably, in view of the exceptional circumstances that 
confront it, upon the request of Haiti to postpone relevant deadlines related to its universal 
periodic review before the Council to a date no later than December 2011; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Welcomes</i> the initiative to establish a joint protection team with the 
participation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/S-13/2 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-13924 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p> 12. <i>Invites</i> the High Commissioner to identify, in collaboration with the 
Government of Haiti, areas for cooperation and technical assistance with Haiti on the basis 
of the expertise and the presence of the United Nations system on the ground, in particular 
the Office of the High Commissioner, in collaboration with special procedures, with a view 
to present suggestions in this regard to the Council at its fourteenth session.
