<p><i>Summary 
</i> At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects 
of the movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the 
enjoyment of human rights conducted a country visit to India from 11 to 21 January 2010. 
The purpose of the mission was to examine the adverse effects that hazardous activities, 
such as shipbreaking and the recycling of electrical and electronic waste (e-waste), have on 
the enjoyment of human rights of countless individuals working in these sectors or living 
close to the places where these activities take place. During the mission, the Special 
Rapporteur met with a wide range of Government representatives and non-State actors, and 
visited an e-waste recycling facility in Roorkee, informal small-scale laboratories for the 
dismantling and recycling of electronic products at Shastri Park in the suburb of the capital, 
a facility for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes in Ankleshwar, and a 
number of shipbreaking yards in Alang and Mumbai.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the significant progress the country has made in 
the area of the management and disposal of hazardous products and wastes. India has 
developed a comprehensive legal framework to protect human rights and ensure the

<p>environmentally sound management of hazardous products and wastes throughout their life 
cycle. With specific regard to shipbreaking, the Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction 
the improvement of the health and safety conditions in Alang/Sosiya, as well as the efforts 
made by the regulatory authority and the industry to improve the health and quality of life 
of workers and their families. With regard to e-waste, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
various initiatives undertaken by Indian authorities to address the e-waste problem in India, 
and in particular the elaboration of the draft rules on the environmentally sound 
management and disposal of e-waste. 
</p>
<p> Despite the progress made, the Special Rapporteur identifies a number of key 
challenges. National legislation on waste management and health and safety at work is not 
effectively implemented, and the current institutional framework appears inadequate to 
respond to the health and environmental challenges posed by the generation, management, 
handling, transport and disposal of toxic and dangerous products and wastes. The health 
and safety situation prevailing at the shipbreaking yards continues to remain critical, 
especially in Mumbai, where the working conditions and the quality of facilities remain 
highly inadequate for guaranteeing health and safety at work and an adequate standard of 
living for those employed in the shipbreaking sector. The Special Rapporteur notes that at 
present, the existing legal framework is not sufficient to ensure the environmentally sound 
management and disposal of e-waste and expresses his concerns about the extremely 
dangerous recovery processes and techniques used in the informal e-waste recycling sector, 
as well as about the widespread contamination caused by the unsound disposal of e-waste 
into the environment. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur concludes with a series of recommendations aimed to assist 
the Government in its efforts to promote the effective enjoyment of human rights by those 
individuals and communities who may be adversely affected by the unsound management 
and disposal of hazardous products and wastes.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the movement and dumping of 
toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights conducted a 
country visit to India from 11 to 21 January 2010. He would like to express his gratitude to 
the Government of India for the invitation, as well as for the support provided to him 
throughout the visit. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to thank representatives of the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in India for their valuable cooperation 
and assistance in arranging the agenda for the mission. 
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was to examine the progress made, and the difficulties 
encountered, by the country in implementing its obligations under human rights and 
environmental law to ensure the sound management and disposal of hazardous products 
and wastes. In particular, the aim of the mission was to gather first-hand information on the 
adverse effects that hazardous activities, such as shipbreaking and the recycling of 
electrical and electronic waste (e-waste), have on the enjoyment of human rights of the 
countless individuals working in these sectors or living close to the places where these 
activities take place. 
</p>
<p>3. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with senior representatives of the 
following: the Ministry of External Affairs; the Ministry of Environment and Forests; the 
Ministry of Labour and Employment; the Ministry of Steel; the Ministry of Shipping; the 
Ministry of Agriculture; the Central Pollution Control Board; and the State Pollution 
Control Boards in Gujarat and Maharashtra. The Special Rapporteur also met 
representatives of several United Nations specialized agencies, programmes and bodies, 
representatives of the donor community, academics, and members of civil society 
organizations, trade unions and the private sector. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to visit an e-waste recycling facility in 
Roorkee, Uttarakhand, and a number of informal small-scale laboratories for the 
dismantling and recycling of electrical and electronic products at Shastri Park, in the 
suburbs of Delhi. He also visited a facility for the treatment, storage and disposal of 
hazardous wastes in Ankleshwar, Gujarat, and a number of shipbreaking yards in 
Alang/Sosiya, Gujarat, and Mumbai, Maharashtra.   
</p>
<p><b> II.  Legal and institutional framework  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International obligations 
</b></p>
<p>5. India is a party to a number of international human rights treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Pursuant to these treaties, the country has 
undertaken an obligation to protect individuals and communities within its jurisdiction by 
eliminating, or reducing to a minimum, the risks that hazardous products and wastes may 
pose to the enjoyment of human rights, including the right to life, the right to the enjoyment 
of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the right to safe and 
healthy working conditions, the right to food and safe drinking water, the right to adequate 
housing, the right to information and public participation and other human rights enshrined 
in the Covenants and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>6. India has ratified some multilateral environmental agreements regulating the 
sound management and disposal of toxic and dangerous products and wastes, including the 
Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>their Disposal, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for 
Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade and the Stockholm 
Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.  
</p>
<p>7. India is a party to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution 
from Ships (1973), as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78), 
but has not ratified other conventions negotiated under the auspices of the International 
Maritime Organization to regulate pollution from ships, such as the Convention on the 
Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (1972) (the 
&#8220;London Convention&#8221;) and its 1996 Protocol. 
</p>
<p>8. Similarly, India is not a party to several conventions developed under the guidance 
of the International Labour Organization to protect workers from health and safety hazards 
associated with dangerous working activities, including the Convention concerning 
Prevention and Control of Occupational Hazards caused by Carcinogenic Substances and 
Agents, 1974 (No. 139), the Convention concerning the Protection of Workers against 
Occupational Hazards in the Working Environment Due to Air Pollution, Noise and 
Vibration, 1977 (No. 148), the Convention concerning Occupational Safety and Health and 
the Working Environment, 1981 (No. 155), the Convention concerning Safety in the Use of 
Asbestos, 1986 (No. 162) and the Convention concerning Safety in the Use of Chemicals at 
Work, 1990 (No. 170). 
</p>
<p>9. As in other common-law jurisdictions, international treaties are not self-executing 
in India. Since the two Covenants have not been incorporated into Indian law, they do not 
have force of law in India, and cannot be enforced in Indian courts. Some, but not all, the 
human rights enshrined in the two Covenants have been incorporated in the Constitution or 
implemented through existing domestic legislation, amendments to existing legislation or 
new legislation, as appropriate. Furthermore, treaties that have not been incorporated can 
still have an indirect impact on the interpretation and application of domestic legislation, 
since statutes should be interpreted in a manner consistent with international law. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Constitutional and legislative framework 
</b></p>
<p>10. Part III of the Constitution of India incorporates &#8220;fundamental rights&#8221;, which are 
justiciable under articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution. They include, among others, 
equality before the law, prohibition of discrimination, and protection of personal liberty and 
life. Part IV of the Constitution, which lays down the &#8220;directive principles of State policy&#8221;, 
includes some economic and social rights that could not be guaranteed at the time the 
Constitution was enacted, but were expected to be fulfilled in succeeding years, such as the 
right to work, the right to just and favourable conditions of work, the right to an adequate 
standard of living and the right to health. Although they cannot be enforced in national 
courts, the directive principles are increasingly being used by judges as tools to guide 
interpretation of fundamental rights, including the right to life protected by article 21 of the 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p>11. Environmental protection has been given a constitutional status in India. The 
Constitution, as originally enacted, did not contain any specific provision to deal with 
environmental pollution, though article 47 made indirect reference to improvement of 
public health as one of the primary duties of the State. The Constitution (Forty-second 
Amendment) Act, 1976, however, incorporated a new article 48-A in the Constitution, 
according to which the State &#8220;shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and 
to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country&#8221;. The Amendment also inserted a new 
provision in the article 51-A, providing that &#8220;it shall be duty of every citizen of India to&#8230; 
protect and improve the natural environment...&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>12. The Supreme Court has contributed significantly to broaden the content of some of 
the basic rights set out in part III of the Constitution. It has stated that &#8220;(the) right to life 
guaranteed in any civilised society implies the right to food, water, decent environment, 
education, medical care and shelter&#8221;.1 It has also affirmed that a right to a healthy 
environment can be derived from a combined reading of articles 48-A and 51-A of the 
Constitution. According to the Supreme Court, environmental pollution which spoils the 
atmosphere and thereby affects the life and health of the person has to be regarded as 
amounting to a violation of article 21 of the Constitution, since a safe and healthy 
environment represents a necessary precondition for the effective enjoyment of the right to 
life.2   
</p>
<p>13. The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, provides for the establishment of the 
National Human Rights Commission, as well as State Human Rights Commissions, as 
autonomous statutory bodies for the promotion and protection of human rights. It also 
provides for the creation of Human Rights Courts at the state level for the purpose of 
providing speedy trial of offences arising out of violations of human rights. It defines 
human rights as &#8220;the rights relating to life, liberty, equality and dignity of the individual 
guaranteed by the Constitution or embodied in the International Covenants and enforceable 
by courts in India&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>14. India has developed a number of legislative and regulatory acts for the protection 
of the environment and natural resources.  
</p>
<p>15. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, provides for the 
prevention and control of water pollution and the maintenance or restoration of 
wholesomeness of water. As such, all human activities that may adversely affect water 
quality are covered by the Act. Pollution is defined in a comprehensive way, and includes 
any contamination or alteration of the physical, chemical or biological properties of water 
which may, or is likely to, create a nuisance or render such water harmful or injurious to 
public health and the environment. The Act establishes central and state pollution control 
boards to perform the functions as laid down under the Act. 
</p>
<p>16. The purpose of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is to 
prevent, control and abate air pollution. Under the Act, which covers any human activities 
susceptible to emit air pollutants into the atmosphere, air pollution is defined as the 
presence in the atmosphere of any solid, liquid or gaseous substance in such concentration 
as may be or tend to be injurious to human beings or the environment. The existing 
pollution control boards created under the Water Act were given additional duties to 
prevent air pollution. 
</p>
<p>17. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, passed in the wake of the Bhopal 
tragedy, constitutes an &#8220;umbrella&#8221; legislation to provide a framework for coordination 
between the central Government and the various central and state authorities established 
under the Water Act and the Air Act. Pursuant to the Environment Act, a number of 
notifications, rules and regulations dealing with the sound management and disposal of 
hazardous products and wastes have been adopted. 
</p>
<p>18. The objective of the Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and 
Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008, is to control the generation, collection, treatment, 
transportation, storage and handling of hazardous wastes. Hazardous waste is defined as 
&#8220;any waste which by reason of its physical, chemical, reactive, toxic, flammable, explosive 
or corrosive characteristics causes danger or is likely to cause danger to health or

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>environment&#8221;. Certain types of hazardous wastes, such as radioactive wastes, biomedical 
wastes and municipal solid wastes, fall outside the scope of these Rules.  
</p>
<p>19. The person who has control over the affairs of the factory or the premises is 
responsible for the safe and environmentally sound handling of hazardous wastes generated 
in his or her establishment, and must obtain an authorization from the State Pollution 
Control Board. The Rules establish detailed procedures for recycling, reprocessing and 
reuse of hazardous wastes and for their import and export. The import of hazardous wastes 
to India for disposal is not permitted under the Rules, as import can be authorized only for 
the recycling, recovery or reuse of such wastes. The export of hazardous wastes from India 
is subject to the prior informed consent of the importing country. 
</p>
<p>20. The Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemical Rules, 1989, apply 
to any industrial activity relating to the handling or storage of hazardous chemicals. 
Industries have to identify the major accident hazards, and are required to take adequate 
steps to prevent such major accidents and/or limit their consequences to persons and the 
environment. They are also required to provide workers with information, training and 
protective equipment necessary to ensure their safety. On-site and off-site emergency plans 
detailing how major accidents will be dealt with are to be prepared before initiating any 
activity. In the event a major accident occurs, industries have a duty to inform relevant 
authorities and provide adequate information to persons living close to the plant on the 
nature of the accident and the safety measures to be adopted.  
</p>
<p>21. The Bio-medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998, regulate the 
collection, management, storage, treatment and disposal of biomedical waste, such as 
human and animal anatomical wastes, items contaminated with blood or body fluids, 
medicines and chemical wastes. It is the responsibility of the generators of biomedical 
waste (health-care institutions, hospitals and clinics providing treatment to more than 1,000 
patients per month) to segregate, pack, store, transport, treat and dispose of the biomedical 
waste in an environmentally sound manner. Biomedical waste is to be segregated into 
containers/bags at the point of generation, and treated and disposed of in appropriate 
biomedical waste treatment facilities. 
</p>
<p>22. The Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000, apply to 
any municipal authority responsible for collection, segregation, storage, transportation, 
processing and disposal of municipal solid wastes. Municipal authorities must set up 
adequate waste processing and disposal facilities. Municipal solid wastes are to be disposed 
of through landfills, and in accordance with specifications and standards laid down in the 
Rules with regard to the protection of ground water, ambient air, leachate quality and 
compost quality.  
</p>
<p>23. The Right to Information Act, 2005, provides that all citizens have the right of 
access to information under the control of public authorities. Public authorities are required 
to reply as expeditiously as possible, and in any case within 30 days of the receipt of the 
request. A request for information may be refused only in the circumstances set out in 
section 8, for example, if the disclosure would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and 
integrity of the State or endanger the life or physical safety of any person. The Act also 
requires public authorities to promote timely dissemination of accurate information to the 
public, train public officers and develop training materials.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Ministry of Environment and Forests is the nodal agency in the administrative 
structure of the central Government for the protection of the environment and natural 
resources of India. Under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the Ministry has been </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>entrusted with the responsibility to set new national standards for the quality of the 
environment as well as standards for controlling emission and effluent discharges, to 
regulate industrial locations, to prescribe procedures for managing hazardous substances, to 
establish safeguards for preventing accidents and to collect and disseminate information 
regarding environmental pollution. The Ministry is also responsible for the implementation 
of legislation, policies and programmes relating to the conservation of the country&#8217;s natural 
resources and the prevention, control and abatement of pollution.  
</p>
<p>25. Other ministries are responsible for policymaking and/or for the implementation of 
legislation and policies in areas of concern to the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. They 
include: the Ministry of External Affairs, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the 
Ministry of Labour and Employment, the Ministry of Law and Justice, the Ministry of 
Chemicals and Fertilizers, the Ministry of Steel, the Ministry of Heavy Industries and 
Public Enterprises, the Ministry of Mines and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. 
</p>
<p>26. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is an autonomous organization that 
has been established to perform the functions laid down in the Water Act, 1974, and has 
been entrusted with additional powers and responsibilities by the Air Act, 1981. CPCB 
advises the central Government on any matter concerning prevention and control of water 
and air pollution and improvement of the quality of air; plans and executes comprehensive 
nationwide programmes for the prevention and control of water and air pollution; provides 
technical assistance to, and coordinates the activities of, State Pollution Control 
Boards/Pollution Control Committees; and organizes trainings and awareness-raising 
programmes on the prevention, control or abatement of water and air pollution.  
</p>
<p>27. A number of inter-ministerial commissions have been established to facilitate 
coordination and cooperation between different ministries and State agencies with 
responsibilities in the field of environmental protection, public health and hazardous 
wastes/chemicals management. For example, an inter-ministerial committee comprising 
representatives of the Ministry of Steel, the Ministry of Labour and Employment, CPCB 
and representatives of the shipbreaking industry has been established under the leadership 
of the Ministry of Steel to coordinate efforts aimed at improving the working conditions in 
the shipbreaking yards.  
</p>
<p>28. In a recent paper, the Ministry of Environment and Forests proposed to create an 
autonomous national environment protection authority.3 The agency would be established 
by law as an independent statutory body with the mandate of monitoring and ensuring 
compliance with environmental legislation. It would cover such areas as industrial 
monitoring, water, air and soil pollution, and hazardous substance and waste management. 
The agency would take over responsibilities for granting environmental clearances, a 
regulatory function currently discharged by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and 
carry out some of the monitoring functions currently attributed to CPCB. The latter would 
either be absorbed by the new agency or have its institutional structure reviewed to ensure 
its effective coordination with the new agency.

<p><b> III. Issues in focus 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Shipbreaking 
</b></p>
<p>29. Shipbreaking is an important industry for India. It represents an important source 
of raw material supply and provides jobs to tens of thousands of people. The practice is 
inherently sustainable, given that over 95 per cent of a ship can be recycled: steel is re-
rolled and used in construction; machinery and equipment are reused; and oils and fuels are 
reused or recycled. In principle the recycling of vessels constitutes the best option for ships 
that have reached the end of their operating life.  
</p>
<p>30. Nevertheless, shipbreaking also represents one of the most hazardous occupations 
in the world. During the dismantling process, workers are exposed to a wide range of 
hazardous workplace activities, such as entry into confined, enclosed or other dangerous 
atmospheres, paint removal, oil/fuel removal and tank cleaning, which may cause death, 
permanent or temporary disabilities, and injuries. Furthermore, long-term exposure to toxic 
and hazardous substances and materials which may be present on ships sent for 
dismantling, such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), heavy metals in paints, 
oils and oil sludge, may lead to serious or irreversible work-related illnesses and diseases, 
including lung diseases, several forms of cancer and asbestos-related illnesses.4  
</p>
<p>31. Thanks to the large intertidal zone areas existing on its coasts, in India ships are 
dismantled on beaches, a method commonly referred to as &#8220;beaching&#8221;.5 This method of 
ship dismantling fails to comply with generally accepted norms and standards on 
environmental protection. Although very little work has been carried out to assess its 
environmental impact, the dismantling of ships on sandy beaches without any containment 
other than the hull of the ship itself appears to have caused high levels of contamination of 
soil, air, and marine and freshwater resources in many South Asian countries, and to have 
adversely affected the livelihood of local communities surrounding the shipbreaking 
facilities, which often rely on agriculture and fishing for their subsistence.6 
</p>
<p><b> 1.  Overview of the shipbreaking industry 
</b></p>
<p>32. Alang/Sosiya is the world&#8217;s largest scrapping site for ocean-going vessels. The 
yards are located on the Gulf of Khambat, 50 kilometres south-east of Bhavnagar, in the 
State of Gujarat. There are currently 173 plots, which have been developed on the 10-
kilometre-long coast. The plots have a breaking capacity of 350 ships a year, about four 
million tons per annum, and produce about 2.5 million tons of re-rollable steel.  
</p>
<p>33. The Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB), a semi-public institution running all ports in 
Gujarat, is the main regulatory authority of the shipbreaking yards of Alang/Sosiya. As a 
nodal agency, GMB provides links between central and local government agencies, such as 
the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, the Custom Department, and the Directorate of 
Industrial Safety and Health, and the shipbreaking industry. As a landlord, GMB leases out 
a shipbreaking plot to the shipbreakers on a 10-year lease basis, and maintains basic 
infrastructures.  
</p>
<p>34. According to figures provided by GMB, 5,052 vessels have been dismantled in 
Alang since 1982, when the first yards were set up. In the last four years alone, more than

</p>
<p>and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights (A/HRC/12/26), paras. 19-22.

 6 Ibid, paras. 31-36. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>784 end-of-life ships arrived in Alang &#8211; 248 in 2009. Some 60,000 workers are employed 
in the yards when the industry works at full force. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
visit, the 128 yards which were operational provided employment to about 30,000 workers. 
In addition, over 500,000 workers are employed in associated downstream industries, such 
as re-rolling mills, foundries, scrap-handling yards, local goods stores and other small 
businesses. On the road to Alang, the Special Rapporteur saw a large number of retailers 
selling items of every sort recycled from the ships, including engines, boilers, furniture, 
electronics, first-aid equipment and kitchenware.   
</p>
<p>35. The scale of operations in Mumbai is much smaller than those in Alang/Sosiya. 
The 19 plots are located in a waterfront area known as Darukhana, very close to the city. 
The land belongs to the Mumbai Port Trust, a public sector undertaking under the control 
of the Ministry of Shipping. The plots are rented out on a very short-term basis, about three 
to four months. In view of the small scale of shipbreaking activities in Mumbai, the 
regulatory authority reportedly plays a relatively less active role than its counterpart in 
Alang/Sosiya,7 especially with regard to the enforcement of national legislation on health 
and safety at work and environmental protection.  
</p>
<p>36. When working at full capacity, the yards provide employment to about 6,000 
workers. The total number of workers directly or indirectly employed in the shipbreaking 
industry is about 20,000, which include the downstream industries generated by the 
shipbreaking yards. During the visit of the Special Rapporteur, it was estimated that some 
2,500 workers (1,700, according to the industry) were employed in the 17 plots that were 
operational.  
</p>
<p>37. Most of the shipbreaking workers at Alang/Sosiya and Mumbai are migrant 
workers coming from poorer, less industrialized states of the Union, such as Uttar Pradesh, 
Orissa and Bihar. Many workers go back to their villages for three to four months a year, 
usually during the monsoon season, to work in agriculture. It is a largely uneducated 
workforce, relatively young (19-45 years old) and mostly male. The majority of the 
workforce speaks Hindi, followed by Oriya and Bhojpuri. Most of the workers are either 
illiterate or have attended primary levels of schooling. A large percentage of workers are 
married, but only 20 per cent of them live with their families.8  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur notes that the laws and regulations on the protection of 
human health and the environment from the threats associated with the unsound 
management and disposal of hazardous products and wastes, such as the Water Act, 1974, 
the Air Act, 1981, and the Hazardous Wastes Rules, 2008, apply to shipbreaking activities. 
General labour laws and health and safety legislation, including the Factories Act, 1948, 
also apply to this industry.  
</p>
<p>39. Various authorities have developed regulations and guidelines on the sound 
management and disposal of end-of-life vessels. The environmental guidelines for 
shipbreaking industries, adopted in 1997 by CPCB, aim at minimizing the adverse impact 
of shipbreaking on the surrounding environment. The guidelines provide for the 
development of a comprehensive environment management plan comprising pollution 
control measures regarding solid waste, air pollution, water pollution and noise. In 2003, 
GMB adopted a set of regulations for the safety and welfare of workers and protection of 
the environment during recycling activity in the shipyard. GMB also issued specific

</b></p>
<p>regulations concerning the prevention of fire and accidents (2000) and gas free for hot work 
conditions (2001). 
</p>
<p>40. The Supreme Court has also contributed to developing the rules and procedures 
applicable to the shipbreaking industry. In its order of 6 September 2007, the Court 
identified the procedures to be followed for anchoring, beaching and dismantling end-of-
life ships, as well as the agencies responsible for ensuring compliance with these 
regulations. Insofar as possible, the ship should be properly decontaminated by the ship 
owner prior to the breaking. Wastes generated during the process should be disposed of in a 
proper manner, and special care must be taken in the handling of hazardous substances, 
such as asbestos.  
</p>
<p>41. The Court also requested that the Government of India formulate a comprehensive 
code incorporating these recommendations. Until this code is adopted, the 
recommendations are operative by virtue of the Court order, and officials of GMB, the 
State Pollution Control Boards, Custom Departments, the National Institute of 
Occupational Health and, where relevant, the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board, oversee 
these arrangements. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Positive developments 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur wishes to commend GMB and the yard owners in 
Alang/Sosiya for the progress made in recent years in the improvement of health and safety 
conditions in the shipbreaking industry. According to information provided by GMB, the 
number of fatal accidents dropped from 28 in 1998 to zero in 2008, and work-related 
injuries resulting permanent or temporary disabilities have also decreased significantly. He 
would also like to express his deep appreciation to national and local trade unions and 
NGOs for their tireless efforts aimed at improving the working and living conditions of 
those employed in the yards. 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that the achievement of this important 
result is directly related to the development of appropriate training opportunities for 
workers. The Safety Training and Labour Welfare Institute, established in 2003 in Alang, 
provides a number of training programmes, seminars and workshop aimed at raising 
awareness on the risks associated with ship-dismantling activities and on the measures to 
adopt to minimize such risks. From 2003 to 2009, some 49,000 workers participated in 
training activities at the Institute.  
</p>
<p>44. The &#8220;basic safety for all&#8221; programme is compulsory for all workers in the yards. It 
lasts for three days, and covers such issues as main hazards on ships, fire prevention, 
personal protective equipments (PPEs) and first aid. Other regular training programmes 
organized by the Institute include the cutter men training, a two-day programme organized 
once a week for workers employed as gas cutters, and the basic firemen training, which is 
organized for all literate young workers and lasts for two days. Special trainings on such 
issues as hazardous waste management, safe removal and handling of asbestos and disaster 
management can also be organized at the request of the industry. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur also notes with satisfaction that the progressive 
introduction and use of basic PPEs, such as helmets, gloves and goggles, have also 
contributed to the significant reduction in the number of serious accidents resulting in death 
or disabilities. During his visit to Alang/Sosiya, he observed that the vast majority of 
workers had been provided with PPEs by their employers, and wore them at all times while 
working. The Special Rapporteur was informed that appropriate PPEs for working in 
specialized areas, such as respiratory protective equipment for work in conditions where 
there is a risk of oxygen deficiency, are also generally available.   </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts made by GMB and the shipbreaking 
industry to improve the health and quality of life of workers and their families in 
Alang/Sosiya. Such efforts include the provision of financial support for the setting up of a 
local Red Cross hospital and a mobile hospital van to provide first aid and emergency 
treatment, the increased availability of safe drinking water in and outside the yards and the 
organization of medical camps to provide free medical check-ups and medicines to workers 
and their families. The Special Rapporteur has also been informed that a full-fledged 30-
bed hospital would be operational shortly. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the progress made with regard to the sound 
management of hazardous substances and the safe disposal of toxic wastes. Before starting 
the recycling process, the yard owner should prepare a ship-specific dismantling plan, 
which is to include information on, inter alia, the hazardous-waste handling and disposal 
plan, based on the type and amount of materials present on board and in the structure of the 
ship, the gas-free and fit-for-hot-work certificates, and the identification and marking of all 
places containing or likely to contain hazardous substances or toxic wastes. The plan 
should also include specific arrangements for the handling and disposal of asbestos and 
asbestos-containing materials. 
</p>
<p>48. GMB has outsourced the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of hazardous 
wastes to Gujarat Environment Protection Infrastructure Ltd. (GEPIL), a private-sector 
enterprise authorized by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The secured landfill for 
hazardous wastes was built in 2005 for the environmentally sound disposal of asbestos, 
glass wool wastes and other hazardous wastes generated during ship dismantling (paint 
chips, PCB-containing wastes, oily sludge, materials contaminated with oil and chemicals, 
among others). GEPIL also manages municipal solid wastes generated from the 
shipbreaking yards. From January 2006 to December 2009, GEPIL handled 7,600 tons of 
asbestos and glass wool, 4,800 tons of industrial and chemical solid waste and 3,100 tons of 
municipal solid waste. The enterprise is planning to build a new landfill for the disposal of 
asbestos and other hazardous/non-hazardous wastes, an incinerator, and mobile facilities 
for asbestos waste management and oil reception.   
</p>
<p>49. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the conclusion of a Memorandum of 
Understanding between Japan and the government of Gujarat to upgrade the existing 
shipbreaking facilities in Alang/Sosiya to international standards. The purpose of the 
Memorandum of Understanding is to provide technology transfer and financial assistance 
to assist the government of Gujarat in addressing the adverse impact that shipbreaking 
activities have on the surrounding environment. It includes the construction and operation 
of a common hazardous waste removal pre-treatment facility, modernization of the 
recyclable goods market and development of human resources.9  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Major concerns 
</b></p>
<p>50. Notwithstanding these positive developments, the health and safety situation 
prevailing at the shipbreaking yards continues to remain critical, as witnessed by the 12 
fatal accidents that occurred in Alang/Sosiya during the course of 2009, and there are a 
number of identifiable shortcomings which need to be addressed. The Special Rapporteur is 
particularly concerned about the quality of infrastructure facilities in Mumbai, which 
continue to be highly inadequate for guaranteeing health and safety at work and an 
adequate standard of living for those employed in the shipbreaking sector.

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>51. The informal nature of shipbreaking activities hampers the effective 
implementation of national labour standards aimed at guaranteeing job security and just and 
favourable conditions of work. There is no written contract of employment. Workers are 
hired either on a monthly basis or for a specific task on a vessel. They regularly change 
plots, depending on the arrival of ships and workload. Workers are paid monthly, usually at 
the daily rate. The average daily rate is 250 rupees a day (about US$ 5). Working hours are 
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., but reportedly there is a two-hour compulsory overtime every day 
until 7 p.m. in most yards.10 Workers can be fired at any time with no prior notice and with 
no reasonable ground.  
</p>
<p>52. The right to work is a fundamental right, recognized in several international legal 
instruments to which India is a party, including the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights. Work as specified in article 6 of the Covenant must be &#8220;decent 
work&#8221;, that is, &#8220;work that respects the fundamental rights of the human person as well as 
the rights of workers in terms of conditions of work safety and remuneration&#8221;.11 The 
Special Rapporteur considers that the absence of a written contract of employment, and the 
possibility of dismissal overnight, are at the core of the vulnerability of shipbreaking 
workers, and de facto prevent the full and effective enjoyment of the core labour rights 
enshrined in articles 6, 7 and 8 of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>53. Information on the hazards and risks to health and safety relating to the specific 
work activities, access to training opportunities, regular exercises in emergency prevention, 
preparedness and response procedures, and proper PPEs constitute essential preconditions 
for the enjoyment of safe and healthy working conditions, which are a component of the 
right to just and favourable conditions of work set out in article 7 of the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>54. With a few exceptions, the vast majority of the workforce in Mumbai do not 
receive any information on the hazards or risks to health and safety, nor do they receive any 
training on how to avoid or minimize them. With regard to safety training, the Special 
Rapporteur is of the view that existing training opportunities in Alang/Sosiya should be 
improved, considering the magnitude of the risks associated with shipbreaking activities 
and the hazardous substances workers are potentially exposed to. In Mumbai, workers do 
not receive any formal training from their employers, which makes them more prone to 
serious accidents and injuries. As far as PPEs are concerned, the Special Rapporteur regrets 
that not all the workers in Mumbai receive helmets, gloves and goggles, and that only a 
fraction of them actually use them during work.  
</p>
<p>55. Due to the informal nature of working arrangements, workers are not covered by 
social protection schemes, and do not receive any benefit in case of work-related injuries or 
diseases. The compulsory insurance that the industry is required to have covers only death 
and permanent disabilities. In cases of minor accidents, employers usually pay for first aid 
and immediate medical expenses, but not for long-term medical treatment or for expenses 
linked to chronic work-related illnesses. Workers do not usually receive any wages or 
benefits when absent from work on medical grounds. 
</p>
<p>56. Much more remains to be done to ensure the effective enjoyment of the right to 
the highest attainable standard of health, as defined in article 12 of the Covenant. The 
Special Rapporteur observes that this right extends not only to timely and appropriate 
health care, but also to &#8220;the underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and 
potable water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and

</p>
<p>housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions, and access to health-related 
education and information&#8221;.12 
</p>
<p>57. Health facilities in Alang/Sosiya do not possess sufficient human, technical and 
financial resources to provide any treatment other than first aid for minor injuries. The 
nearest hospital equipped to deal with life-threatening conditions is in Bhavnagar, more 
than 50 kilometres away. The Red Cross hospital in Alang, which the Special Rapporteur 
visited, can count on only four medical doctors and nine beds to provide health care not 
only to some 30,000 workers in the yards, but also to the neighbouring villages of Alang 
(which has a population of about 18,000 people) and Sosiya (4,000 people). In Mumbai the 
situation is even worse, with no permanent facilities except first aid and ambulance 
services. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that most workers, but reportedly also 
a number of yard owners, are not aware of the serious life-threatening work-related 
diseases which may result from long-term exposure to toxic and hazardous substances and 
materials present on end-of-life ships. In particular, it appears that the majority of the 
workforce and the local population do not know the adverse consequences of prolonged 
exposure to asbestos dusts and fibres and are not familiar with the precautions that need to 
be taken to handle asbestos-containing materials. 
</p>
<p>59. While the Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the existence of slums constitutes 
a much larger problem in the country, he cannot but note with great concern the extremely 
poor conditions in which most shipbreaking workers live, especially in Mumbai. The 
majority of the workforce lives in overcrowded makeshift facilities just outside the yards. 
Most accommodations lack basic amenities such as kitchens, toilet facilities, electricity and 
running water.13  
</p>
<p>60. The water and sanitation facilities available in Alang/Sosiya remain grossly 
inadequate to deal with the consumption, cooking, and personal and domestic hygienic 
requirements of the 30,000 workers who work and live there. In Mumbai, the situation is 
even worse, with no safe drinking water available in the yards. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the availability and the quality of 
education available for the children of those employed in the yards. There are no schools in 
Alang/Sosiya, so children have to travel long distances to attend school in nearby villages. 
The shipbreaking industry has sponsored the construction of four primary schools in the 
surrounding region and has set up an informal education facility for the children of workers 
in Alang.14 In Mumbai, workers have set up an informal education facility for their children 
with the help of local trade unions. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur notes that the actual impact of shipbreaking activities on 
the surrounding environment continues to be debated (A/HRC/12/26, paras. 31-36). GMB 
and the shipbreaking industry claim that ship dismantling has only a limited adverse impact 
on the environment. A study commissioned by GMB to a State-owned laboratory found 
only &#8220;low&#8221; to &#8220;moderate&#8221; levels of hazardous substances in soil and sediment samples. 
However, other sources, including a recent report published by the United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP),15 found high levels of contamination of coastal soil, sea 
water and groundwater resources. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received any

</p>
<p>63. He also notes with concern that according to information provided by the 
International Metalworkers&#8217; Federation, unscrupulous yards owners at times circumvent the 
costs associated with the environmentally sound disposal of asbestos and other hazardous 
wastes generated during the dismantling process by illegally dumping these toxic wastes in 
neighbouring villages. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  E-waste 
</b></p>
<p>64. The term &#8220;e-waste&#8221; is generally used to describe obsolete, broken or discarded 
appliances using electricity, such as computers, mobile phones and household appliances. 
Electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) are made of a large number of different 
substances and materials. Metals (including iron, copper, aluminium and gold) account for 
60 per cent of e-waste, while plastics account for 20 per cent. E-waste also contains a 
number of hazardous substances, which can be released in the workplace and in the 
surrounding environment during the separation and recovery process. Three levels of toxic 
emissions can be distinguished, namely: 
</p>
<p>(a) Primary emissions: hazardous substances that are contained in e-waste (for 
example, lead, mercury, arsenic and PCBs); 
</p>
<p>(b) Secondary emissions: hazardous reaction products of e-waste substances as a 
result of improper treatment (for example, dioxins or furans formed by 
incineration/inappropriate smelting of plastics with halogenated flame retardants);  
</p>
<p>(c) Tertiary emissions: hazardous substances or reagents that are used during 
recycling (for example, cyanide or other leaching agents, mercury for gold amalgamation) 
and that are released because of inappropriate handling and treatment. 
</p>
<p>65. The adverse effects that these hazardous substances may have on human health 
and the environment have already been considered in previous reports of the Special 
Rapporteur.16 
</p>
<p><b> 1.  E-waste in India: facts and figures 
</b></p>
<p>66. UNEP estimates that 20 to 50 million tons of e-waste are generated worldwide on 
an annual basis. This volume is expected to increase at 3 to 5 per cent a year, that is, at a 
rate nearly three times faster than the growth in municipal waste streams.17 In comparison 
to the European and American markets, the increase in e-waste generation is slower in 
India, due to the late technological surge in the country and the tendency to use products for 
longer periods. However, in the first quarter of 2010, India&#8217;s personal computer sales 
touched 2.2 million, a growth of 33 per cent from the same period in 2009,18 and worldwide 
mobile phone sales increased by 17 per cent, thanks in part to the growth of emerging 
markets, including India.19  
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>67. The ongoing technological modernization of Indian society has increased the 
replacement frequency of electronic products, and has in turn led to a dramatic growth in 
the generation of e-waste. It has been estimated that 330,000 tons of e-waste are generated 
annually in India. By 2012, India is expected to cross the 800,000-ton mark.20 The 
generation of e-waste appears to be unevenly distributed, with the west and the south of 
India generating 65 per cent of this waste. Mumbai alone generates around 19,000 tons of 
e-waste per annum, and a substantial part of it is sent to recycling markets located in other 
parts of the country.21 The Government, banking and financial institutions and the industrial 
sector account for some 70 per cent of the e-waste produced. 
</p>
<p>68. In addition to locally generated e-waste, it appears that an additional 50,000 tons 
of end-of-life or obsolete EEE, especially computers, are illegally imported from countries 
where more restrictive legislation makes it more expensive to recycle locally.22 Such 
countries include the United States of America and European Union members.  
</p>
<p>69. At present, it appears that only 3 to 5 per cent of e-waste is recycled in authorized 
recycling facilities. The vast majority of EEE is currently collected, dismantled and 
processed in the informal sector by some 80,000 workers, including women and children, 
who earn their livelihood by breaking down old computers and other high-tech devices to 
recover precious metals such as gold, copper and silver. The work is done largely by hand, 
using rudimentary techniques. Workers recovering glass by hammering cathode ray tubes 
or heating PCBs to remove capacitors are a common sight in most workshops dismantling 
e-waste. Workers do not use any protective gear to guard against hazardous substances 
released during the breaking of obsolete EEE. 
</p>
<p>70. The Delhi area is the main hub for informal recycling of e-waste in India, with 
about 25,000 workers engaged in the various stages of the process. The recycling business 
is based on a network of collectors, traders and recyclers. Each phase of the process adds 
value to the materials and creates job opportunities for a great number of people. The e-
waste market is not centred in one main area, but is spread around different zones, each 
handling a specific stage of the process (for example storage, component separation, plastic 
shredding, acid processing/leaching, open burning and residue dumping).  
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>71. So far, India has not adopted any specific environmental laws or regulations on e-
waste. Existing laws and regulations on waste management do not contain any direct 
reference to e-waste nor do they provide any guidance on its sound management and 
disposal. However, since e-waste, or its constituents, fall under the category of &#8220;hazardous&#8221; 
and &#8220;non-hazardous waste&#8221;, they are covered under the purview of existing legislation, 
such as the Hazardous Wastes Rules, 2008, and the Municipal Solid Waste Rules, 2000. 
</p>
<p>72. In 2008, the Ministry of Environment and Forests issued the &#8220;Guidelines for the 
Environmentally Sound Management of E-waste&#8221;. Although not legally binding, the 
Guidelines contain a set of recommendations for all those who handle e-waste, including 
generators, collectors, transporters, dismantlers, and recyclers, irrespective of their scale of 
operation, to ensure the environmentally sound management of e-waste. The Guidelines 
incorporate the notion of extended producer responsibility, an environmental policy

consumer stage of a product&#8217;s life cycle, and the reduction of hazardous substances 
principle, which aims at reducing the use of hazardous substances for which safe substitutes 
have been found. 
</p>
<p>73. In May 2010, the Ministry finalized the draft e-waste (management and handling) 
rules, 2010. The draft rules have been developed in close consultation with civil society and 
the industry, and are expected to enter into force before the end of 2010. They apply to any 
person or enterprise involved in the manufacture, sale, purchase and processing of EEE or 
components. The rules contain detailed provisions on the responsibilities of producers, 
dealers, collection centres, dismantlers and recyclers of e-waste, and on the procedure to 
obtain authorization from the concerned State Pollution Control Board to handle e-waste.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Positive developments 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts made by Indian authorities to 
strengthen the existing legal and institutional framework for the environmentally sound 
management, handling and disposal of e-waste. These efforts include the launching of a 
nationwide awareness-raising campaign on the e-waste problem in India, especially in the 
large cities, and the creation of a National e-Waste Strategy Group under the leadership of 
the Ministry of Environment and Forests.  
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction the steps taken by the Government 
to prohibit the illegal import of e-waste to India, including appropriate training for custom 
authorities on the effective implementation of the Hazardous Waste Rules, 2008, and the 
establishment of an inter-ministerial coordination committee to coordinate the activities of 
the different central and local government agencies with responsibilities in the field of e-
waste.  
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur wishes to congratulate the Ministry of Environment and 
Forests for elaborating the first legally binding instrument devoted to the environmentally 
sound management and disposal of e-waste. He also welcomes the fact that the draft rules 
have been made available for public comment on the website of the Ministry.  
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that in line with the extended 
producer responsibility principle, producers of EEE are made responsible under the new 
draft rules to collect the e-waste generated for their end-of-life products and to ensure that 
such e-waste is channelled through registered dismantlers or recyclers. He also welcomes 
the fact that, in accordance with the reduction of hazardous substances principle, the rules 
require producers of EEE to comply, within a period of three years, with the threshold 
limits for the use of certain hazardous substances as prescribed in schedule III.  
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts made by the Government to 
encourage the establishment of e-waste recycling facilities through a Public Private 
Partnership model. He welcomes, in particular, the establishment in Roorkee of Attero 
Recycling, the first e-waste recycling facility certified by the Ministry of Environment and 
Forests to collect, dismantle, segregate, reuse and recycle the various components of 
obsolete EEE. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Major concerns 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur cannot but notice that at present, India does not have any 
law or regulation dealing specifically with e-waste, and that the existing legal framework is 
not sufficient to ensure that e-waste is managed and disposed of in such a way to ensure the 
protection of the human rights of individuals and communities who may be adversely 
affected by the unsound management and disposal of the hazardous substances contained in 
obsolete EEE.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>80. So far, legislation on waste management has not proved effective in prohibiting 
the illegal import of e-waste from developed countries. Loopholes in the Hazardous Wastes 
Rules, 2008, have facilitated the import of obsolete EEE &#8211; computers, in particular &#8211; as 
second-hand products just before they reach the end of their operating life (10 years). 
Illegal import to India of obsolete EEE can also be disguised as a donation or as a sale of 
scrap metal. Since the United States of America has not ratified the Basel Convention, the 
import of e-waste from the United States is expressly prohibited by article 4, paragraph 5, 
of the Convention, according to which a party &#8220;shall not permit hazardous wastes or other 
wastes (...) to be imported from a non-Party&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the new draft rules fail to 
recognize the reality of e-waste recycling in the country, where at least 95 per cent of e-
waste is dismantled and recycled by the informal sector. He considers that the new 
legislation does not provide sufficient protection for the estimated 80,000 persons working 
in the informal e-waste recycling sector and their families. The failure to incorporate the 
informal sector into Government strategies on the sound management and disposal of e-
waste constitutes, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, a violation of the obligations 
undertaken by the State under articles 6, 7 and 11 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the extremely dangerous recovery 
processes and techniques used in the informal e-waste recycling sector and their adverse 
effects on the right to health of those employed in small-scale informal workshops. Such 
health-threatening practices include the physical breaking of hazardous components, open-
air incineration and acid leaching to extract gold and copper, and the melting of lead. Most 
of these activities involve physical dismantling by bare hands and basic tools. Workers do 
not use any protective gear to prevent exposure to the hazardous substances contained in 
EEE; indeed, most of them possess very little or no knowledge of the risks associated with 
the handling of these hazardous substances or the precautions to use to minimize their 
adverse health effects.  
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned by the long-lasting and widespread 
contamination caused by the unsound disposal of e-waste into the environment. Unusable 
parts of obsolete EEE are usually disposed of in landfills or burned. E-waste disposed in 
landfills can leach heavy metals and other toxins into the soil and contaminate groundwater 
resources used for drinking or domestic purposes by local populations. Open-air burning of 
e-waste can release dioxins and furans &#8211; two persistent organic pollutants resulting from the 
burning of flame retardants found in plastics &#8211; into the air. Local communities living close 
to the areas where e-waste is dismantled and recycled do not appear to be aware of these 
risks. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  International obligations 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government take all 
appropriate measures to give full effect to international human rights treaties to 
which India is a party, and notably the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in 
domestic law.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes that India is not a party to several 
International Labour Organization conventions on health and safety at work, and 
calls on the Government to consider ratifying these conventions, in particular the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention concerning Occupational Safety and Health and the Working 
Environment, 1981</b> (<b>No. 155) and</b> <b>the Convention concerning Safety in the Use of 
Chemicals at Work, 1990 </b>(<b>No. 170). 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Constitutional and legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that India has developed a 
comprehensive constitutional and legal framework for the promotion and protection 
of human rights. India is one of the few countries in the world that has included 
specific provisions on the protection and promotion of a safe and healthy environment 
in its Constitution. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes in particular the significant role played by 
national courts in strengthening the justiciability of economic, social and cultural 
rights laid down in part IV of the Constitution. He also notes with satisfaction that the 
Supreme Court has on a number of occasions recognized the right to a safe and 
healthy environment as being implicit in the fundamental right to life. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>India has developed a comprehensive legal framework to ensure the sound 
management and disposal of hazardous products and wastes. However, the Special 
Rapporteur notes with concern that this legislation is not effectively implemented. He 
is also concerned about the insufficient enforcement of existing labour legislation at 
the federal and the state levels, as well as the lack of awareness among employers on 
the existing rules and standards.  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur is of the view that the current institutional 
framework is inadequate for responding to the emerging health and environmental 
challenges posed by the generation, management, handling, transport and disposal of 
toxic and dangerous products and wastes. He shares the view expressed by the 
Supreme Court Monitoring Committee on Management of Hazardous Wastes that 
institutional failure at different levels has to be regarded as the main cause for weak 
application of existing laws for pollution control and environmental protection.23 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the role and functions of the 
central and state government institutions responsible for the implementation and 
enforcement of national legislation on hazardous substances and toxic waste 
management be better defined, and that appropriate mechanisms be developed to 
ensure better coordination and cooperation among these institutions.  
</b></p>
<p><b> Enforcement and monitoring </b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government take all 
appropriate measures to provide adequate human, technical and financial resources 
to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the State Pollution Control 
Boards, in order to improve their capacity to effectively enforce, and monitor 
compliance with, the existing legal framework on hazardous substances and waste 
management. He also recommends that the Government consider establishing a new 
</b></p>
<p>  
 23 Report of the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee on Management of Hazardous Wastes, vol. I 
</p>
<p>(November 2006), p. 58. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>national environment protection authority to carry out some of the functions 
currently discharged by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and CPCB. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur further recommends that India adopt all appropriate 
measures to curb illegal import of hazardous waste. Such measures should include the 
allocation of adequate human and financial resources to customs authorities, the 
provision of adequate training opportunities for customs officials and the upgrade of 
laboratory facilities in the major ports of the country. The country should also 
strengthen its capacity to prosecute and punish environmental crimes by, inter alia, 
organizing appropriate training opportunities for judges and prosecutors. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Shipbreaking 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Special Rapporteur finds that national legislation on health and safety in 
the workplace and environmental protection has not been properly implemented by 
the shipbreaking industry or enforced by the Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB), the 
Mumbai Port Trust (MPT) and the State Pollution Control Boards. He also notes that 
the Supreme Court order of 6 September 2007 has not been fully complied with by the 
responsible agencies. He urges the yard owners to comply with their obligations under 
national legislation, and encourages central and local government authorities, 
including GMB, MPT, the State Pollution Control Boards and the National Institute 
of Occupational Health, to enforce relevant legislation and apply the sanctions 
provided for by the law in case of non-compliance.   
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress that the informal nature or the 
seasonal character of shipbreaking activities, which depend on the demand for 
recycled steel and on the cost of recycling operations, cannot &#8211; and must not &#8211; be 
invoked as a reason to justify the non-implementation of national labour standards. 
All workers, including semi-skilled and unskilled workers, should be provided with a 
written contract of employment, which constitutes an essential precondition for 
ensuring job security and the effective exercise of core labour rights. Such a contract 
should indicate, at the very least, the job duties, the duration of employment, 
compensation and benefits, and should be terminated only in the circumstances 
provided for by the law.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Regulatory authorities in Alang/Sosiya and the shipbreaking industry should 
step up their efforts to improve health and safety in the yards. Such measures should 
include the provision of appropriate personal protective equipments (PPEs) for those 
who work in specialized areas, the creation of additional training opportunities and 
safety workshops, and regular exercises in emergency prevention, preparedness and 
response procedures. With regard to Mumbai, the Special Rapporteur urges MPT 
and the shipbreaking industry to adopt all appropriate measures, without further 
delay, to ensure that all workers in the yards receive and use appropriate PPEs and 
have access to formal training opportunities. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Regulatory authorities and the industry should also organize training 
opportunities and awareness-raising initiatives to provide workers and the local 
population with adequate information on the health risks arising from long-term 
exposure to hazardous substances and materials present on end-of-life ships. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government take steps, to the 
maximum of its available resources, to remove the obstacles that currently prevent 
those working in the informal economy to have access to social security on an equal 
basis with other workers. Regulatory authorities in Alang/Sosiya and Mumbai should, 
in consultation with the shipbreaking industry and workers&#8217; associations, consider </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/22/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>developing informal social security schemes to ensure a minimum level of coverage of 
risks and contingencies for all workers in the yards. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges regulatory authorities in Alang/Sosiya and the 
industry to allocate additional human, technical and financial resources to existing 
health facilities in Alang/Sosiya. Since no facilities of a permanent nature, except first-
aid and ambulance services, exist in Mumbai, the Special Rapporteur urges MPT and 
the shipbreaking industry to establish such facilities with no further delay.  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned at the poor conditions in 
which most workers live, especially in Mumbai. He calls on GMB and MPT to provide 
appropriate plots of lands, and to facilitate &#8211; with the financial help of the 
shipbreaking industry &#8211; the construction of adequate housing facilities for those who 
work in the yards. Adequate access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities 
should also be provided within and outside the yards. Taking into account that about 
20 per cent of workers are accompanied by their families, the Special Rapporteur also 
calls on the Government of India and regulatory authorities to establish and maintain 
schools or formal education facilities for the children of those employed in the yards. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Finally, the Special Rapporteur recommends that an independent study be 
carried out to assess the actual and potential adverse effects caused by the discharge 
of hazardous substances and materials into the natural environment. Such a study 
should also assess the steps that need to be taken for the gradual phasing out of 
&#8220;beaching&#8221; in favour of more environmentally friendly methods of shipbreaking. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. E-waste 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls on the Ministry of Environment and Forests to 
finalize, as a matter of priority and in close consultation with civil society 
organizations and the e-waste informal recycling sector, the adoption of the e-waste 
(management and handling) rules, 2010.  
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that India develop a national 
implementation plan to ensure the sound management and disposal of e-waste. Such a 
plan should identify appropriate incentives to ensure that obsolete electrical and 
electronic equipment (EEE) be dismantled and recycled only in authorized recycling 
facilities, and facilitate the integration of the informal sector &#8211; which at present 
recycles at least 95 per cent of e-waste generated or imported into the country &#8211; in the 
new Government policies on the sound management and disposal of e-waste. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges Indian authorities to adopt all appropriate 
measures to improve health and safety working conditions in small-scale informal 
workshops. Such measures should include the organization of safety trainings for 
workers and awareness-raising campaigns on the risks associated with the improper 
handling and disposal of hazardous substances contained in obsolete EEE, as well as 
on the precautions to adopt in order to minimize any adverse effects on health and the 
environment.</b> 
</p>
<p>104. <b>Lastly, the Special Rapporteur considers that the new draft rules might be 
ineffective in controlling illegal trade, since they prohibit only the import of EEE in 
India for charity. He recommends that the current draft be reviewed to include 
specific provisions to prohibit the import of obsolete EEE &#8211; in particular computers &#8211; 
as scrap metal or second-hand products.
