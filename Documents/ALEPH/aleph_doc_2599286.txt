Executive Chairman’s Review of Operations
KEY POINTS FOR THE 6 MONTHS ENDING 30 JUNE 2016
  Group EBITDAX $1.4 million (30 June 2015: $2.2 million). 
 
  After tax profit was $13.6 million (after write-back of previously impaired assets plus the
addition of new assets).
  Production 1,109 Boe/d (30 June 2015:1,151 Boe/d). 
 
  2P PV10 59% higher at $70.8mm (compared to 2015 report at $44.5mm). 
 
  2P reserves 8% higher at 13.7 MMBoe (compared to 2015 report at 12.7MMBoe). 
 
  McArthur Basin Prospective Resource increased P(50)* of 2,068 MMBoe. 
 
  Cash flow positive at current oil and gas prices 
 
  Net tangible assets per share $0.10 (30 June 2015: $0.13)
* “Prospective Resource”- is the estimated quantities of petroleum that may potentially be recovered by the 
application of a future  development project(s) relate to undiscovered accumulations. These estimates  have 
both an associated risk of discovery and a risk of development. Further exploration appraisal and evaluation 
is required to determine the existence of a significant quantity of potentially moveable hydrocarbons. 
 
Valuation of assets 
 
At December 31, 2015 due to prevailing oil and gas prices and production environment, it was determined that 
a  majority  of  undeveloped  locations  were  uneconomic  at  the  time.  At  June  30,  2016,  with  an  improved 
production  environment for both oil  and gas, slightly  improved prices, the  addition of new reserves through 
updated seismic and additional leases, a newly engineered water flood program and a review of behind pipe 
opportunities,  the  Company  undertook  a  review  of  reserves  at  the  half  year.  2P  reserves  increased  by 
1.0MMBoe to 13.7MMBoe and the PV10 for 2P reserves increased by 59% to $70.8 million. This led to a non-
cash write-back of approximately $20.6 million  against the December 31,  2015 asset impairment charge of 
$22.2 million.

Conversion of natural gas to a barrel of oil equivalent is based on a 6:1 ratio. Although this 
conversion ratio may  be useful in terms of energy  equivalents, it is not relevant  in terms of 
value equivalent.

1.2
Lifting Costs - includes lease operating expenses, production and ad valorem taxes.
Reserves – reserves where updated as of June 30, 2016 by Ralph E Davis Associates, Inc., 
Houston, TX (Appalachian and MidCon assets). Prices for reserve calculations were NYMEX 
strip as at close June 30, 2016.
EBITDAX Reporting 
 
In  addition  to  the  information  presented  in  the  financial  report,  to  assist  stakeholders  in  gaining  a  clearer 
understanding of the financial and operational aspects of the Company, a presentation of financial results with 
reference to EBITDAX reporting has been included.  
 
Statements may make reference to the terms “EBITDAX”, Field EBITDAX, “netback”, “cash flow” and “payout 
ratio”, which are non-IFRS financial measures that do not have any standardised meaning prescribed by IFRS. 
Management have attempted to ensure these non-IFRS measures are consistent with reporting by other similar 
E&P companies so useful production and financial comparisons can be made.  
 
IFRS  accounts  have  been  based  on  an  accrual  basis  (effective  date).  The  EBITDAX  accounts,  based  on 
production  date,  are  not  meant  to  reconcile  to  the  statutory  accounts.  However,  EBITDAX  prepared  on  an 
effective date basis can be reconciled to the statutory accounts. At the  time of this  EBITDAX report, actual 
numbers for production, income and expenses have been utilised. The following EBITDAX report is prepared 
on a production date basis. 
 
EBITDAX  represents  net  income  (loss)  before  interest  expense,  taxes,  depreciation,  amortization, 
development and exploration and reserve growth related expenses. Management believes that:
 
 


EBITDAX provides stakeholders with a simple and clear measure of our operating performance;
EBITDAX  is  an  important  measure  of  operating  performance  and  highlights  trends  in  our  core 
business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on current statutory accounting 
and financial measures;
Securities  analysts,  investors  and  other  interested  parties  frequently  use  EBITDAX  in  the 
comparative evaluation of  companies, many companies now present  EBITDAX when reporting 
their results;
  Management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors, banks, research
analysts and others, rely on the use of EBITDAX to assess: 
-
the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure 
or historical cost basis;  
the  ability  of  our  assets  to  generate  cash  sufficient  to  pay  interest  costs  and  support  our 
indebtedness; 
our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in 
our industry, without regard to financing or capital structure; and  
the feasibility of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return 
on alternative investment opportunities.
-
-
-
  Unlike  IFRS  accounting  policies  which  constantly  change,  EBITDAX  reporting  provides 
consistency  over  accounting  periods  to  enable  stakeholders  to  receive  a  precise  snap  shot  of 
historic business operations.

C.  MCARTHUR BASIN, NT – A LARGE EMERGING PETROLEUM PLAY 
 
The McArthur Basin is an underexplored yet emerging petroleum frontier basin with direct indications of oil and 
gas.  To  date  there  has  been  very  little  petroleum  exploration  in  the  Batten  Trough,  located  in  the  southern 
portion of the McArthur Basin and no petroleum exploration in the Walker Trough located in the northern portion 
of the McArthur Basin. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Imperial Oil & Gas Pty Ltd (‘Imperial’), holds 
approximately 14.6 million acres of leases and lease applications in the onshore McArthur Basin.  
 
Farmout Agreement 
 
The  Northern  Territory  Farm-out  with  AEGP  Pty  Ltd,  an  affiliate  of  American  Energy  Partners,  LP  (‘AEP’), 
signed  on  December  22,  2015,  did  not  close  on  April  20,  2016.  Ongoing  discussions  continue  with  the 
McClendon Estate, following the deferment of the completion  of the Northern Territory Farmout Agreement 
due to the unexpected passing of Mr. Aubrey McClendon. It seems unlikely that the McClendon Estate wish 
to proceed with the Farmout, the Company is currently in negotiation with other parties to continue a similar 
exploration program.   
 
Ongoing program – Northern Territory  
 
Until the parties to the Farmout Agreement between Imperial and the McClendon Estate resolve the current 
situation, the planned seismic and drilling program for 2016 has been deferred. The exploration program has 
been scaled back to focus on defining the Tawallah Group resource. To date these studies have indicated an 
additional Prospective Resource P50 of approximately 240MMBoe.

1.5 The New York Fracking Ban 
 
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation’s (‘DEC’) de facto moratorium on hydraulic 
fracturing in New York State ended on 1 July 2011. The moratorium was subsequently extended. In December 
2014 the Department of Health and Governor Cuomo announced that hydraulic fracturing be prohibited in New 
York State. As a result of the New York fracking moratorium, the Company has not been able to develop the 
most lucrative aspects of its ~300,000 acres of lease holdings in New York State. The Company continues to 
aggregate HBP acreage whenever possible.

Notes to Reserves 
 
•  An  updated  Reserve  Estimate,  NYMEX  strip  prices  as  at  30  June  2016,  was  completed  in  August 
2016 and be viewed on the Company’s website or the ASX website. The announcement was titled “1P 
Reserve Values up by 65%” and was dated 23 August 2016.
•  The scope of the Reserve Studies reviewed basic information to prepare estimates of the reserves
and contingent resources.
•  The quantities presented are estimated reserves and resources of oil and natural gas that geologic
and engineering data demonstrate are “In-Place”, and can be recovered from known reservoirs.
•  Oil prices are based on NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI). 
•  Gas prices are based on NYMEX Henry Hub (HH). 
•  Prices were adjusted for any pricing differential from field prices due to adjustments for location, quality 
and gravity, against the NYMEX price. This pricing differential was held constant to the economic limit 
of the properties.
•  All costs are held constant throughout the lives of the properties. 
•  The probabilistic method was used to calculate P50 reserves. 
•  The deterministic method was used to calculate 1P, 2P & 3P reserves. 
•  The  reference  point  used  for  the  purpose  of  measuring  and  assessing  the  estimated  petroleum

reserves is the wellhead. 
“PV0”  Net  revenue  is  calculated  net  of  royalties,  production  taxes,  lease  operating  expenses,  and 
capital expenditures but before Federal Income Taxes. 
“PV10” is defined as the discounted Net Revenues of the Company’s reserves using a 10% discount 
factor. 
“1P Reserves” or “Proved Reserves” are defined as Reserves which have a 90% probability that the 
actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. 
“Probable  Reserves”  are  defined  as  Reserves  that  should  have  at  least  a  50%  probability  that  the 
actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. 
“Possible  Reserves”  are  defined  as  Reserves  that  should  have  at  least  a  10%  probability  that  the 
actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. 
“Bbl” is defined as a barrel of oil. 
“Boe” is defined as a barrel of oil equivalent, using the ratio of 6 Mcf of Natural Gas to 1 Bbl of Crude 
Oil. This is based on energy conversion and does not reflect the current economic difference between 
the value of 1 Mcf of Natural Gas and 1 Bbl of Crude Oil.  
“M” is defined as a thousand.  
“MM” is defined as a million. 
“MMBoe” is defined as a million barrels of oil equivalent. 
“Mcf” is defined as a thousand cubic feet of gas.

• 
•  All volumes presented are net volumes and have had subtracted associated royalty burdens. 
•  Utica  shale  gas  potential  resources  have  only  been  calculated  for  the  region  where  drill  data  is 
available.  Very  few  wells  have  been  drilled  into  the  Utica  in  Western  NY  and  NW  Pennsylvania. 
Estimates  for  GIP  have  been  made  were  the  few  existing  wells  have  been  drilled.  Empire  holds 
additional  acreage  outside  the  current  potential  resource  region.  It  is  expected  that  as  with  shale 
characteristics,  the  shale  formations  will  continue  within  the  remaining  acreage.  The  potential  GIP 
should increase if more data was available.

EMPIRE ENERGY GROUP LIMITED
and its controlled entities
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
for the half-year ended 30 June 2016 
 
NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
Empire Energy Group Limited (“Company”) is a Company domiciled in Australia. The condensed consolidated 
interim financial report of the Company for the half-year ended 30 June 2016 comprises the Company and its 
controlled entities (“Consolidated Entity”). 
 
These  general  purpose  financial  statements  for  the  interim  half-year  reporting  period  ended  30  June  2016 
have been prepared in accordance with complied Australian Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial 
Reporting and the Corporations Act 2001. Compliance with AASB 134 ensures compliance with International 
Reporting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting.  
 
These general purpose financial statements do not include all the notes of the type normally included in annual 
financial statements.   Accordingly, these financial statements are to be read  in conjunction  with the annual 
report for the year ended 31 December 2015 and any public announcements made by the Company  during 
the interim reporting period in accordance with the continuous disclosure requirements of the Corporations Act 
2001. 
 
Due  to  international  operations,  the  Company’s  cash  flows  and  economic  returns  are  denominated  in  US 
dollars (“US$”). The Company changed the currency in which it presents its consolidated financial statements 
from Australian dollars (“A$”) to US$ on 1 July 2011.  
 
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial  year and corresponding 
interim reporting period. 
 
Going concern 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the 
realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 
The Empire Group’s Statement of Financial Position reflects an excess of current liabilities over current assets 
of  $35,049,444.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  Board  determining  the  debt  facilities  be  classified  as  current 
liabilities. Net assets are $33.33 million 
 
In April 2016 the debt facilities were extended for a further three years. The Group is required to make a debt 
repayment of US$1,500,000 (refer to Note 7) under Tranche D of the Term Loan due on 16 September 2016. 
In August 2016 shareholders approved that the Company raise up to $5m to provide liquidity to acquire oil and 
gas  assets  in a weak,  onshore USA  merger  and acquisition  market;  enhance the balance sheet  to  provide 
adequate  working  capital  or  equity  cushion  to  enable  continued  accessibility  of  the  existing  credit  facility, 
including the repayment of the debt payment; and to provide general working capital. 
 
The directors have reviewed the Group’s financial position  and are  of the  opinion that the use of the going 
concern basis of accounting is appropriate as they believe the Group will be able to secure additional funds to 
meet  the  debt  repayment  and  any  other  working  capital  requirements,  as  and  when  required.  However,  if 
market conditions  materially  change  and  the  Group  is  not  successful  in securing  sufficient  additional  funds 
when  required,  then  there  may  be  uncertainty  about  whether  the  Group  is  able  to  realise  its  assets  and 
extinguish its liabilities in the normal course of business at the amounts stated in the financial report. 
 
The  financial  report  does  not  contain  any  adjustments  relating  to  the  recoverability  and  classification  of 
recorded assets or to the  amounts or classification of recorded assets or liabilities that might be necessary 
should the Group not be able to continue as a going concern.   
 
New, revised or amending Accounting Standards and Interpretations adopted 
The  consolidated  entity  has  adopted  all  of  the  new,  revised  or  amending  Accounting  Standards  and 
Interpretations  issued  by  the  Australian  Accounting  Standards  Board  (‘AASB’)  that  are  mandatory  for  the 
current reporting period.
20
EMPIRE ENERGY GROUP LIMITED 
and its controlled entities
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
for the half-year ended 30 June 2016  
 
Any new revised or amending Accounting Standards or Interpretations that are not  yet mandatory have not 
been early adopted. 
 
The  adoption  of  these  Accounting  Standards  and  Interpretations  did  not  have  any  material  impact  on  the 
financial performance or position of the consolidated entity.  
 
NOTE 2 – LEASE EXPIRATION EXPENSES 
 
A charge of $202,300 has been taken against the book value of undeveloped leases which have expired, or 
are to expire. The Company has an ongoing program to renew expiring leases, to take up options on expiring 
leases or acquire new leases if and when possible. The charge is a non-cash entry which has no effect on 
cash-flows. 
 
NOTE 3 – INCOME TAX EXPENSE 
 
Included in the income tax expense for the six month period is an expense of $27,283 which relates to revising 
the estimated deferred tax liability to reflect changes made on lodgement of the Income tax Return for Empire 
Energy Holdings LLC.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
for the half-year ended 30 June 2016  
 
NOTE 6 - OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (Cont’d) 
 
At December 31, 2015 due to prevailing oil and gas prices and production environment, it was determined that 
a majority of undeveloped locations were not viable or were uneconomic at the time. At June 30, 2016, with 
an improved production environment for both oil and gas, slightly improved prices, the addition of new reserves 
through  updated  seismic  and  additional  leases,  a  newly  engineered  water  flood  program  and  a  review  of 
behind pipe opportunities, the Company undertook a review of reserves at the half year. 1P reserves increased 
by 1.3MMBoe to 7.2MMBoe with a PV8 for 1P reserves now $53.8 million. This led to a non-cash write-back 
of approximately $20.6 million against the December 31, 2015 asset impairment charge of $22.2 million.  
 
NOTE 7 - INTEREST BEARING LIABILITIES 
 
These accounts are presented on the basis that all borrowings have been classified as current liabilities. This 
treatment is as a result of a strict application of the relevant provisions of AASB 101 Presentation of Financial 
Statements ("AASB 101"). This accounting standard requires the Group to classify liabilities as current if the 
Group does not have an unconditional right to defer payment for twelve months at period end.  However, the 
expected  repayment  of  the  borrowings  is  not  for  complete  repayment  within  the  twelve  month  period.  In 
February 2016 the Company extended the Facility for a further 3 years through to 26 February 2019.  
 
Credit facility summary 
 
Empire Energy USA, LLC maintains a long-term credit facility with Macquarie Bank Limited (Macquarie), which 
matures in February 2019, consisting of the following:
Revolver facility (revolving line-of-credit):

Other features of the credit facility: 
 
Outstanding  borrowings  under  the  facilities  are  secured  by  a  majority  of  the  assets  of  the  Company.    The 
Revolver and Term Facility are guaranteed by the Company.  
 
Reserve Assessment of 1P reserves are based on third party reserve engineering consultants.  
 
Under terms of the facilities, the Company is required to maintain financial ratios customary for the oil and gas 
industry.    These  include  certain  operational  and  financial  covenants  for  which  the  Company  is  required  to 
maintain, the most restrictive of which is the adjusted proved developed producing (PDP) present value (PV).
Key financial covenants:

Amendments to Credit Facility:

hedges) at November 1, 2016. 
1.0x Current Ratio. 
1.8x EBITDA/Interest Ratio.
1% on draw down amount.
In February 2016, the credit facility was extended for 3 years.  Under this extension the Company agreed to 
allocate US$5 million of the initial US$7.5 million payment to be received from American Energy Partners, LP 
(AEP) on April 20, 2016 (as part of an 80% Farmout of the Company’s interest in its McArthur Basin, Northern 
Territory  project).  The  unexpected  death  of  Mr.  Aubrey  McClendon,  Founder  of  AEP,  has  meant  that  the 
closing of Farmout is unlikely to occur, with the AEP Farmout now an asset controlled by the Trustee of the 
McClendon Estate. Without receipt of  the  US$5 million, the  Company  entered  into  two  amendments  to the 
credit facility, the key items are as follows:
•  The  payment  of  US$5  million  or  future  payments  from  the  Farmout  Agreement  have  been
cancelled.  
In its place, a payment of US$1.5 million is due on September 16, 2016.
• 
•  Margins payable on the credit facility increased from an average of LIBOR+4.7% to LIBOR+6.5%. 
•  The Interest Rate Coverage Ratio, on an ongoing last 4 quarterly rollover basis, to be changed
from 2.5x to 1.8x.
•  The Loan to Asset Coverage Ratio’s are as set out above.
The original Macquarie credit agreement assigned warrants to Macquarie to purchase 10% of the equity in the 
Company’s subsidiary Empire Energy USA, LLC (EEUSA). Under the new Credit Facility signed in February 
2016,  previous  warrants  expired  and  were  replaced  with  a  new  agreement.  Keys  points  in  relation  to  the 
warrants are as follows:
•  Macquarie can exercise warrants at $0.01 to purchase 10% of the equity in EEUSA. 
•  Costs of the warrants are treated as a transaction cost and amortised over the life of the loan.  
•  Amortisation of the warrants over the current period is $113,000.

The Empire Group makes full provision for the future costs of decommissioning oil and gas production facilities 
and pipelines on a discounted basis on the installation or acquisition of those facilities. 
 
The provision represents the present value of decommissioning costs which are expected to be incurred up to 
2050. 
 
The estimated liability is based on historical experience in plugging and abandoning wells, estimated remaining 
lives of those based on reserve estimates, external estimates as to the cost to plug and abandon the wells in 
the future, and regulatory requirements. Assumptions, based on the current economic environment, have been 
made which management  believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability. These 
estimates  are  reviewed  regularly  to  take  into  account  any  material  changes  to  the  assumptions.  However, 
actual  decommissioning  costs  will  ultimately  depend  upon  future  market  prices  for  the  necessary 
decommissioning works. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the assets 
cease to produce at economically viable rates. This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which 
are inherently uncertain.

profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive  Income,  consolidated  statement  of  changes  in  equity  and 
consolidated statement of cash flows for the half-year ended on that date, notes comprising a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration. 
 
Directors’ Responsibility for the Interim Financial Report 
 
The  directors  of  the  company  are  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  half-year 
financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the 
Corporations  Act  2001  and  for  such  control  as  the  directors  determine  is  necessary  to  enable  the 
preparation of  the  interim financial  report  that is  free  from material  misstatement, whether  due  to fraud or 
error. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
 
Our  responsibility  is  to  express  a  conclusion  on  the  half-year  financial  report  based  on  our  review.  We 
conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review 
of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether, on the 
basis  of  the  procedures  described,  we  have  become  aware  of  any  matter  that  makes  us  believe  that  the 
half-year  financial  report  is  not  in  accordance  with  the  Corporations  Act  2001  including:  giving  a  true  and 
fair view of the Group’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and its performance for the half-year ended on 
that  date;  and  complying  with  Australian  Accounting  Standard  AASB  134  Interim  Financial  Reporting  and 
the Corporations Regulations 2001. As auditor of Empire Energy Group Limited, ASRE 2410 requires that 
we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the annual financial report.  
 
A  review  of  a  half-year  financial  report  consists  of  making  enquiries,  primarily  of  persons  responsible  for 
financial  and  accounting  matters,  and  applying  analytical  and  other  review  procedures.  A  review  is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted  in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards and 
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters 
that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. 
 
Independence
In conducting our review, we complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001.

Conclusion 
 
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us 
believe  that  the  half-year  financial  report  of  Empire  Energy  Group  Limited  is  not  in  accordance  with 
the Corporations Act 2001, including:
a.  giving  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  Group’s  financial  position  as  at  30  June  2016  and  of  its
performance for the half-year ended on that date; and
b.  complying  with  Australian  Accounting  Standard  AASB  134  Interim  Financial  Reporting  and
the Corporations Regulations 2001.
Emphasis of Matter 
 
Without  further  modifying  our  conclusion,  we  draw  your  attention  to  Note  1  ‘Going  concern’  of  the 
financial report, which indicates the company has an excess of current liabilities over current assets of 
$35,049,444  as  at  30  June  2016.  The  Company  is  required  to  repay  debt  of  $1,500,000  by  16 
September 2016 and is currently undertaking a capital raise of up to $5m via a share issue. 
 
The financial report had been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes continuity of normal 
business activities, the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the ordinary courses of 
business. 
 
In Note 1, the directors state why they consider the going concern basis used in the preparation of the 
financial  report  is  appropriate.  As  discussed  in  that  note,  if  the  capital  raising  does  not  generate 
sufficient funds, there exists a material uncertainty as to whether the Company and the Group will be 
able to continue as a going concern and therefore, the Group may be unable to realise its assets and 
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
