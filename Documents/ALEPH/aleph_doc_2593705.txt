time to time award stock options to any eligible participant. Stock options give
the holder
the right to purchase shares of our Common Stock within a specified time at a 
specified price. Two types of stock options may be granted under the 2016 Plan: 
ISOs, which are subject to special U.S. tax treatment as described below, and 
nonstatutory
options, or &#147;NSOs.&#148; As specified in the applicable award agreement, 
awards of stock options may be subject to vesting conditions, may provide for 
accelerated exercisability, including in the event of the optionee&#146;s death,
disability,
or retirement or other events, and may provide for expiration in the event the 
optionee ceases to be an employee. The exercise price of a stock option shall be
the fair market value (as defined in the 2016 Plan) of a share of Common Stock 
at the
time of grant as determined by the Committee unless the option is being granted 
in substitution for an outstanding option as part of a corporate transaction 
(such as a merger). Notwithstanding, if an ISO is granted to a person who, at 
the time of
grant, owns Common Stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting 
power of all classes of our voting stock, such ISO cannot have an exercise price
less than 110% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock at the time 
of grant
and cannot expire more than five (5)&nbsp;years after the date of the original 
grant. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-

stock option
may be paid in cash or cash equivalents or, at the discretion of the Committee, 
by the surrender of Common Stock already owned by the optionee, by delivering an
irrevocable instruction directing a securities broker to sell all or part of the
shares
being purchased, by delivering a full recourse promissory note, or by making 
payment in any other form consistent with applicable law. Except as otherwise 
provided in the 2016 Plan and except as described in an award agreement for MIP 
Shares that
are granted in the form of stock options designated as NSOs, no grant of options
can become exercisable sooner than after one (1)&nbsp;year. The expiration dates
of options cannot be more than ten (10)&nbsp;years after the date of the 
original
grant. The Committee may offer to buy out an outstanding stock option for cash 
or cash equivalents or authorize an optionee to elect to cash out an outstanding
option provided that cash payments shall not exceed the fair market value less 
the
exercise price. Prior to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the
exercise of a stock option, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other

may grant stock appreciation rights under the 2016 Plan; provided that no grant 
of stock
appreciation rights may become exercisable sooner than after one (1)&nbsp;year. 
A stock appreciation right entitles the holder upon exercise to receive an 
amount in shares of Common Stock, cash or a combination thereof (as determined 
by the
Committee), computed by reference to appreciation in the value of our Common 
Stock. Stock appreciation rights may be granted alone or in tandem with a stock 
option. As specified in the applicable award agreement, awards of stock 
appreciation rights
may be subject to vesting conditions, may provide for accelerated 
exercisability, including in the event of the holder&#146;s death, disability, 
or retirement or other events, and may provide for forfeiture in the event the 
holder ceases to be an
employee. The exercise price of a stock appreciation right cannot be less than 
100% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant. 
Upon exercise, the holder of a stock appreciation right will receive shares of 
Common
Stock, cash, or a combination of both, as the Committee shall determine. Prior 
to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of a stock 
appreciation right, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as
a stockholder will
exist for the underlying shares. <I> </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-

ALIGN="justify"><I>Restricted Shares</I>.&nbsp;A grant of restricted shares 
involves the immediate transfer by
us to a participant of ownership of a specific number of shares of Common Stock 
in consideration of the performance of services. The Committee may grant 
restricted shares of Common Stock to eligible participants, in the amounts, and 
subject to the
terms and conditions as the Committee determines in its discretion, as specified
in an applicable restricted shares award agreement. Such award agreement may 
provide for accelerated vesting of the restricted shares, including in the event
of the
participant&#146;s death, disability or other events. Awards of restricted 
shares of Common Stock may be made in exchange for services or other lawful 
consideration and may or may not be contingent on the satisfaction of 
performance targets. Except
as otherwise described in an applicable award agreement or in the 2016 Plan, no 
grant of restricted shares will have the restrictions eliminated for a period of
time shorter than three (3)&nbsp;years if based only on the passage of time 
rather than
performance targets, except that the restrictions may be removed ratably during 
the three-year period as determined by the Committee. Awards of restricted 
shares may be subject to vesting conditions and to the attainment of performance
criteria as
specified in the applicable award agreement. If the award is intended to satisfy
the requirements of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, such performance target 
will be based on one or more criteria as specified in the 2016 Plan and may be 
subject to
other restrictions as applicable. Any conditions to vesting and performance 
criteria may be waived in the event of a change in control of the Company, or 
the holder&#146;s death or disability. </P>

agreement may require that dividends be accumulated and paid when the restricted
shares

holder. Any dividends not paid currently will be subject to the same conditions 
and restrictions, including the risk of forfeiture, as the related award;

underlying restricted shares with restrictions that lapse as a result of

grant units
having a value equal to an identical number of shares of Common Stock to such 
eligible participants, in such amounts, and subject to such terms and conditions
as the Committee determines in its discretion. Awards of stock units, other than
awards of
stock units that are MIP Shares, may be subject to vesting conditions and to the
attainment of performance criteria as specified in the applicable award 
agreement. Such stock units award agreement may provide for accelerated vesting 
of the stock
units, including in the event of the participant&#146;s death, disability or 
other events. Except as otherwise provided in the 2016 Plan and except as 
described in an award agreement for MIP Shares that are granted in the form of 
stock units, no
grant of stock units will have the restrictions eliminated for a period of time 
shorter than three (3)&nbsp;years if based only on the passage of time rather 
than performance targets, except that the restrictions may be removed ratably 
during the
three-year period as determined by the Committee. If the stock units (other than
the stock units that are MIP Shares) specify that the period of restriction will
terminate only upon the achievement of performance targets or that the stock 
units will
be earned based on the achievement of performance targets, then, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this paragraph, the period of restriction 
may not be less than one (1)&nbsp;year. Other than with respect to the stock 
units that
are MIP Shares, the Committee may include as vesting conditions or as conditions
for any award of stock units the requirement that the performance of the Company
or a business unit of the Company for a specified period (not less than one
(1)&nbsp;year) equal or exceed a target determined in advance by the Committee. 
If the award of stock units is intended to satisfy the requirements of 
Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, such target will be based on one or more of the
criteria set
forth in the 2016 Plan and may be subject to other restrictions as applicable. 
Any conditions to vesting and/or performance target may be waived in the event 
of a change in control of the Company, or the participant&#146;s death or

receive shares
of Common Stock, cash or any combination thereof, equal to the fair market value
of the corresponding number of shares of Common Stock. Payment of such amount 
may be deferred until a later date. Stock units awarded under the 2016 Plan may 
include a
right to receive dividend equivalents, which would entitle the holder of a stock
unit to receive a credit for the amount equal to the dividends paid on an equal 
number of shares of our Common Stock while the stock unit is outstanding. If the
stock
units become vested, dividend equivalents are settled in the same manner as 
stock units and, prior to distribution, any dividend equivalents that are not 
paid are subject to the same terms and conditions as the stock units to which 
they attach;
provided, however, that dividend equivalents or other distributions on shares of
Common Stock underlying stock units with restrictions that lapse as a result of 
achievement of performance targets will be deferred until and paid contingent

structure certain awards so that they may be able to qualify as &#147;qualified
performance-based compensation&#148; under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. If 
our equity awards qualify as &#147;qualified performance-based 
compensation&#148; for purposes of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, then we 
would generally be able to
receive a federal income tax deduction for certain compensation paid to our 
chief executive officer and the other three most highly compensated executive 
officers (other than our chief financial officer) in excess of $1 million for 
any taxable year.
While we believe it is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders
to have the ability to potentially grant &#147;qualified performance-based 
compensation&#148; under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, we may decide to grant
compensation
that will not qualify as &#147;qualified performance-based compensation&#148; 
for purposes of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code. Moreover, even if we intend to 
grant compensation that qualifies as &#147;qualified performance-based 
compensation&#148;
for purposes of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, we cannot guarantee that such 
compensation will so qualify or ultimately will be deductible by us. </P>

the deduction
limitation of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code, the vesting of the award must be 
contingent solely on the attainment of one or more performance goals determined 
by a committee of two or more outside directors. The award must also be granted 
pursuant
to a shareholder approved plan containing (1)&nbsp;the material terms of the 
performance criteria pursuant to which the performance goals may be established,
(2)&nbsp;the individuals eligible to receive awards under the plan, and 
(3)&nbsp;a
specified limit on the number of shares or value a participant may receive 
within a certain time period or periods. Stockholder approval of the 2016 Plan 
by the Consenting Stockholders is intended to satisfy the shareholder approval

However, the difference between the option price paid and the fair market value

are competitive in terms of potential value to our executives, and which are 
tailored to
our unique characteristics and needs within our industry in order to create an 
executive compensation program that will adequately reward our executives for
their roles in creating value for our stockholders. We intend to be competitive 
with other
similarly situated companies in our industry. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; 
margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"

our need to attract
individuals with the skills necessary for us to achieve our business plan, to 
reward those individuals fairly over time, and to retain those individuals who 
continue to perform at or above our expectations. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times

components&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;salary, cash incentive bonus and stock-based awards.
We view
the three components of executive compensation as related but distinct. Although
our Compensation Committee reviews total compensation, we do not believe that 
significant compensation derived from one component of compensation should 
negate or
reduce compensation from other components. We determine the appropriate level 
for each compensation component based in part, but not exclusively, on our view 
of internal equity and consistency, individual performance and other information
deemed
relevant and timely. The Compensation Committee is in the process of developing 
policies for allocating compensation between long-term and currently paid out 
compensation, between cash and non-cash compensation, and among different forms 
of
compensation. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt;
font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="justify">In addition to the guidance 
provided by our Compensation Committee, we may utilize the services of third 
parties from time
to time in connection with the hiring and compensation awarded to executive 
employees. This could include subscriptions to executive compensation surveys 
and other databases. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times

an annual review of our executive officers&#146; cash compensation and equity 
holdings
to determine whether they provide adequate incentives and motivation to 
executive officers and whether they adequately compensate the executive officers
relative to comparable officers in other companies. </P>

restricted stock. The purpose of the 2013 Plan was to provide our employees who,
by their position, ability and diligence are able to make important 
contributions to our growth and profitability, with an incentive to assist us in
achieving our
long-term corporate objectives, to attract and retain executive officers and 
other employees of outstanding competence and to provide such persons with an 
opportunity to acquire an equity interest in us. Our employees and employees of 
our
subsidiaries were eligible to participate in the 2013 Plan. The 2013 Plan 
provided for the award of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted 
stock, stock units and performance cash awards. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman" ALIGN="justify">Performance cash awards under the 2013 Plan were 
determined primarily on the achievement of financial and operational performance
metrics. In
July 2014, we successfully issued long-term financing in the form of 10% senior 
secured notes due in July 2019. As a result of this achievement, Messrs. 
Hastings, Beatty and Whiteley were awarded an interim 2014 performance payment 
equal to
approximately 50% of annual base salary compensation. The 2014 annual 
performance payment based on achievement of financial and operational 
performance metrics was awarded to Messrs. Hastings, Beatty and Whiteley in 
March 2015. The 2015 annual
performance payment based on achievement of financial and operational
performance metrics was awarded to Messrs. Hastings, Beatty and Whiteley in 
March 2016. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times 
New Roman" ALIGN="justify">The Compensation Committee determined that the 
maximum potential share-based compensation awards under the 2013 Plan would be 
based 45% on
financial performance and 55% on an unconditional grant. Messrs. Hastings and 
Beatty were eligible to earn restricted stock and stock option awards of up to 
100% of base salary compensation and Mr.&nbsp;Whiteley was eligible to earn 
restricted stock
and stock option awards of up to 75% of base salary compensation. </P> <P 
STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New
Roman" ALIGN="justify">On June&nbsp;18, 2015, our Board of Directors, upon the 
recommendation
of the Compensation Committee, made restricted stock unit and incentive stock 
option grants under the 2013 Plan to our executive officers as part of across-
the-board awards to employees based on our 2014 performance and the respective
employee&#146;s compensation plan. Since the 2014 financial performance 
objectives were not achieved, only the unconditional grant was awarded. The 
unconditional grant was allocated equally to restricted stock units and 
incentive stock options based
upon our Common Stock closing price on January&nbsp;2, 2015 of $4.12 and 
incentive stock options valued using the Black-Scholes options pricing model. 
The January&nbsp;2, 2015 closing stock price represented the timing of initial 
discussions by the
Compensation Committee of potential 2013 Plan awards. The grants were effective 
June&nbsp;29, 2015 and vest one-third on the date which is 90&nbsp;days after 
the issuance and one-third each on the first and second anniversaries of the 
grant. The
incentive stock options were granted with an exercise price of $4.12 and expire 
upon the earlier of termination of employment or ten years after the grant date.

form of a grant of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to $50,000 divided 
by the average of
the last sale prices of Common Stock for three (3) consecutive trading days 
after the third quarter earnings release date, which shall be vested upon 
issuance, and each director may make an election by the annual meeting date each

immediately upon receipt by the Company and the effectiveness of such 
stockholder approval. The purpose of the Plan is to promote the long-term 
success of the Company and the creation of stockholder value by 
(a)&nbsp;encouraging Employees to focus
on long-range objectives, (b)&nbsp;encouraging the attraction and retention of 
Employees with exceptional qualifications, and (c)&nbsp;linking Employees 
directly to stockholder interests through increased stock ownership. The Plan 
seeks to achieve
these purposes by providing for Awards in the form of Restricted Shares, Stock 
Units, Options (which may be ISOs or NSOs), Performance Cash Awards and SARs.

are not Non-Employee Directors the authority to grant Awards to eligible persons
who are
not then subject to Section&nbsp;16 of the Exchange Act. Nothing herein shall
