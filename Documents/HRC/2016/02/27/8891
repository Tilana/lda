<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In resolution 9/7, the Human Rights Council requested the Expert Mechanism to prepare a 
study on lessons learned and challenges to achieve the implementation of the right of indigenous 
peoples to education, and to conclude it by 2009.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p><b>II.  INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>2. Indigenous peoples have historically been among the poorest and most excluded and 
disadvantaged sector of society. A major factor contributing to the disadvantaged position of 
indigenous peoples is the lack of quality education - which may be defined as education that is 
well resourced, culturally sensitive, respectful of heritage and that takes into account history, 
cultural security and integrity, encompasses human rights, community and individual 
development, and is designed in a way that is implementable - depriving millions of indigenous 
children of the basic human right to education. 
</p>
<p>3. International human rights law recognizes the right to education as a basic human right for 
everyone. When elaborating on the right to education of indigenous peoples, it is necessary to 
take into account two categories of human rights provisions: (a) general human rights provisions 
acknowledging and defining the content of the individual right to education; and (b) international 
standards specifically recognizing indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, including the provisions of the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>4. The Declaration reflects the existing international consensus regarding individual and 
collective rights of indigenous peoples in a way that is coherent with, and expands upon, 
international human rights standards, including the interpretation of human rights instruments by 
international bodies and mechanisms. As the most authoritative expression of this consensus, the 
Declaration provides a framework of action aiming for the full protection and implementation of 
these rights, including the right to education. </p>
<p>5. Education is recognized as both a human right in itself and an indispensable means of 
realizing other human rights and fundamental freedoms, the primary vehicle by which 
economically and socially marginalized peoples can lift themselves out of poverty and obtain the 
means to participate fully in their communities. Education is increasingly recognized as one of 
the best long-term financial investments that States can make. 
</p>
<p>6. Education of indigenous children contributes to both individual and community 
development, as well as to participation in society in its broadest sense. Education enables 
indigenous children to exercise and enjoy economic, social and cultural rights, and strengthens 
their ability to exercise civil rights in order to influence political policy processes for improved 
protection of human rights. The implementation of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to education is an

addressed the issue of education at its first session. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>essential means of achieving individual empowerment and self-determination.<b>2</b> Education is also 
an important means for the enjoyment, maintenance and respect of indigenous cultures, 
languages, traditions and traditional knowledge.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>7. Important human rights aspects of education include (a) the right of access to quality 
education; (b) the practice of human rights in and through education; and (c) education as a right 
that facilitates the fulfilment of other rights. 
</p>
<p>8. Quality education must recognize the past, be relevant to the present, and have a view to 
the future. Quality education needs to reflect the dynamic nature of cultures and languages and 
the value of peoples in a way that promotes equality and fosters a sustainable future.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Relevant international human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>9. Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right 
to education. This right is reaffirmed, contextualized and further elaborated upon in numerous 
other international instruments, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights (arts. 13-14), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(art. 18 (4)), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (arts. 28-31), the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (art. 5 (e) (v)), the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (art. 10), the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention concerning Discrimination in Respect of 
Employment and Occupation (Convention No. 111, art. 3), the Convention concerning Basic 
Aims and Standards of Social Policy (Convention No. 117, arts. 15-16), the Convention against 
Discrimination in Education, World Declaration on Education for All (UNESCO, 1990), the 
Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (part I, para. 33, and part II, para. 80), and the 
outcome document of the Durban Review Conference (para. 72).<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>10. The ILO Convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples (Convention No. 169, 
arts. 26-31), and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
(arts. 14-15) contain specific standards concerning the right to education of indigenous peoples. 
The right is also recognized as a specific right under several treaties concluded between 
indigenous peoples and States. 
</p>
<p>11. The right to education is also acknowledged in various regional instruments, including 
Protocol 1 to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental

Rights (art. 17) and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (art. 11). 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The aims and objectives of education 
</b>12. All education, whether formal or non-formal, private or public, should be directed towards 
the aims and objectives of education, as reflected in article 13 (1) of the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and article 29 (1) of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child, including the full development of the human personality, sense of dignity and respect 
for human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>13. Human rights education is an integral aspect for the promotion and achievement of stable 
and harmonious relations among communities and for fostering mutual understanding, tolerance 
and peace. Learning about human rights is the first step towards respecting, promoting and 
defending the rights of all individuals and peoples.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>14. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights emphasizes that States parties to 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights are required to ensure 
education conforms to the aims and objectives identified in article 13 (1), as interpreted in the 
light of other international instruments containing provisions on the right to education. The 
Committee takes the view that, while these other texts closely correspond to article 13 (1) of the 
Covenant, they also include elements that are not expressly provided for in article 13 (1), such as 
specific references to gender equality (article 29 (1) (d) of the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child) and respect for the natural environment (article 29 (1) (e) of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child). These additional elements are implicit in and reflect a contemporary interpretation 
of article 13 (1) of the International Covenant.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>15. Article 29 (1) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child establishes the obligations of 
States parties to ensure that the aims and objectives of education are fulfilled. Article 29 (1) is 
indispensably interconnected with a number of other provisions of the Convention, such as, but 
not limited to, the following rights and freedoms: (a) non-discrimination (art. 2); (b) the best 
interest of the child (art. 3); (c) the right to life, survival and development (art. 6); (d) freedom of 
expression (art. 13); (e) freedom of thought (art. 14); (f) right to information (art. 17); (g) rights 
of children with disabilities (art. 23); (h) right to education for health (art. 24 (2) (e)); (i) right to 
education (art. 28); (j) linguistic, cultural and religious rights of children belonging to minorities 
and children of indigenous origin (art. 30); and (k) the right to play (art. 31). 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Access to and content of education 
</b></p>
<p>16. Article 13 (2) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
stipulates, while taking into account the conditions prevailing in the State concerned, that in

</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  E/C.12/1999/10. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>order to achieve the full realization of educational rights, education in all its forms and at all 
levels should be available to all within the State: primary education should be compulsory and 
available free to all (art. 13 (2) (a)); secondary education in its different forms should be made 
generally available and accessible to all by every appropriate means (art. 13 (2) (b)); higher 
education should be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate 
means (art. 13 (2) (c)); fundamental education should be encouraged or intensified as far as 
possible for persons who have not received or completed primary education (art. 13 (2) (d)); and 
the development of a system of schools at all levels should be actively pursued (art. 13 (2) (e)). 
Article 28 of the Convention contains a provision which is normatively similar to article 13 (2) 
of the International Covenant. 
</p>
<p>17. The principle of the progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights, within 
the limits of available resources,<b>8</b> is in some instances invoked by some States in an attempt to 
legitimize the de facto denial of education to indigenous peoples and other marginalized sectors 
of national society. 
</p>
<p>18. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights addresses the principle of 
progressive realization of rights, including the right to education, in its general comment 
No. 3 (1990). The Committee emphasizes that a State party in which any significant number of 
individuals is deprived of &#8220;the most basic forms of education&#8221; is failing to discharge its 
obligation under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The 
Committee concluded that, in order for a State to be able to attribute its failure to meet at least its 
minimum core obligation to a lack of available resources, it must demonstrate that every effort 
has been made to use all resources that are at its disposition in an effort to satisfy, as a matter of 
priority, those minimum obligations. 
</p>
<p>19. Governments are obliged, collectively and individually, to make quality education 
available to all, accessible without any form of discrimination, acceptable in the light of 
international human rights standards and adaptable to the circumstances and in the best interest 
of the child. 
</p>
<p>20. States are obliged to ensure that functioning educational institutions and programmes are 
available to indigenous peoples in sufficient quantity within the jurisdiction of the State 
concerned. What they require to function depends upon numerous factors, including the 
developmental, social and cultural context within which they operate. 
</p>
<p>21. States are obliged to ensure that all indigenous school-age children have access to free 
education, including through indigenous neighbourhood or community-based schools providing 
education in their own languages, in a manner appropriate to their cultural methods of teaching 
and learning. In order to guarantee cultural safety and culturally appropriate education for 
indigenous students, curricula must be based on, or sufficiently reflect, indigenous peoples&#8217; 
cultural values and beliefs. Fiscal allocations sufficiently matching the State&#8217;s human rights 
obligations are also required to ensure the realization of the right to education of indigenous 
peoples, including specific State-funded programmes for the education and recruitment of 
indigenous teachers. 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, art. 2 (1). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>22. States have a duty to ensure that educational institutions and programmes are accessible to 
all indigenous individuals within the jurisdiction of the State, without discrimination. 
Consequently, education must be accessible, in law and fact, without discrimination on any of 
the prohibited grounds. The elimination of discrimination against indigenous peoples, and the 
elimination of conditions that cause such discrimination, are an important precondition for 
ensuring that indigenous individuals are not excluded from education. This requires that States 
take measures to identify existing and potential barriers of discrimination of indigenous 
individuals in the education system, including legal, political, administrative and fiscal barriers. 
States should establish a method for the collection of disaggregated data, and develop indicators 
conforming to international human rights standards, for the purpose of identifying areas of 
discrimination and other relevant barriers. 
</p>
<p>23. Education must be within safe physical reach (physical accessibility), either by attendance 
at some reasonably convenient geographic location or via modern technology, such as access to 
distance learning. Moreover, education must be affordable to all indigenous individuals 
(economic accessibility). Primary education should be available free of charge to all. States are 
required to progressively introduce free secondary and higher education. 
</p>
<p>24. The indigenous child&#8217;s right to education is, however, not only a matter of access to and 
availability of education, but also of the content of education. The form and substance of 
education, including curricula and teaching methods, have to be culturally appropriate and 
acceptable to indigenous peoples, that is, relevant, of high quality, culturally safe and 
appropriate. 
</p>
<p>25. Acceptability also requires that States ensure that the education system conforms to all 
human rights standards. In the assessment of whether the education system meets the 
requirements of international human rights law, general human rights provisions related to the 
right to education need to be complemented by standards that specifically address the rights of 
indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>26. States are obliged to ensure that education is flexible and adaptable to the specific needs, 
cultures, languages and situation of indigenous peoples concerned and responds to their diverse 
social and cultural settings. For instance, the best interest of an indigenous child might not in all 
circumstances be identical with the best interest of non-indigenous children owing to their 
distinct culture, lifestyle and the collective nature of their societies. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>27. Numerous provisions of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, in particular articles 2, 12 (1), 13, 14, 15, 17 (2) and 44, closely correspond with State 
obligations under article 13 (1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and article 29 (1) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. These provisions reaffirm 
and apply the essence of Covenant article 13 (1) and Convention article 29 (1) in relation to the 
specific historical, cultural, economic and social circumstances of indigenous peoples. 
Interpreted in conjunction with other relevant international human rights standards, they 
establish the basis for the contemporary understanding of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to education. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>28. Declaration article 2 reaffirms the existing prohibition of discrimination, as enshrined in 
numerous other international human rights instruments.<b>9</b> Article 2 is also closely linked to 
article 44 of the Declaration, which establishes that the rights and freedoms recognized therein 
are equally guaranteed to male and female indigenous individuals. The prohibition of 
discrimination is subject to neither progressive realization nor the availability of resources, and it 
applies to all aspects of the right to education of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>29. Article 12 (1) reaffirms important aspects of article 29 (1) of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, including the obligation of States to ensure that education is directed towards the 
development of respect for the child&#8217;s parents, his or her own cultural identity, language and 
values. Article 12 (1) provides that indigenous peoples have the right to manifest, practise, 
develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions, customs and ceremonies. 
</p>
<p>30. Article 13 (1) recognizes that indigenous peoples have the right to revitalize, use, develop 
and transmit to future generations their histories, languages, oral traditions, philosophies, writing 
systems and literatures. 
</p>
<p>31. Articles 12 (1) and 13 (1) are both closely linked to the right to education, as they fall 
largely within the ambit of the right to education as pronounced in other international human 
rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>32. Article 14 (1) provides for educational autonomy for indigenous peoples, provided that 
such arrangements meet minimum standards for education. This provision specifies that 
indigenous peoples have the right to establish and control their educational systems and 
institutions providing education in their own languages, in a manner appropriate to their cultural 
methods of teaching and learning. Article 14 (1) reaffirms article 29 (2) of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, which provides individuals and bodies with the liberty to establish and direct 
educational institutions, subject to the observance of certain core principles. 
</p><p>33. Article 14 (2) emphasizes that indigenous individuals have the right to all levels and forms 
of education of the State without discrimination of any kind. Hence, it reaffirms already existing 
human rights provisions, such as article 13 (1) of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights and article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>34. Article 14 (3) determines that States shall, in conjunction with indigenous peoples, take 
effective measures so that indigenous individuals, particularly children, have access, when 
possible, to an education in their own culture and language. It follows from the provision that 
indigenous peoples living outside their communities also have the right to have access to an 
education in their own culture and language, whenever possible. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  Including art. 2 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination, art. 2 (2) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
art. 2 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and art. 2 (1) of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>35. Arbitrary administrative or legislative requirements, for example requiring a minimum 
number of indigenous students in schools outside indigenous communities before such services 
are provided, are not a sufficient basis for determining whether it is possible to provide education 
in indigenous cultures and languages for indigenous children living outside their communities. In 
order for a State to be able to attribute its failure to provide such education services to children 
living outside their communities, it must demonstrate that every effort has been made to use all 
resources that are at its disposition in an effort to satisfy, as a matter of priority, this obligation. 
</p>
<p>36. Article 14 is also implicitly connected to articles 8 and 31 of the Declaration, because it is 
largely based on an acknowledgement that indigenous cultures, like all other human cultures, 
possess a mechanism for passing information on to the next generation. Article 8 provides that 
indigenous peoples and individuals have the right not to be subjected to forced assimilation or 
destruction of their culture, and that States should take effective measures for the prevention of 
and redress for any form of forced assimilation or integration. Culturally appropriate educational 
systems and institutions are an important element in any effort to ensure that indigenous cultures 
and languages are maintained and flourish. The rights enunciated in article 31 can only be 
realized through the intergenerational transfer of knowledge, language and culture. 
</p>
<p>37. Article 15 largely coincides with the description of the aim and objective of education, as 
established under article 13 (1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights and article 29 (1) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 15 is applicable to 
education provided to both indigenous and non-indigenous individuals. This provision reaffirms 
that education should be directed at combating prejudice and to the promotion of understanding 
and tolerance and good relations among segments of society, including the development of 
respect for the cultural identity, language and values of indigenous peoples. Human rights 
education is an important tool for the realization of this aim and objective. 
</p><p>38. Article 17 (2) provides that States shall, in consultation and cooperation with indigenous 
peoples, take specific measures to protect indigenous children from economic exploitation and 
from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child&#8217;s education 
or to be harmful to the child&#8217;s development. The provision emphasizes education as means of 
empowerment of indigenous children, reaffirming already existing international standards, in 
particular the standards adopted by ILO, including the Conventions concerning the Prohibition 
and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour (Convention 
No. 182), the Minimum Age for Admission to Employment (Convention No. 138) and ILO 
Convention No. 169. 
</p>
<p>39. The right to education is an indispensable means of realizing indigenous peoples&#8217; right to 
self-determination. Education is a vital precondition for the capacity and ability of indigenous 
peoples to pursue their own economic, social and cultural development in accordance with 
article 3 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Article 3 of the 
Declaration mirrors other international instruments that uphold the right to self-determination as 
a collective human right for all peoples, including common article 1 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights. The right of indigenous peoples to establish their own education systems and 
institutions is an integral part of their right to pursue their own economic, social and cultural 
development. 
</p>
<p>40. Article 4 of the Declaration acknowledges that indigenous peoples, in exercising their right 
to self-determination, have the right to autonomy or self-government in matters relating to their 
internal and local affairs, as well as ways and means for financing their autonomous functions. 
Article 4 should be interpreted in the light of article 14 of the Declaration, particularly 
paragraphs 1 and 2, article 27 of ILO Convention No. 169 and article 29 (2) of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child. All these provisions call for educational autonomy for indigenous 
peoples, if the right is invoked by them.

<p>41. Indigenous peoples&#8217; education systems and institutions can be put into one of two main 
categories: traditional education or ways of learning and institutions; or integration of indigenous 
perspectives and language in mainstream education systems and institutions. 
</p>
<p>42. The right of indigenous peoples to establish and control their education systems and 
institutions under article 14 (1) of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, articles 27 and 29 of ILO Convention No. 169 or article 29 (1) of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child should be interpreted as being applicable to both traditional and mainstream 
education systems and institutions. Consequently, States are expected to equip indigenous 
communities by integrating their perspectives and languages into mainstream education systems 
and institutions, and also by respecting, facilitating and protecting indigenous peoples&#8217; right to 
transfer knowledge to future generations by traditional ways of teaching and learning. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Traditional education and institutions 
</b></p>
<p>43. Traditional education can be described as a lifelong pedagogical process and an 
intergenerational transfer of knowledge aimed at maintaining a flourishing and harmonious 
society or community. Children from a young age receive guidance on various aspects of 
indigenous development from older members of the community to prepare them for life and their 
responsibilities towards their community. Intergenerational transfer of knowledge ensures that 
community members enjoy adequate economic security in an environment of sociocultural and 
political stability. For this to be realized, States should enable indigenous peoples to maintain 
and develop their political, economic and social systems and institutions. 
</p>
<p>44. Traditional education is achieved through the principles of participatory learning, holistic 
growth, nurturance and mutual trust. Participatory learning requires community members to be 
fully engaged in the learning process, through exposure, observation, practice or dialogue. 
Except for certain specialized knowledge and skills, children are exposed from an early age to 
different types of life-skill activities in the community. Through the examples of adults around 
them, children learn indigenous ways of life. Children also learn customary laws, expressed 
through prohibitions and limitations of what one can do in a community. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>45. Holistic growth involves education on the community&#8217;s ideals, knowledge and 
perspectives in developing its own cultural, social, spiritual, economic, political, juridical, 
natural resources, health and technological systems. Learning is conducted in a participatory way 
that encourages nurturance and mutual trust between learners and teachers,<b>10 </b>with the active 
giving and sharing of knowledge. As it is based on the concept of lifelong education, there are no 
barriers such as time frames, grading or age limits. 
</p>
<p>46. Holistic traditional education includes sustainable use and management of lands, territories 
and resources. Recognizing traditional education also means acknowledging its important link to 
indigenous peoples&#8217; lands, territories and resources; ensuring access to these resources is a 
prerequisite for the transfer of fundamental elements of traditional knowledge. 
</p>
<p>47. Traditional skills and knowledge may be transmitted through apprenticeship, repetitive 
practice and instruction and direct observation. Transmission of spiritual knowledge may come 
in other forms, such as dreams or as gifts. In most indigenous societies, learning is mainly 
conducted through oral tradition, making the maintenance of language a vital part of education. 
</p>
<p>48. Specific traditional occupations that require a high degree of discipline, technical and 
spiritual understanding, such as healing, carpentry and ironsmithing, are learned through 
apprenticeship. The apprentice stays with his or her master until the knowledge has been passed 
from master to pupil. 
</p>
<p>49. Repetition and application are central to learning the oral tradition. These techniques are 
employed in transmitting knowledge related to healing (such as knowledge of plants and 
animals), cultures (languages, songs, dances, weaving), economic and resource management 
(such as farming or water management), governance (customary laws and political institutions)<i>, 
</i>and social relationships (kinship, behavioural norms and so on). 
</p>
<p>50. Direct observation through active involvement in activities encourages reflection; with 
prompting from elders, children learn what is necessary to prepare them to be an adult and an 
effective member of the community. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Integration of indigenous perspectives into mainstream  
education systems and institutions 
</b></p>
<p>51. Indigenous peoples have made tremendous efforts to integrate indigenous perspectives and 
languages into mainstream or formal education. Mainstream education systems usually involve a 
standard set of curricula provided by education ministries based on government policy. The 
inclusion of indigenous ways of learning, instructing, teaching and training is important in 
ensuring students/learners and teachers/instructors in mainstream institutions are able to benefit 
from education in a culturally sensitive manner that draws upon, utilizes, promotes and enhances 
awareness of indigenous perspectives and languages. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  In this context, a &#8220;teacher&#8221; denotes an elder or younger person who holds particular 
</p>
<p>knowledge and who is engaged in transmitting this knowledge to other community members. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>52. For indigenous students/learners and teachers/instructors, the inclusion of the 
above-mentioned methods often enhances educational effectiveness, success and learning 
outcomes by providing education that adheres to indigenous peoples&#8217; own inherent perspectives, 
experiences and world views. For non-indigenous students and teachers, education using such 
methods has resulted in greater awareness, respect for and appreciation of other cultural realities. 
</p>
<p>53. In terms of educational content, indigenous educators, organizations and parents have been 
working with ministries, institutions and donors to include indigenous perspectives in school 
curricula and to produce educational materials. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  LESSONS LEARNED 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Creating national laws and policies 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Expert Mechanism considers the constitutional recognition of indigenous peoples and 
the adoption of related national laws and policies on education a priority in applying the right of 
indigenous peoples to education. 
</p>
<p>55. Important existing legal provisions include those giving recognition to pluralistic systems 
of education, equal importance to traditional ways of teaching and learning, indigenous peoples&#8217; 
control over their own curricula and learning institutions, and adequate financial and 
infrastructure support for the implementation of these initiatives.<b>11</b> Such legislations have led to 
the establishment of indigenous learning centres that have benefited communities and allowed 
indigenous organizations to secure financial support from their respective Governments or 
interested donors. 
</p>
<p>56. Examples of important existing education legislations include those recognizing the 
integration of indigenous perspectives and languages into mainstream education, culturally 
appropriate curricula, mother-tongue-based bilingual and multilingual education, intercultural 
education and the effective participation of indigenous peoples in designing education 
programmes.<b>12</b> Policies of complementary education for indigenous peoples permit the 
implementation of intercultural education in schools and colleges with the aim of moving 
towards multiculturalism and the recognition of the diversity of peoples. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  Examples from submissions received include the Basic Education Act 2001 and Executive 
</p>
<p>Order No. 356 of 2004 (Philippines), First Nations Jurisdiction over Education Act 2006 and 
First Nations Education Act 2007 (Canada), the Education Act of Norway, the National 
Education Act (Argentina) and the Constitutions of Mexico, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), 
Colombia and Ecuador. 
<b>12
</b></p>
<p>  The General Law on Education and General Law on Linguistic Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
(Mexico); the Policy on complementary education for indigenous peoples (Colombia); 
section 6 (2) of the Constitution of South Africa; and the bilingual education policy of Australia. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>57. The Expert Mechanism urges States to adopt a policy framework for quality education for 
indigenous peoples, set clear goals, targets and priorities, and develop indicators to measure 
achievements, together with indigenous peoples,<b>13</b> that could include greater participation, 
improved literacy skills, lower truancy rates and the gaining of meaningful qualifications.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Financial and infrastructure support 
</b></p>
<p>58. To make policies and laws on the right of indigenous peoples to education effective and 
implementable, the provision of resources and the attaching of a high priority to the education of 
indigenous peoples are of utmost importance. Currently, funding allocations by Governments, 
international non-governmental organizations or United Nations agencies are mainly used to 
build infrastructure and to provide human resources. 
</p>
<p>59. The improvement of infrastructure, particularly of education centres in remote villages, is 
necessary to allow indigenous children equal access and opportunities to obtain quality 
education. Home schooling, a remote learning model, provides an opportunity for children in 
remote villages to receive an education without having to attend boarding schools.<b>15</b> Funding 
priorities should include providing quality education to nomadic communities and indigenous 
peoples in remote areas and to women and girls through mobile school and scholarships.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>60. Allocating targeted financial resources for the development of materials, testing proposed 
culturally appropriate curricula, teaching indigenous languages, providing support for training 
and incentives for teachers in rural schools and developing education programmes in cooperation 
with indigenous peoples are also effective initiatives. An equally important consideration for 
communities located in isolated and sparsely populated areas is that the allocation of funding for 
infrastructure should not be made based on a school-to-population ratio. 
</p>
<p>61. Financial support by non-governmental organizations and international donors for 
indigenous ways of learning, particularly the intergenerational transfer of knowledge and skills 
on farming, handicrafts, the making of implements, health care and the establishment of 
indigenous vocational centres contribute to the maintenance of traditional occupations and 
economically sustained communities. State recognition and support would thus enhance and 
promote vibrant communities. One example of a government-supported indigenous institution is 
the S&#225;mi University College.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>13
</b>  In British Columbia, Canada, enhancement agreements between indigenous communities and 
</p>
<p>school districts involve shared decision-making and specific mutually agreed goal-setting to 
meet the needs of indigenous students.

</p>
<p><b>C.  International development assistance 
</b></p>
<p>62. Most States subscribe to the Millennium Development Goals of achieving education for 
all.<b>18</b> At the World Education Forum in Dakar in 2000, Governments made additional 
commitments to ensuring that all children, particularly girls and indigenous peoples, had access 
to free primary education by 2015.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>63. Effective participation of indigenous peoples in the development of education budgets with 
relevant government departments is critical to ensure that their concerns and needs are included 
and understood by donors. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Establishing and controlling traditional education and institutions 
</b></p>
<p>64. Indigenous education institutions have been established primarily to promote indigenous 
perspectives, innovations and practices in an environment that replicates traditional ways of 
learning. These institutions complement community efforts, particularly in rural areas, through 
both traditional and contemporary institutions, to maintain traditional intergenerational 
education. 
</p>
<p>65. In some examples, communities have adapted traditional ways of learning to allow 
community members to systematically learn and teach indigenous cultures and traditions in an 
everyday setting. The Talaandig School of Living Tradition (Philippines) and the Community 
Learning Centres (Malaysia) build venues where community members can carry out activities, or 
discuss and resolve issues collectively. Respected elders and other knowledge-holders in the 
community make up the institution that guides the activities. Similar initiatives are being 
implemented in indigenous territories in Colombia, and among the Maasai in Kenya. 
</p>
<p>66. In another example, from Western Australia, elders develop ways to stop substance 
misuse, self-harm and suicide, and to promote life skills and sustainable livelihoods in their 
communities through youth leadership, land management and community development. 
Confidence-building through culture incorporating back to country trips for youth at risk has 
been successful in getting youths away from substance abuse and returning to their 
communities.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>E. Interfacing between traditional and mainstream  
education systems and institutions 
</b></p>
<p>67. Valuable lessons can be drawn from examples of the integration of indigenous perspectives 
into mainstream education curricula to promote an interface between traditional and State 
education systems.

</p>
<p>68. Non-governmental and other organizations in Asia have found that assistance has to be 
provided in a holistic way to work successfully with indigenous communities in remote areas. 
Support may be provided in the form of construction materials to renovate or build schools, 
assistance to develop curricula, teaching aids and materials, teacher training, capacity-building 
and poverty alleviation. Culturally appropriate curricula based on a guide incorporating 
indigenous languages and perspectives and provided by the Government were developed and 
taught in community schools by teachers selected from the communities themselves. Courses 
offered range from preschool to tertiary level, including full-time degrees and short-term training 
courses.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>69. The integration of indigenous perspectives into mainstream education programmes assists 
in the development of vocational and life skills and allows indigenous students to be proud of 
their own cultures and way of life, and confidently engage and succeed academically.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>70. Depending on the level of collaboration and openness of school officials, traditional forms 
of teaching methods can be employed to help indigenous students attain a greater appreciation of 
learning. The effective incorporation of traditional forms of teaching includes use of oral 
traditions, storytelling by elders, and teaching in the school, at home and in the forests or fields.<b>23</b> 
Research by indigenous scholars into traditional knowledge and cultures was also found to 
contribute to the conservation of indigenous lifestyles.<b>24</b> Adult education has also become 
common in many countries, ranging from formal class-based learning to self-directed learning. 
Respecting the expertise of indigenous elders and providing them with a significant role in an 
integrated mainstream education system were also found to be effective ways to revitalize 
indigenous societies and improve learning among indigenous students. 
</p>
<p>71. Engaging institutes of higher learning to provide relevant courses for indigenous scholars 
is another way to integrate traditional and mainstream education, as seen in the experience of 
Canada and New Zealand.<b>25</b>

<p>72. In Latin America, bilingual and intercultural approaches to education are widely promoted 
and have been found to have a certain degree of success in the preservation of identity and 
culture and vital in tackling discrimination and the exclusion of indigenous peoples.<b>26</b> 
</p>
<p>73. Joint curriculum development between indigenous peoples and education ministries has 
had a tremendous impact not only in terms of achieving results but also of relationship-building 
and commitment to partnership and inclusiveness. Close collaboration with mainstream 
education authorities is needed to bring about a change in attitude by education officers and State 
institutions.<b>27</b> Such a change, and the seriousness of States in carrying out their responsibilities, 
will determine the progress of implementing the right to education of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Teaching of indigenous languages 
</b></p>
<p>74. Mother-tongue-based bilingual and multilingual education has had a positive impact in 
many countries.<b>28</b> Governments and donors now recognize initiatives by indigenous 
organizations as effective strategies to bridge education for indigenous children in mainstream 
education institutions; in many countries, they receive financial support from the State. 
</p>
<p>75. The main concept of mother-tongue-based bilingual and multilingual education is that, 
once a child learns his or her indigenous language well, learning other languages will be easier. 
The benefits of mother-tongue-based multilingual education include a better personal and 
conceptual foundation for learning (if indigenous languages are learnt well and not suppressed); 
access to more information and opportunities (knowing other languages and other cultures); and 
more flexible thinking processes, thanks to the ability to process information in two languages. 
</p>
<p>76. Most indigenous children are disadvantaged when they join primary schools and cannot 
speak the national language, which is usually the teaching medium. Valuable lessons learned to 
decrease this disadvantage include using a participatory approach whereby indigenous 
representatives are involved in decision-making processes, developing books and materials, 
managing lessons and selecting community members to be trained as language teachers.<b>29</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>77. Experience in Norway and Malaysia<b>30</b> reveals that teaching children in their own language 
during early child (preschool) education establishes a firm foundation and facilitates learning of 
other languages at a later age. Effective methods include centring language learning on the 
community, including allowing children to meet native speakers and culture-bearers in natural 
community settings.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p>78. Good examples of teaching of indigenous languages at higher levels of education as the 
mother tongue or as an optional language in universities also exist, such as in S&#225;mi University 
College in Norway, which delivers education and research within a range of programmes, 
including the S&#225;mi language. At the College, the S&#225;mi language is both the medium of 
instruction and the language of administration.<b>32</b> Experience shows that information and 
communication technologies, such as online dictionaries, radio and audio-visuals, enhance 
language learning. Financial support for these endeavours could benefit isolated and nomadic 
communities. 
</p>
<p>79. Enacting laws relating to mother-tongue multilingual education and the setting-up of 
institutes can ensure compulsory education provided by the State will include indigenous 
languages, such as in Mexico, under the general law of the linguistic rights of indigenous peoples 
and the establishment of a national institute of indigenous languages. 
</p>
<p>80. Some numerically small, disadvantaged indigenous groups are specifically vulnerable to 
losing their languages and marginalization in the education sector. These groups should be 
identified and targeted through decisive measures to assist in the preservation of their languages, 
including by elaborating standard orthographies, grammars, vocabularies and materials.<b>33</b>  
</p>
<p><b>G.  Training programmes and certification of teachers and institutions 
</b></p>
<p>81. Teacher training and capacity-building initiatives aimed at allowing communities to 
manage education projects independently are essential for the successful, long-term 
implementation of any curriculum. Successful teacher training programmes include strategies for 
teachers to be competent to teach culturally appropriate curricula and indigenous languages, and 
to enhance the engagement and academic achievement of indigenous learners. The experience of 
many schools reflects the need for stricter rules on discrimination against indigenous pupils by 
teachers. Community involvement contributes to better supervision and monitoring of teachers. 
Parents, particularly mothers, elder members and indigenous community organizations can be 
encouraged to play this role.

<p>82. Increasing funding and incentives for teachers to remain in remote areas were found to be 
successful to a certain degree. The most effective strategy, however, is still the recruitment and 
special training of teachers from indigenous communities to teach in their localities, which may 
require flexibility in interpreting formal recruitment criteria. 
</p>
<p>83. Acceptance of certification of teachers through an internationally recognized institution is 
one way of maintaining standards. Teacher certificates and the certification of indigenous 
institutions are issued and monitored by the World Indigenous Higher Education Consortium, 
and the institutes are assisted with the development of standards and their implementation, to 
attain global recognition and guidance for teachers. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Networking and participation 
</b></p>
<p>84. A former Special Rapporteur recommended the participation of indigenous peoples in all 
phases of the planning, design, implementation and evaluation of reforming education systems.<b>34</b> 
Shared decision-making and involvement of community leaders and parents is critical to the 
successful implementation of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to education.<b>35</b> As such, training of 
community leaders, especially women, and responding to the needs of the community to support 
community education initiatives are considered complementary activities. 
</p>
<p>85. Networking between communities, local groups and organizations at the national and 
international levels can assist communities in sharing resources, addressing problems and 
supporting one another. In many countries, community volunteers contribute labour and financial 
resources for the construction of school facilities and hostels and to supply food to students, or 
volunteer as teachers. Appreciation for these contributions not only encourages the communities, 
but will build support in implementing Government education programmes. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CHALLENGES AND MEASURES 
</b></p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur identified a number of serious concerns raised by indigenous 
peoples, organizations and civil society organizations related to the right to education. They 
included (a) the lack of control over education initiatives for indigenous children; (b) the lack of 
consultation on the development and implementation of educational services provided to 
indigenous peoples; (c) the failure to consult with indigenous leaders on proposals for legislation 
on indigenous education; (d) the limited consideration given to autonomy and participation of 
indigenous peoples in the delivery of educational services, including multicultural and 
mother-tongue-based bilingual education; (e) the limited opportunities of access to quality 
mother-tongue-based bilingual education; (f) the failure to develop educational opportunities for

</p>
<p>indigenous peoples that demonstrate respect for their history and culture; (g) the lack of adequate 
supplies, funding and teachers, and poor quality schools; (h) the general lack of focus on 
education for indigenous peoples; (i) educational materials that only reflect the culture of 
dominant groups; (j) insufficiently funded and developed multilingual educational programmes; 
(k) inadequate teacher training and the lack of scholarships for indigenous students; and (l) the 
inadequate development of culturally appropriate curricula.<b>36</b> 
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur concludes that the full enjoyment of the right to education as 
recognized in international human rights law is not a reality for most indigenous peoples, and 
that the main impediments to this right are discrimination and lack of equal access to education. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Non-recognition of traditional education and institutions 
</b></p>
<p>88. The limited ratification of relevant international human rights instruments by many States 
is a major obstacle to the recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. As a result, traditional 
education and institutions in particular do not get the necessary legislative support of 
international standards. 
</p>
<p>89. In Asia and Africa, where indigenous peoples&#8217; rights are not always recognized or 
protected under the law, indigenous organizations have pressed their Governments to recognize 
traditional education and institutions and to respect indigenous values and knowledge systems 
by using national constitutional provisions prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of ethnic 
origin, religion or gender. The assimilationist model of education has accelerated the 
transformation and ultimate disappearance of indigenous cultures and languages.<b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>90. Urgent efforts to revitalize traditional education should be made, particularly among the 
younger generation. Considering the lack of understanding of and respect for the concepts and 
principles of traditional education, Governments must attach greater importance to building 
understanding and to providing adequate funding for initiatives by indigenous organizations to 
establish traditional education institutions. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Discrimination and poor access to education 
</b></p>
<p>91. Indigenous peoples have been subjected to monolithic mainstream education systems that 
have eroded traditional ways of life and languages, imposed foreign ideologies and belief 
systems and institutionalized discriminatory attitudes against indigenous peoples, leading to 
further marginalization and the exacerbation of conflicts, including armed conflicts. Mainstream 
education systems have been imposed through State institutions, political ideologues, religious 
groups, non-governmental organizations and business interests.<b>37</b> It is the responsibility of States 
to address and undo past wrongs to reform mainstream education systems.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>92. States can also overcome discrimination and marginalization by helping indigenous 
peoples to gain the knowledge necessary to participate fully and equally in national society. 
Removing stereotypes, inappropriate terminologies and other negative elements in school 
textbooks and materials, developing strict rules against discriminatory attitudes, eradicating 
poverty and promoting intercultural education are some of the measures that could be taken. 
</p>
<p>93. Access to education for indigenous peoples can be challenging, as it encompasses many 
issues, including poverty and gender issues. Measures to overcome these challenges need to be 
firmly grounded on human rights standards. Furthermore, human rights and gender education 
should be among the most important subjects taught in school. 
94. Small rural or nomadic communities also face numerous difficulties in gaining access to 
State education institutions, mainly because of their geographical isolation. For this reason, 
sufficient funding should be given to ensure suitable education at all levels according to 
situation.<b>38</b> Other measures, such as outreach programmes, use of information communication 
technologies and radios, mobile schools, improved infrastructure, safe transportation and 
working with communities to establish community schools are also necessary measures. 
</p>
<p>95. Special temporary measures should be taken also to ensure access to education for 
internally displaced persons, migrant workers and refugees from indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Issues affecting women 
</b></p>
<p>96. In certain communities, social norms prevent indigenous girls from attending schools. 
Families often prefer girls to remain at home to perform domestic chores and care for children 
and siblings; others prefer their daughters to be married off at a young age.<b>39</b> This, coupled with 
other ongoing exclusion and discrimination of indigenous girls and women, has led to serious 
consequences for the community and society.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>97. Measures to ensure the provision of education at all levels for indigenous girls and women 
should be seen as a matter of urgency. Instruments of dialogue would help to mediate conflicting 
issues and norms within indigenous societies and to ensure equal access to education for 
indigenous girls and women.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Aid effectiveness 
</b></p>
<p>98. According to a report by the Secretary-General, multilateral and bilateral assistance can 
play a significant role in providing a predictable budget for education. Although aid directed to 
basic education for low-income countries increased from $1.6 billion in 1999 to $5 billion in 
2006, it is still well below the estimated $11 billion in aid required annually to reach universal 
primary education by 2015. Trust funds created to accelerate progress in developing countries 
with no regular access to bilateral and multilateral funds are supported by very few donors, and 
resources are too limited to provide reliable budget support. Additional efforts will have to be 
made to improve aid effectiveness by strengthening the capacity of national education systems.<b>41</b> 
The Expert Mechanism urges increased funding allocation to indigenous peoples&#8217; educational 
needs through international development programmes and initiatives. 
</p>
<p>99. A challenge is posed, however, by the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness with regard 
to the five key principles (ownership, alignment, harmonization, managing for results, mutual 
accountability) of international development cooperation. Support for indigenous peoples can 
even be omitted if participation in government structures or in decision-making is weak, or if 
indigenous peoples have little political leverage or are absent in the Government&#8217;s overall 
strategy. Measures must be taken to address such deficiencies using a rights-based approach and 
to include requirements such as governance, inclusiveness, transparency and quality with respect 
to education. 
</p>
<p>100. Donors and international agencies should also prioritize the right to education of 
indigenous peoples within their administered programmes and strengthen the capacity of 
developing countries to meet the educational needs of indigenous peoples. The Assistance 
Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is also urged to take 
steps to include oversight and accountability of development effectiveness for indigenous 
peoples in their peer reviews, and to disseminate the results.<b>42</b> 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Fiscal allocations 
</b></p>
<p>101. Public spending on indigenous education is generally inadequate and lower than for other 
sectors of the population, and teachers of indigenous children tend to receive lower pay and 
incentives than other teachers.<b>43</b> In remote areas where many indigenous communities are 
residing, basic infrastructure, including schools and roads, is still lacking. Financial support for 
the development of materials, testing of curricula and adequate support and incentives for 
teachers to teach in rural schools is limited, and, in some countries, unavailable.

</p>
<p><b>43
</b>  Submission by ILO. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>102. As disaggregated data on Government spending in education for indigenous peoples are 
often limited and difficult to obtain, it can be a challenge to convince States to invest more in this 
sector. There is a need for States to conduct a study to measure outcomes of Government 
spending, such as the number of teachers, infrastructure and equipment. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Institutionalization of educational services 
</b></p>
<p>103. The institutionalization of education services invariably leads to its standardization. The 
prescribed concept and definition of schools that do not fit into indigenous cultures and 
conceptual framework and the standard service delivery and specifications of school buildings 
are also problematic, especially in remote areas where indigenous peoples seek to obtain 
recognition for the establishment of learning centres in the absence of State educational services. 
</p>
<p>104. The diversity of indigenous peoples means that education for indigenous peoples cannot 
conform to a single model. Education models, such as traditional ways of learning and teaching, 
distance learning, adult education and curricula adapted to the community&#8217;s need should be 
accepted. 
</p>
<p>105. The Expert Mechanism concurs with the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur that 
courses on indigenous peoples be broadened at all levels of national education, with an 
anti-racist, multicultural focus that reflects respect for cultural and ethnic diversity and, in 
particular, gender equality.<b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>106. The lack of well-trained, culturally competent teachers was identified as a serious problem 
in several reports and submissions received.<b>44</b> Recruitment and deployment of teachers need to 
be reformed so that an adequate number of teachers from the community can be selected and 
trained. In this regard, the assistance of teachers&#8217; unions and community leaders should be 
sought. 
</p>
<p>107. There is also a scarcity of indigenous language experts and documentations, particularly in 
Africa and Asia, and a lack of effective teaching methods of indigenous knowledge and skills, 
which are still largely transferred through oral tradition. An effort to harness experiences and 
skills in traditional education would be an important step in advancing and achieving the 
implementation of the right of indigenous peoples to education. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Governance and creating appropriate curriculum 
</b></p>
<p>108. The lack of participation by indigenous peoples in the planning, programming and 
implementation of existing curriculum poses a major challenge.<b>34</b> Discrimination and prejudice 
against indigenous peoples can be combated by including indigenous representatives and 
</p>

</p>
<p>educators in curriculum development with the aim of reflecting indigenous perspectives in an 
appropriate and respectful way. Universities and research centres could increase their 
involvement in the preparation of multidisciplinary curricula. 
</p>
<p>109. Education is usually centrally controlled by Governments, and, in many countries, 
educational activities not employing government curriculum are scrutinized. Many national 
education policies in Asia and Africa do not provide for the inclusion of indigenous perspectives 
in the national curriculum. Such barriers should be reviewed with a view to reforming education 
laws and policies, making them more inclusive and sensitive to indigenous values and 
perspectives. Reforms should also include a decision-making authority for indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>110. The policy and approach to mother-tongue-based multilingual education is also unclear 
and keeps changing. As a result, indigenous educators and teachers are not able to reach an 
agreement or to plan teaching indigenous languages systematically, leading to disputes. It is 
imperative therefore that a step-wise policy to promote all cultures and languages, especially 
endangered languages, be followed. Sufficient funding is needed to support the development of 
teaching methods for the pupil&#8217;s own language and literacy materials and scripts. Discriminatory 
remuneration for indigenous language teachers should also be removed. 
</p>
<p>111. Education for indigenous peoples should be holistic. Mainstream education curricula 
should therefore cover human rights, environmental protection, the importance of lands and 
resources for indigenous peoples and physical education. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Gaps in educational quality and measurement of achievements 
</b></p>
<p>112. Educational services in indigenous areas are more often than not underfunded, of low 
quality and poorly equipped. Indigenous children often attend the worst schools, with the least 
educated teachers and the smallest amount of resources. To achieve quality education for 
indigenous peoples, it is important to ensure consultation with and participation and consent of 
the target community and to establish good communication between interested parties, given that 
quality standards may vary from State to State, and between indigenous and non-indigenous 
children. 
</p>
<p>113. Most countries do not have disaggregated data that can give an accurate description of the 
education of indigenous peoples. Nevertheless, where data are available, they suggest that 
indigenous peoples invariably lag behind the general population with regard to educational 
quality and achievements. The rates of enrolment and completion of education among 
indigenous children, in particular girls, remain low.<b>45</b>  
</p>
<p>114. There is therefore a need for ongoing data gathering and monitoring of outcomes. The 
Education for All framework, which specifies six education goals to meet the learning needs of 
all children, youth and adults by 2015, could be a useful basis for data gathering. It is of utmost

</p>
<p>importance, however, that Governments, indigenous peoples, donors and civil society 
organizations work together to ensure that special approaches are devised to coincide with the 
aspirations of indigenous peoples, within the context of national Education for All strategies.<b>46</b>  
</p>
<p>115. Human rights indicators can also be used as a tool. OHCHR has prepared a structural 
process outcome methodological framework for human rights indicators. The framework 
assesses institutional mechanisms for the realization of human rights, such as the ratification and 
adoption of legal instruments, the evaluation of State policy instruments which can lead directly 
to the realization of a human right, and capturing individual and collective attainments of human 
rights in context.

<p><b>46
</b>  The six goals, which also form part of the Millennium Development Goals, are (1) to expand 
</p>
<p>early childhood care and education; (2) to provide free and compulsory primary education for 
all; (3) to promote learning and life skills for young people and adults; (4) to increase adult 
literacy by 50 per cent; (5) to achieve gender parity by 2005, gender equality by 2015; and (6) to 
improve the quality of action. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>EXPERT MECHANISM ADVICE No. 1 (2009) ON THE RIGHTS  
OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES TO EDUCATION 
</b></p>
<p>1. Education is a universal human right fundamental to the exercise of other human rights; 
everyone has the right to education pursuant to international human rights law. Education is also 
an empowerment right, through which economically and socially marginalized individuals can 
obtain means to participate fully in their communities and economies, and in the society at large. 
</p>
<p>2. Education is the primary means ensuring indigenous peoples&#8217; individual and collective 
development; it is a precondition for indigenous peoples&#8217; ability to realize their right to 
self-determination, including their right to pursue their own economic, social and cultural 
development. 
</p>
<p>3. The right of indigenous peoples to education includes the right to provide and receive 
education through their traditional methods of teaching and learning, and the right to integrate 
their own perspectives, cultures, beliefs, values and languages in mainstream education systems 
and institutions. The right to education for indigenous peoples is a holistic concept incorporating 
mental, physical, spiritual, cultural and environmental dimensions. 
</p>
<p>4. The full enjoyment of the right to education as recognized in international human rights 
law is far from reality for most indigenous peoples. Deprivation of access to quality education is 
a major factor contributing to social marginalization, poverty and dispossession of indigenous 
peoples. The content and objective of education to indigenous peoples in some instances 
contributes to the assimilation of indigenous peoples into mainstream society and the eradication 
of their cultures, languages and ways of life. 
</p>
<p>5. The right of everyone to education is enshrined in numerous international human rights 
instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, ILO Convention No. 117 on Social Policy, the 
UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education. It is also reaffirmed in various 
regional human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>6. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and ILO Convention 
No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries contain specific 
provisions on indigenous peoples&#8217; right to education. Several treaties between indigenous 
peoples and States acknowledge the right of indigenous peoples to education and educational 
services as a treaty right. 
</p>
<p>7. The Declaration is coherent with and expands upon legally binding human rights 
instruments and international jurisprudence developed by international supervisory bodies and 
mechanisms. The Declaration, interpreted in conjunction with other international instruments, 
provides an authoritative normative framework for the full and effective protection and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples. In the context of education, the Declaration 
reaffirms and applies the right to education to the specific historical, cultural, economic and 
social circumstances of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>8. Article 14 of the Declaration acknowledges that indigenous peoples have the right to 
establish and control their educational systems and institutions providing education in their own 
languages, in a manner appropriate to their cultural methods of teaching and learning. This 
reaffirms existing international human rights law, including article 29 (2) of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child and article 27 (3) of ILO Convention No. 169. The right of indigenous 
peoples to establish and control their education systems and institutions applies to traditional as 
well as formal education systems and institutions. 
</p>
<p>9. Numerous other provisions of the Declaration (arts. 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 (1), 8 (2), 12, 13, 14 (2) 
(3), 17 (2), 31, 44) either reaffirm and apply the essence of already existing human rights treaty 
obligations on the right to education, or are inseparably linked to provision on the right to 
education of the Declaration, applicable to both traditional and formal education. 
</p>
<p>10. In view of the prevailing lack of understanding of and respect for the concepts and 
principles of traditional education, Governments are urged to attach importance to building 
understanding and respect for traditional methods of teaching and learning, including by 
providing adequate funding for initiatives by indigenous peoples and communities to strengthen 
or establish traditional educational initiatives. 
</p>
<p>11. The right of indigenous peoples to traditional education may be closely, and in some 
instances inseparably, associated with the use of their traditional lands, territories and natural 
resources. States must give legal recognition and protection to such lands, territories and 
resources with due respect for indigenous peoples&#8217; customs, customary law and traditions. 
</p>
<p>12. States are obliged, collectively and individually, to make quality education available to all 
indigenous peoples, accessible without any prohibited form of discrimination, acceptable in the 
light of international human rights standards, and adaptable to the circumstances and in the best 
interest of indigenous peoples. States should address past wrongs, including by removing 
stereotypes, inappropriate terminologies and other negative elements referring to indigenous 
peoples in textbooks and educational materials. States should promote intercultural education, as 
well as develop and strictly implement provisions aimed at eliminating discrimination against 
indigenous peoples in the educational system. 
</p>
<p>13. Educational programmes and services for indigenous peoples must be developed and 
implemented in consultation and cooperation with the indigenous peoples concerned in order to 
address and incorporate their special needs, histories, identities, integrity, values, beliefs, 
cultures, languages and knowledge, as well as their social, economic and cultural priorities and 
aspirations. Educational programmes and services for indigenous peoples should be of high 
quality, culturally safe and appropriate, and must not aim at or result in unwanted assimilation of 
indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>14. Indigenous peoples, in exercising their right to self-determination, have the right to 
educational autonomy. States, in consultation and cooperation with the peoples concerned, must 
ensure the realization of educational autonomy, including the financing of such autonomous </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>arrangements. Indigenous peoples should be regarded as having prepaid present and future 
financial allocations from the State, including allocations to education, by sharing their lands, 
territories and resources with others. 
</p>
<p>15. The right of indigenous peoples to educational autonomy includes the right to decide their 
own educational priorities and to participate effectively in the formulation, implementation and 
evaluation of education plans, programmes and services that may affect them, as well as the right 
to establish and control their own education systems and institutions, if they so choose. 
</p>
<p>16. States should support the efforts of indigenous peoples to maintain and develop their own 
political, economic, social, cultural and education systems and institutions. National law and 
policy frameworks should be enacted or reformed, and budgets allocated to support traditional as 
well as formal education institutions that are established with the aim of developing and 
implementing appropriate programmes and activities for and by indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>17. The adoption of national legislation and policies that specifically address and acknowledge 
indigenous peoples&#8217; right to education, pursuant to international human rights law, should be 
regarded as a matter of priority by States. Constitutional recognition of the existence of 
indigenous peoples and their rights provides a solid legal basis for the adoption and 
implementation of legislation on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, including the right to education. 
</p>
<p>18. The Expert Mechanism recommends that States follow a step-wise policy that could help 
promote all indigenous languages. Sufficient funding is needed to support the development of 
teaching methods, literacy materials and orthographies in the pupil&#8217;s own language. 
</p>
<p>19. The Expert Mechanism highlights the need for disaggregated educational data, and 
recommends that States establish methods and systems for the collection of disaggregated data 
and develop indicators conforming with international human rights standards in the field of 
education, for the purpose of identifying barriers preventing indigenous peoples from enjoying 
fully the right to education and to reform education laws and policies to be more inclusive and 
sensitive to indigenous values and perspectives. 
</p>
<p>20. Measures to ensure the provision of education at all levels for indigenous girls and women 
should be seen as a matter of urgency. The Expert Mechanism is of the view that instruments of 
dialogue would help to mediate conflicting issues and norms within indigenous societies and to 
ensure equal access to education for indigenous girls and women. 
</p>
<p>21. Education for indigenous peoples should be holistic; mainstream education curricula 
should include human rights, environmental protection, importance of lands and resources for 
indigenous peoples and physical education. 
</p>
<p>22. Human rights education is an integral aspect for the promotion and achievement of stable 
and harmonious relations among communities and for fostering mutual understanding, tolerance 
and peace. Learning about human rights is the first step towards respecting, promoting and 
defending the rights of all individuals and peoples. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>23. The Expert Mechanism recommends that States identify specific challenges and possible 
measures to achieve the implementation of the right of indigenous peoples to education in their 
respective countries, in consultation and cooperation with indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>24. The Expert Mechanism recommends that States Members of the United Nations pay 
particular attention to the right to education of indigenous peoples in the universal periodic 
review process of the Human Rights Council as well as under its special procedures. Similarly, it 
recommends that all relevant United Nations human rights treaty bodies pay attention to 
indigenous peoples&#8217; right to education in their communication with States parties, in particular in 
their periodic examination of State party reports.
