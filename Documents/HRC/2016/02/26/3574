<p><b> I.  Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 17/22, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to pay particular attention to the 
situation of migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing recent events in North Africa and to report 
to the Council at its eighteenth session. Accordingly, on 12 July 2011, OHCHR addressed a 
note verbale to Member States and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations 
in which it sought their views and information. Written submissions were received from a 
small number of States, intergovernmental organizations, and non-governmental 
organizations.1 In addition, OHCHR has relied on other credible governmental and non-
governmental sources with knowledge of the situation of migrants and asylum-seekers 
described in resolution 17/22. The present report will seek to describe the human rights 
implications of the movement of migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing recent events in 
North Africa during the period between January and August 2011.2  
</p>
<p>2. As events in the Middle East and North Africa unfolded in early 2011, the 
momentous political changes taking place in countries across the region were accompanied 
by significant population movements within and out of the region. In these flows were 
various groups of persons on the move, including refugees and asylum-seekers, migrant 
workers, stateless persons, trafficked and smuggled persons, unaccompanied and separated 
children, and migrants in search of reunification with family, or those in search of 
economic opportunity. Migrants moved within both regular and irregular channels. Some 
moved between different legal categories as their situation and need for protection changed 
during the course of their journey.  
</p>
<p>3. The protection and promotion of the human rights of all migrants is a priority of 
OHCHR. In her opening address to the Human Rights Council at its seventeenth session, 
the High Commissioner highlighted the extreme vulnerability of migrants to human rights 
violations, particularly in the context of recent events in North Africa. Human rights 
mechanisms have also expressed similar concerns; for example, in April 2011, the 
Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families expressed its alarm at the situation of thousands of migrant workers and their 
families who had fled armed conflict in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and were staying in 
overcrowded transit centres without access to basic amenities, or who were subject to 
dangerous interception at sea and at inland borders.<footnote name="3">&#8220;UN Committee alarmed by disastrous consequences of Libyan armed conflict for migrant workers&#8217; 
rights&#8221;, OHCHR press release, 13 April 2011. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>4. The armed conflict in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, which broke out late in February 
2011, was the main cause of population movement in the region. On 7 August 2011, it was 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Submissions were received from the Governments of Canada, Greece, Malta and the United Kingdom 
</p>
<p>of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the European Union, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the 
International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent 
Societies, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Amnesty International, the 
International Federation for Human Rights, Caritas Italiana and the International Commission on 
Eritrean Refugees. 
</p>

<p>reported that around 846,000 people had left the country since the start of the conflict.<footnote name="4">1 See for example &#8220;New Tunisian Red Crescent transit camp for migrants fleeing Libya&#8221;, International 
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, 15 April 2011. </footnote> Of 
these, some 648,083 were migrants, including 299,763 people from third countries (namely, 
not from the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya or the neighbouring countries into which they had 
arrived). The scale of movement was often staggering: in February, humanitarian 
organizations reported that up to 14,000 people had crossed the border between the Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya and Tunisia in one day.<footnote name="5">7. A number of countries provided financial support for the humanitarian response, 
including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, 
Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom, as well as the European Commission. Nonetheless, 
the revised Regional Flash Appeal for the Libyan Crisis was still significantly underfunded 
in early August. 
</footnote>  
</p>
<p>5. Apart from the estimated 186,000 Libyan nationals who remain displaced outside 
their country,6 migrants who arrive in neighbouring countries, such as Tunisia and Egypt, 
are located in various sites at the border until they can be evacuated or returned to other 
countries. 
</p>
<p>6. Many thousands of refugees living in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya prior to the 
uprising remain stranded there or in border camps, unable to return to the country because 
of the ongoing instability or to their countries of origin for fear of persecution and other 
human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>7. By early August, nearly 48,000 people had arrived at the seaports of Italy and 1,<footnote name="5">6. A joint humanitarian operation, spearheaded by IOM and UNHCR with the support 
of a large number of countries, has evacuated around 156,<footnote name="5">5. Neighbouring countries and countries outside the region received hundreds of 
thousands of migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing the upheaval in the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya. The largest number of migrants leaving the country fled overland to Tunisia 
and Egypt, while significant flows of migrants went to Algeria and the Niger, as well as to 
Chad and the Sudan. 
</footnote>66 migrants stranded at border 
camps in Tunisia and Egypt. Humanitarian agencies approached donors to provide 
chartered long-haul aircrafts to return migrants to their countries of origin. Tens of 
thousands of others were taken home by aircraft and ships provided by their Governments. 
Egypt, Tunisia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland offered air or sea transport to assist in the evacuation.43  
</footnote>35 
people had arrived in Malta.7 This movement included thousands of Tunisians who had left 
their country in the aftermath of the revolution of January 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights concerns 
</b></p>
<p>8. Human rights concerns have been reported in the contexts described below with 
regard to the situation of migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing recent events in North 
Africa. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Discrimination and violence against migrants 
</b></p>
<p>9. Prior to the outbreak of conflict in February 2011, there were an estimated 2.<footnote name="5">UNHCR press briefing notes, 1 March 2011.

million migrant workers in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya who were making significant 
contributions to the economy of the country.8 Since the 1990s, large populations of migrant 
workers had arrived in the country through regular and irregular channels. The majority 
worked as low-wage labourers in key industries, such as in oil, construction and agriculture. 
Refugees and asylum-seekers from such countries as Eritrea, Somalia, the Sudan and C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire came to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya in search of refuge. Some migrants and 
asylum-seekers entered the country in the hope of continuing onwards to other countries in 
the region and beyond.  
</p>
<p>10. While in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, migrants and asylum-seekers were vulnerable 
to human rights violations. Migrants from sub-Saharan Africa were reportedly subject to 
xenophobic attacks or hostility from the local population, and portrayed in the media as 
responsible for criminal behaviour. Migrants and asylum-seekers could be subject to 
arbitrary and prolonged detention, inhumane treatment, degrading conditions, violence, 
extortion and sexual abuse in detention, as well as being at risk of forced expulsions and

<p>

</p>
<p>As at 7 August, a total of 808,281 Libyans had at one time crossed the border to escape the conflict, 
with many eventually returning to the country.  
</p>

<p>refoulement to their countries of origin. Concerns were raised by human rights groups that a 
disproportionately high number of migrants were being executed in the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya in proceedings that failed to meet international standards for fair trials, with at 
least half of those sentenced to death being foreign nationals.9 
</p>
<p>11. Following the uprising in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, migrants continued to be 
vulnerable to human rights violations committed by Government forces and opposition 
groups, as well as unaffiliated civilians. The international commission of inquiry, 
established by the Human Rights Council in its resolution S-15/1, reported that 
mistreatment of migrant workers had taken many forms, including having their houses 
subject to arbitrary search, being beaten and subject to other cruel and inhuman treatment. 
The most serious attacks on migrant workers appeared to have been linked to a suspicion 
that such persons were &#8220;mercenaries&#8221; on the basis of their national origin or skin colour.10 
The commission also reported that migrants had been subject to forced disappearances and 
extra-judicial killings. Migrants trying to leave reported being regularly stopped and 
violently harassed at checkpoints, and there were reports that some had been kidnapped for 
ransom. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, acting under its 
urgent action procedure, also expressed its serious concern at the impact of the conflict on 
migrants and asylum-seekers.11 
</p>
<p>12. Following the outbreak of conflict, as hundreds of thousands of migrants streamed 
across borders, transit camps in border areas rapidly became overcrowded and volatile. 
Early in March 2011, at the Egyptian border with the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, one 
Bangladeshi man died after a fight over food distribution.12 Several violent incidents in 
May 2011, some involving confrontations between local residents and the camp population, 
left at least six migrants in Choucha camp in Tunisia dead, and parts of the camp destroyed 
by fire.13  
</p>
<p>13. Founded upon the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of every human 
being, the principles of equality and non-discrimination lie at the heart of international 
human rights law.14 In the context of conflict, migrants are entitled to the same protections 
afforded to nationals under international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>14. Article 16 (2) of the International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers 
and Members of Their Families and article 5 (b) of the International Convention on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination require States to provide effective police and other 
criminal justice protection for all persons, including irregular migrants, who are subject to 
physical or sexual violence, whether inflicted by Government officials or by private 
individuals, groups or institutions. In its general recommendation No. 30 on discrimination 
against non-citizens, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on 
States to take steps to address xenophobic attitudes and behaviour towards non-citizens, in

<p>particular hate speech and racial violence, and also to take resolute action to counter any 
tendency to target, stigmatize, stereotype or profile such groups. 
</p>
<p>15. In the context of the Declaration of the World Conference against Racism, Racial 
Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, States affirmed their responsibility to 
safeguard and protect migrants against illegal or violent acts, in particular acts of racial 
discrimination and crimes perpetrated with racist or xenophobic motivation by individuals 
or groups. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Trafficking and smuggling of migrants and asylum-seekers 
</b></p>
<p>16. For years, the mixed movement of people across the Mediterranean Sea has 
provided a lucrative income for smugglers and an opportunity for traffickers to prey on 
vulnerable and desperate migrants and asylum-seekers. It has been noted that increasingly 
tough controls at the external borders of Europe have increased the risks and raised the 
stakes of movement, forcing migrants and asylum-seekers into dangerous modes of travel, 
sometimes in conditions that violate human rights.15 Insufficient legal opportunities to 
migrate also added to the compulsion of migrants and asylum-seekers to rely on smugglers 
to facilitate movement. Some reports indicate that, in the context of recent events, migrants 
and asylum-seekers have felt compelled to leave overcrowded border camps to search out 
smugglers who could facilitate the sea crossing to Europe.16 
</p>
<p>17. Some migrants have been left alone and adrift on unseaworthy boats by smugglers, 
who have forced them to crew the boat themselves despite having no knowledge of how to 
operate the vessel or to navigate at sea. Others have been subject to violence and cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment by the people facilitating their movement. Still others 
who had thought that they had simply paid a smuggler to transport them to their destination 
have been forced into a situation of trafficking upon reaching destination.&#160;
</p>
<p>18. The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially 
Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime is the first international instrument to identify trafficked persons as 
victims of crime. Although not a human rights instrument, the Protocol contains important 
provisions in respect of protection for the victims of human trafficking. The High 
Commissioner has stated that trafficking itself is first and foremost a human rights 
violation.17  States have accordingly been urged to adopt a human rights-based approach to 
trafficking by a wide variety of human rights bodies.18 
</p>
<p>  
 15 A recent Europol report noted that &#8220;Increasing control of external borders, the introduction of higher 
</p>
<p>quality travel documents and other protective measures implemented by destination countries are 
making illegal immigration more difficult for individual migrants, forcing them to seek the services of 
organised crime groups &#8230; Transiting migrants are frequently exploited in illicit labour, thus marking 
a point of contact between illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings.&#8221; Europol, EU 
organized crime threat assessment, The Hague, 28 April 2011. 
</p>
<p> 16 M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res, &#8220;Trapped in transit: Neglected victims of the war in Libya&#8221;, 30 June 2011. 
UNHCR similarly reported that &#8220;a number of people who had fled Libya [crossed] back into Libya, 
with the intention of boarding boats to reach Europe. While refugees appear to be aware of the high 
death toll in such perilous journeys, most feel they have little to lose by the attempt.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> 17 OHCHR, Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking 
Commentary, New York and Geneva 2010. Jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights 
adopts the same approach, where the Court concluded in the case of <i>Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia</i> 
that &#8220;there can be no doubt that trafficking threatens the human dignity and fundamental freedoms of 
its victims and cannot be considered compatible with a democratic society and the values expounded 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>19. Regional standards that protect the human rights of victims of trafficking include the 
Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CETS No. 
197), 2005. 
</p>
<p>20. In 2002, OHCHR developed a set of recommended principles and guidelines on 
human rights and human trafficking in order to provide practical, rights-based policy 
guidance on the prevention of trafficking and the protection of victims of trafficking. Their 
purpose is to promote and facilitate the integration of a human rights perspective into 
national, regional and international anti-trafficking laws, policies and interventions. In 
2010, OHCHR published a commentary on the recommended principles and guidelines, 
which aims to provide further concrete guidance on the prevention of trafficking and the 
protection of victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p>21. Like the Trafficking Protocol, the primary aim of the Protocol against the 
Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime is to combat transnational crime. 
However, in affirming that the &#8220;protection of the rights of persons who have been the object 
[of smuggling]&#8221; is a State obligation, article 4 of the Protocol extends its scope beyond the 
prevention, investigation and prosecution of migrant smuggling offences to also ensure the 
human rights of smuggled migrants. In addition, article 19 provides a broad &#8220;savings 
clause&#8221; to ensure that States acting in pursuit of their obligations to combat human 
smuggling must do so in full compliance with their obligations under international law, 
including international human rights law. Under the Protocol, persons (or institutions) are 
not liable to criminal prosecution if they procure the illegal entry or permit the illegal 
residence of a migrant in a receiving State for reasons that do not involve financial or 
material gain.19 This would apply to individuals who smuggle family members, for 
example, or charitable organizations that assist the movement of asylum-seekers. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Interception and deaths at sea 
</b></p>
<p>22. In recent months, thousands of migrants and asylum-seekers from South Asia, as 
well as from sub-Saharan and North African countries, have sought to leave the Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya and other North African countries by sea, most relying on unseaworthy 
vessels. Most migrants and asylum-seekers who have fled on this route have arrived on the 
small Italian island of Lampedusa,20 with a small number reaching Malta. Reports also 
indicate that some vessels have been intercepted off the coast of Tunisia to prevent them 
making the journey towards Europe.  
</p>
<p>23. The boats in which the journey have been made are often overcrowded and in a poor 
state of repair. As a result, boats have broken apart in the water, or have drifted for days or 
weeks while migrants on board ran out of food and water. Vulnerable individuals were 
particularly at risk during such voyages; agencies reported that, in recent months, a woman 
gave birth at sea while awaiting rescue, while two other women suffered miscarriages

<p>during the ordeal at sea or just after being rescued. Hundreds of migrants have not survived 
the perilous journey across the Mediterranean, with reports suggesting that more than 1,400 
migrants may have perished in the crossing since the beginning of 2011 (see table below).

</p>
<p>24. In the most recent incident, Italian ships rescued around 370 refugees on 4 August 
2011 from a boat drifting near Lampedusa. Relief organizations say the migrants told of 
at least 30 people, most of them women, who had died of dehydration and exhaustion 
during the time that the rickety boat was in the water. Reports noted that the 20-metre 
vessel had left from near Tripoli on 30 July, vastly overcrowded and lacking water and 
food. Even as the boat was rescued, according to some reports the vessel had been 
allowed to drift for days despite having come to the attention of other vessels in the 
vicinity. 21 
</p>
<p>25. The non-exhaustive table above indicates the fate of boats carrying migrants seeking 
to reach Europe from North Africa in recent months.22 
</p>
<p>26. Concerns have been expressed that vessels operating in the Mediterranean are 
refusing to rescue migrants in distress at sea. In recent months, United Nations agencies and 
others have appealed to States to urgently put in place more reliable and effective 
mechanisms for rescues on the Mediterranean. Ship masters have also been called on to 
continue to adhere to the long-standing maritime obligation of aiding people in distress. 
Strong calls have been made to States, commercial shipping companies and others present 
in the Mediterranean to consider that, in the present circumstances, all boats leaving the 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya for Europe are likely to require assistance.

NATO air and naval units had been aware of the boat but had failed to come to its aid.<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 22 Statistics and data mainly sourced from the UNHCR submission for the present report, and from other  </p>
<p>credible sources. </p>


<p>27. Reports have also alleged that boats carrying rescued migrants have been unable to 
disembark the migrants at the nearest safe port.23 Concerns have been raised also that, as 
boats continue to arrive, States could revert to previous problematic interception policies 
that involved screening of protection needs at sea, or even to summary pushbacks.  
</p>
<p>28. All persons, regardless of where they are, their legal status, nationality or mode of 
travel, are entitled to protection of their right to life.24  
</p>
<p>29. Also guaranteed to all persons, regardless of their legal or other status, is the right to 
protection from refoulement.25 It should be noted that the principle of non-refoulement, 
which is recognized as a rule of customary international law, is equally applicable to all 
places where the intercepting State exercises jurisdiction and control, including on the high 
seas.26  
</p>
<p>30. Article 98.2 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea codifies the 
obligation of shipmasters to render assistance to any person found at sea in danger of being 
lost and to proceed with all possible speed to the rescue of persons in distress, if informed 
of their need for assistance. In addition, coastal States have an obligation to &#8220;promote the 
establishment, operation and maintenance of an adequate and effective search and rescue 
service.&#8221; The obligation of rescue is also provided in the International Convention for the 
Safety of Life at Sea. The International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue obliges 
States to &#8220;ensure that assistance be provided to any person in distress at sea &#8230; regardless of 
the nationality or status of such a person or the circumstances in which the person is found&#8221; 
(chap. 2.1.10).  
</p>
<p>31. In the context where a State has intercepted a ship suspected of smuggling migrants, 
article 9 of the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air (see 
</p>
<p>  
 23 One such incident took place in July 2011, when disagreement among several States, including Malta, 
</p>
<p>Spain and Italy, over disembarkation led to more than 100 migrants being stranded on a vessel under 
NATO command for several days. See &#8220;Migrants&#8217; rescue: Malta awaits NATO&#8217;s explanation&#8221;, <i>Times 
of Malta</i>, 14 July 2011. The Council of Europe expressed concerns in relation to the treatment of 
migrants and asylum-seekers rescued at sea, stating that &#8220;the absolute priority in the event of 
interception at sea is the swift disembarkation of those rescued to a &quot;place of safety&#8221;&#8230;Yet it is clear 
that the notion of &#8220;place of safety&#8221; should not be restricted solely to the physical protection of people, 
but necessarily also entails respect for their fundamental rights.&#8221; Council of Europe resolution 1821 
(2011), para. 5.2. 
</p>
<p> 24 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, art. 3; International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
art. 6 (1). 
</p>
<p> 25 Namely the return of anyone to a country where they would be at risk of torture, cruel, inhuman and 
degrading treatment. See Convention against Torture, art. 3, and (in the case of refugees) Convention 
relating to the Status of Refugees, art. 33. 
</p>
<p> 26 In its general comment No. 31, the Human Rights Committee noted that &#8220;the enjoyment of Covenant 
rights is not limited to citizens of States parties but must also be available to all individuals, regardless 
of nationality or statelessness, such as asylum-seekers, refugees, migrant workers and other persons, 
who may find themselves in the territory or subject to the jurisdiction of the State Party.&#8221; Similarly, 
the Committee against Torture affirmed that the non-refoulement obligation contained in article 3 of 
the Convention against Torture applies in any territory under a State party&#8217;s jurisdiction. See, for 
example, CAT/C/USA/CO/2. In the regional context, the Council of Europe noted that &#8220;the high seas 
are not an area where States are exempt from their legal obligations, including those emerging from 
international human rights law and international refugee law.&#8221; (resolution 1821). See also the 
judgement of the European Court of Human Rights in the case <i>Medvedev and others vs France</i> (no. 
3394/03), where the Court held that the exercise of full and exclusive control on the high seas was 
tantamount to jurisdiction. Also see UNHCR, Advisory Opinion on the Extraterritorial Application of 
Non-Refoulement Obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 
1967 Protocol, 26 January 2007.  </p>


<p>paragraph 22 above) requires the intercepting State to, inter alia, &#8220;ensure the safety and 
humane treatment of the persons on board&#8221;. In order to avoid arbitrary expulsions, all 
persons &#8211; including smuggled migrants &#8211; rescued at sea should be screened individually to 
determine whether they face particular risks to their dignity and safety if disembarked to a 
foreign State. 
</p>
<p>32. According to amendments to the International Convention on Maritime Search and 
Rescue adopted in 2004 that entered into force in 2006, States are obliged to cooperate and 
coordinate so that rescued persons are disembarked and delivered to a place of safety. The 
IMO Guidelines on the Treatment of Persons Rescued at Sea define such a place of safety 
as a &#8220;place where the survivors&#8217; safety of life is no longer threatened and where their basic 
human needs (such as food, shelter and medical needs) can be met.&#8221;27  
</p>
<p>33. The IMO Guidelines also highlight the &#8220;need to avoid disembarkation in territories 
where the lives and freedoms of those alleging a well-founded fear of persecution would be 
threatened is a consideration in the case of asylum-seekers and refugees recovered at sea.&#8221; 
The UNHCR Executive Committee has further specified that interception measures should 
not result in asylum-seekers and refugees being denied access to international protection or 
result in those in need of international protection being returned, directly or indirectly, to 
the frontiers of territories where their life or freedom would be threatened.28 
</p>
<p>34. In order to protect the physical integrity of migrants travelling at sea, States should 
be mindful to avoid dangerous interception practices. As the Inter-American Commission 
on Human Rights notes, &#8220;a policy of attempting to stop, board and/or tow fully loaded or 
overloaded crafts in poor conditions on the high seas is inherently a high risk operation 
which not only jeopardizes many lives, but has resulted in the loss of human life.&#8221;29 
</p>
<p><b> D. Reception, detention and collective expulsion  
</b></p>
<p>35. Particularly in the early months and weeks of the crisis, concerns were raised in 
relation to inadequate reception arrangements for migrant arrivals, including overcrowding 
and lack of appropriate facilities in reception centres. Overcrowding and inadequate 
facilities were reported in neighbouring countries as well as further afield.30 In the initial 
months, as reception centres rapidly filled to capacity, the numbers of arrivals in 
Lampedusa led the Government of Italy to declare a state of emergency on the island.

</p>
<p>seekers are now confined in camps and transit centers for an indefinite period of time, their freedom 
of movement severely limited. Existing transit facilities and services are not equipped for long-term 
stay, and confinement in these centers is tantamount to detention. This situation is having a serious 
impact on the mental and physical health of the most vulnerable people, including unaccompanied 
minors, children, pregnant women, and victims of torture, violence, or human trafficking. In both 
Tunisian and Italian centers, the existing accommodation is inadequate for anyone staying longer than 
a few days.&#8221; MSF, &#8220;Trapped in transit: Neglected victims of the war in Libya&#8221;, 30 June 2011. In July 
2011, riots erupted at an immigration centre in Bari, Italy, as asylum-seekers protested against delays 
in the processing of asylum claims. &#8220;African migrants found dead on overcrowded boat bound for 
Italy&#8221;, <i>Guardian</i>, 1 August 2011. </p>


<p>36. By late July 2011, concerns were reported in relation to lengthy delays in the 
registration and processing of migrants at the border in Tunisia and Egypt, as well as 
continuing concerns about inadequate living conditions for the migrants who remained in 
these locations.31 Agencies reported that migrants had been forced to sleep outside in the 
bitter cold, as available shelter at the border was filled to capacity. Recent reports indicate 
that smaller numbers of migrant workers, many from sub-Saharan Africa, continue also to 
be stranded inside the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, living in the open with limited access to 
food, water and health services.32 
</p>
<p>37. Agencies have reported concerns that some countries operate a mandatory detention 
policy for irregular migrant arrivals by sea from North Africa, leading in some cases to 
prolonged detention. Concerns have also been expressed about the situation of 
unaccompanied migrant children in reception facilities, particularly where there is 
overcrowding and where conditions are otherwise inadequate.33 
</p>
<p>38. While no reports of mass or collective expulsions have been received at any of the 
borders to which migrants and asylum-seekers are arriving, isolated incidents of 
refoulement have been reported, particularly at land borders, and there are ongoing 
concerns that border guards may lack the necessary training and technical tools to be able to 
identify accurately protection needs in the context of mixed flows. &#160;
</p>
<p>39. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (art. 25) and the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights provide that everyone is entitled to enjoy the right 
to an adequate standard of living (art. 11), the right to health (art. 12)34 and to education 
(article 13, and article 26 of the Declaration). The Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights has clarified that the prohibition of non-discrimination also includes 
discrimination against non-nationals on the grounds of nationality.35 
</p>
<p>40. In line with the requirements of non-discrimination, reception arrangements to meet 
the immediate material and psychosocial needs of migrants, such as accommodation, food, 
clothing and medical services, should be provided to all persons, regardless of status, until 
referral is possible to the appropriate services and procedures. Reception centres that house 
children should include appropriate facilities for education, as well as play. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Detention 
</b></p>
<p>41. Under international human rights law, and because of the drastic impact of detention 
on the individual human being, the deprivation of liberty should in all cases be a measure of 
last resort and the result of an individual determination. The right to liberty and security of 
person is a fundamental human right enjoyed by everyone, regardless of legal status. 
Articles 3 and 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 9 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide accordingly that everyone has

<p> 33 Caritas Italiana submission, 4 August 2011. 
 34 In paragraph 34 of its general comment No. 14, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights referred to the obligation of States to respect the right to health by, inter alia, refraining from 
denying or limiting equal access for all persons, including asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants, to 
preventive, curative and palliative health services. 
</p>

<p>the right to liberty and security of person, and that no one should be subjected to arbitrary 
arrest or detention. Therefore, while international law allows that administrative 
immigration detention may legitimately be applied in certain individual cases, it is widely 
held that such a deprivation of liberty should be exceptional, and used only as a measure of 
last resort. 
</p>
<p>42. In addition, international law provides that the detention of children, including 
children in the context of migration, should generally be avoided. The Special Rapporteur 
on the human rights of migrants has affirmed that it is never in the best interests of children 
to be detained, and that children should not be detained on the basis of their migratory 
status or irregular entry to the country.36 
</p>
<p>43. The prohibition of arbitrary detention means that any decision to detain must be 
guided by principles of reasonableness, necessity, proportionality and non-discrimination. 
These principles also require States to consider other ways to achieve their objectives 
without interfering with the right to liberty and security of person. So-called &#8220;alternatives to 
detention&#8221; can take the form of reporting requirements, bails or bonds, open centres and 
directed residence, or electronic monitoring. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
advised that &#8220;alternative and noncustodial measures, such as reporting requirements, should 
always be considered before resorting to detention.&#8221;37 In the regional context, article 15 (1) 
of the European Union Returns Directive asserts that immigration detention should be 
preceded by a consideration of &#8220;other sufficient but less coercive measures [that] can be 
applied effectively in a specific case.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>44. The impulse to use detention as a deterrent measure could also be questioned in the 
light of recent research, which indicates that there is no empirical evidence to support the 
conclusion that detention deters irregular migration or discourages persons from seeking 
asylum. 38 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Collective expulsion 
</b></p>
<p>45. The absolute prohibition of collective expulsion is well established in international 
and regional human rights law.39 Article 22 (1) of the International Convention on the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families provides that &#8220;migrant 
workers and members of their families shall not be subject to measures of collective 
expulsion. Each case of expulsion shall be examined and decided individually.&#8221; Article 4 of 
Protocol 4 to the European Convention on Human Rights similarly provides that &#8220;collective 
expulsion of aliens is prohibited.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>46. In accordance with this principle, all non-nationals enjoy protection from collective 
expulsion, including those with an irregular status. Accordingly, each person in a group of 
non-nationals intercepted by a State has the right not to be returned or removed without

<p>consent to any other State without a prior reasonable and objective examination of the 
circumstances of that particular individual&#8217;s case. This due process right ensures that all 
grounds under international and national law that may avoid the expulsion of the individual 
are duly taken into account. Such grounds can include the prohibition of refoulement, 
family reunification, protection of victims of trafficking, the rights of unaccompanied or 
separated children, subsidiary or temporary protection considerations, and other grounds 
arising from health needs, and particular individual circumstances. 
</p>
<p>47. In order to ensure safeguards against the arbitrary expulsion of migrants, it is 
important that State officials who make decisions relating to expulsion, including border 
guards, should be able to appreciate the full range of arguments that weigh against the 
expulsion of a particular individual, be adequately trained on relevant standards of national 
and international law (including international refugee law and human rights law) and be in 
an effective position to corroborate relevant elements where necessary. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Response of the international community  
</b></p>
<p>48. The initiatives described below are some of those taken by States and other 
stakeholders that are of relevance to the situation of migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing 
recent events in North Africa. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Rescue at sea 
</b></p>
<p>49. A number of search and rescue interventions have been carried out by countries in 
the Mediterranean region since January 2011. 
</p>
<p>50. In its recently published Fundamental Rights Strategy, the European Border Control 
Agency Frontex noted that the &#8220;respect and promotion of fundamental rights are 
unconditional and integral components of effective integrated border management&#8221; and 
stipulated that Frontex joint operations are to take into account &#8220;the particular situation of 
persons seeking international protection and the particular circumstances of vulnerable 
individuals or groups in need of protection or special care (e.g. separated and 
unaccompanied children, women, victims of trafficking, and persons with medical 
needs).&#8221;40 
</p>
<p>51. In June 2011, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe  appointed 
Senator Tineke Strik of the Netherlands to head an inquiry into the death of hundreds of 
migrants in the Mediterranean since January 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Protection of vulnerable migrants  
</b></p>
<p>52. A number of governmental and non-governmental actors provided emergency 
humanitarian assistance to migrants and asylum-seekers stranded at borders, including 
food, water, medical care and psychosocial support. 41 Measures were also taken to improve 
</p>
<p>  
 40 It should be noted that the Parliamentary Committee of the Council of Europe cautioned in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 1821 (2011) that, while welcoming the amendment of rules governing Frontex, &#8220;the 
Assembly is concerned about the lack of clarity regarding the respective responsibilities of European 
Union states and Frontex and the absence of adequate guarantees for the respect of fundamental rights 
and international standards in the framework of joint operations co-ordinated by that agency.&#8221; 
</p>

<p>the condition of migrants in reception centres; for example, in April, the Government of 
Italy put in place procedures intended to facilitate the rapid transfer of migrants and 
asylum-seekers from Lampedusa, in partnership with non-governmental organizations.42  
</p>
<p>53. More than 1,600 of some 37,000 Bangladeshi migrant workers forced to flee the 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya have received reintegration grants of 50,000 taka ($680) each from 
the Government of Bangladesh through a grant programme, which is managed by IOM and 
funded by a $40 million loan from the World Bank. 
</p>
<p>54. On 5 April 2011, the European Union adopted a Directive (2011/63/EU), which is 
aimed at harmonizing legislation and penalties, ensuring successful prosecution and better 
protection of and assistance to victims, and preventing trafficking. The Directive also 
repeals Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA and represents a crucial step forward in 
addressing human trafficking in and into the territory of the European Union. 
</p>
<p><b> C. International cooperation  
</b></p>

<p>Borders Fund, may be mobilized to provide additional support for Member States dealing 
with mixed flows of migrants.44   
</p>
<p>60. On 20 April 2011, UNHCR launched the Global Resettlement Solidarity Initiative, 
which calls upon States to consider contributing resettlement places for non-Libyan 
refugees coming from the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and who are hosted on the borders of 
Egypt and Tunisia, as well as for long-term refugees  living in urban centres in Egypt. To 
date, UNHCR has received pledges from 11 countries offering some 936 resettlement 
places for resettlement out of Egypt and Tunisia. The United States of America has pledged 
a number of resettlement places, and the Government of Canada reported that it had 
selected for resettlement a number of refugees in Tunisia, as well as from the Sallum camp 
on the Egyptian-Libyan border.45 On 12 May, the European Commission organized a 
ministerial pledging conference during which European Union Member States and three 
associated countries pledged to resettle a total of 718 refugees from North Africa, in 
particular from Tunisia and Egypt.46 
</p>
<p>61. On 24 May 2011, the European Commission adopted a communication entitled 
&#8220;Dialogue for migration, mobility and security with the Southern Mediterranean countries&#8221; 
(COM (2011)292). In the communication, the Commission proposed establishing dialogues 
on migration, mobility and security with the southern Mediterranean countries. 47 
</p>
<p><b>  IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> The flows of people leaving North Africa in response to recent events are often 
termed &#8220;mixed flows&#8221;, in that they include people with various motivations and 
protection profiles, including refugees and asylum-seekers, unaccompanied and 
separated children, victims of trafficking, irregular migrants and smuggled migrants. 
Vulnerable groups include in addition women at risk, elderly migrants, migrants with 
disabilities, and migrants with serious health conditions and needs, including as a 
result of being caught up in the conflict. International norms provide that every 
person in a mixed flow is entitled to the individual consideration of his or her 
particular circumstances; accordingly, this requires States to put in place protection-
sensitive responses to such flows. 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> Such an approach is preferable to policies that are premised on assumptions 
about the motivations of migrants based on their country of nationality or of 
departure, their gender, age or their ethnicity. Under international human rights law, 
all arriving migrants are entitled to have access to an adequate process to determine 
their protection needs. Some migrants will need the protection offered by specific legal 
regimes, such as refugee law or the protection of victims of trafficking. Others will 
need the protection of universal human rights norms that protect all persons 
regardless of their status. The advantage of such an approach, in addition to assuring 
greater protection of human rights, is that it could reduce pressure on the asylum

<p>  
 44 Submission of the European Union, 11 August 2011. The European Commission also reported that 
</p>
<p>any future flows of migrants could enable use of the 2001 Temporary Protection Directive so as to 
provide immediate protection and reception in the territory of Member States of the European Union 
for the persons concerned and to promote voluntary solidarity between Member States.

<p><b>system of receiving countries by enabling officials to channel migrants towards 
protection systems that are appropriate to their situation. 
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> While the immediate humanitarian and human rights challenges relating to 
migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing recent events in North Africa continue to 
preoccupy the international community, it is important to bear in mind some potential 
longer-term consequences of the larger movement of migrants. A significant number 
of migrant workers are no longer able to send remittances to their families and 
communities, and a considerable number have been compelled to return to countries 
with high unemployment rates and fragile or inadequate social support 
infrastructure. Countries with newly established or transitional Governments, such as 
Egypt and Tunisia, have been faced with the need to reintegrate large numbers of 
returning migrants without adequate time to prepare, and are already seeing a drop 
in remittance flows. Effective international cooperation will need to be ensured so that 
neighbouring countries are able to shoulder adequately the burden of hosting large 
populations of migrants and asylum-seekers. In the context of the legislative and 
institutional reform process currently under way in these countries, it would be 
important to ensure the inclusion of human rights protections for all migrants in 
relevant laws and regulations. 
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> A major concern for repatriated migrant workers is the financial impact of 
contracts that have been terminated on short notice, sometimes without the payment 
of due salaries, and the rescue of data on social security contributions made in 
countries of employment, which are no longer accessible.48 It is important therefore 
that responses to the current migration crisis take into effective account the longer 
term need to ensure that any return of migrants to their countries of origin is 
sustainable and that the human rights of all returnees, including their fundamental 
economic, social and cultural rights, are respected, protected and fulfilled.</b>   
</p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> The High Commissioner recommends that States: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Increase efforts to prevent deaths at sea through prompt and 
coordinated action; all States</b>, <b>commercial shipping companies and others present in 
the Mediterranean should consider that all boats leaving the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya 
are likely to require assistance and act accordingly; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Make efforts to ensure that adequate procedures are put in place at 
borders in order to clarify individual protection needs under international refugee law 
and human rights law prior to any lawful expulsion or removal;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Consider granting temporary permits on humanitarian grounds to 
migrants fleeing recent events in North Africa; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Ensure that all migrants and asylum-seekers are protected from 
arbitrary detention, and explore the use of alternative and non-custodial measures 
prior to placing migrants in administrative detention;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Avoid detaining migrant and asylum-seeking children, regardless of 
their status;
