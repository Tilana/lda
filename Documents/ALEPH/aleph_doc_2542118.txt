Summary

The Ann Mason Project (Project) is located in west-central Nevada, approximately 75 km southeast of Reno, 45 km southeast of Carson City
(the capital of Nevada), and 7 km west of the town of Yerington (Figure 1-1).  The Project is situated within the Yerington Mining District, a
historical copper mining district that covers the eastern side of the Project in Lyon County.
 
Since 2009, through a company merger with PacMag, option agreements, purchases and ground staking, Entrée has consolidated a group of
mineral claims west of the town of Yerington, Nevada, comprising 1,053 unpatented lode mining claims and 20 patented lode mining claims,
covering a total area of approximately 8,005 ha.  Together these claims now form the Ann Mason Project.
 
The Project hosts two known mineral deposits: Ann Mason and Blue Hill.  Both are copper molybdenum porphyries although Blue Hill is
predominantly  an  oxide  copper  deposit.    This  PEA  focused  on  the  Ann  Mason  sulphide  copper  deposit  and  concluded  that  it  could  be
developed  as  a  large-scale  open  pit  mine  with  a  conventional  sulphide  flotation  milling  operation.    A  site  layout  has  been  prepared  to
illustrate the proposed location of required infrastructure, mining, and processing facilities for the Project (Figure 1-2).
 
Entrée  retained  AGP  Mining  Consultants  (AGP)  to  provide  a  National  Instrument  43-101  (NI  43-101)  compliant  Preliminary  Economic
Assessment (PEA) of the Ann Mason Deposit.  As part of the PEA, a resource update was completed on Ann Mason by Quantitative Group
Pty Ltd (QG) for use in this study.  This PEA conforms to the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Mineral Resources
and Mineral Reserves definitions referred to in NI 43-101, Standards of Disclosure of Mineral Projects.
 
Additionally, AGP provided the first resource statement for Blue Hill.  Although the initial resource estimate for Blue Hill is included in this
report, it was not evaluated as part of the PEA.
 
The PEA study used Base Case metal prices of $3.00/lb Cu, $13.50/lb Mo, $22/oz Ag and $1,200/oz Au for the economic analysis.  The pit
design incorporated metal price assumptions (Engineering Design Prices) of $2.50/lb Cu, $13.50/lb Mo, $15/oz Ag, and $1,100/oz Au.  All
costs, unless otherwise noted are in Q3 2012 United States dollars.  Cost estimates were developed for all disciplines, both in operating and
capital  requirements.    AGP  concludes  that  the  Ann  Mason  Project  has  the  potential  to  yield  a  pre-tax  net  present  value  (NPV)  of
$1,106 million at a 7.5% discount rate with an IRR of 14.8%.  The payback is anticipated to be 6.4 years.  Post-tax the NPV is $690 million at
7.5% discount rate with an IRR of 12.6% and 7.1 year payback..

Site Layout
The  PEA  is  preliminary  in  nature  and  includes  Inferred  Mineral  Resources,  which  are  considered  too  speculative  geologically  to  have
economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.  There is no certainty that the
results in this preliminary economic assessment will be realized.
 
AGP recommends that the Ann Mason Project advance to the next levels of engineering and trade-off studies, with infill and exploration
drilling, metallurgical testwork, engineering, and environmental field programs required to support the necessary level of engineering for a
prefeasibility study (PFS).  Advanced planning of this work is a critical component to its success; therefore, recommendations by discipline
are provided to ensure sufficient information is available going forward.
 
With the current level of information for the Project, AGP does not foresee Mineral Resources, potential economics, or environment issues that
would inhibit the Project from advancing to further levels of study.
 
1.1
 
The Project area comprises two main mineralized deposits: Ann Mason, a copper-molybdenum porphyry hosted by granodiorite and quartz
monzonite; and Blue Hill a copper oxide and sulphide deposit, located approximately 1.5 km northwest of the Ann Mason deposit.  Several
other under explored copper oxide and sulphide targets are located throughout the Project area.
 
Since acquiring the Project, Entrée’s exploration work has focused on increasing and upgrading the Mineral Resources of the Ann Mason
deposit,  defining  initial  Mineral  Resources  at  Blue  Hill  and  identifying  and  drill  testing  new  copper  targets  on  other  areas  of  the
Project.  Based on the favourable exploration results at Ann Mason, Entrée has recently shifted the focus towards the completion of this PEA
on the Ann Mason deposit and advancing towards a PFS.
 
1.1.1
Regional Geology
Geology
Ann Mason is hosted by several phases of the Jurassic-aged Yerington batholith, including, granodiorite (Jgd), porphyritic quartz monzonite
(Jpqm), quartz monzonite (Jqm) and younger quartz monzonite porphyry dykes (Qmp-a, Qmp-b and Qmp-c).  Copper mineralization primarily
occurs within a broad zone of main-stage potassic alteration containing chalcopyrite and bornite.  An assemblage of chalcopyrite-epidote or
chalcopyrite-epidote-quartz mineralization locally overprints main-stage potassic alteration and copper mineralization.
 
Within the Yerington district, Mesozoic host rocks and copper-molybdenum porphyry deposits have been rotated 60° to 90° westward by
Miocene  age  normal  faulting  and  extension.    As  a  result,  mineralized  intercepts  in  vertical  drill  holes  through  Ann  Mason  represent
approximately horizontal intervals across the original pre-tilt geometry of the deposit.
 
 
Page 1-4
Ann Mason Deposit
1.1.2
 
The Ann Mason deposit has the characteristics of a typical, large copper-molybdenum porphyry system.  Projected to the surface, the 0.15%
Cu  envelope  covers  an  area  approximately  2.3  km  northwest  and  up  to  1.3  km  northeast.    At  depth,  this  envelope  extends  more  than  a
kilometre below surface.  The mineralization remains open in most directions.
 
Within  the  0.15%  Cu  envelope  the  highest  grades  occur  within  a  200  m  to  800  m  thick,  west-plunging  zone  that  surrounds  the  intrusive
contact between granodiorite and porphyritic quartz monzonite.  Within this zone, the highest copper grades are dependent on vein density,
sulphide species, frequency, and relative age of quartz monzonite porphyry dykes and the mafic content of the granodiorite.  Mineralization is
closely associated with quartz monzonite (Qmp-a and Qmp-b) porphyry dykes.
 
Sulphide  zoning  is  that  of  a  typical  porphyry  copper  with  an  outer  pyritic  shell,  and  concentric  zones  of  increasing  chalcopyrite  and
decreasing pyrite progressing inward to a central zone of chalcopyrite-bornite.
 
Within  the  northeast,  southeast,  and  southwest  quadrants  of  the  deposit  chalcopyrite  and  chalcopyrite-bornite  are  the  primary  sulphide
domains.  This mineralization is the most dominant in terms of overall deposit tonnage and continues to the drilled depth of the deposit.  In the
northwest quadrant the primary sulphide domain is chalcopyrite ≥ pyrite; a domain that forms thick intervals of >0.3% Cu, with only minor
bornite present at depth, near the granodiorite-porphyritic quartz monzonite contact.
 
Chalcopyrite occurs as individual grains in veins and disseminated in rock, as fillings in brecciated pyrite grains, attached to or included in
pyrite grains, and attached to or included in bornite.  Bornite occurs as separate grains in veins, and disseminated in rock and attached to
chalcopyrite.    Sparce  chalcocite  occurs  as  replacement  rims  on  chalcopyrite,  but  more  commonly  as  replacement  rims  or  exsolution
replacement of bornite.
 
Molybdenum  occurs  as  molybdenite  in  quartz  veins  and  on  fracture  or  shear  surfaces  as  molybdenum  paint  in  several  of  the  copper
domains.  In the current resource model molybdenum is constrained within a >0.005% Mo grade envelope that occurs almost entirely within
the 0.15% Cu envelope and extending further below, where sodic (albite) alteration has removed copper mineralization, leaving molybdenum
largely in place.  The molybdenum mineralization also remains open towards the north.
 
 
Page 1-5
Silver ≥0.6 g/t and gold ≥0.06 g/t are closely associated with the occurrence of bornite within the chalcopyrite-bornite sulphide domain.
 
Alteration types include a broad, main-stage zone of potassic alteration (secondary biotite, K-feldspar), an outer propylitic zone (chlorite and
epidote occurring with pyrite) and restricted late-stage overprints of sodic-calcic (chlorite+oligoclase±epidote), sodic (albite ), sericite, zeolite
and gypsum.  Late-stage sodic and sericite alteration occur along late, high-angle faults and as local, pervasive alteration of rocks.  In areas of
strong (>15%) albite or sericite alteration, the copper grades can locally be greatly reduced, resulting in copper grades <0.2% and in places,
<0.05%.  Molybdenum mineralization is not significantly affected by the late sodic alteration, beyond partial remobilization from veins into
nearby fractures and shears.
 
Two prominent structures form structural boundaries to the Ann Mason resource:
 
 ·The relatively flat Singatse Fault truncates the upper surface of the 0.15% Cu envelope over a portion of the deposit and juxtaposes sterile
Tertiary volcanic rocks on top of the mineralized intrusives.
·A high-angle, northwest-trending, southwest dipping fault located along the southwest margin of the resource juxtaposes chlorite-altered
rocks with pyrite mineralization in the hanging wall against potassically-altered rocks with copper-molybdenum mineralization in the
footwall.  Copper-molybdenum mineralization in the footwall remains open at depth along the entire strike length of the fault.
Other, late, high-angle faults, either with or without sodic or sericite alteration, cross the deposit in various orientations.
 
1.1.3
Blue Hill Deposit
near surface, oxide/mixed-copper mineralization
The Blue Hill deposit is about 1.5 km northwest of Ann Mason and occurs in a very similar geologic environment, but in a separate fault
block.  AGP opted not to include Blue Hill in the PEA until additional exploration work is completed.
 
Two main styles of porphyry mineralization have been identified:
 
  1)
 
  2)
 
Both styles of mineralization are hosted  by quartz monzonite with lesser amounts of porphyritic quartz monzonite and quartz monzonite
porphyry.  The low-angle, southeast dipping Blue Hill Fault strikes northeast through the middle of the target, cutting off a portion of the near-
surface oxide mineralization.  However, sulphides continue below the fault to the southeast.
 
 
Page 1-6
underlying copper-molybdenum sulphide mineralization.
The oxide zone is exposed on surface and has been traced by drilling as a relatively flat-lying zone covering an area of about 900 m by 450
m, and continuing for several hundred metres further to the west as a thinner zone.  Significant copper oxides, encountered in both reverse
circulation (RC) and core drill holes extend from surface to an average depth of 124 m.  Oxide copper mineralization consists of malachite,
chrysocolla, rare azurite, black copper-manganese oxides, copper sulphates, and copper-bearing limonites.  Mineralization occurs primarily
on fracture surfaces and in oxidized veins or veinlets.  A zone of mixed oxide/sulphide mineralization with minor chalcocite is present below
the oxide mineralization to depths of up to 185 m and averaging about 160 m.  The copper oxide zone remains open to the northwest.
 
Oxide copper mineralization at Blue Hill is interpreted to be the result of in-place oxidation of copper sulphides with only minor transport of
copper into vugs, fractures, and faults or shear zones.  No significant zones of secondary enrichment have been observed.
 
The copper-mineralized sulphide zone underlies the southern half of the oxide mineralization and continues to depth towards the southeast,
below the Blue Hill Fault.  Mineralization consists of varying quantities of pyrite, chalcopyrite, and molybdenite.  Local, higher-grade sulphide
mineralization commonly occurs within zones of sheeted veins containing chalcopyrite, magnetite and secondary biotite.  Significant amounts
of disseminated molybdenum mineralization have been observed locally, often in contact with dykes.  To the northwest, below the oxides only
a  few  holes  have  tested  the  sulphide  potential;  however,  in  this  direction  the  sulphides  appear  to  be  increasingly  pyritic  with  only  minor
amounts of copper.
 
Alteration assemblages are similar to Ann Mason except that original zoning is difficult to discern in areas of pervasive oxidation.  Within
zones  of  sulphide  mineralization,  propylitic  alteration  is  more  widespread  and  potassic  alteration  is  more  restricted  to  quartz  monzonite
porphyry dykes and immediately adjacent rocks of the Yerington batholith.  Late stage sodic alteration locally reduces copper grades, similar
to what has been observed at Ann Mason.
 
The sulphide mineralization remains open is several directions, most importantly, to the southeast, towards Ann Mason.

This  PEA  is  preliminary  in  nature  and  includes  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  that  are  considered  too  speculative  geologically  to  have  the
economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves.  there is no certainty that the PEA
will be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.  Only the resources at the Ann
Mason deposit were included in the PEA mine design and economic analysis, however, both the Ann Mason and Blue Hill deposits are
included in the resource statement and presented separately.  .

Ann Mason
1.2.1
 
Entrée contracted QG based in Perth, Australia, to prepare an updated Mineral Resource estimate for Ann Mason.  The current resource
estimate is contained within a constraining Lerchs-Grossmann (LG) pit shell, generated by AGP, and is based on approximately 33,000 m of
recent drilling in 30 holes and approximately 49,000 m of historical drilling in 116 holes.  The resource database also includes re-assaying of
6,142 samples from 44 historical Anaconda core holes, to allow molybdenum, gold, and silver values to be estimated.  At a base case cut-off
of 0.20% Cu, the deposit is estimated to contain an Indicated Mineral Resource of 1,137 Mt at 0.33% Cu and 0.006% Mo and an Inferred
Mineral Resource of 873 Mt at 0.29% Cu and 0.004% Mo.  By-product levels of gold and silver were also estimated and are shown in Table 1-
1.  The Mineral Resource estimate is CIM compliant and prepared in accordance with NI 43-101.

Note:The Mineral Resource estimate has an effective date of August 14, 2012 and was prepared by Scott Jackson, F.AusIMM from QG.
 
Mineral Resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.
 
The key estimation parameters used by QG for the Ann Mason estimate are as follows:
 
 ·Copper was interpolated using a single estimation domain created using an approximate 0.15% Cu threshold.  A similar however smaller
domain was built for molybdenum using a 0.005% threshold.
· Assays were composited to 5 m in line.
Page 1-8
·Copper and molybdenum variograms show that there is not a high degree of anisotropy; there is a moderate nugget effect and ranges up to
300 m were modelled.
·Inside the copper domain, composites above 2% were given a restricted range of influence (40 m).  For molybdenum, a similar strategy was
applied at 0.01% molybdenum.
· Estimation of 40 x 40 x 15 m blocks was by ordinary kriging (OK).
 
 ·Density in the mineralized porphyry was based on 4,051 wax-immersion determinations and a Kriging model was built.  In the volcanics
above the Singatse Fault a single bulk density value (2.34) based on 130 measurements was used.
·The resource was classified into inferred or indicated using a number of factors, taking into account confidence in the model, data spacing
and various complementary geostatistical parameters, as follows:
-Indicated: Material inside the 0.15% Cu domain with a slope of regression (a measure of conditional bias) above 0.7
 
 -Inferred: Material inside the 0.15% Cu domain with a spacing of greater than 100 m, but less than 175 m (i.e., the rest of the copper domain)
 
 -Not Classified: All material outside the 0.15% Cu domain or below the economic pit shell.
 
The general parameters of the LG pit are as follows:
 
 ·3-year trailing average gross metal values of $3.61/lb Cu, $14.94/lb Mo, $1,425/oz Au, and $27.91/oz Ag
 
  · metallurgical recoveries of 92% Cu, 50% Mo, 50% Au and 55% Ag
 
 ·mining costs: $1.09/t base cost to the 1,605 m level then increasing by $0.02/t/15 m bench below that level
 
  · process and G&A costs of $6.12/t ($5.82/t process plus $0.30/t G&A)
 
  · pit slopes of 52° in the volcanic rock and 44° in the porphyry mineralization.
 
1.2.2
 
Mr. Desautels of AGP is the QP responsible for the Blue Hill resource estimate.   The estimate is based on copper, molybdenum, gold, and
silver drill hole sample grades collected from 6 core and 24 RC drill holes completed by Entrée, and also from 20 historical core and RC drill
holes completed by Anaconda and PacMag Metals.
 
The key parameters of the estimate are as follows:
Blue Hill
Page 1-9
·Domains were modelled in 3D to separate oxide, mixed, and primary mineralization from surrounding waste rock.  The domains were
modelled to a nominal 0.075% Cu cut-off.
·High-grade outliers in the drill hole assay database were capped to 0.75% for copper, 0.03 g/t for gold, and 2 g/t for silver prior to
compositing.  No capping was applied to molybdenum.
·Drill hole assays were composited to 5 m lengths interrupted by the overall mineralization boundary.
 
 ·Block grades for copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver were estimated from the drill hole composites using inverse distance weighted to the
second power (ID2) into 40 x 40 x 15 m blocks coded by domain.  Molybdenum, gold, and silver were estimated for sulphide blocks only.
·Dry bulk density was estimated globally for each domain from drill core samples collected throughout the deposit.  The oxide and mixed
zones were assigned a density of 2.57 t/m3 and the sulphide zone was assigned 2.62 t/m3.
· metallurgical recoveries of:
· average gross metal values of:
- 81.7% leachable oxide copper
· All blocks were classified as inferred in accordance to CIM definitions.
 
Mineral Resources were reported within an LG pit shell, generated by AGP, above a copper cut-off of 0.10% for the oxide and mixed zones
and 0.15% for the sulphide zone.
 
The general parameters of the LG pit are as follows:
 
 
 
  - $3.32/lb Cu for oxide and mixed material
 
 - $3.16/lb Cu, $12.12/lb Mo, $1,057/oz Au, and $13.58/oz Ag for sulphide material

Entrée retained BGC Engineering Inc. (BGC) in association with AGP to undertake a geotechnical review of the proposed open pit.  To
accomplish this, BGC completed a site visit in February/March 2012.  During the site visit, rock mass characterization was completed by
reviewing available core, visiting the Yerington pit, located on an adjacent property owned by Quaterra Resources Inc. (Quaterra), and by
examining the Ann Mason site with Entrée personnel.
 
The drill core that was reviewed from the Ann Mason deposit was primarily located in the area of mineralization; no drill core was available in
the area of the proposed pit slopes.  In addition, much of the drill core reviewed had been cut and sampled for assays.  Drill core was HQ
diameter and recovered with the “double tube” method, typical of exploration geology drilling.  This method is adequate for geology logging
and assay; however, the core can be disturbed and broken by the drilling process.  As such, rock quality designations (RQD) logged by
Entrée as part of their basic data collection may under-represent the in-situ quality of rock mass due to this disturbance.  BGC supplemented
Entrée’s data with observations of rock strength, fracture spacing, longest stick, and joint conditions for the sections of core reviewed.
 
 
Page 1-11
Tertiary volcanics (Domain I)
Geotechnical data relevant to the open pit slopes is limited at this stage of study, typical of most mine development projects at the PEA
stage.  Entrée’s work on the geology of the site appears to be of good quality and their development of a fault model at this stage of study is
commendable.  The major data limitation identified in the review is a lack of geotechnical drilling information outside of the mineralized zone
or proposed wall slopes.  Geotechnical data in the area of the proposed pit slopes will be needed for future geotechnical evaluations.
 
The rock mass of the Ann Mason deposit was divided into three main geotechnical units:
 
  1)
 
  2) Granodiorite of the Yerington batholith (Domain II)
 
  3) Quartz monzonite porphyry of the Yerington batholith (Domain II).
 
The overlying volcanics have limited the weathering of the underlying granodiorites and monzonites.
 
Bedding is the main geological structure observed in the volcanic rocks of the Ann Mason deposit.  The bedding dips on average at 62° to
the west.  This west dip of the bedding is a result of the regional tilting due to the rotation of normal faulting.  The main faults of the Ann Mason
deposit are the Singatse Fault, the Montana Yerington Fault (1.5 km east of pit), and several possible southeast- striking normal faults.
 
Pit slope configurations were provided to AGP by BGC for pit design work.  This included overall slope angle, inter-ramp angle by domain,
bench height, safety bench spacing, and width and bench face angles.  The maximum inter-ramp height is limited at this stage of study to
150 m in the Ann Mason deposit.  Each 150 m, an extra width “geotechnical berm” is to be applied which has a width of 32 m.
 
The pit slope design indicated the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  - height between safety benches = 30 m (double benched)
- bench face angle = 67 degrees
· Volcanics (Domain I)
-
inter-ramp angle = 52 degrees
- width of safety bench = 11 m
· Porphyry (Domain II)
-
inter-ramp angle = 39 degrees
- bench face angle = 63 degrees
- height between safety benches = 15 m (single benched)
 
 
 
 
Page 1-12
- width of safety bench = 11 m.
These have been incorporated in the current design.
 
BGC recommends the following:
 
 ·Future geotechnical studies should focus on geotechnical specific drill holes targeting the proposed wall rocks of the pit.  A minimum of four
inclined holes should be completed each of which may be up to 800 m long.  All holes should be “triple tube” coring system holes with splits
in the core tube.  HQ3 diameter core is preferred.
·Due to poorer rock mass quality throughout the deposit, all geotechnical holes should be surveyed with a borehole televiewer system.
 
 ·The hydrogeological system needs to be investigated going forward in the next study.  Geotechnical mapping needs to be completed as
well.
Mining
Future  geologic  models  should  include  interpretations  of  the  main  rock  types,  alteration  zones,  depth  of  weathered  zones  and  major

The PEA focused on the potential development of the Ann Mason deposit.  It was determined that a conventional large-scale open pit is
possible at the deposit.  The deposit would be mined at a rate sufficient to feed a mill 100,000 tonnes per day (t/d).
 
The Ann Mason pit has been designed as a series of five pushbacks or phases and will be developed using conventional rotary drilling,
blasting and loading with electric cable shovels and 360 tonne trucks.  The open pit will have a mine life of 24-years, after three years of pre-
stripping  to  ensure  sufficient  material  is  available  for  the  mill.    A  total  of  562.3  Mt  of  Indicated  resource  grading  0.32%  Cu,  0.005%  Mo,
0.03 g/t Au and 0.56 g/t Ag makes up 67% of the mill feed over the mine life.  The remaining 33% of the mill feed is in the Inferred category
and amounts to 274.1 Mt grading 0.29% Cu, 0.003% Mo, 0.03 g/t Au, and 0.63 g/t Ag.
 
The life-of-mine (LOM) strip ratio is 2.16:1 and 1,808.7 Mt of waste rock will be moved over the course of the mine life.
 
Waste material will be placed to the southwest of the Ann Mason pit in a waste rock management facility (WRMF).  For this study, waste
materials have been assumed to be non-acid generating based upon a review of sulphur present in the deposit.  This assumption will need to
be confirmed in subsequent levels of study beyond this PEA.  Material in the pre-stripping phase will also be directed to two of the tailings
dams to reduce quarrying costs during construction.
 
 
Page 1-13
Operating costs for the open pit are expected to average $1.18 per tonne (/t) total material over the LOM or $3.82/t of mill feed.  At the peak of
material movement in Year 5, the major equipment fleet is expected to consist of five 229 mm drills, two 40.5 m3 front-end loaders, four 55.8
m3 electric cable shovels and thirty-two 360-tonne trucks.  Normal support equipment (track dozers, rubber tired dozers, graders) would also
be part of the fleet to maintain normal mining operations.
 
Pre-stripping operations will begin in Year -3 and by Year 1, 4.3 Mt of mill feed will have been stockpiled in preparation for the mill start
up.  This stockpile will be rehandled and sent to the mill in Year 1.  Year 1 will see the plant capacity at 27 Mt/a to allow for ramp up but
subsequent years will be at the nominal capacity of 100,000 t/d or 36 Mt/annum.
 
Mining will focus on material above 0.2% Cu content until Year 22.  The material between the milling cut-off (0.145% Cu) and the 0.2% Cu
cut-off will be stockpiled.  In Year 22, the stockpile material will be rehandled and directed to the primary crusher as mill feed.  Mining of
material in the pit will cease in Year 23 and processing operations will be complete in Year 24, once the stockpile has been depleted.
 
Reclamation of the WRMF will be concurrent with mining.  The final height of this facility will be at elevation 1665 for an overall maximum
Metallurgy and Process
height of 125 m.

Metallurgical  testwork  conducted  in  2011  at  Metcon  Research  has  indicated  that  the  Ann  Mason  mineralized  material  is  amenable  to
concentration by conventional grinding and froth flotation.  A grindability composite sample was found to have a moderate Bond Ball Work
Index (BBWI) of 15.7 kWh/t, while batch rougher flotation tests revealed an optimum primary grind size of ~100 to 120 µm.  Locked cycle
testing of two composites, representing the chalcopyrite, and chalcopyrite-bornite domains, resulted in copper recovery to final concentrate in
excess of 93%, at saleable concentrate grades, and with no penalty elements identified.  The potential for producing a separate molybdenum
concentrate has also been investigated and is included as part of the PEA; however, larger scale testing is required in order to generate more
accurate grade and recovery estimates due to the low sample head grade.
 
Follow-up testwork conducted in 2012 on samples from the chalcopyrite-pyrite mineralized domain of the Ann Mason deposit indicated that
acceptable concentrate grades could still be achieved despite the lower copper head grade and the higher ratio of sulphur to copper for the
composites from this zone.  This mineralized domain represents a very minor portion of the total mineralized material within the PEA mine
plan.
 
Based on the results of the testwork, a PEA level plant design was completed to process the Ann Mason sulphide material at a nominal rate
of 100,000 t/d.  The design combines industry standard unit process operations consisting of primary crushing, SAG milling, closed circuit ball
milling,  copper-molybdenum  bulk  rougher  flotation,  concentrate  regrinding,  copper-molydenum  cleaner  flotation,  copper-molybdenum
separation flotation, and product and tailings dewatering.
 
 
Page 1-14
Infrastructure and Site Layout
Recommendations for future work to improve the understanding of the metallurgy at Ann Mason include a detailed grindability study and
comminution circuit modelling for the sulphide material and the development of the copper-molybdenum separation flotation circuit.
 
Preliminary  column  leaching  tests  were  carried  out  on  oxide  and  mixed  oxide-sulphide  composites  from  the  Blue  Hill  deposit.    Results
indicated that good copper extractions, averaging 84.8%, were achievable after 91 days of acid leaching at a moderate crush size P80 of
¾".  Acid consumption for the column tests averaged 11.95 kg/kg Cu, or 18.04 kg/t.
 
Additional column leach testing of the Blue Hill oxide zone is recommended.

The mill is to be constructed to the northeast of the open pit and consists of a process plant and the supporting infrastructure for mining
operations.  A mining equipment garage, as well as mine dry, offices, and warehouse, are also included in the site complex.  Access to the
site will be via an upgraded access road to the northeast of the Project.
 
The anticipated power demand will be 105 MW during peak production.  Power will come from the existing NV Energy 120 kV transmission
line in service just east of the town of Yerrington.  A tap from this line will be constructed along with 10 km of new 120 kV line to service the
site.  The line will feed two main substation transformers.
 
The proposed tailings management facility (TMF) is illustrated in Figure 1-2.  This arrangement provided the lowest height for the tailings
dams and added security by keying the tailings dams into rock contacts for increased stability.  Further study on this layout is required in later
levels of study.
 
The principal objective of the TMF is to provide secure containment of all the tailings solids generated by the milling process.  The facility
must accommodate 653.4 Mm3 of tailings.
 
The tailings dam design for this study considers four separate structures.  Three of these will be constructed entirely of rock fill with the fourth
a combination of rockfill and cyclone tailings.  The South Dam will be the dam with the combination of materials.  The volume in the South
Dam is estimated at 94.6 Mm3 of which 21.8 Mm3 will be rock.  This dam is active the entire mine life.
 
 
Page 1-15
The tailings slurry will be pumped via a 5 km pipeline from the plant to the south tailings dam.  Tailings will be distributed to a series of
cyclones on the dam crest and used to construct the dam further.  Process water will be reclaimed from the TMF pond and returned to the
plant via a dedicated reclaim water pumpset and pipeline.
 
The design height of the South Dam is the 1,650 m level, which results in a maximum height of 125 m.  End of mine life freeboard has been
designed at 5 m.
 
The TMF pond plays a key role in the site water management by providing buffering of process water, direct precipitation, and runoff.
Surface diversion ditches along the western edge of the TMF have been included to capture and divert water away from the TMF without
contact and released back into the environment.  Seepage collection ponds and pumping systems are considered in the costing for each of
the dams.  This seepage will be returned to the process plant via the reclaim water system or returned to the TMF.
 
The effect of evaporation and a final water balance have not been completed for this study, but will be required in the next levels of study as
the Project advances.
 
The plant site drainage will be collected in a settling pond with disposal to the process water pond.  Wash bay drainage will be directed to an
adjacent settling pond and pumped to the TMF.  Mine water collection will be pumped to a small settling pond near the primary crusher.  The
water will be used for dust control on the road surfaces.  Excess water will be sent to the TMF.  Surface drainage will be diverted away from
the mine where possible to ensure contact with active mining areas does not occur.  If contact does occur, it will be directed to the mine-
settling pond.

Table 1-3 shows a summary of the capital costs for the Ann Mason Project.
 
Initial capital requirements (preproduction) are estimated to be $1,010.4 million.  Production starts in Year 1 and the tail end of the start-up
capital requirements will be partially offset by revenue in that year.  Capital requirements for Year 1 total $272.9 million.  Pre-production
mining costs were treated as an operating cost and therefore were not capitalized.  The indirect and contingency values vary by capital cost
item; the percentages applied are shown Table 1-4.

Operating Costs
1.7.2
 
Operating costs were developed for a 100,000 t/d mining and milling operation with a 24-year milling life.  The pre-strip requirements add an
additional three years prior to milling commencement.
 
All prices in the PEA study are quoted in Q3 2012 United State dollars unless otherwise noted.  Diesel fuel pricing is estimated at $1 per litre
using a $100/barrel reference price.  This estimate was derived from a price quotation for off-road diesel fuel delivered to site with applicable
taxes considered.  The price for electrical power was set at $0.064/kWh, based on current Nevada industrial pricing.
 
The Ann Mason pit will be developed using conventional open pit technology, with large-scale equipment.  This includes rotary drills with
large electric cable shovels loading 360 tonne haul trucks.  The open pit has a LOM strip ratio of 2.16:1, with three years of pre-stripping
required to prepare sufficient material for continuous plant operation.  A total of 562.3 Mt of Indicated material and 274.1 Mt of Inferred material
will be fed to the mill over the 24-year processing life.  A further 1,809 Mt of material will be placed in the waste rock management facility.
 
Mill feed material will be available from Year -1 and stockpiled adjacent to the proposed primary crusher.  A total of 4.5 Mt will be stockpiled
and then reclaimed in Year 1.  Processing will be at a 100,000 t/d rate, with a brief ramp up period in Year 1, which assumes 75% capacity
from the mill in Year 1.
Page 1-17
Stockpiling of lower grade material (<0.2% Cu) will start in Year 1 and continue at variable rates, depending upon higher-grade availability,
until Year 21.  This material will be reclaimed in Year 22 until the end of the mine life to ensure plant capacity is maintained at its design rate.
 
The process plant is designed to operate at a nominal rate of 100,000 t/d.  The plant will use conventional grinding and flotation with a
molybdenum separation circuit to make separate copper and molybdenum concentrates.  Tailings will be pumped horizontally 5 km to the
tailings management area, where a portion will be cycloned to be used in the construction of the south dam.
 
G&A costs are based on an average of 53 people; 16 staff and 37 hourly.  Additional charges, such as public relations, recruitment, logistics,
and busing, are also included in the G&A costs.  Mine employees will be located in the immediate area, and no camp will be provided or
required.
 
Concentrate  transportation  costs  are  estimated  using  values  from  logistics  firms.    Delivery  of  the  concentrate  will  be  by  bulk  trailers  and
hauled either to the port of Stockton, California, or by truck/rail to Coos Bay, Oregon, or Vancouver, Washington, for delivery to customers
overseas.    The  molybdenum  concentrate  will  be  stored  in  tote  bags  and  delivered  to  locations  in  the  United  States,  either  Arizona  or
Pennsylvania.
 
Port costs consider the handling of the bulk material, assaying, and cost of the referee on the concentrate grade.
 
Shipping to smelter cost is based on current seaborne rates for delivery to various smelters in the Pacific Rim for the copper concentrate.
 
A summary of all the operating cost categories on a cost per tonne mill feed basis over the total mill feed tonnage is shown in Table 1-
5.  Costs associated with those items directly attributable to the concentrate are reported in cost per tonne of concentrate.

Economic Analysis
1.8
 
This PEA is preliminary in nature and it includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the
economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as reserves.  There is no certainty that the PEA will be
realized.  Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.
 
The  analysis  is  based  on  a  LOM  plan  for  24  years  at  a  processing  rate  of  100,000  t/d.    The  decision  to  use  the  100,000  t/d  rate  was
determined  early  in  the  study  through  various  trade-off  studies.    This  provided  a  reasonable  NPV  while  maintaining  LOM  capital  below
$2 billion.
 
All prices are quoted in Q3 2012 U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
 
The tonnes and grades from the five-phase design for the open pit phases were used in the discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.  The
breakdown of Indicated and Inferred material utilized in the analysis is shown in Table 1-6 to highlight the percentage of material currently in
the Indicated category.  Two additional phases were designed, complete with access, but while still economic, did not benefit the NPV of the
overall project at current metal prices.  These demonstrate upside potential for the mine.
 
The DCF analysis was completed using different metal prices with low, base, high and spot price cases examined.  All of the prices in those
options were below the three-year trailing average prices for each of the metals as of September 17, 2012.  Table 1-7 highlights the case
metal prices.

The Base Case is the scenario chosen by AGP and Entrée, with the other scenarios showing price sensitivities.  The results for the Base
Case indicate the potential for a Pre-Tax NPV at 7.5% discount rate of $1,106 million with an IRR of 14.8%.  The payback period is 6.4 years,
with payback occurring in the seventh year of production (Table 1-8).  The Post-Tax NPV at 7.5% discount rate is $690 million with an IRR of
12.6%.  Payback post-tax is 7.1 years.
 
Potential revenue from the various metal streams with the Base Case pricing had copper as the dominant value from the deposit at $14.6
billion or 93.2% of the total revenue.  This is followed by molybdenum at $449 million for 2.9% of the revenue, then gold $432.8 million (2.8%)
and silver $172.2 million (1.1%).
 
The metal terms considered copper smelting to cost $65/dmt and refining to cost $0.065/lb for an average concentrate grade of 30%.  The
molybdenum roasting fees would be $1.15/lb with 99% payable.  Silver and gold would both be payable at 97% with refining charges of
$1.00/oz Ag and $10.00 /oz Au.

Page 1-3
The greatest sensitivity for developing the Ann Mason deposit is metal prices.  The base case prices that are used consider a price of copper
at $3.00/lb.  Three-year trailing average price for copper as of September 17, 2012 was $3.61/lb.  The base case copper price is 27% lower
than the three-year average.  A further 20% reduction of that price would see a copper price of $2.40/lb.  That is what the -20% sensitivity
value equates to.  However, given the higher copper price regime at present, the economics benefit greatly.
 
The second most sensitive parameter is recovery.  To calculate the sensitivity to recovery, a percentage factor was applied to each metal
recovery  in  the  same  proportion.    Therefore,  while  sensitivity  exists,  actual  practice  may  show  less  fluctuation  than  is  considered  in  this
analysis.  Recovery testwork has not indicated recoveries in the range of 75% which the -20% change in recovery would represent.  As
copper represents 93.2% of the revenue, this large a swing in recovery has the obvious effect of influencing the economics, but may not be
realistic.
 
The  operating  cost  is  the  next  most  sensitive  item.    With  the  mine  being  a  bulk  mining  operation,  focus  on  this  cost  is  instrumental  to
maintaining attractive project economics.  Any opportunity to shorten waste hauls would have a positive effect on the economics.
 
The least most sensitive item is capital cost.  While changes in the cost have an effect, in comparison to the other three parameters, its effect
is more muted.  If the capital costs go up by 20%, the post-tax net present value change from the base drops to $475 million from $690.
 
No royalties are applicable for the project at the time of the PEA preparation.
 
1.9
 
Entrée’s Plan of Operations (PoO) for the Ann Mason Project focused on exploration activities and in minimizing and mitigating the impact on
the environment.  With the PEA completed and better understanding of the size and scope of the Project, the data collection and testwork can
begin to prepare for the next stage of study and ultimately permit applications.
 
Basic data collection needs to commence as soon as possible covering a wide range of diverse subjects: weather, water flows, vegetation,
wildlife, and socioeconomic.  A comprehensive program will need to be established to collect the required information necessary to comply
with the respective agency permit application requirements.  This is of critical importance to ensure that the permits may be issued in a timely
manner.
 
 
Page 1-4
Environmental
A detailed Prefeasibility plan will be required to build upon the other information collected.  Data collection and testwork should coincide with
portions of the permit application process.  Detailed environmental and engineering information must be collected in at least the following
areas:
 
 ·Seasonal data of at least 12 months may be required for some of the elements above.  The programs should start as soon as possible.
 
 ·Reclamation of mine activities will be a significant part of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) PoO and the Nevada Bureau of Mining
Regulation and Reclamation (BMRR), and plans for closure must be approved by both agencies prior to initiation of mining activities.  Entrée
will work with both agencies to develop cost effective reclamation methods including reclamation concurrently with mine operations as
appropriate.  Reclamation costs will be developed along with detailed mine development plans, and an acceptable reclamation bond will be
posted with the BLM.
Summary
Proposed Budget
1.10
 
 
1.10.1
 
Based on the results of the PEA study completed for the Ann Mason deposit, AGP recommends that Entrée proceed to a PFS.  As part of the
PFS, a two-phase, results driven drill program is recommended to complete initial regional exploration on some of the key target areas and
then,  to  bring  the  Mineral  Resources  within  the  current  Phase  5  pit  to  a  minimum  Indicated  Mineral  Resource  category.    The
recommendations and associated budgets are described in the sections below.  The overall budget to complete the recommended work is
summarized as follows:
 
  · Phase 1 Drilling approximately $2.3 million
 
  · Phase 2 Drilling approximately $16 million
 
  · Phase 2 PFS Work approximately $8 to 10 million.
Blue Hill and the peripheral oxide targets remain as very strong priorities for Entrée that will see a portion of the Phase 1 drilling.  Although not
included in the current economic PEA, results of future work could determine whether the Blue Hill deposit should be included in future PFS
work.  A small phase of metallurgical work is recommended in Phase 2.
 
 
Page 1-5
Phase 1 and 2 Drilling
1.10.2
 
QG and AGP recommend a two-phase, results driven drilling program.  Phase 1 includes core drilling along the northern edge of the currently
defined Ann Mason deposit, RC drilling at both the Blue Hill deposit and its periphery, and initial drilling at the Blackjack IP anomaly and
Blackjack oxide target.
 
Completion of the Blue Hill deposit and Blackjack target oxide drilling, as well as the Blackjack IP anomaly drilling will establish if potentially
viable targets occur at depth in these areas that will require further drilling, and to further guide the placement of proposed infrastructure,
related to the Ann Mason Project.
 
Pending favourable results from Phase 1, Phase 2 includes a detailed in-fill drilling program within the current Ann Mason resource area,
concurrent with additional drilling to test for lateral extensions of the Ann Mason deposit.  The in-fill program is designed to collect data for
grade estimation at a confidence level high enough to support a PFS level.
 
Since  the  historical  drilling  completed  by  Anaconda  at  Blue  Hill  did  not  include  the  analysis  of  molybdenum,  silver,  and  gold,  AGP
recommends Entrée extend its core re-sampling program to test for these elements.  This will be important to validate the historical copper
values and update the database with these new copper grade as well as molybdenum, gold, and silver.  AGP believes that the additional data
will increase confidence in the model.
 
AGP also recommends collecting bulk density samples in the Tertiary volcanics to the east of the Blue Hill Fault, which is currently inside the
resource constraining pit shell and has only been sampled by RC drilling.
 
1.10.3
 
As part of Phase 2, AGP recommends that Entrée proceed to a PFS.  AGP estimates that a PFS for Ann Mason would be in the range of $8 to
$10 million to complete, although the scope of the PFS remains to be thoroughly reviewed and a detailed budget determined.  The PFS
would cover areas such as:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  · tailings management facility design and site geotechnical
 
  · environmental management studies and data collection
 
  · concentrate marketing and sales studies
 
 
 
 
Page 1-6
· capital and operating cost estimation
Phase 2 Prefeasibility Work
resource estimate update
· metallurgical testwork
·
·
·
geotechnical studies
condemnation drilling
·
financial evaluation
· project management and administration.
 
Aspects  of  the  study  can  take  place  concurrent  with  the  Phase  2  drilling  program.    Environmental  and  social  work  and  some  of  the
geotechnical and metallurgical work would also occur at this time.

The Project is situated within the Yerington Mining District, a historical copper mining district that covers the eastern side of the Project in
Lyon County.
 
4.2
 
The  Ann  Mason  Project  comprises  1,053  unpatented  lode  mining  claims  and  20  patented  lode  mining  claims,  covering  a  total  area  of
approximately 8,005 ha.  The claims are listed in Table 4-1, and shown as groupings on Figure 4-2.
 
Entrée has consolidated land surrounding the Ann Mason deposit through a combination of staking and a series of transactions undertaken
since July 2009, including the acquisition of PacMag, an Australian company, in June 2010.  Following a claim survey program in 2012, the
Company relocated some of the older claims and staked additional claims.  As a result, new claims were registered and some older claims
were abandoned.  This is still in process for a few claims, as noted in Table 4-1.
 
The Ann Mason Project claims can be itemized as follows:
 
 ·350 unpatented claims are owned and held by MIM, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entrée.  MIM was acquired by Entrée in connection with
the acquisition of PacMag.
·432 unpatented claims are held by Entrée U.S.  Of the 432 unpatented claims, 171 are beneficially owned by Larry and Susan McIntosh and
are subject to a mining lease and option to purchase agreement (the “MLOPA”) with Larry and Susan McIntosh.  The remainder are owned
by Entrée U.S.
·20 patented claims are owned and held by Entrée U.S., subject to a 2% net smelter returns (NSR) royalty granted to AngloGold Ashanti
(Nevada) Corp. (AngloGold) on 17 of the patented claims.
·55 unpatented claims are owned and held by Susan and/or Larry McIntosh (McIntosh) and are subject to the MLOPA.
 
 ·216 unpatented claims are owned and held by Bronco Creek Exploration Inc. (BCE), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eurasian Minerals Inc.
(Eurasian Minerals).  Entrée U.S. is earning an 80% interest in the claims through an option agreement with BCE (the “Option
Agreement”).  The area covered by the claims was previously referred to by the Company as the Roulette property.

·On or before November 1 of each year, Entrée must record an Affidavit that the BLM required fees have been paid and Notice of Intent to
Hold for the previous claim maintenance year in the county in which the claims are located.  The Affidavit and Notice of Intent to Hold must
be accompanied by a fee equal to $10.50 per claim plus a nominal fee for county document recording.
Underlying Agreements and Royalties
Mining Lease and Option to Purchase Agreement
A Notice of Intent to Hold Unpatented Mining Claims has been recorded with Douglas and Lyon Counties and with the BLM for the 2012
annual assessment year, which ended at noon on September 1, 2012.  The required annual mining claim maintenance fees in the amount of
$140.00 per claim have been paid to the BLM for the 2013 assessment year, which began on September 1, 2012.
 
The patented mining claims are situated in Township 14 North, Range 24 East, and Township 13 North, Range 24 East.  All property taxes
payable to Lyon County have been timely paid and are current.
 
4.3
 
4.3.1
 
A total of 226 of the Project’s unpatented mining claims are subject to an underlying MLOPA with Larry and Susan McIntosh, dated June 7,
2006 as amended on July 20, 2009, August 26, 2009, and July 27, 2011 (Claims WA 6-56, 66, 68-106, 108, 110, 229-248, 253-264, 267-280,
and 283-306; BJ 1; CCP 210 and 212-217, and Grand Tour 1-55: see Table 4-1).  Under the MLOPA, Entrée U.S. leases the mining claims
and is granted the option to purchase the claims for $500,000.  The term of the MLOPA is ten years, and can be extended for ten additional
one-year terms.  In the event that Entrée U.S. exercises its option to purchase the claims, Larry and Susan McIntosh will retain a 3% NSR
royalty, which may be bought down to a 1% NSR royalty for $2 million.  The MLOPA required advance royalty payments, which may be
credited  towards  future  royalty  payments  or  the  buy  down  of  the  royalty.    Entrée  U.S.  has  made  the  required  advance  royalty  payments
through to June 7, 2013.  On June 7, 2013, and on every anniversary thereafter until sustained commercial production begins, Entrée U.S. is
required to make an advance royalty payment of $27,500.  The MLOPA is currently in good standing.

Pursuant to a Corrective Special Warranty Deed With Reserved Net Smelter Returns Royalty dated effective August 2, 2012, Entrée U.S.
acquired 17 patented mining claims from AngloGold (Yellow Metal and Veta Granda claims: see Table 4-1).  The claims are subject to a 2%
NSR royalty granted in favour of AngloGold.
 
4.4
 
Surface rights to the areas covered by unpatented Iode mining claims are vested with the BLM, which regulates surface management.
 
Where surface disturbance due to exploration is 5 acres (2 ha)  or  less  per  year,  the  operator  must  file  a  notice  advising  the  BLM  of  the
anticipated work.  An approved Notice of Intent is required, including a determination of the required reclamation cost and acceptance of an
approved financial assurance instrument.  Where surface disturbance from mining activity covers more than 5 acres, it must be done under a
detailed plan of operation filed with the appropriate BLM field office.  Bonding is required to ensure proper reclamation.

Ann Mason Plan of Operations
Environmental Considerations and Exploration Permitting
4.5
 
4.5.1
 
In December 2007, a Plan of Operations/Application for a Nevada Reclamation Permit (Plan) (Record number NVN-084570/Reclamation
Permit No. 0291, respectively) was submitted by MIM to the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP), the Nevada Bureau of
Mining Regulation and Reclamation (BMRR), and the BLM.  The Plan was revised in March 2009, and covers the area surrounding the Ann
Mason and Blue Hill deposits, excluding the Sylvia 1 claim which was owned by a third party at the time of the Plan’s application.
 
In  conjunction  with  the  Plan  submittal,  MIM  retained  the  BLM  and  Enviroscientists  Inc.  of  Reno,  Nevada,  to  conduct  an  Environmental
Assessment (EA) in 2009.  The EA was completed in December 2009 (BLM, 2009).  The “Finding of No Significant Impact and Decision
Record”  approving  the  Plan  is  dated  January  19,  2010.    The  Plan  allows  for  exploration  activities  consisting  of  drill  sites  and  sump
construction, road construction, road maintenance, overland travel, exploration drilling, and bulk sampling for a total of up to 50 acres (20.2
ha) of surface disturbance over a ten year period.
 
A phased cash bond in the amount of $84,132.00, paid by MIM, was accepted by the Nevada State Office of the BLM on March 2, 2010, for
exploration surface disturbance totalling 19.2 acres (7.77 ha).  Following the acquisition of MIM by the Company in June 2010, a Change of
Operator form was filed with the BLM.  Effective August 3, 2010, Entrée U.S. was approved as operator and added as a co-principal on the
bond.
 
In  January  2011,  Entrée  U.S.  submitted  an  Amendment  (Amendment  #1)  to  the  approved  Plan  of  Operations  NVN-084570,  and  a  minor
modification to the Nevada Reclamation Permit No. 0291 to the BLM and BMRR.  In Amendment #1, an increase in the approved work area is
proposed, with no change to the approved surface disturbance of 50 acres or exploration techniques.  The BLM Sierra Front Field Office
accepted the application to amend as complete on June 15, 2011.  Amendment #1 was approved by the BLM Sierra Front Field Office on
June 28, 2011, and the financial guarantee amount was set at $147,568 for reclamation disturbances totalling 19.2 acres (7.72 ha) conducted
under the approved Plan.  To cover the financial guarantee, an additional bond in the amount of $63,436, posted by Entrée U.S. in the form of
a Certificate of Deposit, was accepted by the Nevada State Office of the BLM on July 5, 2011.  The total amended area covered is shown in
Figure 4-3.
 
4.5.2
 
Two areas within the Project have been permitted for exploration by Entrée U.S. through Notices of Intent.  These Notices are now beyond the
initial two-year exploration time period.  Entrée U.S. has notified the BLM that it wishes to extend both Notices of Intent.

Page 4-8
A Notice to Conduct Geophysical Work and Drilling was submitted by Entrée U.S. to the BLM’s Carson City District Office, Sierra Front Field
Office, on February 18, 2010 (Record Number NVN-088217), and was accepted on April 14, 2010.  The Notice covers an area west and
northwest of the Plan area (formerly the Blackjack property).  A cash bond in the amount of $51,050.00, paid by Entrée U.S., was accepted by
the Nevada State Office of the BLM on May 3, 2010.  The Notice had an initial period of two years and allows for a maximum disturbance of 5
acres (2.0 ha).  All surface disturbances related to drilling and access roads for drilling have been re-contoured and re-seeded.
 
The second permitted area was located on the unpatented lode mining claims covered by the Option Agreement.  BCE submitted to the BLM
a  Notice  to  Conduct  Exploration  Trenching  and  Drilling  on  April  1,  2010,  and  it  was  accepted  on  April  23,  2010  (Record  Number  N-
85205).    Based  on  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  between  the  two  Companies,  Entrée  U.S.  provided  to  BCE  the  reclamation  funds
specified by the BLM in the amount of $27,113.00.  The cash bond was accepted by the Nevada State Office of the BLM on May 10, 2010,
and Entrée was added as bond co-principal in order to extend the coverage of the bond to include liabilities for operations conducted by
Entrée under Notice N-085205.  Entrée amended the proposed drilling program for NV-085205 on July 7, 2010.  A revised bond amount of
$12,607.00  was  determined  on  July  8,  2010.    A  total  of  $14,506.00  is  available  for  future  amendments  to  N-085205.    The  Notice  also
remained in effect for two years, and allowed for a maximum disturbance of 5 acres (2.0 ha).
 
In addition, two Notice Level projects operated by MIM prior to Entrée’s acquisition of PacMag remain open.  Notices of Intent for work at
Ludwig  (NVN-84673)  and  Minnesota  (NVN-846689)  conducted  by  MIM  remain  open,  pending  clearance  of  the  reclamation  work  by  the
BLM.  MIM posted reclamation bonds in the amount of $11,017.00 for Ludwig and $12,100.00 for Minnesota.  Both bonds are administered
through the State of Nevada reclamation bond pool.   Entrée  has  completed  surface  reclamation  and  re-seeding  on  both  projects,  and  is
working to have the projects cleared by the BLM.
 
4.6
 
In the course of considering the Plan, the BLM prepared an EA that considered the potential impact of the Plan on the environment.  The BLM
determined that no significant impact to the human environment would occur due to the proposed exploration work.
 
Substantial  environmental  studies  were  conducted  in  the  preparation  of  the  EA.    These  studies  documented  that  historic  and  prehistoric
cultural resources, habitat of certain special interest species of plants and/or wildlife, and other concerns exist or could exist in the vicinity of
Ann Mason.  Through coordination with the regulatory agencies, conducting additional comprehensive environmental studies, prudent project
planning and design, and avoiding and/or mitigating potential project environmental impacts, the Company anticipates being able to obtain all
necessary permits for Ann Mason and to operate Ann Mason in an environmentally acceptable manner.  There are no known environmental
issues that could materially affect Ann Mason.

The approved Ann Mason Plan of Operations (NVN-084570) dated January 19, 2010, and amended June 28, 2011, allows up to 50 acres of
surface  disturbance  over  a  ten  year  period  in  the  area  shown  on  Figure  4-3.    Reporting  of  as-built  surface  disturbance  and  reclamation
documentation is required by the U.S. Department of Interior, BLM, and the NDEP Reclamation Branch annually by June 15th.  A total of
19.2 acres (7.77 ha) of surface disturbance (4.89 acres of Notice Level disturbance and 14.31 acres of new disturbance) is allowed during
Phase 1 of the Plan .  As of June 15, 2012, Entrée’s Phase 1 disturbance totalled 18.61 acres (7.53 ha).
 
Proposed drilling on Ann Mason and Blue Hill as part of the Phase 1 budget (Section 26) is permitted by the existing Plan.  New surface
disturbance for six Ann Mason drill holes and 8 Blue Hill holes is estimated to be 5.74 acres (2.32 ha).  A total of $50,000 is included in the
Phase 1 budget to cover a possible increase in reclamation bonding requirements once total surface disturbance exceeds the initial 19.2
acres.  The 9 proposed drill holes on new oxide copper targets and two proposed holes on the Blackjack IP target that are included in the
proposed Phase 1 budget will be covered by an amendment to the existing Blackjack Notice of Intent (NVN-088217).  The total surface
disturbance allowed under the existing Notice of Intent was 4.21 acres (1.70 ha) on seven drill sites.  All hole plugging, surface clean-up,
back-filling and recontouring of sumps, drill sites, and access roads, and re-seeding has been completed.  New surface disturbance for the 11
proposed drill holes is estimated to be 4.51 acres (1.83 ha).  Entrée will request that the current reclamation bond of $51,050.70 be transferred
to the new drill sites.
 
Proposed drilling on Ann Mason as part of the Phase 2 budget (Section 26) is also permitted by the existing Plan except on the Sylvia 1
claim, which will require an amendment to the Plan.  New surface disturbance for 108 drill holes is estimated to be 34.26 acres (13.86 ha).  A
total  of  $250,000  is  included  in  the  Phase  2  budget  to  cover  a  possible  increase  in  reclamation  bonding  requirements.    Concurrent
reclamation of drill sites will keep total surface disturbance within the approved 50 acre (20.23 ha) maximum.  To date, concurrent reclamation
by Entrée has been completed on 12.38 acres (5.01 ha) of surface disturbance on 59 drill sites and roads covered by the Plan.
 
Additional development and construction permitting requirements as the Project advances are provided in Section 20.

5.1
 
The Project is situated roughly 75 km direct distance southeast from Reno, the third largest city in Nevada and a tourist entertainment resort
Accessibility
city.  The Project is easily accessible from Reno via the main highway network.
 
There  are  regularly  scheduled  flights  to  Reno  from  many  major  centres  in  the  U.S.A.  and  some  international  destinations.    From  Reno
International Airport, the Project can be accessed by road following:
 
  · Highway 395 north for approximately 3.5 km to the off-ramp, to join
 
 ·Interstate Highway 80 east for approximately 50 km to the turnoff into Fernley, to join
 
  · West Main Street south and east for 2 km, to join
 
  · Highway 95 south for approximately 70 km to Yerington to join
 
 ·Burch Drive southwest, toward the town site of Weed Heights for approximately 3 km, to join
 
  · Austin Street south, becoming Belmont Street, for 500 m, to join
 
 ·Mead Avenue, which becomes Mickey Pass Road, for approximately 4 km west to turnoffs north and south, to join
 
 ·the access roads to the Ann Mason Project site; there are several unpaved roads that allow further access to the Project.
 
The  highways  and  roads  to  Yerington  and  Weed  Heights  are  paved.    The  road  past  Weed  Heights  to  the  Project  is  an  all-weather  dirt
road.  The drive from Reno to the Project is typically one and a half to two hours.  The drive from Yerington is roughly 20 minutes.
 
Two  alternate  routes  to  the  Project  from  Yerington  are:  1)  via  the  MacArthur  deposit  and  Mason  Pass  Road,  and  2)  from  the  north  via
Campbell Lane and Gallagher Pass (Figure 5-1).

West-central Nevada is characterized by a high altitude temperate climate, with warm to hot summers and cool winters.  The high altitude and
mountain ranges place the Project in an area of rain shadow where precipitation is minimal, and mainly comes down in the form of snow in
winter.
 
 
Page 5-2
Climate
Local Resources
Mean  temperatures  in  summer  vary  between  19°C  and  23°C;  mean  temperatures  in  winter  vary  between  0°C  and  4°C.    Maximum
temperatures average 33°C in the summer, and minimum temperatures average -7°C in the winter.
 
Average  yearly  precipitation  in  Yerington  is  135  mm,  with  the  mean  monthly  precipitation  varying  between  6  mm  (Sep.)  and  16  mm
(May).  Total snowfall per year averages 170 mm from October to May; (Western Regional Climate Center, http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/).
 
Work  can  be  conducted  throughout  the  year,  with  only  minor  stoppages  during  winter  months  due  to  heavy  snowfall  or  unsafe  travel
conditions when roads are particularly muddy.
 
5.3
 
The city of Yerington is the closest urban centre to the Project, with a population of approximately 3,300.  The town is the main seat for Lyon
County  and  has  been  primarily  a  regional  ranching  and  farming  centre  for  most  of  its  history.    Most  basic  consumables  are  available  in
Yerington.
 
The  State  of  Nevada  has  a  long  history  of  mining  and  a  well-developed  mining  industry.    Most  mining  supplies  and  equipment  can  be
sourced from Reno/Sparks, Carson City, or Elko, Nevada.
 
5.4
 
Northwest Nevada has a well-developed network of paved highways and secondary roads.  Highway 95 (Figure 5-1) in Yerington is the main
artery that connects the town to the interstate highway system.
 
The nearest access to the Union Pacific rail network is located in Wabuska, situated 19 km north of Yerington.
Infrastructure
There is an uncontrolled airport in Yerington, with a 1.8 km paved runway but no regularly scheduled flights.  The nearest major airport is
located in Reno, approximately 130 km by road to the northwest.
 
NV Energy services the majority of Nevada.  The service area covers approximately 50% of Nevada State and the majority of the populated
areas.  Yerington is connected to the state grid and there is a power substation in Weed Heights, located adjacent to the former Yerington
mine, 3 km east of the Project.  A 226-MW NV Energy plant (Fort Churchill) is located near Wabuska, approximately 18 km northeast of the
Project.
 
 
Page 5-3
All water within Nevada belongs to the public and is subject to appropriation for beneficial uses, such as mining.  The State Engineer is
responsible  for  administering  and  enforcing  Nevada  water  law,  which  includes  the  appropriation  of  surface  and  ground  water  in  the
State.  Water rights may be acquired in one or both of the following ways:
 
  · by making application to the State Engineer to acquire new water rights
 
 ·by leasing or purchasing existing water rights from a third party.  Water rights may be purchased as personal property or as an appurtenance
in a real-estate transaction.
Physiography
The nearest sources of surface water are the Walker River, located 7 km east of the Project, or the northern part of Smith Valley, located 8 km
southwest of Ann Mason.  There are no active streams or springs on the project area.  All gulches that traverse the area are dry.  To date,
water for drilling has been sourced from the city of Yerington.  Entrée U.S. has applied for, and received approval (Permit # 81518), for up to
50 acre-ft (15,271 m3)of water per year to be used for mining and milling including exploration drilling.  This is subject to successfully drilling
and completing one or two wells capable of producing that amount of water.
 
There is available land on the Ann Mason Project for potential TMF, WRMF, and process plant site.  Details are discussed in Section 18 .
 
5.5
 
The topography of the Ann Mason Project is characterized by mountain ranges surrounded by wide, open valleys.  The Singatse Mountain
Range extends from the north-eastern through the eastern parts of the Project, while the Buckskin Range borders its western edge.  The
southwestern part of the Project extends into the northern portion of Smith Valley.  The Ann Mason deposit lies along the western flank of the
Singatse Range (see Figure 5-1).  Elevations on the Project vary from 1,400 m in Smith Valley to 1,940 m at Singatse Peak.  The relief profile
of the Project is low rolling hills to moderately steep slopes at higher elevations.
 
Vegetation throughout the Project consists of interspersed sagebrush and low profile desert shrubs.  There are no trees on the Project.  A thin
layer of overburden dominantly covers the area, generally less than 2 m thick in areas of outcropping rock, and locally up to 40 m in some
valleys.  The thickness of overburden on the Roulette area ranges from 0 to more than 600 m.

History
Yerington Mining District
6
 
6.1
 
The eastern portion of the Ann Mason Project lies within the historic Yerington Mining District, an area of early discovery and production of
copper in Nevada.  In addition to copper, other known commodities in the Yerington District are gold, turquoise, iron, and nickel (Tingley,
1998).
 
Mining in the Yerington District dates back as far as 1865, when copper sulphate was first mined from several mines along the Singatse
Range (the Ludwig deposit, Mason Valley, and Bluestone Mines).  In the early 1900s, several companies started to consolidate properties in
the district and began exploration and development.  A smelter was built at Thompson, north of Wabuska, and the Nevada Copper Belt
Railroad was constructed from the smelter to service the copper mines.  The smelter operated intermittently between 1912 and 1928.  Several
small mines operated during this time: Bluestone, Douglas, Mason Valley, McConnell, and Casting Copper (Tingley 1990, Arimetco, 1991).
 
In 1941, the Anaconda Company (Anaconda) acquired the Empire Nevada property (now the Yerington property), a past-producing copper
oxide mine, and began exploration.  By 1950, after an extensive diamond-drilling program, Anaconda had outlined sufficient reserves to make
a  production  decision  at  the  Yerington  deposit.    From  1953  to  1965,  Anaconda  open  pit  mined  the  oxide  ore,  and  in  1965,  a  mill  and
concentrator were constructed to process sulphide ore (Tingley, 1990).
 
Several companies subsequently acquired the rights to the Yerington property, and some minor additional production resulted.  Over a 25
year period from 1953 to 1978, the Yerington mine processed approximately 162 Mst grading 0.55% Cu (Arimetco, 1991).
Ann Mason Project
The Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) purchased all of the assets of Anaconda in 1976 and subsequently shut off dewatering pumps in the
pit and closed the Yerington Mine in 1979.  The NDEP assumed operation of the site in early 2000.  The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency  (EPA)  has  taken  over  the  lead  management  role.    The  open  pit,  currently  held  by  Quaterra  Resources  Inc.  (Quaterra),  through
Singatse Peak Services LLC., is approximately 3 km to the east of the Ann Mason deposit.
 
6.2
 
6.2.1
 
Early exploration work on the Ann Mason Project was carried out by Anaconda from the 1950s through the 1970s, with regional mapping and
targeted programs, primarily on the Ann Mason deposit.  Subsequently, other companies carried out exploration programs within the Project
(see Table 6-1 for a list of companies and their involvement).  The following sections briefly describe the exploration activities carried out by
these companies, and include a historical drilling summary for the Ann Mason and Blue Hill deposits.  Locations of historical drill holes and
targets are illustrated in Figure 6-1.  It should be noted that Entrée does not have complete drilling data for a small number of the historical drill
holes.  All available data from historical drilling has been incorporated into Entrée’s database and used in the geological interpretation of the
Ann Mason and Blue Hill deposits.

Ann Mason Project – Historical Drilling
Anaconda, 1956–1981
6.2.2
 
Anaconda  explored  the  Ann  Mason  project  area  between  1956  and  1975,  with  the  bulk  of  the  work  focused  on  the  Ann  Mason  deposit
area.    During  1969  and  1970,  approximately  23,775  m  of  core  drilling  delineated  a  bulk  tonnage  low-grade  copper  deposit  (Arimetco,
1991).    Anaconda  conducted  an  airborne  magnetic  study  in  the  early  1970s  that  indicated  a  trend  of  magnetic  lows  westward  from  Ann
Mason, and an IP survey conducted in the 1970s that indicated a broad zone of anomalous chargeability, trending north-northwest along the
western margin of Ann Mason (Pyle, 2003).  A re-evaluation of the geology was conducted from 1973 to 1976, and an additional 10,370 m of
core drilling was completed in 27 drill holes.  Diamond drill core was re-logged for drill holes located along eleven drill sections between mine
grid coordinates 10,500 to 15,300E (UTM Coordinates 303,450E to 304,900E).  Structure, rock type, and sulphide mineralization were re-
examined, and the above referenced drill sections reinterpreted to determine factors controlling the distribution of mineralization in the deposit
(Souviron, 1976).
Arimetco, 1990
In 1977, Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) acquired Anaconda and its mineral rights.  Anaconda continued to evaluate the Ann Mason
deposit, and by 1981, a total of 42,524 m of drilling was completed.
 
On the Blue Hill area, Anaconda conducted mapping programs in 1956 (Langerfeldt, 1956) and 1970 (Gustavson, 1970).  In 1968 and 1970,
Anaconda drilled 13 holes at Blue Hill to evaluate the copper oxide potential.  Eleven of the 13 Anaconda holes have been used to estimate
the Blue Hill resource.
 
Exploration drilling was also carried out in other areas within the Project.
 
6.2.3
 
The  Ann  Mason  deposit  was  largely  ignored  until  1989,  when  Arizona  Metals  Company  (Arimetco)  acquired  the  mineral  rights  to  the
Yerington Mine and the Ann Mason deposit.
 
In 1990, Arimetco drilled a 170 m confirmation and assessment drill hole at the Ann Mason deposit (Arimetco, 1991).  However, there is no
information available on the location, core, or assays from this drill hole.  No further work was conducted by Arimetco.
 
6.2.4
 
Phelps Dodge Corporation carried out a four-hole drill program in the Blue Hill area of the Property circa 1995 to test potential oxide copper
mineralization.    Data  available  from  the  drilling  is  limited  to  drill  hole  locations  and  summary  results  for  intervals  of  oxide  copper
mineralization encountered in three of the drill holes.

Phelps Dodge Corporation, ~1995
Mount Isa Mines, 2002–2003
6.2.5
 
In June 2002, Australian-based Mount Isa Mines, through their subsidiary MIM, acquired Arimetco’s claims around the Ann Mason deposit
through  bankruptcy  court,  and  staked  an  additional  six  claims  (Pyle,  2003).    MIM  completed  a  work  program  that  included  geological
mapping,  an  IP  geophysical  survey  using  MIM’s  proprietary  3D  MIM  digital  acquisition  system  (MIMDAS),  and  reverse  circulation  (RC)
drilling.    MIMDAS  was  designed  to  acquire  networked  multi-channel  electrical  and  electromagnetic  (EM)  and  induced  polarity  (IP)
geophysical data.
 
Results from the MIMDAS IP survey indicated that the main zone of mineralization in the drilled resource area is located on the eastern flank
of a chargeability anomaly (Pyle, 2003).
 
MIM conducted an RC drilling program to test for shallow mineralization on the northwest portion of the chargeability anomaly.  A total of 925
m of drilling was completed in five holes.  Each of the holes encountered anomalous copper, zones of intense phyllic alteration, and scattered
zones of potassic alteration (Pyle, 2003).
 
6.2.6
 
Giralia Resources NL (Giralia), an Australian-based, publicly listed junior mining company, acquired MIM’s Ann Mason project in October
2003, following the acquisition of Australian-based Mount Isa Mines by Xstrata.  Giralia did not conduct any exploration activities on the
project.
 
6.2.7
 
In 2004–2005, Lincoln Gold Corporation (Lincoln Gold) had an option to earn 100% interest in a property located near the centre of the Ann
Mason Project area (Lincoln Flat property).  In 2005, Lincoln Gold explored the property for gold by completing a soil survey (188 samples
over two grids), followed by a drill program consisting of nine RC holes for a total of 1,568 m.  Scattered intercepts of gold in the order of 150
to  330  ppb  gold  were  encountered  in  the  drill  holes.    Not  meeting  Lincoln  Gold’s  expectations,  the  property  was  returned  to  the
owner.  (Lincoln Mining Corp. Website).
 
6.2.8
 
In  November  2005,  Pacific  Magnesium  Corporation  Ltd.  acquired  the  mineral  rights  to  Giralia’s  Ann  Mason  project  when  the  companies
entered into a merger agreement that included the outright purchase of Giralia’s Ann Mason project.  On June 29, 2006, Pacific Magnesium
Corporation Ltd. changed its name to PacMag Metals Limited (PacMag).  In 2006 and 2007, PacMag acquired additional mineral claims
contiguous to the Ann Mason deposit mineral claims and covering the Blue Hill deposit, as well as other groups of claims adjacent to the
Buckskin (gold), Minnesota (iron), Ludwig (copper), and Casting Copper (copper) historical mines.  PacMag carried out exploration programs
on the Ann Mason deposit, the Blue Hill deposit, and the Minnesota target.  These programs are summarized in the following sections.

Giralia Resources NL, 2003
PacMag, 2005–2010
Ann Mason Deposit
 
Between 2006 and 2008, PacMag drilled 12 holes for a total of 6,973 m on the Ann Mason deposit area.  Most drill holes were initially pre-
collared by RC drilling, followed by diamond drilling with HQ and NQ sized drill rods.
 
In November 2006, PacMag retained Golder Associates Inc. (Golder) to complete a resource estimate on the Ann Mason deposit (Golder,
2006).  The resource estimate was classified in compliance with the JORC Australasian Code for Reporting of Identified Mineral Resources
and  Ore  Reserves  (JORC  Code,  2004).    Golder  considered  the  Inferred  resource  classification  appropriate,  based  on  drill  hole  spacing,
sample intervals, and geological interpretation of the Anaconda historical data.  PacMag’s drill holes Ann06001 and Ann06002 were included
in the resource estimate.
 
In November 2007, a scoping study was completed by Metallurgical Project Consultants Pty Ltd (MPC, 2007).

In 2006, 2008, and 2010, PacMag completed three soil geochemical programs on the Blue Hill deposit.  The strongest anomalies these
programs detected are located immediately northwest of the Blue Hill Fault.
 
During 2007 and 2008, PacMag completed seven RC holes and two core holes on the Blue Hill deposit totalling 3,438 m.  The two core holes
were precollared by RC drilling.
 
Minnesota Target
 
In August 2007, sixteen claims were located by PacMag on the Minnesota prospect to cover a large positive aeromagnetic anomaly.  The
Minnesota iron mine is a copper-iron skarn-related deposit, which produced high-grade magnetite ore from open pit operations from 1952–
1966.  The mine is located adjacent to these claims on the northern flank of the magnetic anomaly.  Although the Minnesota prospect was
primarily developed as an iron mine, it was originally worked as an underground copper mine, with minor copper ore production during World
War I.
 
A ground magnetic survey was conducted on the Minnesota prospect by Magee Geophysical Services in July, 2007 (Magee, 2007).  The
survey  consisted  of  21  line-km  along  seven  3  km  profiles,  and  was  merged  with  a  previous  profile  surveyed  in  May  2007  (one  3  km
profile).  The survey confirmed the size, shape, and amplitude of the magnetic anomaly.  A 3D IP survey was subsequently conducted on the
prospect  by  SJ  Geophysics  Ltd.  (Lindner,  2007).    The  IP  survey  consisted  of  11  lines  totalling  17.05  km,  and  identified  two  discrete
chargeability anomalies with locally coincident conductive zones, both on the western flank of the magnetic anomaly.

In 2008, PacMag completed an initial three-hole RC drilling program, totalling 560 m.  The first two holes targeted the two IP chargeability
anomalies,  and  encountered  considerable  pyrite  (commonly  2%  to  5%,  locally  >10%),  but  no  significant  copper  or  iron-oxide
mineralization.  The third hole tested the apex of the magnetic high, but again drilled mineralization dominated by pyrite, with only narrow
intervals of 1% to 2% magnetite, and no significant copper.  The source of the magnetic high anomaly remains untested at depth.
 
6.2.9
 
Between 2006 and 2008, Telkwa Gold Corporation (Telkwa Gold) consolidated a group of mineral claims west of PacMag’s Ann Mason and
Blue  Hill  mineral  claims.    The  area  was  referred  to  as  Yerington  West,  and  comprised  the  former  Blackjack  (Iron  Cap)  property  and  the
Roulette  earn-in  property.    Telkwa  Gold  Corporation  changed  its  name  to  Honey  Badger  Exploration  Inc.  (Honey  Badger)  in  June  2008
(Honey Badger Website).
 
Telkwa  Gold  carried  out  a  soil  geochemical  and  prospecting  program  northwest  of  Blue  Hill.    Results  included  a  wide  distribution  of
anomalous copper samples, with numerous grab samples returning copper values between 5,000 to 50,000 ppm, and three grab samples
that  returned  216,  356,  and  840  ppb  Au.    A  significant,  multi-line,  gold-in-soil  anomaly  was  also  identified,  along  with  several  zones  of
anomalous copper from the same soil survey (Honey Badger Website).
 
A high-resolution magnetic and time-domain electromagnetic (TEM) airborne survey was conducted over the project in March and April of
2008 by Fugro Airborne Surveys (Fugro, 2008).  During March 2009, Geotech Ltd. carried out a helicopter-borne AitMt and magnetic survey
over two blocks covering Honey Badger’s project area, past producing mines, and known porphyry copper and copper oxide deposits in the
immediate area (Geotech, 2009).  Both surveys are described in exploration Section 9.5 Geophysics.
 
In 2009, a hand-held XRF soil survey and geologic mapping program was completed in the north area of the Project by BCE on behalf of
Honey  Badger.    In  total,  3,320  XRF  analyses  were  taken  from  962  field  stations,  and  geologic  maps  were  produced  for  portions  of  the
property, including the western flank of the northern Singatse Range and the eastern flank of the northern Buckskin Range.  The XRF data did
not reveal any significant new soil anomalies.  Mapping was carried out in the northern Singatse Range, the northern Buckskin Mountains,
and areas around Wishart Hill.  Mapping was focused in the areas covered by the soil survey, but a few traverses were conducted in adjacent
areas as well (BCE, 2009).

Entrée is earning an 80% interest in the Roulette property through an option agreement with BCE, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eurasian
Minerals.    The  Company  is  not  aware  of  any  exploration  program  carried  out  by  BCE  on  this  portion  of  the  Project  prior  to  Entrée’s
involvement in 2010.

Most of the historical drilling on the Project was carried out on the Ann Mason and Blue Hill deposits and is summarized in Table 6-2 and
 
Table 6-3.  Drilling by Anaconda in the late 1960s, and in the 1970s on other areas of the Project, is not well documented.  The Minnesota
target was drilled by PacMag.

Regional Geology
7 Geological Setting and Mineralization
 
7.1
 
The Yerington district is located in west-central Nevada, 80 km east of the Sierra Nevada batholith, and within a portion of the Basin and
Range  province,  which  consists  of  an  early-Mesozoic  volcanic-arc  terrane  (Speed,  1978).    The  area  is  believed  to  be  underlain  by
Precambrian  or  late-Paleozoic  oceanic  crust  and  Paleozoic  continental  margin-arc  volcanic  rocks  and  volcaniclastic  sedimentary  rocks
(Stewart, 1972 and 1980; Speed, 1979).  This package of rocks lies north and west of an inferred Precambrian craton, the edge of which is
marked by the 0.7060 initial strontium isopleth (Dilles, 1987).
 
7.2
Local Geology
The oldest rock formations mapped in the Yerington district include the 1,300 m-thick sequence of intermediate composition Triassic volcanic
rocks of McConnell Canyon and an overlying 1,800 m-thick sequence of carbonate, volcaniclastic, tuffaceous, and argillaceous sedimentary
rocks of Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic age (Dilles, 1987).  The Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic formations include the limestone of Mason
Valley, limestone of Ludwig, and the andesite of Artesia Lake, along with interbedded carbonate, argillite, volcanic sandstone, andesitic tuff
and  tuff-breccia,  gypsum,  and  anhydrite  and  quartzite  (Proffet  and  Dilles,  1984).    Dacitic  to  latitic  volcanic  rocks  of  Fulstone  Spring
unconformably overlie the andesite of Artesia Lake (Hudson and Oriel, 1979).
 
The Yerington batholith, informally named by Carten (1986), was originally emplaced as a 12 km by 15 km composite pluton, intruding the
McConnell Canyon volcanics and overlying Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic volcanic and sedimentary rocks (Dilles, 1987).  The batholith is
comprised of three successively younger intrusive phases, including granodiorite (Jgd) and gabbro (Jgb) of the McLeod Hill Suite, quartz
monzonite (Jqm) of the Bear Suite, and porphyritic quartz monzonite (Jpqm) and quartz monzonite porphyry (Jqmp) of the Luhr Hill Suite.  U-
Pb zircon dates range from 169 Ma for early granodiorite (Jgd) to 168 Ma for late quartz monzonite porphyry (Jqmp).
 
Along the southern margin of the Yerington district, quartz monzonite of the Shamrock batholith (165 Ma) intrudes Triassic volcanic rocks of
McConnell Canyon, Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic sedimentary and volcanic rocks, and the Yerington batholith.  Andesite dykes of Jurassic
age are common within the district, and cross-cut all phases of the Yerington batholith.
 
Up  to  120  m  of  well-rounded  pebble,  cobble,  and  boulder  conglomerates  (Tcg)  were  deposited  on  a  pre-Tertiary  erosional  surface
characterized by red, deeply weathered phases of the Yerington batholith and adjacent andesitic wall rocks.  Clasts within the conglomerate
consist of Mesozoic and Tertiary lithologies.
 
 
Page 7-1
Ann Mason Deposit Geology
Silicic, Oligocene ignimbrites and Miocene andesitic volcanic rocks, including the Mickey Pass, Singatse, Bluestone Mine, and Blue Sphinx
tuffs  and  the  hornblende  andesite  of  Lincoln  Flat,  unconformably  overlie  all  Mesozoic  rocks  (Proffett  and  Dilles,  1984,  and  Dilles,
1987).  Miocene andesitic units and all older rocks have been rotated 60° to 90° to the west by Miocene and younger Basin and Range
faulting and related extension (Dilles, 1987).  As a result, the district has been segmented into a series of gently east-dipping fault blocks
containing Tertiary volcanic rocks and pre-Tertiary rocks of the Shamrock and Yerington batholiths and adjacent andesitic and sedimentary
wall rocks.  These fault blocks are separated by the Singatse and the Blue Hill faults.  Figure 7-1 shows the simplified Project geology.
 
7.3
 
The Ann Mason deposit is largely concealed by Tertiary ignimbrites present in the hanging wall of the Singatse Fault and by Quaternary
alluvium and eolian deposits that occupy the valley leading to the west of Mickey Pass (Figure 7-2).  Surface indications of the deposit,
consisting of secondary biotite replacing mafic minerals in Qmp dykes and limonite after chalcopyrite, are exposed in an L-shaped trench
located at the southern margin of the deposit.  Limonites indicative of copper mineralization and minor copper oxide minerals are present on
fracture surfaces in Qmp-b dykes that outcrop south of the Singatse Fault.
 
In the immediate vicinity of the deposit, Tertiary (Oligocene and Miocene) volcanic rocks in the hanging wall of the Singatse Fault include
Hornblende andesite of Lincoln Flat (Tha and Thai) and the Bluestone Mine, Singatse and Mickey Pass Tuffs.  These rocks generally strike
10° and dip 60° to 90° NW.  Granodiorite (Jgd), cut by various quartz monzonite porphyry dykes, outcrops south and west of the Singatse
Fault.  Granodiorite of the McLeod Hill suite of rocks, and porphyritic quartz monzonite (Jpqm) and quartz monzonite porphyry dykes of the
Luhr Hill suite, comprise the major rock types present at Ann Mason.  Quartz monzonite, interpreted to be part of the Bear suite of rocks, has
been logged in a few drill holes located along the north margin of the deposit.  The detailed rock descriptions that follow are taken primarily
from Souviron (1976), with modifications based on observations from Entrée’s drilling at Ann Mason.

7.3.1
 
Granodiorite (Jgd)
 
Granodiorite is the main component of the Yerington batholith that outcrops south and west of the Singatse Fault.  In the immediate vicinity of
the Ann Mason deposit, granodiorite tends towards mafic quartz monzonite, and is characterized by more abundant graphic quartz than in
normal granodiorite, plagioclase greater than alkali feldspar (K-feldspar), and 15% to 20% shreddy mafics (mostly secondary biotite after
hornblende).  Texturally, the granodiorite is fine-grained and tends to be sub-porphyritic.  The granodiorite is intruded by all of the younger
phases of the batholith.
 
Mafic Porphyry
 
Mafic porphyry occurs mostly within deeper portions of the batholith, and is generally associated with granodiorite.  At Ann Mason, mafic
porphyry  also  occurs  with  porphyritic  quartz  monzonite  at  deeper  levels  of  the  batholith.    A  few  shallower  exposures  associated  with
granodiorite were also seen towards the western margin of the deposit.  Mafic porphyry is characteristically fine-grained, with 60% or more
grainy groundmass composed primarily of small biotite books and hornblende, sparse phenocrysts of biotite and plagioclase, up to 3% quartz
eyes, and occasional K-feldspar phenocrysts.
 
7.3.2
 
Quartz Monzonite (Jqm, Jbqm)
 
The quartz monzonite is medium-grained and equigranular to weakly porphyritic.  Plagioclase and orthoclase in roughly equal amounts are
the major constituents, constituting 60% to 70% of the rock.  Other components include 20% to 25% quartz and 5% to 10% mafics, with the
rest made up of accessory minerals such as sphene, apatite, and magnetite.
 
Border quartz monzonite is mineralogically similar, but finer grained, contains more quartz, and tends to be sub-porphyritic.
 
The majority of the quartz monzonite is located along the northern portion of the Ann Mason area, primarily east of 304,600 E.  West of this
section the quartz monzonite grades to finer-grained border quartz monzonite (Jbqm), which is last seen at 303,450 E.
 
Quartz monzonite (Jqm and Jbqm) also occurs at the Blue Hill deposit and Roulette target.
 
7.3.3
 
Porphyritic Quartz Monzonite (Jpqm)
 
Porphyritic quartz monzonite is most abundant in the eastern portion of the deposit, directly beneath the Singatse Fault, and at depth to the
west.  The texture of porphyritic quartz monzonite varies from an equigranular matrix of plagioclase, quartz, and K-feldspar, with sparse and
fairly  large  K-feldspar  phenocrysts,  to  a  weak  porphyritic  texture  with  an  incipient  groundmass  development  and  abundant  K-feldspar
phenocrysts.  The mafic content averages between 5% and 10%, with approximately 30% biotite books.  Quartz eyes are absent.
 
 
Page 7-5
Bear Suite
Luhr Hill Suite
Porphyritic quartz monzonite is cut by Qmp-a porphyry dykes and all subsequent quartz monzonite porphyries; no direct relation with Qmp-d
was seen.
 
Qmp-a and Qmp-ab
 
Qmp-a  and  -ab  are  porphyry  dykes  with  surface  exposures  indicating  east-west  to  north-westerly  trends  and  dips  to  the  south,  which  is
consistent with the information developed by drilling.  Qmp-a has 40% to 60% medium-grained aplitic groundmass with occasional patches of
graphic  material,  5%  fine-grained  and  shreddy  mafics,  5%  quartz  eyes,  no  large  K-feldspar  phenocrysts,  and  30%  to  40%  feldspar
phenocrysts, generally smaller than 5 mm.
 
In the subsurface, Qmp-a dykes occur and are primarily preserved along the intrusive contact between granodiorite and porphyritic quartz
monzonite.
 
Qmp-ab is similar, excepting that it contains large K-feldspar phenocrysts.
 
Qmp-b, Qmp-bq, Qmp-bm and Qmp-c
 
Qmp-b is the most abundant of the porphyries.  On surface, it strikes N 50° W to N 70° W and dips 35° to 55° to the north.  Qmp-b is
generally characterized by 50% very fine-grained groundmass containing small feldspar phenocrysts and hornblende, 5% to 10% coarse
mafics with many biotite books, less than 5% quartz eyes, and 5% to 10% large K-feldspar phenocrysts.  The “root zone” Qmp-b differs from
the above in that it has a coarser, grainy groundmass, which occasionally tends towards an aplitic texture.  It can be distinguished from Qmp-
ab by its characteristic biotite books.
Qmp-bq differs from Qmp-b in that it contains 10% or more quartz eyes.  In the root zone Qmp-bq develops a grainy groundmass, and the
quartz eyes tend to be more irregular and to have less euhedral outlines.  On surface, Qmp-bq develops mostly in the western portion of the
Ann Mason area, strikes northwesterly, and dips to the north.
 
Qmp-bm appears irregularly on surface, but generally tends to subparallel Qmp-b, and is characterized by abundant, small, and needle-like
laths  of  hornblende  in  the  groundmass.    This  groundmass  is  very  fine-grained,  and  makes  up  50%  of  the  rock.    Coarse  mafics  (mainly
hornblende laths) total 10%, quartz eyes 10% to 15%, and large K-feldspar phenocrysts up to 5%.
 
Qmp-c chilled porphyries are generally found along the borders of quartz monzonite porphyries, within the porphyries themselves, and where
quartz monzonite porphyry dykes cut granodiorite, porphyritic quartz monzonite, or quartz monzonite.  Qmp-c porphyries are interpreted as
chilled margins of Qmp-b, Qmp-bq, and Qmp-bm dykes.
 
 
Page 7-6
Qmp-b, -bq, -bm, and -c dykes cut granodiorite, porphyritic quartz monzonite, and Qmp-a and Qmp-ab porphyry dykes.
 
The differences between the various quartz monzonite porphyries are quite clear in the shallower exposures where they occur in dyke form,
cross-cutting granodiorite, quartz monzonite and porphyritic quartz monzonite, and each other.  Down-section, these dykes converge into a
root zone, where they merge together and with porphyritic quartz monzonite, forming a large mass in which their individual characteristics
become much less distinct.
 
Qmp-d
 
Qmp-d  is  oriented  N  70°  W,  and  dips  30°  to  60°  north.    Qmp-d  normally  has  a  lower  groundmass  content  (less  than  50%)  than  other
porphyries, and this groundmass tends to be aphanitic and choked with small feldspar phenocrysts.  Mafics, mostly hornblende, make up 10%
or more of the rock, quartz eyes generally less than 5% to occasionally 10%, large K-feldspar phenocrysts 5% to 10%, and abundant sphene
(usually altered to quartz-rutile) is a common accessory mineral.  The difference between Qmp-b and Qmp-d is not always clear cut, and in
certain cases an intermediate rock-type labelled Qmp-bd has been mapped.  Qmp-d, as logged by Anaconda, is much more prevalent than
occurrences  identified  in  recent  drill  holes  completed  by  Entrée.    Rare  examples  observed  in  the  current  drilling  commonly  contain
disseminated pyrite, almost no sulphide mineralization in the form of veins, and low copper values.
 
Porphyritic Aplite – (Jpa)
 
Porphyritic aplite is found only sparsely, and is closely associated with Qmp-a and -ab.  It is an aplitic rock, with minor phenocrysts of quartz
and feldspar and occasional mafics.  Age relations show the aplite cutting granodiorite, porphyritic quartz monzonite, and Qmp-b porphyry
dykes, but it is most common cutting porphyritic quartz monzonite.
 
Qmp – (Jqmp)
 
Some quartz monzonite porphyries did not fit any of the classifications described above.  They have been labelled Qmp.
 
7.3.4
 
Igneous Breccia – (ibx)
 
Igneous Breccia was only found in four diamond drill holes: D-176, D-118, D-234, and EG-AM-11-020.  It is composed mainly of granodiorite,
with fragments of aplite, mafic porphyry, and Qmp (probably types -a and -b).  Truncated quartz veinlets are also commonly found.  In drill hole
EG-AM-11-020,  the  breccia  occurs  as  intrusive  breccia  at  the  contact  between  granodiorite  or  porphyritic  quartz  monzonite  and  Qmp-b
porphyry dykes.  Occurrences in holes D-234 and EG-AM-11-020 are strongly mineralized with chalcopyrite.
 
 
Page 7-7
Other Intrusive Rock Types
Diorite – (Jd)
 
A coarse-grained diorite was intersected by four drill holes (D-176, D-222, D-234, and EG-AM-11-008) on Section 304,400 E.  This rock type
is weakly pyritized and postdates the main phase of copper mineralization.  The rock contains 20% to 30% hornblende, and less than 5%
quartz.
 
Andesite Dykes – (Ja)
 
Andesite dykes, commonly less than 1 m thick, cut quartz monzonite porphyries and earlier equigranular intrusives.  On surface, these dykes
have  various  orientations,  ranging  from  east-west  to  northwesterly.    The  subsurface  intersections  indicate  a  probable  steep  northerly  dip
(cross-section 304,800 E).  The andesite is fine-grained and fresh to chloritized, with weak pyrite mineralization.
Tertiary Volcanic Rocks
7.3.5
 
Tertiary volcanic rocks postdate copper/molybdenum mineralization in the Yerington district, and were deposited unconformably on the pre-
Tertiary erosion surface developed on the Yerington batholith and adjacent wall rocks.  In their present configuration, the volcanic rocks are in
depositional contact with older rocks within individual fault blocks or in fault contact along various low-angle faults, including the Singatse,
Blue Hill, and Fulstone Spring faults.
 
Proffett and Proffett (1976) and Proffett and Dilles (1984) described and mapped the stratigraphy of Tertiary volcanic rocks of the Yerington
district in detail.  For the purpose of this report, post-mineral volcanic rocks are not described in detail.
 
7.3.6
 
The current extent of the Ann Mason deposit is contained entirely within the Ann Mason fault block, which is bounded above by the Singatse
Fault and below by the underlying Blue Hill Fault.  Copper mineralization at Ann Mason is truncated by the Singatse Fault to the east of UTM
304,400E  and  between  UTM  4,317,300N  and  UTM  4,318,000N.    Surface  exposures  of  Tertiary  conglomerate  (Tcg),  in  contact  with
granodiorite (Jgd) rocks in the hanging wall of the Singatse Fault are offset approximately 4 km to the east relative to the footwall.  Based on
Entrée’s drilling at Ann Mason and Blue Hill, the Blue Hill Fault is projected to be 50 m to 100 m below the current depth of drilling at Ann
Mason on the northwest margin of the deposit (Hole EG-AM-11-015), and 200 m to 600 m below the current depth of drilling in the central and
eastern portions of the deposit (Holes EG-AM-11-007 and -009).
 
 
Page 7-8
Structure
Alteration
Ten high-angle faults have been identified at Ann Mason by integrating historical structural data with Entrée’s logging of faults interpreted to
have significant amounts of displacement.  These high-angle faults have strike directions ranging from AZ 295° to 325°, and dip 60° to 70°
southwest.  The criteria used to identify significant amounts of displacement include thickness of clay gouge, changes in rock type across
structures, and the presence of fault breccia or slickensides.  The high-angle structures were mapped in cross-section using north-south and
east-west sections on 100 m spacing, and transferred to 50 m-spaced level plans for final compilation and interpretation.
 
One well-defined high-angle fault (Fault 1A) marks the current southwest margin of >0.15% Cu mineralization in the deposit, juxtaposing
predominantly  chlorite-altered  rocks  with  pyrite  mineralization  in  the  hanging  wall  against  predominantly  potassically-altered  rocks  with
copper-molybdenum mineralization in the footwall.  Copper-molybdenum mineralization in the footwall of the fault remains open at depth
along the entire length of the fault.
 
These northwest-trending structures offset the intrusive contact between granodiorite and porphyritic quartz monzonite to successively deeper
levels towards the southwest.  Overall, the contact plunges 15° to as much as 50° to the southwest, from where it is truncated by the Singatse
Fault in the northeast quadrant of the deposit.
 
7.3.7
 
Hydrothermal alteration associated with porphyry copper and molybdenum mineralization is similar to alteration described in many porphyry
copper deposits.  Voluminous sodic-calcic alteration zones on the flanks of the Yerington district deposits may have been leached of copper
and iron, possibly providing those components to mineralizing fluids (Dilles and Proffett, 1995).
 
Alteration  assemblages  include  an  outer  propylitic  zone,  widespread  potassic  alteration  associated  with  main-stage  copper-molybdenum
mineralization, and more restricted late-stage zones of calcic-sodic alteration, sodic or albite alteration, and sericitic alteration.  Assemblages
of chlorite and epidote, locally with oligoclase, form the outer propylitic zone, in conjunction with pyrite as the primary sulphide.  Along the
southwest  margin  of  the  deposit,  propylitic  alteration  is  in  fault  contact  with  mineralized  zones  of  potassic  alteration.    Secondary  biotite,
replacing mafic minerals, constitutes the bulk of the main-stage potassic alteration.  K-feldspar replacement of plagioclase phenocrysts and
rock groundmass occurs within the main body of the deposit, but is much less prevalent.  Secondary K-feldspar also occurs as veins and
patchy replacement of rock groundmass within propylitic alteration.  Sodic-calcic alteration, consisting of assemblages dominated by chlorite
and including oligoclase and minor epidote, forms a weak to strong overprint on the potassic alteration.  Sodic (albite) alteration affects all
rock  types  at  Ann  Mason,  ranging  from  incipient  replacement  (evidenced  by  white  rims  surrounding  feldspar  phenocrysts)  to  pervasive
replacement that partially or completely obliterates rock texture.  At logged concentrations of <10% by volume, albite alteration has little or no
effect on copper mineralization.  Moderate, pervasive albitization (10% to 15%) where rock texture is still discernible may reduce bornite
content while leaving chalcopyrite partly or completely intact.  Above 15% albite, most copper mineralization is removed, and rock texture is
largely destroyed.  Resulting copper grades are <0.2%, and locally <0.05%.  Epidote is generally absent in zones of strong albite alteration, a
characteristic  that  helps  distinguish  albite  alteration  from  zones  of  sodic-calcic  alteration.    Molybdenum  mineralization  is  not  significantly
impacted by albitization beyond partial remobilization of molybdenite from veins into nearby fractures and shear zones.  Later overprints of
chlorite  and  fine-grained  sericite,  replacing  secondary  and  primary  biotite  and  partially  replacing  plagioclase  phenocrysts,  do  not  have  a
pronounced effect on copper mineralization.  However, the development of quartz-sericite alteration closely associated with relatively narrow
structural zones destroys mineralization and previous mineral assemblages.
 
 
Page 7-9
Zeolite is rarely present as fracture fillings and, in one example, forms a matrix interstitial to plagioclase phenocrysts.
 
Gypsum occurs in two relatively flat-lying zones in the footwall of the Singatse Fault.  An upper, 200 m-thick zone is present at depths of 100
m to 200 m below surface.  The lower 100 m-thick zone occurs at depths ranging from 400 m to 500 m below surface.  Isolated gypsum
occurrences, observed at depths up to 1,200 m below surface, are believed to be controlled by high-angle fractures or fault zones.  Gypsum
cements the rock as fracture fillings, veins, and pervasive alteration, producing long pieces of intact core.  Gypsum is largely absent within the
central portion of the deposit, an area where Tertiary volcanic rocks have been eroded at surface.  Because it cements highly fractured rock
and, locally, fault zones, gypsum alteration is considered to postdate Miocene faulting, extension, and structural rotation.
 
Fluorite has been observed rarely, occurring as light green, blue, or purple fracture-fillings, and mm to cm-sized veins at a rate of a few veins
per drill hole in 9 of the 30 holes Entrée has completed.

Copper-molybdenum  mineralization,  accompanied  by  potentially  economic  concentrations  of  silver  and  gold,  represents  the  primary
economic mineral assemblage at Ann Mason.  At the time of discovery and while Ann Mason was being explored by Anaconda (1967 to
1981),  copper  was  the  primary  commodity  of  interest.    In  2002,  MIM  analyzed  historical  drill  core  from  Anaconda’s  drilling  and  found
potentially  economic  concentrations  of  molybdenum.    Gold  and  silver  were  also  found  during  this  re-assaying  program,  but  were  never
considered for inclusion in resource models due to the limited number of gold and silver assays contained in the historical database.

Ann Mason Deposit
Mineralized Zones
Copper occurs primarily as copper sulphides, including chalcopyrite, bornite, minor chalcocite, and rare examples of covellite.  Oxide copper
mineralization, consisting of malachite, black copper-manganese oxides, and copper-bearing limonite, is present in a 22 m interval of hole
EG-AM-11-016.    Molybdenum  occurs  as  molybdenite  in  quartz  veins,  fractures,  shear  zones,  and  disseminated  in  rock.    Distribution  of
molybdenite is both coincident with and, in portions of the deposit, independent of copper.
 
Structure
 
Copper-molybdenum  mineralization  is  truncated  by  the  Singatse  Fault  east  of  UTM  304,400E  and  between  UTM  4,317,300N  and
4,318,000N.  Approximately 4 km of normal (eastward) displacement on the Singatse Fault has been documented in geological mapping by
Proffett and Dilles (1984).
 
Miocene normal faulting and extension have rotated deposits in the Yerington district, including Ann Mason, 60° to 90° to the west.  As a
result, north-south cross-sections are approximately equivalent to level plans in the pre-tilt geometry of the deposit.  East-west cross-sections
remain roughly equivalent to vertical sections through the deposit, except that they are rotated approximately 90° west.
 
Late, high-angle faults, with or without late-stage sodic (albite) or sericitic alteration, are known to reduce copper grade within the deposit.
 
Lithology
 
Copper  mineralization  at  Ann  Mason  in  concentrated  within  a  >0.15%  copper  grade  envelope  with  fairly  sharp  boundaries  between
mineralized and unmineralized rock.  When projected to surface, the envelope covers an area of approximately _2.3_km northwest by 1.3_km
northeast and extends more than _1.2 km _vertically.  The envelope plunges steeply to the west-southwest and extends from 200 m to as
much as 800 m above or below the intrusive contact between granodiorite (Jgd) and younger porphyritic quartz monzonite (Jpqm).  Within this
envelope, copper grade is dependent on vein density, sulphide species, frequency and relative age of quartz monzonite porphyry dykes, and
the availability of mafic mineral sites within granodiorite favourable for deposition of disseminated mineralization.  The top of the envelope is
truncated by the Singatse Fault and the much of the southwest edge is truncated by the northwest-trending 1A Fault.  Although the sense of
movement and amount of displacement on the 1A Fault is unknown, it is possible that copper mineralization continues southwest of the fault,
either at depth or along strike.
 
Copper mineralization  occurs in all intrusive units of the Yerington batholiths except Qmp-d, but is most closely associated with Qmp-a and
Qmp-b quartz monzonite porphyry dykes.  Anaconda geologists interpreted Qmp-a dykes at Ann Mason as the earliest and best mineralized
of the Luhr Hill suite of rocks.  Spatially, Qmp-a dykes primarily occur along the intrusive contact between granodiorite (Jgd) and porphyritic
quartz  monzonite  (Jpqm).    Contrary  to  previous  geological  models,  copper  mineralization  does  not  appear  to  be  distributed  conformably
around Qmp-b porphyry dykes, which generally strike AZ 290° and dip 45° NE.
 
 
Page 7-11
Identification  of  the  granodiorite/porphyritic  quartz  monzonite  intrusive  contact  as  a  deposit-scale  control  on  the  distribution  of  copper
mineralization is the result of deeper infill and step-out drilling conducted by the Company between 2010 and 2012.  The observed empirical
relationship between copper distribution and the intrusive contact is supported by mapping of the top of the chalcopyrite-bornite sulphide
assemblage in close proximity to the intrusive contact.
 
Sulphide Zoning
 
Ann  Mason  sulphide  domains  include  an  outer  pyrite-dominated  shell  and  varying  ratios  of  pyrite>chalcopyrite,  chalcopyrite≥pyrite,
chalcopyrite, and chalcopyrite-bornite (Figure 7-3).  Table 7-1 shows the ratios used by Anaconda geologists to define sulphide domains.

The copper sulphide zoning is that of a typical porphyry copper with an outer pyritic shell, and concentric zones of increasing chalcopyrite and

Ann Mason Cross-Section 4,317,700 N Showing Sulphide Domains
Figure 7-3:
 
 
 
Page 7-13
Within the northeast, southeast, and southwest quadrants of the deposit, little or no overlap occurs between pyrite and bornite or between
pyrite and molybdenite.  Chalcopyrite and chalcopyrite-bornite are the primary sulphide domains in these portions of the deposit.
 
The primary sulphide domain in the northwest quadrant of the deposit (west of UTM 304,300E and north of UTM 4,317,700N) is chalcopyrite
≥ pyrite, a domain that forms thick intervals of >0.3% Cu, with only minor bornite present at depth, near the granodiorite-porphyritic quartz
monzonite contact.  Copper mineralization >0.15% Cu in this portion of the deposit coincides with a pyrite:chalcopyrite ratio below 7:1.
 
In thin section, chalcopyrite occurs as individual grains in veins and disseminated in rock, as fillings in brecciated pyrite grains, attached to or
included in pyrite grains, and attached to or included in bornite; bornite occurs as separate grains in veins, and disseminated in rock and
attached to chalcopyrite.  Chalcocite occurs as replacement rims on chalcopyrite, but more commonly as replacement rims or exsolution
replacement of bornite.
 
Molybdenum occurs as molybdenite in quartz veins and on fracture or shear surfaces as molybdenite paint.  Quartz-chalcopyrite-molybdenite
and quartz-molybdenite vein types have been observed.  Within quartz veins, molybdenite occurs as disseminations, centerline segregations
and discontinuous selvages.  Molybdenum within the 0.005% Mo grade shell occurs largely within the 0.015% Cu grade shell.  Where late
albite alteration has reduced copper grade, molybdenum mineralization extends to greater depth than copper.
 
Alteration
 
Copper  mineralization  is  associated  with  two  main  alteration  assemblages:  chalcopyrite-pyrite,  chalcopyrite,  or  chalcopyrite-bornite
associated  with  main-stage  potassic  alteration,  including  secondary  biotite  and  K-feldspar;  and  chalcopyrite  associated  with  epidote  or
epidote+quartz, primarily in areas where copper mineralization has been affected by late albite alteration.
 
Veining
 
Veining at Ann Mason carries a closer relation to copper and mineralization than previously recognized.  Sulphide veins are logged as to
mineral  assemblage,  form,  thickness,  and  type  and  width  of  selvage.    Up  to  five  mineral  types  are  used  to  characterize  vein  mineral
assemblages.  In general, veining observed at Ann Mason represents typical porphyry style veins as described by Dilles and Einaudi (1992)
for Ann Mason, which includes types A, AB, B, C, and D.
 
Higher  copper  grades  at  Ann  Mason  are  commonly  associated  with  dark,  cross-cutting,  and  sometimes  irregular  or  discontinuous  veins
containing  quartz,  secondary  biotite  and  K-feldspar,  chalcopyrite,  and/or  bornite.    Dark  selvages,  ranging  in  width  from  millimetres  to
centimetres, typically contain the same mineral assemblages.
 
 
Page 7-14
Blue Hill Deposit
Molybdenum occurs primarily as molybdenite in quartz veins, and on fracture or shear surfaces as molybdenum paint.  Quartz-chalcopyrite-
molybdenite and quartz-molybdenite veins are both present.  In quartz veins, molybdenum occurs as disseminations, centreline segregations,
and borders or selvages.
 
 
7.4.2
 
The Blue Hill deposit consists of copper oxide mineralization and, to the southeast, an underlying adjacent zone of copper-molybdenum
sulphide mineralization that appears to extend beneath the southeast dipping Blue Hill Fault.
 
Significant copper oxides (encountered in RC drill holes EG-BH-10-001 through -005, EG-BH-10-008 through -011, EG-BH-11-023, -024, and
-026 through -030, and diamond holes EG-BH-11-015 to -018) extends from surface to an average depth of 124 m and over an area of 900 m
x 450 m, and continues over several hundred metres to the west in narrow intervals
 
(Figure 10-4).  The copper minerals (black oxides, malachite, blue/green sulphates, and chrysocolla) occur with abundant iron oxides.  Mixed
oxide/sulphide mineralization with minor chalcocite is present below the oxide mineralization to maximum depths of 185 m.  The copper oxide
zone remains open to the northwest and southeast.
 
Copper sulphide mineralization at the bottom of holes drilled to date, and in core holes EG-BH-11-019 and -021, indicates the presence of
underlying  porphyry-style  sulphide  mineralization  similar  to  that  found  in  PacMag  drill  holes  BH08001  and  BH08003.    Significant
molybdenum mineralization was also intersected in drill holes EG-BH-10-005 and -009, and EG-BH-11-019.
 
RC intervals averaging >0.1% total copper (TCu) were analyzed for acid-soluble copper (SolCu).  The overall average ratio of SolCu to TCu
for all intervals is 68%.
 
Similar to the setting at Ann Mason, post-mineral volcanic rocks of Tertiary age are present in the hanging wall of the low-angle, southeast-
dipping Blue Hill fault.
 
Quartz monzonite (Jqm) and quartz monzonite porphyry dykes (qmp-b) in the footwall of the Blue Hill fault comprise the main lithologies of the
Yerington batholith at Blue Hill.  Lesser amounts of quartz monzonite porphyry (Jpqm) have been mapped in outcrop (Proffett and Dilles,
1984) and occur in the subsurface.  Although similar to the quartz monzonite porphyry present at Ann Mason, there is insufficient data to
determine if the Blue Hill portion is part of the same Jpqm body or a separate intrusive.  Higher copper-molybdenum grades in sulphide zones
generally  coincide  with  quartz  monzonite  porphyry  dykes.    Faulting,  possibly  structures  that  parallel  the  Blue  Hill  fault,  also  control  the
distribution of mineralization.  Sulphide mineralization occurs as pyrite, chalcopyrite, and molybdenite.  Closely spaced, sheeted veins with
chalcopyrite are common in zones of higher copper grades.
 
 
Page 7-15
Alteration associated with sulphide mineralization includes broad areas of propylitic (chlorite and epidote) and potassic (secondary biotite > k-
feldspar) assemblages, cut by zones of late albite and locally overprinted by sodic-calcic alteration (chlorite-albite±epidote).

Porphyry Copper Deposits

8.1
 
The following description of copper porphyries is taken from Panteleyev (1995).
 
Porphyry copper deposits commonly form in orogenic belts at convergent plate boundaries, linked to subduction-related magmatism.  They
can also form in association with the emplacement of high-level stocks during extensional tectonism, which is related to strike-slip faulting
and back-arc spreading following continent margin accretion.  Host rocks are typically intrusions, which range from coarse-grained phaneritic
to  porphyritic  stocks,  batholiths  and  dyke  swarms.    Intrusive  rock  compositions  range  from  calcalkaline  quartz  diorite  to  granodiorite  and
quartz  monzonite.    There  are  multiple  intrusive  phases  that  are  successively  emplaced,  and  a  large  variety  of  breccias  are  typically
developed.
 
Stockworks of quartz veinlets, quartz veins, closely-spaced fractures and breccias containing pyrite and chalcopyrite with lesser molybdenite,
bornite and magnetite occur in large zones of economically bulk-mineable mineralization in, or adjoining, porphyritic intrusions and related
breccia bodies.  The mineralization is spatially, temporally, and genetically associated with hydrothermal alteration of the hostrock intrusions
and wallrocks.  Zones where fracturing is most intensely developed can give rise to economic-grade vein stockworks, notably where there are
coincident  or  intersecting  multiple  mineralized  fracture  sets.    Disseminated  sulphide  minerals  are  present,  generally  in  subordinate
amounts.    Typical  minerals  include  pyrite,  chalcopyrite,  molybdenite,  lesser  bornite  and  rare  (primary)  chalcocite,  with  lesser
tetrahedrite/tennantite, enargite and minor gold, electrum and arsenopyrite.  Late-stage veins can contain galena and sphalerite in a gangue
of quartz, calcite and barite.
 
Alteration commonly takes the form of different assemblages that are gradational and can overprint earlier phases.  Potassic-altered zones (K-
feldspar and biotite) commonly coincide with mineralization.  This alteration can be flanked in volcanic host rocks by biotite-rich rocks that
grade outward into propylitic rocks.  The biotite is a fine-grained, secondary mineral that is commonly referred to as a “biotite hornfels.”  The
early biotite and potassic assemblages can be partially to completely overprinted by later biotite and K-feldspar alteration, zoning outwards to
quartz–sericite–pyrite (phyllic) alteration, then, less commonly, argillic zones, and rarely, in the uppermost parts of some deposits, kaolinite–
pyrophyllite, or advanced argillic, alteration.
 
Porphyry copper deposits can be subdivided into three styles on the basis of copper, gold, and molybdenum metal content ratios.  Typical
tonnages and grades for the three styles are:

 ·Porphyry Cu–Mo: averages 500 Mt at 0.42% Cu, 0.016% Mo, 0.012 g/t Au and 1.2 g/t Ag.
 
8.2
 
The following description of supergene oxidation is from Sillitoe, 2005:
 
Supergene leaching, oxidation and chalcocite enrichment in porphyry and related copper deposits takes place in the weathering environment
to depths of several hundred meters. [...]
 
Sulphide  oxidation  takes  place  above  the  water  table  as  an  electrochemical  process  mediated  by  acidophyllic,  Fe-  and  S-oxidizing
bacteria.  Where acidic conditions prevail, Cu is efficiently leached and transferred downward to the reduced environment. [...]
 
Several local and regional controls optimize supergene profile development.  Orebodies should be vertically extensive and contain a well-
developed array of steep faults and fractures, elevated pyrite/Cu-bearing sulphide ratios to maximize acidity of the supergene solutions, and
nonreactive  advanced  argillic  and  sericitic  alteration  assemblages  to  minimize  neutralization  of  the  acidity.    Porphyry  Cu  deposits  pass
through a natural supergene cycle in which leaching and mature enrichment in advanced argillic and sericitic zones give way during eventual
exposure of deeper potassic zones to in situ oxidation without attendant enrichment.  Mature oxidation and enrichment are promoted by the
following: uninterrupted supergene activity for at least 0.5 m.y. but typically minima of 3 to 9 m.y.; tectonically or isostatically induced surface
uplift responsible for depression of water tables and exposure of sulfides to oxidative weathering; and hot, semiarid to pluvial climates so long
as erosion rates remain in balance with rather than outpacing supergene processes. [...]
 
Leached cappings are traditionally subdivided on the basis of their dominant limonite component into hematitic above mature enrichment,
goethitic  above  hypogene  ore  or  protore  where  Cu  leaching  is  limited,  and  jarositic  above  pyrite-rich  mineralization.  Major  oxidized  Cu
orebodies are developed either in situ where pyrite contents and leaching are minimal or as exotic accumulations located lateral to enriched
zones. Oxidized ore comprises Cu minerals and mineraloids of both green and black color, with the latter, such as Cu wad, Cu pitch, and
neotocite, being poorly characterized and tending to typify low-grade rock volumes. Among the green Cu species, chrysocolla dominates
most high-grade ores of both in situ and exotic origin, hydrated sulfates and hydroxysulfates typify oxidation of pyrite-bearing enriched zones,
and prevalence of hydroxychlorides in northern Chile testifies to exceptionally arid supergene conditions. Enrichment, by factors of three or
even more, generates chalcocite and other Cu-rich sulfides in proximity to the overlying water table but lower grade covellite mineralization at
depth.  Gold  and  Mo  do  not  normally  undergo  significant  enrichment.  Oxidized  and  enriched  zones  undergo  pervasive  supergene  argillic
alteration, with kaolinite, accompanied under arid to semiarid conditions by alunite, dominating leached and enriched deposits; smectite is
more  common  in  zones  of  in  situ  sulphide  oxidation.  Dissolution  of  hypogene  anhydrite  typifies  the  supergene  profiles  of  porphyry  Cu
deposits and extends deeper than all significant enrichment. Geologic context and mesoscopic textural criteria facilitate distinction between
hypogene and supergene Cu sulfides, limonite, clay, and alunite. [...]
 
 
Page 8-2
Supergene transformations of the upper parts of many Cu and related Au deposits are beneficial because the ores are either upgraded or can
be  more  easily  and  cheaply  processed,  commonly  using  heap-leaching  technology.    Nevertheless,  heap-leaching  efficiency  is  highly
dependent on the oxide and sulphide mineralogy.

In August and September of 2012, Entrée carried out a rock sampling program to the south of the Ann Mason deposit and within the Blackjack
Oxide exploration areas.  A total of 186 grab samples were collected to characterize mineralization and alteration.  Seventy-four of these
samples returned copper assays ranging from 1.08% to 13.73%.

General
 
Three, partly overlapping conventional soil surveys were completed, one each by Honey Badger (then Telkwa Gold) and PacMag Metals
between 2006 and 2010, and one by Entrée in 2012.  The historical and current surveys comprise a total of 1,617 samples over an irregular
area extending from south of the Ann Mason deposit to 3 km north of the Blue Hill deposit (Table 9-2 and Figure 9-2).

Honey Badger carried out soil sampling programs in 2006 and 2007 over a 2.4 km2 area to the west and northwest of the Blue Hill deposit.  In
total, 760 samples were collected, mostly at 60 m x 60 m intervals, with some infill sampling.  Samples were submitted to ALS in Reno for
gold and multi-element analyses.  Samples were collected with shovels from pits generally ranging from 0.3 m to 1 m deep.  In most cases the
survey targeted the soil immediately below a narrow zone of very fine, clayey, silty material, yet remaining above the underlying regolith or C
horizon.  Samples were screened to -10 mesh in the field and averaged about one kilogram in weight.  The PacMag Blue Hill soil sampling
program was carried out in three stages.  The first 19 orientation samples were collected in 2006 on a 200 m x 200 m grid, but the initial 200 m
program was not completed until 2008, when an additional 79 samples were collected.  Encouraging results from the southern part of the soil
survey resulted in a more detailed 2010 follow-up survey with a 100 m grid spacing and collection of an additional 72 samples.  All samples
were  submitted  to  ALS  for  Au-ST43  and  copper  and  47  additional  elements  by  the  ME-MS61  method  (inductively  coupled  plasma/mass
spectrometer (ICP/MS)).
 
On Ann Mason, PacMag soil sampling was conducted in 2006, and comprised 99 samples on a 200 m x 200 m grid to the south and west of
the Ann Mason deposit.  Samples were submitted to ALS in Reno, where gold was analyzed using the Au-ST43 method, and copper and 47
additional elements were analyzed by the ME-MS61 method (ICP/MS).  This grid was largely infilled by recent Entrée sampling.
 
PacMag  sample  sites  were  located  in  the  field  using  a  handheld  Garmin  GPS  receiver,  which  is  generally  accurate  to  within  three
meters.  Sampling was restricted to areas of soil developed over in situ Jurassic granitic bedrock.  Grid sites that fell in areas of transported
alluvium (Qal) or post-mineral Tertiary volcanics were excluded or moved to the nearest Jurassic rock outcrop area.  Samples were collected
with a rock hammer from depths of 10 cm to 20 cm whenever possible, or from the bottom few centimetres of soil where bedrock depths were
<10 cm.  Soil material was sifted through a -10 mesh sieve in the field, and the +10 mesh fraction was discarded.  Approximately 250 g of -10
mesh-sieved soil was retained in a 4.5" x 6" Hubco cloth soil sample bag for each sample.  All efforts were made to avoid contamination, but
a few samples contained a significant fraction of eolian sand, which was noted in the sample field notes (as were the dominant lithology and
alteration of the bedrock and/or float).
 
The 2012 Entrée soil sampling was completed between July and September, and covered a number of copper oxide showings located 2 km
to 3 km north of the Blue Hill deposit (Blackjack Oxide Target), and also to the south and west of the Ann Mason deposit, to fill in and expand
the original 2006 PacMag survey (Figure 9-2).  A total of 397 samples were collected covering a combined area of 762 ha.  Samples taken to
the north were on a nominal 100 m x 100 m grid, while samples taken around the Ann Mason deposit were taken on a 100 m x 200 m grid.
 
 
Page 9-5
Entrée soil sample sites were located in the field using a handheld Garmin GPS receiver, generally accurate to within three meters.  Sampling
was restricted to areas of soil developed over in situ Jurassic granitic bedrock or thin alluvium (Qal).  Grid sites fell on disturbed ground
(trenches, prospect pits, and mine dumps), eolian sand, or stream beds were moved to adjacent undisturbed or residual soil.  Grid sites that
fell in areas of post-mineral Tertiary volcanics were excluded.  Sampling protocol was the same as that used by PacMag and described
above.  All samples were delivered to Skyline Assayers & Laboratories (Skyline) in Sparks, Nevada, for sample preparation by sieving to -80
mesh and analyses by Skyline’s TE-3 49 element ICP/MS analytical package.
 
Soil Results
 
Contoured copper in soil results are shown in Figure 9-3.  Molybdenum results have not been presented but, except for being more subdued,
largely mirror copper results.  Results are discussed by area below.
 
Ann Mason Area
 
Recent Entrée soil sampling, together with PacMag sampling, covers an area of approximately 410 ha wrapping around the south and west
sides of the Ann Mason deposit (Figure 9-3).  Anomalous copper results to the south of the Ann Mason deposit (Figure 9-3) generally wrap
around  or  partly  overlie  the  deposit.    Strongest  results  (200  to  960  ppm  Cu)  are  located  where  the  deposit  surfaces  to  the  south  of  the
Singatse Fault.  Other anomalous areas south of the northwest and southeast ends of the deposit are within the area of alteration related to
Ann Mason and require follow-up surface investigation.
 
Blue Hill Area
 
The Blue Hill deposit is well-defined by a 1.5 km-wide zone of anomalous copper values which overlie the deposit and extends for 750 m to
the  southwest.    Sampling  and  associated  results  are  truncated  to  the  east  by  the  Blue  Hill  Fault,  which  places  mainly  barren  Tertiary
volcanics over mineralized Jurassic intrusive.  This broad zone of anomalous values extends northwest from the Blue Hill deposit for 2 km,
and covers an area largely underlain by Jurassic quartz monzonite and porphyritic dykes.  The northwest part of the copper anomaly has
been partly tested by Entrée drill holes EG-B-10-003, -004, -006, and -007, in which mineralization was dominantly pyritic, although sporadic
low-grade copper mineralization was intersected (i.e., 20 m of 0.20% Cu from 136 m in hole -004).

Blackjack Oxide Area
 
Recent Entrée soil sampling over the Blackjack oxide area covers 352 ha to the north of Wishart Hill, and is located at the east end of the
Blackjack IP anomaly.  Sampling is limited on the north side and to the west by overlying barren Tertiary volcanic rocks, while most of the
gridded area is underlain by variably altered locally copper-mineralized Jurassic quartz monzonite and porphyritic dykes.
 
Five zones of interest can be defined (Figure 9-3) based on copper in soil results, old mine workings, and copper mineralization/alteration
exposed in numerous historical trenches.  In general, the mainly oxide copper mineralization in the northern zones (I and II) appears to be
related to east-west trending, albitized and sericitized shears.  The southern zones (III/IV/V) are generally more related to pervasive alteration
and disseminated sulphide and/or quartz-sulphide veining.  All targets in this area require follow-up evaluation.
 
9.4.3
 
On the Roulette earn-in grounds, a deep penetrating soil geochemistry and pH survey was carried out from November 8 to 12,  2009  by
Heberlein Geoconsulting (Heberlein, 2009).  Soil samples were collected at 100 m intervals along two northeast-southwest lines for a total
length of 7.2 km.  Two additional samples were collected for soil pH measurements at each site.  Based on soil pH and analytical (Cu, Mo,
Au, and As) results, the report recommended further investigation over one feature (feature B) located in the northern area of the Roulette
target.  Drilling in this area subsequently encountered porphyry style copper mineralization (20.7 m of 0.14% Cu) in hole EG-R-10-003 starting
at 497.3 m

Historical  geophysical  data,  consisting  of  IP/Resistivity  surveys  acquired  by  Anaconda  and  Superior  Oil  and  magnetic  data  acquired  by
Anaconda,  show  responses  similar  to  recent,  more  detailed  surveys  conducted  by  Honey  Badger  and  Entrée  U.S.    These  surveys  are
described below.

Airborne Geophysics
9.5.1
 
A high-resolution magnetic and TEM airborne survey was conducted over the Project in March and April 2008 by Fugro on behalf of Honey
Badger (Fugro, 2008).  A total of 91 traverse lines were flown, ranging in length from 7 km to 12.9 km, with a spacing of 100 m between
lines.    Fourteen  tie  lines  were  flown  with  a  spacing  of  1  km  between  lines.    The  survey  totalled  approximately  1,063  line-km  of  data
acquisition.  The airborne geophysical data showed a pronounced magnetic low approximately 1.5 km northwest of the Blue Hill deposit, as
well as a strong magnetic high in the centre of the Roulette property (Honey Badger, 2009).  These anomalies were partially drill tested by
Entrée.
 
 
Page 9-8
Ground Geophysics
Also on behalf of Honey Badger, Geotech Ltd. carried out a helicopter-borne geophysical survey in 2009, covering the Project area.  The
survey used a Tri-Axis Electromagnetic (AirMt) system, and a cesium magnetometer.  A total of 1,123 line-km were flown, generally at a
200 m line spacing (Geotech, 2009).  Two separate AirMt anomalies were identified by the survey.  One is located at the northeast corner of
the  Project,  occurs  coincident  with  an  IP  anomaly  at  depth,  and  was  subsequently  drilled  by  Entrée  with  hole  EG-B-001.    Results  are
discussed in Section 10.2.  The second anomaly, located at the southwest corner of the Roulette property, was deemed too deep to be tested
by drilling without having additional supporting data (Honey Badger, 2009).
 
Figure 9-4 shows the total magnetic intensity obtained from the Geotech 2009 airborne survey.
 
9.5.2
 
Four geophysical surveys were conducted for Entrée on the Ann Mason Project in 2010 and 2011: Complex Resistivity Induced Polarization
(CRIP) and Natural Source Audio Magnetotelluric (NSAMT) were conducted over the west portion of the project in April 2010 (formerly the
Blackjack project and portions of the Roulette property); a dipole-dipole IP survey was conducted over the Ann Mason/Blue Hill areas in July
and August 2010; and an NSAMT survey was conducted over the Ann Mason deposit area in January 2011.  The surveys were contracted to
Zonge  Engineering  and  Research  Organization  (Zonge).    The  objective  of  the  surveys  was  to  locate  and  identify  zones  of  enhanced
chargeability or resistivity that may be associated with metallic mineralization.
 
Figure 9-5 shows the 2010 chargeability results at 600 m depth.
 
CRIP and NSAMT Surveys (April 2010)
 
Between April 5 and 19, 2010, Zonge conducted a dipole-dipole CRIP survey and an NSAMT geophysical investigation on the west portion
of the Project (Zonge, 2010a).  Dipole-dipole CRIP data were acquired along nine lines oriented N-S (Lines 2 through 10) for a total coverage
of 43.5 line-km at 154 stations.  NSAMT data were acquired along one line (Line 1) for a total of 3 line-km at 31 stations.
 
Line 1 NSAMT results were unable to map resistive or conductive zones potentially related to porphyry mineralization or alteration at depth,
due to very high conductivity values at surface, possibly caused by saline groundwater in Quaternary alluvium.  In addition, the NSAMT data
was not able to substantiate possible uplift on the northeast side of a northwest-trending structure located near the southwest corner of the
Roulette block.  The structure, interpreted from the Honey Badger AirMT survey, could have placed potential porphyry targets at shallower
depths than was interpreted from drill thicknesses of Quaternary alluvium.

Figure 9-5:

At Blue Hill, chargeability responses are interpreted to be primarily caused by pyrite mineralization located northwest of oxide and sulphide
copper mineralization.
 
The CRIP survey also defined an east-west, 5.4 km-long IP anomaly located in the northern portion of the Ann Mason Project area.  The main
body of the anomaly, observed on lines 2 through 9, is interpreted as a possible separate porphyry system. Georeferenced plots of inverted IP
sections, in conjunction with geologic cross-sections, indicate that the main body of the IP target occurs in volcanic and sedimentary wall
rocks to the west of the Yerington batholith and beneath Quaternary alluvium and Tertiary volcanic rocks.
 
IP Survey (2010)
 
Between July 29 and August 19, 2010, Zonge conducted a dipole-dipole IP survey over the Ann Mason and Blue Hill areas of the Project
(Zonge, 2010b).  Data were acquired along ten lines (lines 11 through 20) for a total coverage of 52.2 line-km, with 184 stations at 300 m
intervals.  Lines 11 and 14 overlapped and extended line 9 and line 10 (respectively) of the previous survey.  Details of this survey were
previously described in Morrison and Cann (2011).
 
Chargeability responses observed on lines over the Ann Mason deposit and extending westward towards Blue Hill reflect a combination of
copper  sulphides  in  the  central  and  eastern  portions  of  the  Ann  Mason  deposit,  and  pyrite,  pyrite-chalcopyrite,  and  chalcopyrite-pyrite
domains to the west.  Between Ann Mason and Blue Hill, chargeability responses in the Ann Mason fault block obscure possible responses
that might be located in the underlying Blue Hill fault block.
 
NSAMT Survey (2011)
 
Between January 20 and 29, 2011, Zonge conducted a NSAMT geophysical survey over the Ann Mason deposit area of the Project to add to
the previous survey of July and August 2010 (Zonge, 2011).  Data were acquired along 9 lines covering 15.4 km.  The survey repeated
selected portions of lines 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 of the prior survey, and added segments 16.5, 17.5, and 18.5.
 
The NSAMT survey was conducted in an attempt to better define conductive zones observed in the Ann Mason IP/Resistivity survey that have
an apparent spatial association with the Ann Mason copper resource.  In detail, the distribution of copper mineralization at Ann Mason does
not appear to coincide directly with conductive zones mapped by the NSAMT data.  A general association between the overall distribution of
copper mineralization at Ann Mason and the relatively conductive zones detected by the IP/Resistivity survey may still exist.

Petrographic Work
9.6
 
A petrographic study by L.T. Larson was completed on twenty-nine polished thin sections from selected Ann Mason core samples in January
2012  (Larson,  2012).    The  petrographic  report  provides  information  on  rock  types,  alteration,  and  mineralization  present  within  the
deposit.  Key findings are included in Sections 7.3 and 7.4.
 
9.7
 
Entrée completed 75 drill holes totalling 45,590 m on the Ann Mason Project from June 2, 2010 to May 9, 2012.
 
Most of the drilling was carried out on the Ann Mason deposit, and was designed to increase tonnage and confidence in the resources by
step-out and infill drilling.  A total of 30 drill holes totalling 32,883 m were completed at Ann Mason.
 
At the Blue Hill exploration area, 25 RC and 11 diamond drill holes totalling 9,528 m were completed.  The drilling programs at Blue Hill were
to  test  for  shallow  copper  oxide  mineralization  and  deeper  sulphide  mineralization,  in  order  to  define  resources  and  to  test  for  possible
extension of the known mineralization.
 
Seven holes (two RC pre-collar, three diamond with RC pre-collars, and two diamond daughter holes) were drilled on the Roulette target in
2010 and 2012 for a total length of 2,308 m.  The holes were sited based on a strong aeromagnetic high revealed in Honey Badger’s 2009
geophysical survey and the results of the soil geochemical and pH survey described in Section 9.4.3.
 
Finally, on the Blackjack Northeast target, two holes (one diamond with RC pre-collar, and one RC pre-collar) totalling 871 m were drilled in
2010 to test the AirMt target interpreted in Honey Badger’s 2009 airborne survey, which is coincident with the 2010 IP anomaly.
 
Drilling programs and results are described in Section 10.

Reverse circulation drilling was contracted to Diversified Drilling LLC of Missoula, Montana, using a DLD1200 track-mounted rig, and Boart
Longyear Company of Salt Lake City, Utah, using a D40K truck-mounted rig.  The hole diameters for pre-collars and shallow exploration
holes were 15.8 cm or 16.5 cm.
 
Diamond drilling was contracted to Ruen Drilling Incorporated of Clark Fork, Idaho, using DE710 and DMW100 track-mounted core rigs and a
truck-mounted LF-230 core drill, and Boart Longyear Company, using an LS244 truck-mounted rig.  All holes recovered HQ size (6.35 cm)
core, and 3 holes (EG-AM-11-009, EG-BH-11-021, and EG-R-10-004A) were reduced to NQ (4.76 cm) core.  Hole EG-R-10-005A recovered
NQ size core.  Hole EG-AM-11-008 was drilled with an HQ triple-tube core barrel through the Tertiary volcanics, Singatse Fault, and most of
the rest of the hole.  EG-AM-11-011 was also drilled with an HQ triple-tube core barrel through the Tertiary volcanics and the Singatse Fault.
 
All Entrée drill holes are prefixed with “EG” and then “AM” for Ann Mason, “BH” for Blue Hill, “R” for Roulette, or “B” for Blackjack (within the
former Blackjack property), followed by the year commenced (2 digits), followed by a sequential hole number.  Seven Blackjack holes (“B”-
prefixed) have been reallocated to the Blue Hill periphery and the Blackjack Northeast exploration target.
 
 
Page 10-1
Historical Anaconda drilling is prefixed with a “D,” followed by a three digit hole number, or “ANN,” followed by a one digit hole number, and
PacMag drilling is prefixed with “BH” for Blue Hill or “Ann” for Ann Mason, followed by the year (2 digits), followed by a three digit hole
number.  The 2002 MIM drilling is labelled AM0201 to AM0205.  Phelps Dodge Holes are labelled “WH.”
 
Collar and elevation data for all Entrée holes except hole EG-R-10-005 were located by differential GPS surveys by Mineral Exploration
Services, Ltd. of Reno (hole EG-R-10-005 was surveyed with a handheld GPS).  All coordinates are NAD83 UTM Zone 11.  Historical hole
locations were converted to NAD83 UTM Zone 11N from the Anaconda Mine Grid.  Scott Jackson and Entrée have field-checked select
locations using a hand-held GPS to confirm hole locations.  PacMag drill holes were located using NAD27 UTM Zone 11N using a differential
GPS by Mineral Exploration Services, Ltd., and converted to NAD83, UTM Zone 11N.
 
Core was recovered with standard wireline equipment and conventional core barrels, with the exception of two Ann Mason drill holes: holes
EG-AM-11-008 and -011 were partially drilled using a triple-tube core barrel for the purpose of obtaining core samples of Tertiary volcanic
rocks suitable for geotechnical logging.
 
Core recovery at Ann Mason, Blue Hill, and Blackjack was generally good (90% or better), while recovery at Roulette was lower, averaging
80%.  Core was commonly quite broken.  RQD values for Ann Mason, Blackjack, and Roulette were often zero, and averaged 15%; RQD
values for core recovered from the Blue Hill deposit and EG-BH-11-031 (periphery) were also often zero, and averaged 15%; RQD values for
holes EG-B-10-003 to 007 (Blue Hill periphery) averaged 55%.
 
Downhole surveys at Ann Mason, Blue Hill, Blackjack, and Roulette were conducted using a Reflex EZ shot borehole instrument.  Digital
readings were collected at 91 m intervals.
 
All historical core from Ann Mason and Blue Hill is stored in two warehouse buildings leased by Entrée in Yerington, Nevada, along with all
rejects and pulps from Entrée’s 2010 through 2012 drilling.  Core from Entrée’s 2010 through 2012 drilling is stored in a locked and fenced
area adjoining the Company’s office and core logging facility in Yerington, Nevada.
 
10.2
 
Entrée completed thirty diamond drill holes totalling 32,883.49 m on the Ann Mason deposit from October 26, 2010, to May 9, 2012.  Most
holes were drilled vertically; eighteen were pre-collared with RC drilling from surface to the approximate depth of the Singatse Fault.  Drill
holes EG-AM-10-002, 11-017, 11-022, 11-025, and 12-028 were drilled at various angles in order to test portions of the deposit not accessible
via vertical drill holes.  Drill spacing ranges from 70 m x 70 m within the central and eastern portions of the deposit to 70 m x 150 m in the
recently drilled western portions of the deposit.  The north and northeastern portions of the deposit have drill hole spacings of approximately
150 m x 250 m.

Entrée drilling to date has expanded the known limits of mineralization both laterally and at depth (Figure 10-1).  Holes EG-AM-11-014, -025, -
028 and -029 define the current northern limit of mineralization, while holes EG-AM-11-027, -029 and -030 define its western margin.  To the
east side of the deposit, both EG-AM-11-016 and -018 extended the vertical thickness of the known mineralization.  The deposit remains open
to  the  north  and  to  the  west,  and  along  several  sections  to  the  east  and  south.    Known  mineralization  now  covers  an  ellipsoidal  west-
northwest-trending area of 1.3 km x 2.3 km to a depth of over 1 km.
 
A detailed description of the mineralization of the Ann Mason deposit is provided in Section 7.4.1

In 2010, Entrée completed a reverse circulation drill program (14 holes, EG-BH-10-001 to EG-BH-10-014) at the Blue Hill deposit to test for
copper mineralization in the shallow oxide zone, identified at surface by soil geochemistry and outcropping oxide copper mineralization.  In
2011,  Entrée  drilled  16  drill  holes  (diamond  and  RC;  holes  EG-BH-11-015  to  EG-BH-11-030)  to  continue  testing  for  shallow  oxide
mineralization, and also investigated the deeper sulphide target first discovered by PacMag in 2008.
 
The oxide deposit is exposed on surface and has been traced by drilling as a relatively flat-lying zone, covering an area of about 900 m x 450
Blue Hill Deposit and Periphery

m, and continuing for several hundred metres to the west as a thinner zone.  Oxide mineralization extends from surface to an average depth of
124 m, where a zone of mixed oxide/sulphide mineralization is present to depths averaging 160 m.  The copper oxide zone remains open to
the  northwest  and  southeast.    Copper  sulphide  mineralization  encountered  in  widely-spaced  holes  D177,  200,  223,  233,  236  and  261,
PacMag holes BH08001 and 003, and Entrée holes EG-BH-11-019 and -020, is more restricted as compared to Ann Mason.  Higher-grade
copper mineralization was observed in zones of sheeted veins containing chalcopyrite, magnetite, and secondary biotite and with quartz
monzonite porphyry (qmp-b) dykes.
 
A detailed description of the mineralization of the Blue Hill deposit is provided in Section 7.4.2.
 
Most  of  the  drilling  was  vertical,  and  intersected  mineralization  perpendicular  to  the  broad,  flat-lying  oxide  and  mixed/oxide
mineralization.  Figure 10-4 illustrates the location of all drill holes, and Figure 10-5 illustrates the drilling on vertical section with respect to
the  mineralization.    No  drilling,  sampling,  or  recovery  factors  that  could  materially  affect  the  accuracy  and  reliability  of  the  results  were
observed.

Holes EG-B-10-003 to -007, located 0.7 to 1.4 km northwest of the Blue Hill deposit, were completed In June and July of 2010 to test a
combination of IP, soil geochemical, and geological targets.  Initial target analysis and identification was conducted by Taiga Consultants Ltd.
(Taiga)  as  part  of  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  historical  geological  and  geophysical  data,  in  conjunction  with  data  provided  by  Honey
Badger.  The upper portions of all five holes are strongly oxidized and iron-rich, with occasional copper minerals noted.  Drill holes EG-B-10-
003 and -004 intersected narrow intervals of anomalous copper sulphide mineralization (Table 10-3).  The area tested by these five drill holes
contains primarily pyritic mineralization to a depth of approximately 350 m.
 
Hole EG-BH-11-031, located 750 m east-southeast of EG-BH-11-019, was collared into bedrock in mid-2011, and completed to a depth of
756 m in February 2012.  Two intervals of copper mineralization were intercepted: 13.78 m of 0.28% Cu (oxide zone), and 42 m of 0.31% Cu
(sulphide zone).  Hole EG-BH-11-031 was drilled to test a conductive geophysical target located on the north flank of the Ann Mason/Blue Hill
IP  chargeability  anomaly,  and  interpreted  to  be  in  the  footwall  of  the  Blue  Hill  fault.    Rock  and  soil  sampling  conducted  by  Anaconda
encountered anomalous copper mineralization in the area surrounding hole -031.
 
Significant intercepts for all holes at the Blue Hill deposit and adjacent areas are shown in Table 10-3.

Roulette
10.4
 
As initially described by BCE, the primary exploration target at Roulette is a covered, high-grade zone of copper mineralization in wall rocks
outside of contact skarn, developed along the intrusive contact between the Yerington batholith and adjacent volcanic and sedimentary wall
rocks.
 
In 2010, Entrée completed six holes (three RC pre-collar, two diamond with RC pre-collars, and one diamond daughter hole) at Roulette.  The
holes were sited based on a strong aeromagnetic high, the results of a soil geochemical and pH survey, and a structural analysis of the target
as completed by BCE.  One of the pre-collared holes was completed in April 2012 after deepening the hole with core.  Approximately 2,308 m
of drilling has been completed to date at Roulette.
 
Hole EG-R-10-003 successfully reached target and was completed at 619.82 m.  It intersected 20.7 m, averaging 0.14% Cu, from a depth of
497.3 m.  This intercept is based on core length, and may not reflect the true width of mineralization.  Mineralization occurs as chalcopyrite-
pyrite in strongly altered granodiorite cut by quartz-K-feldspar and quartz-chlorite veins.
 
This  new  copper  occurrence  is  interpreted  as  representative  of  a  separate  porphyry  system  located  near  the  southwest  margin  of  the
Yerington batholith.  Disseminated magnetite, associated with K-feldspar alteration, is interpreted to be the cause of the strong magnetic
anomaly.  Exploration potential of the target had been previously dismissed by Anaconda, after drilling into a magnetic Tertiary-age andesite
beneath Quaternary alluvium, but in the hanging wall of the Blue Hill Fault.  Mineralization and the source of the magnetic high is interpreted
to be in the footwall of the Blue Hill Fault.  Additional, displaced mineralized zones may be present in the hanging wall of the Blue Hill Fault to
the southeast of EG-R-10-003.
 
Holes EG-R-10-001 and -002 were cased to a depth of 211.72 m and 125 m respectively, but were not deepened by diamond drilling.  Holes
EG-R-10-004 and EG-R-10-004A were collared approximately 1,000 m northeast of EG-R-10-003, but failed to penetrate the Blue Hill Fault
after several attempts to drill though highly faulted volcanic rocks and were abandoned.  An RC pre-collar (EG-R-10-005) was drilled and
cased to a depth of 329.18 m.  The hole is located 200 m southeast of holes -004 and -004A.

Blackjack Northeast
In  2012,  the  RC  pre-collar  EG-R-10-005  was  deepened  with  core  to  a  depth  of  606.86  m.    The  hole  penetrated  the  Blue  Hill  fault  and
encountered strongly faulted and sheared granodiorite at 563.16 m, but was lost due to caving of highly faulted volcanic rocks located above
the Blue Hill fault.  Weak pyrite mineralization, with trace amounts of chalcopyrite and disseminated magnetite, are present in the granodiorite
within  zones  of  chlorite  and  potassic  alteration.    Hole  EG-R-10-005A  wedged  off  hole  -005  at  541.94  m,  and  was  drilled  to  a  depth  of
712.93 m.  The hole was abandoned after consistently poor recovery, slow and expensive drilling, and weak mineralization.  Highly faulted
and sheared granodiorite cut by Jurassic andesite dykes and one quartz monzonite porphyry (qmp) dyke, is present in the footwall of the Blue
Hill  fault.    Weak  to  moderate  pyrite  mineralization,  with  weak  chalcopyrite  and  minor  amounts  of  disseminated  magnetite,  are  present
throughout the granodiorite, and occur with zones of chlorite-epidote and potassic alteration.

On the Blackjack Northeast exploration area, two holes (one diamond with RC pre-collar and one RC pre-collar) totalling 870.67 m were
drilled in June 2010 to test the AirMT target interpreted from Honey Badger’s 2009 airborne survey.  Initial target analysis and identification
was conducted by Taiga as part of a comprehensive analysis of historical geological and geophysical data, in conjunction with data provided
by Honey Badger.  The Blackjack Northeast target is coincident with a chargeability anomaly defined by Entrée’s initial 2010 IP survey.
 
Narrow  intervals  of  copper  mineralization  in  hole  EG-B-10-001  occur  as  coarse  chalcopyrite  in  silicified  breccias.    Hole  EG-B-10-001
confirmed the presence of porphyry-style sulphide mineralization (predominantly pyrite) in granodiorite intruded by quartz monzonite porphyry
dykes at the eastern limit of a 5-km-long, east-west-trending IP anomaly.  Hole EG-B-10-001 intersected 4.0 m averaging 0.44% Cu from a
depth of 444.0 m.  This intercept is based on core length, and may not reflect the true width of mineralization.
 
EG-B-10-002 was cased to a depth of 262.5 m, but subsequently abandoned based on the determination the hole would be too deep to test
the Blackjack Northeast IP anomaly below EG-B-10-001.

Sample Preparation, Analyses, and Security
Introduction
11.1
 
Sampling programs on the Ann Mason Project date back to the 1950s, and include soil, rock chip, drill core, and RC samples.  All of the early-
stage sampling and assaying methods on the Ann Mason deposit have been superseded by subsequent drilling programs and are therefore
not discussed in detail in this section.  Soil sampling programs are discussed in Section 9.  No written documentation is available for the
historical drilling and related sampling, analytical, or quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) work by Anaconda, MIM, or Phelps Dodge,
and therefore these programs are not discussed in detail in this section.  Being major mining companies, it is believed that their sampling and
assaying programs would have met or exceeded the general standards and best practices typical for those periods.  Anaconda’s sampling of
core  was  done  by  mechanical  splitter  to  obtain  samples  of  half  core.    Sample  intervals  were  selected  by  the  length  of  individual  core
runs.    Work  completed  by  PacMag  is  briefly  discussed  in  this  section,  along  with  a  detailed  description  of  Entrée’s  programs.    Entrée
personnel or contractors have carried out all of the current sampling programs.  The QPs are of the opinion that the sample preparation,
analytical procedures, and security measures discussed in the section below are adequate to support the Mineral Resource estimates.
 
Other  sampling  programs  discussed  in  this  section  include  historical  core  resampling  completed  by  PacMag  in  2006,  a  historical  core
resampling program recently initiated by Entrée, and a bulk density sampling program undertaken by Entrée during 2011–2012.
 
11.2
 
11.2.1
 
The following is a brief summary of the general logging procedures used by PacMag:
 
 ·All drill core was logged by PacMag geologists for lithology, alteration, structure, and sulphide species.
 
 ·Geotechnical logging included RQD, fracture frequency, and other parameters sufficient to formulate a rock mass rating (RM78).  Drill core
was also subjected to point load index strength tests (axial and diametral) at regular downhole intervals (approximately every 3.05 m).
Diamond Drill Core Sampling
PacMag (2006–2008)
·All drill core was subject to measurement of magnetic susceptibility, and was also photographed.
 
 
Page 11-1
·Starting in 2007 and continuing through 2008, PacMag contracted American Assay Laboratories (AAL) in Reno to complete the core cutting
at their facility in Reno, Nevada, followed by sample preparation and analyses (refer to Section 11.4.1).  Prior to the core being picked up by
AAL, PacMag would complete core mark-up, including marking a red “cut line” along the core axis for core sawing.  PacMag geologists
would also insert geochemistry standards (pulp bags) into the core boxes, so that they would enter the sample stream in the correct
sequence.
Entrée Gold (2010 to Present)
In general, core samples were saw-cut over approximately 1.5 m to 3.05 m intervals, at an average length of 3.03 m.
 
11.2.2
 
Entrée’s personnel and contractors follow the core sampling procedure described below:
 
 ·An Entrée geologist picks up the core boxes each morning at the drill rig and transports them to the Yerington core logging/sampling
facility.  Core is transported in covered boxes in a secure position, to prevent core spillage.  The core is delivered directly to the core logging
facility, and received by an Entrée geologist or technician to ensure that all boxes are accounted for.
core recovery
· Core is washed and photographed.
· Core remains in the secure facility while being logged and sampled.
 
 ·Footage on boxes and core blocks are converted to metres, and the “from-to” metres are recorded on the end of each box.
 
 
 
  · The following geotechnical information is recorded:
 
 
 
 
 
 -magnetic susceptibility is measured for each 2 m interval by averaging 10 readings along the core.
 
 ·Core logging protocols include lithology, alteration, mineralization, structure, and veining.
 
 ·Sample intervals for cutting are marked on the core by the geologist.  Generally, sample intervals for the Ann Mason deposit are 2 m;
however, occasionally sample intervals conform to contacts of major rock or alteration types.  Three-part sample tags are used.  Part 1 has
the sample or quality control information recorded on the tag, and remains in the sample book.  Parts 2 and 3 are stapled into the box at the
end of each sample interval; part 2 becomes a permanent record in the core box.  .
RQD

-
·All geotechnical, logging, and sampling data is entered into the Century Systems (CAE Mining) database.
 
 
Page 11-2
·On completion of the geotechnical and geological logging, the core is transported to the core cutting facility.
 
 ·Core is sampled by sawing competent pieces of core in half, or collecting half of the rock in areas of highly broken core.  Part 3 of each
sample tag is placed in an 18" x 24", 6 mL plastic bag along with the sampled core.  The sample number is written on the outside of the bag
with a waterproof marker.
· Sample bags are secured by plastic cable ties.
 
 ·Assay samples are kept in a secure facility prior to being picked up by the laboratory.
 
 ·Sample shipments are picked up by laboratory personnel and taken to the lab.  Strict chain of custody procedures are maintained during the
transporting of the samples to the labs.  An Entrée Sample Submittal Form and Order for Analytical Services is transmitted with each sample
shipment, with a copy retained by Entrée.  The form includes shipment number, date shipped, shipping method, destination, number of bags,
and contents of shipment (range of sample numbers).  Individual assay samples are packaged in woven, polypropylene bags (four per bag),
secured with plastic zip ties.  The polypropylene bags are shipped on wooden pallets secured with shrink wrap.  All sample shipments are
made by Entrée or laboratory vehicles and personnel.  Upon delivery to the laboratory, sample shipment information is recorded into the
laboratory’s Information Management System.  Indications of tampering or discrepancies between samples received and samples shipped
are reported to Entrée by the laboratory.  In some cases, the laboratory will e-mail delivery confirmation to Entrée.
Reverse Circulation Drilling and Sampling
·Once logged and split, the core is stored on racks or, in the case of wooden core boxes, stacked on pallets in a secure storage facility.
 
 ·Pulps and coarse rejects are returned to Entrée’s Yerington facility, where they are catalogued and stored on site.
 
11.3
 
11.3.1
 
Few details are available for PacMag’s RC sampling protocols.  RC was used to pre-collar through the overlying sterile volcanics for most of
the core holes at Ann Mason.  At Blue Hill most of the holes were entirely RC, and a few of the deeper ones were collared with RC and
converted to core at depth.  Samples were collected over approximate 3.05 m sample intervals; however, within the pre-collared zones, only
selected samples (approximately one in five samples) were sent to the lab for analysis.
 
 
Page 11-3
PacMag (2006–2008)
Entrée Gold (2010 to Present)
11.3.2
 
Entrée used RC drilling for most of the drilling at Blue Hill.  In addition, many of the Ann Mason holes use RC drilling to pre-collar through the
sterile overlying volcanic; however, these portions of the holes were not analyzed on a regular basis.  Entrée’s personnel and contractors
follow the RC sampling procedure described below:
 
 ·RC samples are collected at the drill; all RC drilling is conducted with air and/or water as the drilling medium.
 
 ·Assay samples consist of an approximate quarter-split of all cuttings and water returned from each 5 ft interval, and are collected in an 18" x
24" MicroPor cloth sample bag, resulting in 6 kg to 10 kg samples when dry.
·Part 3 of a three-part, numbered sample tag is inserted in each sample bag; the sample number is also written on the outside of each
bag.  The first and second parts of each sample tag remain in the sample booklet, along with written notes on hole number and footage for
each assay sample.  For selected tags, information on blanks, duplicates, and standards is written on the first part of the sample tags.
·Assay duplicates are collected at the drill by using approximate 1/8 splits for both the assay sample and duplicate.
 
 ·Samples are allowed to drain at the drill site, and are transported to Entrée’s secure core and sample facility by Company employees at the
end of each day of drilling.  Samples are then allowed to air dry in a fenced and locked facility prior to being submitted to the laboratory for
analysis.
·Blanks, duplicates, and standards are inserted prior to sample shipment at varying intervals, depending on laboratory batch sizes (Section
11.7.3).
11.4
Sample Preparation and Analyses
PacMag (2006 to 2008)
11.4.1
 
Following logging and photographing, all 2006 PacMag samples were dispatched as chip samples (for RC) or half-cut HQ or NQ diamond
core to ALS in Reno, Nevada.  All sample preparation and gold analysis was performed in Reno, while the pulps were forwarded by ALS to
their Vancouver lab for inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analyses.  Samples were prepared and analyzed as follows:
 
  · The entire sample was crushed to >70% passing -2 mm.
 
  · 1 kg was separated by riffle splitter off and pulverized to >85% passing 75 µm.
 
  · A 200 g pulp was split off, and the remaining pulp kept as a pulp reject.
 
 
Page 11-4
·Samples were analyzed for 25 elements using a four-acid digestion inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-
AES)/MS (ALS code ME ICP61a), and for gold using a 30 g fire assay (ALS code Av-AA23).  All molybdenum values >300 ppm were re-
assayed by ICP method ME-MS61, which employs a second digestion to assess the rhenium values and a wider range of trace elements
(47 elements).
Starting in 2007 and continuing through 2008, all PacMag samples were dispatched as chip samples (for RC) or uncut HQ or NQ diameter
core to AAL in Reno, Nevada.  AAL is a well-recognized, Nevada-focused laboratory.  AAL was contracted to complete the core cutting,
sample preparation, and all analyses (Section 11.2.1).  Samples were prepared and analyzed as follows:
 
  · The entire sample was crushed to >70% passing -2 mm.
 
  · 1 kg was separated by riffle splitter off and pulverized to >85% passing 75 µm.
 
  · A 200 g pulp was split off, and the remaining pulp kept as a pulp reject.
 
 ·Samples were analyzed for 61 elements using a four-acid digestion ICP-AES method, and for gold using a 30 g fire assay with an AAS
finish.  All copper values >1.0% were re-assayed by ICP method, using a second digestion.
Entrée Gold – ALS Chemex Samples (2010 to July 2011)
11.4.2
 
All Entrée samples between September 2010 and July 2011 were sent to ALS in Reno, Nevada, for sample preparation and analyses.  This
included RC chip samples from Blue Hill and half-cut HQ or NQ diamond core from both Ann Mason and Blue Hill.  A total of 61 batches were
assayed, including 9,855 regular samples, 1,069 QC samples from core drill holes EG-AM-10-001 to EG-AM-11-010 and EG-AM-11-012, and
RC and/or core holes EG-BH-10-001 to EG-BH-11-30.
 
All sample preparation and gold analysis was performed in Reno, Nevada, while the pulps were forwarded directly by ALS to their Vancouver
lab for ICP analyses. Samples were prepared and analyzed as follows:
 
 
 
  · The entire sample was crushed to >70% passing -2 mm.
 
  · A sample was riffle split, and 250 g was pulverized to >85% passing 75 µm.
 
 ·Gold assay values were determined by fire assay with atomic absorption spectroscopy finish (FA-AAS) using a 30 g nominal sample.  The
detection range for gold is 0.005 ppm to 10 ppm Au.
· The sample was dried at 110°C.
Page 11-5
·Ore-grade copper and molybdenum were analyzed by four-acid digestion using conventional ICP-AAS.  A prepared sample was digested
with nitric, perchloric, hydrofluoric, and hydrochloric acids.  Detection limits are 0.001% to 40% for copper, and 0.001% to 10% for
molybdenum.
·Multi-element analyses of the samples targeted a suite of 51 elements determined by ICP-AES and mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) techniques
after aqua regia digestion.
·Blue Hill samples within the oxide and mixed zones were further analyzed for leachable copper for those pulps with returning values >0.1%
TCu.  Samples were assayed using a 5% sulphuric acid leach followed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Cu-AA05 procedure).  The
copper detection limits with this procedure are 0.001% to 10% Cu.
Entrée Gold – Skyline Samples (July 2011 to May 2012)
·Pulps and rejects were periodically returned to Entrée by laboratory personnel for storage in their secure facility in Yerington.
 
11.4.3
 
Starting in mid-July 2011, and continuing to May 2012, Skyline Assayers and Laboratories (Skyline) was designated as the primary laboratory
for the Ann Mason project.  Skyline is a well-known Tucson-based laboratory that specializes in providing analytical services to the copper
industry in the southwest U.S.A.  During the period of the Ann Mason core drilling, Skyline operated a sample preparation facility in Battle
Mountain,  Nevada,  where  Entrée’s  samples  were  shipped.    Sample  analyses  were  completed  at  Skyline’s  laboratory  facility  in  Tucson,
AZ.  Samples sent to Skyline from the Ann Mason deposit are from core drill holes EG-AM-11-011, and EG-AM-11-013 to EG-AM-11-030, as
well  as  quarter-core  samples  from  Entrée’s  recent  historical  core  resampling  program  (Section  11.5.2).    Samples  submitted  to  Skyline
included  92  batches,  totalling  9,150  regular  core  samples,  and  6,142  quarter-core  samples  from  historical  core;  these  batches  were
accompanied  by  2,671  regular  QC  samples.    Samples  from  one  peripheral  Blue  Hill  hole,  EG-BH-031,  were  also  submitted  to  Skyline;
however, this hole is not part of the current Blue Hill resource estimate.
 
Samples were prepared and analyzed as follows:
 
 
 
  · The entire sample was crushed to >75% -10 mesh.
 
  · A split of 250 to 300 g was pulverized with hardened steel to >95% -150 mesh.
 
 ·Gold assay values were determined by FA-AAS) using a 30 g nominal sample (Skyline code FA-1).  The detection range for gold is 5–3,000
ppb Au.
· The sample was dried.
·Ore grade copper and molybdenum were further analyzed by a four-acid digestion, inductively coupled plasma (ICP-OES) technique
(Skyline code CuMo-MEA).  Lower detection limits are 0.01% for copper, and 0.001% for molybdenum.
Page 11-6
·Multi-element analyses of the samples targetted a suite of 49 elements determined by an ICP-MS technique (Skyline code TE-3) that uses
an aqua regia digestion (for samples submitted until late September 2011, up to drill hole EG-AM-11-16).  On September 29, 2011, the multi-
element analysis method was switched to an ICP-OES technique (Skyline code TE-4), which uses a four-acid digestion and targets a suite
of 24 trace elements, including copper, molybdenum, and silver.
·Starting with the latter portion of drill hole EG-AM-028 (March, 2012), and continuing through EG-AM-29 and 30, silver was further analyzed
by a fire assay method (Skyline code FA-08).
PacMag (2006)
Core Re-Assaying Programs
·Pulps and rejects were periodically returned to Entrée by laboratory personnel for storage in their secure facility in Yerington.
 
11.5
 
11.5.1
 
In 2006, PacMag conducted a check assay program for copper and molybdenum values at the Ann Mason deposit.  The following is an
extract of the core re-assay program from Clifford (2006), intended to provide a basis for confidence in using the historical data from Anaconda
for resource estimation purposes.
 
A drill core resampling program of 23 drill holes was completed by PacMag to assess the validity of the previous Anaconda (CMS) composite
analyses.  Limited metadata was available to PacMag on the sampling and analysis method used by Anaconda for the broad composites, but
it is assumed that the composites were pulp or coarse rejects from the original 3 ft core samples re-analysed for Cu, Mo, S and Au by Atomic
Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS).
 
A  total  of  1,505  new  samples,  collected  by  PacMag,  covered  137  Anaconda  composite  samples,  or  approximately  12,356  ft  of  drill
core.  These samples were analyzed for molybdenum, and represent greater than 10% of the total core drilled by Anaconda.
 
For  each  of  the  137  Anaconda  composite  samples,  an  equivalent  weighted  average  molybdenum  grade  was  calculated  for  the  PacMag
assay values.  The length of the composite samples versus those calculated from the PacMag samples has an average difference of 0 ft, with
a maximum difference of 20.4 ft.
 
The  average  grade  of  length-weighted  PacMag  samples  versus  those  of  Anaconda  shows  no  significant  difference,  with  a  total  average
grade of 92 ppm Mo and 89 ppm Mo, respectively.  X-Y scatter plots show a modest scatter of results indicating fair repeatability, interpreted to
reflect the coarse grained nature of the molybdenite as disseminated blebs and veins.
Page 11-7
Although PacMag also assayed for copper and a multi-element ICP package, documents provided to Entrée did not include an evaluation of
the copper grades from the Anaconda sampling versus PacMag resampling.  Therefore, Entrée analyzed the results by reduction to major
axis (RMA) plots (Figure 11-1), which, once significant outliers are removed, indicated a reasonably good fit for copper.  This is reflected in a
high value of the coefficient of determination R2 for copper (0.929), and an acceptable bias figure of 4.9%.  However, when the four highest-
grade copper values are removed from the historical database (original Anaconda values >3% Cu), the bias drops to 2.1%, which suggests
that the bias is influenced by a few, very high-grade samples.  During resource estimation, a capping strategy was applied, so that high grade
values (>2% Cu) are subjected to a volume restriction.  Grades above this threshold are only allowed to be projected 40 m (Section 14.1.3),
which minimizes any potential influence of this bias.
 
Table 11-1 shows the results of the RMA statistics for all data, while Table 11-2 and
 
Figure 11-1, overleaf, show the statistics with the outliers removed.  Table 11-3 shows the outlier statistics with the >3% Cu grades removed
from the historical database.
 
The PacMag check sample batches included copper, gold, and molybdenum standards, which did not show any significant bias.

PacMag Resampling of Anaconda Core (Cu RMA Plot, Outliers Removed)
Figure 11-1:
 
 
11.5.2
 
In January 2012, Entrée initiated a program of resampling and assaying 13,750 m of historical Anaconda core (6,142 samples) collected from
44 historical drill holes.  This included additional core from 19 of the 23 drill holes partially resampled by PacMag in 2006, and core from 25
complete holes selected by Entrée, in order to provide more uniform coverage within the deposit.  These assays have provided a larger
database  of  molybdenum,  gold,  and  silver  values  for  the  resource  estimate,  and  a  more  thorough  comparison  of  historical  copper
values.  Original sample lengths by Anaconda average around 1.16 m; therefore, Entrée combined every two Anaconda samples into one
Entrée sample (average length 2.24 m).
 
The samples had the same preparation, analytical, and QC procedures applied to them as are described in Sections 11.2.2 and 11.4.3.
 
Entrée analyzed the results by RMA plots (Figure 11-2) which, once significant outliers were removed, indicated a reasonably good fit for
copper.  This is reflected in a high value of the coefficient of determination R2 for copper (0.875), and a low bias figure of 1.0%.

this report, and therefore only 6,061 out of 6,142 total pairs were compared.
 
The Entrée check sample batches included copper, gold, and molybdenum standards, which did not show any significant bias.

Bulk Density Sampling (Entrée 2011 to Present)
11.6
 
Dry  bulk  density  measurements  were  completed  by  Entrée  on  drill  core  at  both  Ann  Mason  (4,181  samples)  and  Blue  Hill  (411
samples).  Entrée tested all the samples in the field during 2011 and 2012, using a wax-coated immersion procedure.  The procedure is
summarized as follows:
 
  · samples consist of 10 cm to 15 cm long core pieces
 
 ·sample is oven-dried at 100°C for about one hour to remove any remnant moisture
 
 ·oven dried sample is weighed in air with a 0.1 g precision balance (A, or dry weight in air)
 
 ·sample is well coated with a thin layer of molten paraffin with density dpar (0.82 g/cm3), and weighed in air (B, or coated weight)
 
 ·sample is weighed on a submerged plate, completely covered by water (C, or submerged weight).
 
With this method, the bulk density (d) was calculated as follows:
d = A/{B - C-[(B-A)/dpar]}
Table 11-6  and Table 11-7 summarize the results of the bulk density determinations for the Ann Mason deposit and Blue Hill prospect,
respectively.  The total range of mean values by rock type at Ann Mason is between 2.08 and 2.73 g/cm3.  At Blue Hill, these range between
2.25 and 2.83 g/cm3.
 
Results at Blue Hill were further subdivided to look at the rock types within the oxide, mixed, and sulphide mineralized domains.  There is an
increasing trend with depth through the oxide and mixed zones, with bulk density values ranging as shown below.  The density value for the
waste material is similar to that of the sulphide mineralized rock and is also shown below:
 
  · Oxide: 2.33 to 2.63 g/cm3 (average 2.55 g/cm3)
 
  · Mixed: 2.44 to 2.63 g/cm3 (average 2.56 g/cm3)
 
  · Sulphide: 2.30 to 2.82 g/cm3 (average 2.62 g/cm3)
 
  · Waste: 2.14 to 2.89 g/cm3 (average 2.61 g/cm3).

On January 30, 2012, Entrée submitted to ALS in Reno, Nevada, a suite of 30 rock samples for independent bulk density checks.   The
samples tested by ALS were not the same pieces used by Entrée, due to the residual wax coating remaining on original samples; instead, an
adjacent sample from the same lithology and alteration type was used.  ALS used a similar wax immersion technique, and the results showed
a reasonable correlation with no significant bias noted between the two sets of results.
 
The Qualified Persons are of the opinion that the bulk dry density measurements at the sample spacing and testing quality performed by
Entrée are acceptable for use in resource estimation.

QA/QC Programs
PacMag (2006–2008)
Entrée Gold, Ann Mason Deposit (ALS Chemex), Dec. 2010–Jul. 2011)
11.7.1
 
PacMag had a minimal QA/QC program in place during all of their sampling, including for RC and core drilling, and their historical core
resampling.  One of four different standards was randomly inserted for every 50 regular samples.  PacMag purchased commercially available
standards from Geostats in Australia, with certified grades of copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver reflecting the general range of expected
results within the deposit.
 
On receipt of each batch of analytical results, the grades of the reference standards were assessed against the expected values.  A statistical
analysis of the precision and accuracy of the standards was completed, and no inherent issues were reported.
 
11.7.2
 
Entrée established a thorough QA/QC program at the start of exploration in 2010.  Although RC drilling was used to pre-collar many of the
holes that were collared in the volcanic, few samples were collected, and therefore RC sampling methods were not considered in the QC
review.  The generalized core drilling QC protocols are as follows:
 
For diamond drilling:
 
  · quarter-core field duplicate samples (1 for every 30 samples)
 
 
 
  · certified Cu±Mo, Au, Ag standards (1 for every 30 samples).
 
ALS in Reno, Nevada, was designated as the primary lab between December 20, 2010, and August 21, 2011 (core drill holes EG-AM-10-001
to EG-AM-11-010, and EG-AM-11-012).
 
Table 11-8 summarizes the QC samples applied to the ALS samples over this period.

Methods of Reviewing QC Results
 
Upon receipt of the assay data from the laboratory, a series of QA/QC evaluation procedures were undertaken by Entrée, and any failures
investigated and recorded.  These evaluation procedures included:
 
  · Max-Min plots (to evaluate duplicate samples):
 
 The results for the duplicate samples were plotted on modified scatter diagrams (max-min plots) to compare the differences between pairs to
the expected error limit for duplicates of this type.  Duplicate pair assays were plotted such that the minimum of each pair was the X value
and the maximum was the Y value.  The pair error shows as the distance between the point and the X-Y line.  A curve was also plotted on
this graph, which for twin samples and RC field duplicates represented a relative error of 30%; for coarse duplicates, this represented a
relative error of 20%; and for pulp duplicates, it represented a relative error of 10%.  This curve was derived from a hyperbolic function, which
allows for a greater error tolerance near the detection limit.  The degree of this allowance was determined from the labs’ stated detection
limits.  Points plotting above the red hyperbolic error line were considered out-of-specification (OOS) pairs.  The protocol for duplicates calls
for no more than 10% OOS samples.
 
 
 
 Packets of reference standards were sent to the laboratory at a rate of approximately one for every 30 samples.  The results were plotted in
chronological order on graphs depicting the mean grade of the standards being reviewed, as well as plus and minus two and three times the
standard deviation of the dataset, and a moving average of the mean.  This provided a check of the precision of the assays.  Two or more
· Control Charts (to evaluate standards)
consecutive results outside two standard deviations, or one result outside of three standard deviations from the mean, generally triggered a
request to redo the standard and two or three samples before and after the standard in the sample stream.  This occurred a few times
throughout the program, resulting in a few adjustments in standard grades, but no significant database adjustments.  Once the precision of
the standard was acceptable, the reference standards’ results were compared against the certified grade or “best value” (BV), ± (5% +
manufacturer’s tolerance limit), in order to check the accuracy of the assays.  This generated a positive or negative bias value as compared to
the BV.  The following criteria were used to evaluate the accuracy of the standard:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 11-14
unacceptable: >±10% bias.
reasonable = ±5–10% bias
-
-
-
good = 0 to ±5% bias
· Blank versus Preceding Sample Plots (to evaluate coarse and pulp blanks):
 
 These scatter plots show the grade of the preceding sample along the X-axis and the grade of the blank along the Y-Axis.  A blank failure
value was generally set at five times the lower detection for each element reviewed.  Samples above this threshold were considered as
potential contamination events.
 
  · RMA Plots (to evaluate check samples)
 
 The RMA plots were X-Y scatter plots that provided an unbiased fit of the data between two sets of assay results.  The RMA calculations
assumed that both sets of results were independent.
 
Core Twin Samples
 
Core twins were evaluated using max-min plots for copper, gold, silver, and molybdenum; the results are summarized in Table 11-9, and the
results for copper are shown in
 
Figure 11-3.  An acceptable number of failures occurred for all of the elements, some of which may represent sample mix-ups bearing further
investigation.  The results of the twin samples were considered within the acceptable range for all the studied elements (at least 90% of the
sample pairs should plot within the failure limits, evaluated for a maximum relative error of 30%).  In summary, the core and RC sampling
variance is considered to be within acceptable limits.  Same batch coarse duplicates and pulp duplicates were not included as part of the
initial QA/QC program for assays submitted to ALS.

Blanks
 
In total, 208 blank samples were processed for each of the four main elements, accounting for a 3.4% insertion rate.  It should be noted that a
portion of the blanks correspond to the insertion of construction sand (as fine blanks), and the remainder were coarse blank material (coarse
crushed landscaping rock).  The sterile nature of the coarse blank was verified by submitting 40 samples of the blanks to Skyline Lab.  All
samples returned values either below the detection levels or occasionally at or near the detection levels for copper, molybdenum, gold, and
silver.
 
Coarse/fine blank sample plots were prepared for all studied elements.  A few minor potential cross-contamination events during preparation
were identified for copper, gold, silver, and molybdenum.  The failure criteria were set as 5 times the detection levels.  After reviewing the
preceding  sample  grades,  only  a  portion  of  these  failures  remain  as  possible  contamination  events,  while  the  remaining  failures  can  be
discarded as low-level contamination events or outliers.
Standard Reference Material
 
In total, 216 standard reference materials (SRMs) were processed by ALS, accounting for a 3.5% insertion rate.  Most of the SRMs (207) were
commercially available standards, purchased at CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. (CDN) in Langley, BC (Table 11-10), while the remaining
nine were custom prepared SRMs that replaced the CDN SRMs near the end of the ALS program.  Actual grades of the custom standards are
not reported as this time in order to maintain the blind nature of the standards for ongoing sampling programs.  Grades for the elements of
interest cover a range of high-, mid-, and low-grades typical for the Ann Mason deposit.  Approximately half of the CDN SRMs did not include
certified values for molybdenum, and only one included a provisional silver value.

use, therefore their certified grades are not reported here.
Control charts were prepared for every element and for the respective certified element for each SRM.  Note that some of the standards only
included a few sample submissions, precluding a statistically meaningful evaluation of the results.
 
Based on the criteria discussed previously, no failures were identified for copper, silver, or molybdenum, and only two failures were reported
for gold (Table 11-11).
 
All copper, molybdenum, and silver standards returned acceptable levels of bias
 
(Table 11-11), except for standard CDN-CM-5, which returned an unacceptable (17.2%) bias for gold; however, this was only based on three
samples.  The gold value for this standard may have been mislabelled, and it should not be used in future.  Eleven of the 12 standards with
certified molybdenum values returned negative bias values.  Although these are considered reasonable and can be accepted, it is worth
investigating to see whether a calibration issue exists at the lab.

Conclusions on ALS Sampling Campaign
 
In general, the QC data processing from ALS indicated acceptable results:
 
 ·The QC insertion rate was slightly lower than ideal; however, this was subsequently increased, starting in August 2011, coinciding with the
switch to Skyline Labs.
·Twin sample data indicates that sampling variances are within acceptable ranges.  No coarse or pulp duplicate samples were collected,
therefore a conclusion cannot be reached regarding sub-sampling and analytical variances.  These have been initiated for the Skyline
submissions.
·Indications of some minor potential cross-contamination during preparation and/or assaying have been detected and need to be
investigated.
·The standard insertions indicated that analytical accuracy for copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver was within acceptable ranges, apart
from one gold standard (CDN-CM-5).  Analytical accuracy for molybdenum is acceptable; however, most of the standards are biased slightly
low, which may indicate some minor analytical or calibration issues at the lab.
·A few potential sample mix-ups remain to be investigated.  These mix-ups may have taken place on site, while labelling the samples or
while introducing the data into the database, or at the lab, during preparation or assaying.  All of these possibilities should be
considered.  The lab should be warned about the possibility that a mix-up may have occurred.

  2 RC field duplicates samples: Cu 118, Au 89, Ag 89, Mo 35.
  3 Coarse blanks: Cu 154, Mo 154, Au 112, Ag 112.
 
QC data was processed using the same techniques described in Section 11.7.2.
 
Core Twin Samples
 
Depending on the element, between 24 and 41 twin sample pairs were reviewed, accounting for a 2.0% to 3.4% insertion rate.  Max-min plots
were prepared for copper, gold, silver, and molybdenum.  The failure rates ranged between 0% for gold and 25% for silver.  The copper failure
rate was 14.6%.  The results of the gold and molybdenum twin samples were considered within the acceptable range for all the studied
elements (at least 90% of the sample pairs should plot within the failure limits, evaluated for a maximum relative error of 30%).  The copper
results  were  higher  than  the  generally  accepted  limits  (10%  error  rate);  however,  several  of  the  failures  were  at  very  low  grades  and/or
occurred very close to the failure line, and can therefore be accepted.  Silver values were much higher than acceptable limits; however, the
grades were very low and close to the practical detection limits for silver, where the labs ability to replicate values is inconsistent.
 
 
Page 11-20
In summary, the core sampling variances for copper, gold, and molybdenum were considered to be within acceptable limits.
 
RC Field Duplicates
 
Depending on the element, between 35 and 118 RC field duplicate pairs were reviewed, accounting for a 1.4% to 4.6% insertion rate.  Max-
min plots were prepared for copper, gold, silver, and molybdenum.  The failure rates ranged between 0% for gold and molybdenum and 2.5%
for copper.  The results of the RC field duplicate samples were considered within the acceptable range for all the studied elements (at least
90% of the sample pairs should plot within the failure limits, evaluated for a maximum relative error of 30%).  The RC sampling variance was
within acceptable limits for all elements.
 
Coarse Blanks/Fine Blanks
 
In total, 154 coarse/fine blank samples were processed, accounting for a 4.1% insertion rate.  Copper and molybdenum were analyzed for
each of the 154 blanks; however, gold and silver were only analyzed for 112 samples (3.0% insertion rate), since Blue Hill drill holes targeting
the  oxide  zone  were  not  analyzed  for  these  elements.    It  should  be  noted  that  a  portion  of  the  blanks  correspond  to  the  insertion  of
construction sand (as fine blanks), and the remainder were coarse blank material (coarse crushed landscaping rock).  The switch from fine to
coarse blanks occurred on June 25, 2011, (assay batch RE11097800).  For the purposes of this review, all blanks were processed together;
however, upon review of the data, there was a minor change in background level for each of the four elements (copper, molybdenum, and
silver increased; gold decreased), corresponding with the date the blank source was changed.
 
The  sterile  nature  of  the  fine  (sand)  blank  was  not  independently  verified.    The  coarse  blank  was  verified  by  submitting  40  samples  to
Skyline.  All samples returned values either below the detection levels or occasionally at or near the detection levels for copper (0.01%),
molybdenum (0.001%), gold (0.005 g/t), and silver (0.1 g/t) (refer to certificate BOG021, October 21, 2011).
 
Coarse/fine blank sample plots were prepared for all studied elements.  The failure criterion was set as five times the detection level.  After
reviewing  the  preceding  sample  grades,  only  one  of  the  failures  for  copper  remains  as  a  possible  contamination  event  bearing  further
investigation.  The remaining failures can be discarded as low-level contamination events or outliers.  Many of the gold and silver failures
prior to June 25, 2011, may be a result of original contamination within the sand blank.  Since the source of the blank has been changed, no
action is required for these.
 
SRMs
 
In  total,  130  SRM  (standards)  samples  were  processed,  accounting  for  a  3.5%  insertion  rate.    Each  SRM  was  a  commercially  available
standard purchased at CDN.  Many of the standards were only for copper and gold, and did not include certified values for molybdenum.  Only
one included a provisional silver value.  Control charts were prepared for every element and for each SRM.  Note that some of the standards
only included a few sample submissions, precluding a statistically meaningful evaluation of the results.  The following criteria were used to
evaluate the accuracy of the standards:
 
 
Page 11-21
·
·
reasonable = ±5–10% bias
good = <±5% bias
· unacceptable: >±10% bias.
All copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver standards returned acceptable (good) levels of bias, except for molybdenum in standard CDN-CM-
8, which returned a reasonable bias.  It should be noted that all five of the standards with molybdenum-certified values returned negative bias
values, ranging from -0.5% to -8.0%.  Although these are considered good to reasonable and can be accepted for resource estimation, it is
worth contacting the lab and determining why there appears to be a low, but systemic bias.
 
Samples  were  flagged  as  being  failures  if  two  consecutive  samples  plotted  outside  of  the  average  ±2  standard  deviation  range,  or  one
sample outside of the average grade ±3 standard deviation range.  No failures were identified for any of the four main elements.
 
Conclusions and Recommendations
 
In general, the Blue Hill QC data processing at ALS indicated acceptable results.
 
 ·The QC insertion rate was slightly lower than ideal.  However, this was subsequently increased in August 2011, coinciding with the switch to
Skyline Labs.
·RC field duplicate data indicated that sampling variances were within acceptable ranges.
 
 ·Core twin sample data indicated a slightly higher than acceptable failure rate; however, several of the failures were very low grade and close
to the failure line, and can be accepted.  During future drilling, the geologist should ensure that a core cutting guide line is marked on the
core using a grease pen, and, in areas of coarse mineralization with a potential high nugget effect, the core should be rotated to determine
the cutting line that will result in the most representative split.
·No coarse or pulp duplicate samples were collected, and therefore a conclusion cannot be reached regarding sub-sampling and analytical
variances.  These have been initiated for the Skyline submissions.
·Only one indication of potential cross-contamination during preparation and/or assaying has been detected and needs to be
investigated.  For future batches, a pulp blank should accompany the coarse blank (inserted immediately before it), to determine whether
sample contamination is occurring at the pulverization and analysis stage.  When possible, the core logging geologist should attempt to
insert the two blanks immediately following a high-grade sample.
Page 11-22
·The standard insertions indicated that analytical accuracy for copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver is generally very good and within
acceptable ranges.  Analytical accuracy for molybdenum is acceptable; however, all of the standards are biased slightly low, which may
indicate some minor analytical or calibration issues at the lab.
·A few potential sample mix-ups remain to be investigated.  These mix-ups may have taken place on site, while labeling the samples or while
introducing the data into the database, or at the lab, during preparation or assaying.  All of these possibilities should be considered.  The lab
should be warned about the possibility that a mix-up may have occurred.
The sample batches discussed in this section can be accepted and used for resource estimation purposes.

11.8.4.  QC data was processed using the same techniques described in Section 11.7.2.
 
Core Twins
 
Core twin samples were evaluated using max-min plots for copper, gold, silver, and molybdenum, and the results are summarized in Table
11-14.  The copper plot for the twin samples is shown in Figure 11-5.  Results of the copper, gold, silver, and molybdenum twin samples were
considered within the acceptable range for all the studied elements (at least 90% of the sample pairs should plot within the failure limits,
evaluated for a maximum relative error of 30%).  In summary, the core sampling variance was considered to be within acceptable limits.

Coarse Duplicates
 
Coarse duplicates consisted of splits from the reject crushed material taken at the laboratory.  There were 277 of these control samples taken
during the course of the drilling and historical core resampling program.  The coarse duplicates were run at the primary laboratory.  The
results are summarized on Table 11-14 and were plotted on relative difference plots, similar to that depicted in Figure 11-6.
Page 11-25
Example Relative Error Diagram – Coarse Duplicates
Figure 11-6:
 
 
The principal difference between this diagram and the twin sample plot is that the error tolerance is reduced to 20%, owing to the fact that the
reject material should be more homogeneous than intact core.
 
Results  of  the  copper,  gold,  silver,  and  molybdenum  coarse  duplicates  were  considered  within  the  acceptable  range  for  all  the  studied
elements (at least 90% of the sample pairs should plot within the failure limits, evaluated for a maximum relative error of 20%).  In summary,
the coarse duplicate sampling variance is considered to be within acceptable limits.
 
Pulp Duplicates
 
Pulp duplicates were taken as splits from the original pulverized subsample and submitted to the primary laboratory for analysis.  A total of
261  duplicate  pulps  were  collected  over  the  course  of  the  drill  and  historical  core  resampling  program  for  those  samples  submitted  to
Skyline.  The paired duplicates were plotted on relative difference charts and scatter diagrams to look for excessive deviations or signs of bias
(Figure 11-7), and the results
 
(Table 11-14) were also used to generate estimates of the practical detection limit.  The tolerance limit for pulp duplicates was established as
10%.
 
 
Page 11-26
Example Relative Error Diagram – Pulp Duplicates
Figure 11-7:
 
 
The higher number of failures for the pulp duplicates compared to that for the coarse duplicates and core twins may be due to an increased
number  of  sample  mix-ups,  either  by  Entrée  during  the  process  of  inserting  and  organizing  the  various  types  of  pulp  control  samples
(standards,  pulp  blanks,  pulp  duplicates,  and  database  inputs),  or  mix-ups  that  occurred  at  Skyline.    Even  so,  the  error  rates  for  copper,
molybdenum, gold, and silver were within the acceptable limits.
 
Blanks
 
Coarse blank material was inserted into the sample stream at a rate of approximately one for every 17 samples.  The blank reference material
was coarse crushed landscaping rock purchased by Entrée from a local building supply shop.  When possible, the blanks were deliberately
inserted following high-grade samples, in order to check for evidence of contamination resulting from improper laboratory procedures.  During
the course of the program, 879 coarse blanks were sent to the laboratory.
 
The results were plotted in chronological order on graphs to look for OOS results, and also on “blank versus preceding sample” charts.  The
protocol was established that any sample which returned a value greater than five times the detection limit was designated as a possible
contamination  event  and  was  further  reviewed.    Few  samples  were  so  designated,  indicating  that  the  assays  were  likely  free  of  cross-
contamination.
 
 
Page 11-27
Reference Standards
 
Prior to August 22, 2011, Entrée was using a selection of commercially prepared standards purchased from CDN, but subsequently switched
to a suite of six custom prepared standards.  The custom standards (AM-1 to AM-6) were prepared by CDN labs using Ann Mason sulphide
mineralized rock.  The new standards include certified values for copper and molybdenum, and mostly provisional or indicated values for gold
and silver.  Grades for the elements of interest cover a range of high, mid, and low grades typical for the Ann Mason deposit.  Actual grades
are not reported as this time in order to maintain the blind nature of the standards for ongoing sampling programs.
 
Packets  of  reference  standards  were  sent  to  the  laboratory  at  a  rate  of  about  three  for  every  50  samples.    The  results  were  plotted  in
chronological  order  on  graphs  (as  described  in  Section  11.7.2)  in  order  to  complete  a  check  of  the  precision  and  accuracy  of  the
standards.  The number of failures per standard is reported in Table 11-15.  All four elements show good precision for each standard, with a
few failures remaining in the database.  These isolated failures remain to be further investigated to determine whether they are sample mix-
ups or analytical issues.
 
The  reference  standards  results  were  also  plotted  against  the  BV  ±  (5%  +  manufacturer’s  tolerance  limit)  criteria  in  order  to  check  the
accuracy of the assays (Table 11-15).  All copper standards returned acceptable levels of bias, and only one molybdenum standard returned
an unacceptable bias (AM-5); however, this is mainly influenced by a single, high molybdenum standard outlier.  Accuracy of gold values
were  either  acceptable  or,  in  one  case,  just  above  the  upper  limit.    All  silver  standards  returned  very  consistent  negative  bias  values,
indicating poor silver analytical accuracy by Skyline.  Silver grades are biased low (between -14.9% and -26.7%, averaging -20%), and this
could reflect a calibration issue at the lab.  The bias was further confirmed through a recent check assay program at ACME (Section 11.8.4),
which revealed a -13.4% bias between ACME and Skyline silver assays.  Entrée will need to investigate this further to determine what action
may be needed during future programs.

Conclusions on Skyline Sampling Campaign
 
In general, the processing of QC data from Skyline indicated acceptable results.
 
  · The QC insertion rate (17.4%) was good.
 
 ·Twin samples and coarse duplicates for copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver indicated that sampling variances for each of these duplicate
types was within acceptable ranges.
·Coarse blanks did not reveal any significant potential cross-contamination events during preparation and/or assaying.
 
 ·The standard insertions indicated that analytical accuracy for Cu, Mo, and Au were within acceptable ranges, except for one gold standard
(AM-1, 12.6% bias) and one molybdenum standard (AM-5, 17.2% bias).  Analytical accuracy for silver was unacceptable (bias levels ranging
from -14.9 to -26.7 for all six standards).  Silver assaying will need to be investigated during the next phase of work.  A few outliers remain to
be investigated for all four elements.
·The sample batches processed by Skyline can be accepted and used for resource estimation purposes.

Check Samples
11.8
 
Entrée has initiated several check assay programs that involve sending additional splits of the pulp reject material either back to the same
laboratory at a later date, or to a secondary laboratory, as a check on the primary laboratory.  These check assay programs are described
below.
 
11.8.1
 
Since same-batch pulp duplicates were not included as part of the original QC program for batches sent to ALS, Entrée initiated a program of
randomly selected, same-lab check assays in October 2011, after the original assays were completed.  This included 316 pulp samples re-
assayed for copper and molybdenum.  The original samples were collected from drill holes EG-AM-10-001 to 11-010 and EG-AM-11-12,
drilled between November 2010 and July 2011.  The sample batches included nine standards; therefore, the shipment included 307 check
samples (representing 5% of the samples included in the regular submission batches).
 
The results were analyzed by RMA plots, which indicated a good fit for both copper and molybdenum between the different submission dates
to ALS.  This was reflected in high values of the coefficient of determination R2 (for Cu, 0.997; for Mo, 0.990), and acceptable bias figures (for
Same Lab Check Assays (Ann Mason)
Cu, 0.5%; for Mo, -0.7%).  Nine outliers were identified for copper, with none identified for molybdenum (Table 11-16; Figure 11-9).
 
The check sample batches included nine standards to assess analytical accuracy at ALS.  No outliers were detected for any of the standards
for either copper or molybdenum.  All copper standards yielded acceptable accuracies, with bias ranging from 0.7% to -2.1%.  Molybdenum
bias levels were consistently negative, but acceptable, ranging from -3.1% to -6.7%.  The molybdenum bias levels are consistent with those
from results of the review of the regular QC insertions during the period when ALS was the primary lab (Dec. 2010–July 2011).

ALS-Skyline Check Assays (Ann Mason)
Figure 11-9:
 
 
11.8.2
 
A  total  of  114  samples  originally  assayed  at  ALS  between  May  2011  and  July  2011  were  sent  for  check  assays  at  Skyline  in  Tucson,
Arizona.  The original samples were collected from drill holes EG-AM-11-007 to 11-010, drilled between April and June 2011; Entrée initiated
a program of random pulp resampling from these holes in September 2011.
 
The  results  were  analyzed  by  RMA  plots,  which  indicated  a  reasonably  good  fit  for  copper,  molybdenum,  and  gold  between  ALS  and
Skyline.  This was reflected in high values of the coefficient of determination R2 (for Cu, 0.997; for Mo, 0.993; and for Au, 0.987).  Silver had a
slightly lower R2 (0.946), possibly due to the different assay methods being used between the two labs.  Bias figures were acceptable (5.5%
for Cu, -6.8% for Au).  The bias figure for molybdenum (-0.4%) was very good.  The bias level for silver (27.1%) was unacceptable, and could
reflect the persistent negative bias in Skyline’s silver assays (Table 11-15).  Table 11-17 shows the results of the RMA statistics for all data,
while Table 11-18 and Figure 11-10 shows the results with the outliers removed.
 
The  check  sample  batches  did  not  include  any  standards,  duplicates,  or  blanks,  and  therefore  no  conclusion  can  be  reached  regarding
analytical accuracy or precision or potential contamination.

ALS-ACME Check Assays (Blue Hill)
A total of 188 randomly selected samples, originally assayed at ALS between September 2010 and July 2011, were sent for check assays at
ACME  in  Vancouver  in  February  2012.    This  represents  about  5%  of  the  samples  included  in  the  regular  ALS  Blue  Hill  submission
batches.  The original samples were all collected from the Blue Hill deposit, from drill holes EG-BH-10-001 to 11-030, which were drilled
during  2010  and  2011.    The  check  assay  sample  batches  included  11  standards,  12  pulp  blanks,  and  10  pulp  duplicates;  the  shipment
therefore included a total of 221 samples.  Not all of the original Blue Hill samples in the oxide zone were analyzed for gold; therefore, check
assays for this element only consisted of 118 samples.
 
 
Page 11-32
The results were analyzed by RMA plots, which indicated a very good fit for copper and molybdenum, and a reasonable fit for gold, between
ALS and ACME.  This was reflected in high values of the coefficient of determination R2 (for Cu, 0.999; for Mo, 0.991; and for Au, 0.784).  The
analytical method that ACME used for silver has a detection limit that is higher than the general range of silver grades at Ann Mason, and
therefore no comparison was done with ALS silver values.  Bias figures (0.8% for Cu, -4.0 for Mo, and 3.1% for Au) were good.  Table 11-19
shows the results of the RMA statistics for all data, while Table 11-20 shows the statistics with the outliers removed.  Four outliers were
identified for copper, two for molybdenum, and seven for gold (Table 11-20, Figure 11-11).
 
The check sample batches included 11 standards (3 separate standards for copper, molybdenum, and gold) to assess analytical accuracy at
ACME.    No  outliers  were  detected  for  any  of  the  standards,  and  all  standards  yielded  acceptable  accuracies.    No  significant  potential
contamination was noted for copper or molybdenum; however, two failures were noted for gold and are currently being investigated.  All
duplicates returned acceptable values.
 
Included in the batch of external duplicates were 11 sieve checks designed to test the quoted pulverization protocols by ALS (85% passing -
200 mesh).  The average result of the eleven checks was 94% passing -200 mesh, and no samples failed the passing criteria.

Skyline-ACME Check Assays (Ann Mason)
Cu in ACME Check Samples – Blue Hill Samples (Outliers Excluded)
Figure 11-11:
 
 
11.8.4
 
A batch of randomly selected pulp samples, originally assayed at Skyline between July 2011 and May 2012, was sent for check assays at
ACME in Vancouver in August 2012.  The original samples (751 pulps) were all collected from the Ann Mason Deposit, from Entrée drill holes
EG-AM-11-011  and  EG-AM-11-013  to  EG-AM-11-030,  drilled  during  2011  and  2012,  and  from  the  recent  historical  core  re-assaying
program.  The sample batches also included 44 standards, 44 pulp blanks, and 44 pulp duplicates; therefore, the total shipment included 883
samples.  The 751 pulps represent about 4.9% of the samples included in the regular submission batches to Skyline.
 
The results were analyzed by RMA plots, which, after outliers were removed, indicated a very good fit for copper, molybdenum, gold, and
silver between Skyline and ACME.  This is reflected in high values of the coefficient of determination R2 (for copper: 0.995; for molybdenum:
0.988; for gold: 0.952 and for silver: 0.832).  Bias figures (for copper, -0.1%; for molybdenum, -3.2; and for gold, -1.0%) are good.  The bias for
silver is much higher (-13.4%), and could reflect assaying or calibration issues at Skyline (Section 11.7.4).  Table 11-21 shows the results of
the RMA statistics with the outliers removed.  Figure 11-12 shows an RMA plot for copper with the outliers removed.

RMA Plot – ACME vs. Skyline, Copper
Figure 11-12:
 
 
The  check  sample  batches  included  44  standards  (three  separate  standards,  AM-2,  AM-5,  AM-6)  to  assess  analytical  accuracy  at
ACME.    One  outlier  was  detected  for  silver  in  Standard  AM-2,  but  none  were  detected  for  any  of  the  remaining  standards  for  copper,
molybdenum or gold.  All standards yielded acceptable accuracies (<10%).  No significant potential contamination was noted for copper,
molybdenum, gold, or silver.  All duplicates returned acceptable values.
 
As part of the check assay program, Entrée requested that ACME check the quoted pulverization protocols of Skyline lab (95% passing -150
mesh) by completing sieve checks on approximately 5% of the pulps submitted.  The results showed that the pulps were pulverized to grain
sizes  ranging  from  62%  passing  -150  mesh  to  98%  passing  -150  mesh.    Although  the  stated  protocols  by  Skyline  are  probably  more
aggressive than labs can typically achieve on a regular basis, only 10 out of 34 pulps tested matched or exceeded Skyline’s protocols.  The
average value achieved was 84% passing -150 mesh, which is probably still a reasonable average pulverization size.  However, Skyline
should be notified regarding the pulverization protocols not being met.

QA/QC Program Review

Data Verification
Data Verification (Ann Mason)

12.1
 
12.1.1
 
Scott Jackson has reviewed the QA/QC program used by Entrée for sampling at the Ann Mason deposit and is of the opinion that it is in
accordance  with  standard  industry  practice  and  CIM  Exploration  Best  Practice  Guidelines.    Entrée  personnel  have  taken  all  reasonable
measures to ensure that the sampling completed to date is accurate and precise.
 
12.1.2
 
In July 2012, Entrée initiated a program of database double data entry to validate the historical recorded assay data at the Ann Mason deposit
from the Anaconda era of sampling, as well as the more recent digitally imported data.  Most of the historical assay results are recorded on
paper assay certificates and drill logs, many being photocopies of original hand written data.  For this data, the double data entry method is
the  preferred  system,  since  it  ensures  the  lowest  error  rate  and  is  proven  the  most  effective  method  to  remove  entry  errors  from
databases.  This entry system permits the validation, audit, cleaning and clarification of a database on a real-time basis, with the intent to limit
data entry error to less than 1%, well within the rate of error acceptable for data used in a resource model.  This system of data entry dedicates
two  teams  to  enter  the  identical  data  that  was  captured  on  hardcopy  forms,  in  individual  databases  on  separate  local  computers.    The
databases are then compared at the completion and errors fixed with the end product being a validated database.
 
For the Ann Mason data, an Excel programme was used to select every 20th sample from the assay export file used to estimate the Ann
Mason resource, or approximately 5% of the database.  This totaled 2,162 samples.  Data from the two data entry teams was compared and it
was determined that 12 data errors exist in the checked portion of the database, representing approximately a 0.6% error rate.  Most of the
errors that remain are from poorly documented or illegible entries in the original data, however these types of errors are rare and do not
represent a significant percentage of the overall database.  Scott Jackson considers the assay results acceptable for use in the estimation of
Mineral Resources.
 
During Scott Jackson’s site visit, he also reviewed the drill hole collars in the historical hardcopy files for 35 Anaconda drill holes (out of 105
available  files).    Of  these,  23  were  found  to  have  the  same  coordinates  in  hardcopy  as  in  the  database;  five  holes  had  no  hardcopy
information to verify collars; and nine holes had two sets of coordinates.  Since then Entrée have investigated these discrepancies and re-
surveyed several of the locations in the field.
 
 
Page 12-1
Scott Jackson also reviewed more than 5% of all assays by comparing hard copy original assay certificates against the assays recorded in
the database.  No material errors were detected.  Some minor errors were noted, for example in D115 where some assays that were below
detection were allocated a grade of zero and some cases where intervals logged as 'no core' have zero grades also (Hole D166).
Drill Hole Locations
Independent Review of Core Samples
12.1.3
 
The collection of independent samples is meant to demonstrate that mineralization exists on the property in similar ranges reported by the
issuer.  To this end, Scott Jackson reviewed core from several holes while at site and observed chalcopyrite, bornite, and/or molybdenite
mineralization in the core in the approximate percentages that would roughly coincide with copper and/or molybdenum grades as reported by
the company.
 
12.1.4
 
The locations of three holes (ANN06001, D164, D227) were checked in the field by Scott Jackson during the site visit.  The locations were
determined by a hand-held GPS and, which were all within approximately 10 m of those reported by Entrée in the final database.  In Scott
Jackson’s opinion, this is acceptable given the accuracy of the device (±10 m) used during the site visit.
 
12.1.5
 
During the site visit, Scott Jackson reviewed the mineralized sections of hole ANN06001, which comprised predominantly granodiorite with
intermittent zones of one type of Quartz Monzonite Porphyry (Qmp-a).  Mr. Jackson concluded that the logging was of good quality but noted
that a degree of familiarity with the rocks was required to classify lithologies according to the local schemes (in particular differentiating some
of the different phases of Qmp was not always obvious).  When comparing the logs with the assays a link was noted between lithologies with
an increased mafic component and increasing copper grades.  Copper mineralisation in the form of bornite and chalcopyrite was observed in
quantities consistent with the assays.

AGP checked the drill hole assay database for missing intervals, out of sequence intervals, non-numerical values, negative values, and min
and max values.  No errors were observed.  Only one missing sample interval of 4.5 m in length was observed in the database in drill hole
EG-BH-11-025, but was located in the overlying non-mineralized volcanic rocks.  Sixteen missing intervals in historical holes were observed
in non-mineralized rocks and three missing intervals were observed within the sulphide mineralization.  Compositing routines substituted
these missing intervals with zero grades.

Data Verification (Blue Hill)
Database Verification
AGP selected four drill holes from the 2010/11 drilling for verification of the assay database against the assay results provided directly to AGP
by the ALS Minerals.  A total of 759 samples results were crosschecked against the certificates that represents 20% of the total samples
collected.  AGP checked total copper, oxide copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver; however, not all samples were tested for all elements.  No
discrepancy was observed.
 
AGP also selected four drill holes from the historical drilling for verification of the assay database.  A total of 984 sample results representing
35% of the historical assay database were cross checked against drill hole logs for two holes completed by Anaconda, and against laboratory
certificates supplied by Entrée for two holes completed by PacMag.  AGP checked total copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver; however, not
all samples were tested for all elements.  Only copper was checked for the Anaconda holes.  No discrepancy was observed.
 
AGP did not cross check geology logs with lithological data in the database.  As a grade shell was used to constrain the resource estimate,
any errors in geological coding in the database would not be considered material to the results.
 
AGP did not cross check down hole survey measurements with the data in the database.  As most holes were vertical, any errors would be
minor in their impact.

Geological Model
 
An interpretation of the geological model for Blue Hill was in progress at the time of the site visit.  A set of cross-sectional interpretations
drawn on paper and reconciled in two azimuths (similar to a fence diagram) was near completion.  The interpreted model was supported
mostly by reverse circulation holes, with a few diamond drill core holes.  Well-organized chip trays facilitated the examination of the data
collected.
 
Core Logging
 
AGP considered the core logging and core handling procedures to be industry standard.
 
The core handling was observed to be very efficient.  The core is stored at the Entrée exploration office in Yerington, Nevada.  The complex
consists of a large warehouse with offices inside a fully fenced yard.  Entrée also leases two nearby warehouses to store the RC chips,
sample rejects, sample pulp, and Anaconda core.
 
The drill core boxes are marked in feet by the driller, and drill rods are also assumed to be imperial lengths.  The core is collected daily by a
geologist and brought to the Entrée exploration office.  The core is placed onto a logging table, measured in metric units, and logged for
lithology, mineralization, alteration, veining, structure, magnetic susceptibility, and RQD.  Observations are recorded on paper forms, which
are  then  transcribed  into  a  computer.    The  geologist  logging  the  core  can  visually  identify  the  mineral  assemblages  in  the  mineralized
zone.  AGP observed, the lithology and ICP assay results plotted on graphic logs, and the drill hole log was being adjusted as necessary by
Entrée's geologists.  AGP found that Entrée’s core logging and validation procedure resulted in consistency between drill hole logs, which is
important since the domains used in the resource model rely in part on the visual determination of the mineralized assemblages.
 
 
Page 12-4
Core recovery in a number of core boxes examined by AGP showed rubble material, caused by weak fracture planes that break into small
pieces  when  the  core  is  emptied  from  the  core  barrel,  as  opposed  to  ground  core,  evidenced  by  angular  features  of  the  recovered
pieces.  Sampling activity intensifies the core deterioration.  Since solid core was recovered for these intersections, the measured core length
is subject to interpretation by the logger.  Entrée experimented with a triple tube core barrel, without much success considering the added
cost.    AGP  recommends  conducting  a  trial  study  to  determine  if  core  recovery  is  being  estimated  accurately  in  zones  that  are  heavily
fractured.  AGP suggest estimating the core recovery by weighing the recovered contents of each run of a drill hole and dividing the results by
an assumed weight of a full run of core with 100% recovery.  The methodology assumes a constant SG.  AGP recommends comparing the
estimates with recoveries using the standard technique of measuring the length of the recovered core.
 
Core Sampling
 
AGP observed core cutting by diamond saw blade.  The saw blade was continuously cooled by fresh water.  A decant tank was used to
prevent the rock cuttings from leaking into the environment.  During the site visit, core was often observed to be heavily fractured, and in these
zones, the technician collected approximately half of the broken pieces.
Once cut, the core was tagged and sampled by a locally hired technician, who also inserted the required QA/QC control samples.  The drill
hole samples were individually bagged in 6 mil plastic bags and loaded in woven polypropylene sacks for shipment.  The samples are picked
up by the laboratory truck and driver at Entrée's warehouse.  AGP found the security and chain of custody to be industry standard or better.
 
QA/QC Review
 
AGP observed QA/QC procedures exceeding industry standard.
 
Quarter core twin samples were collected by re-sawing the half-core samples destined for delivery to the laboratory.  The twin samples have a
sample volume half that of the regular samples however, the twin samples are of equal volume to each other.  AGP does not consider this an
issue, as the grade is relatively consistent.
 
Packets of standard reference material were inserted in the sample chain without the suppliers’ tags but with the regular sample tags used in
the sample sequence.
 
AGP  observed  coarse  crushed  blanks,  volcanic  rock  from  a  landscape  supply  store  in  Reno,  Nevada,  being  inserted  into  the  sample
sequence to test for contamination at the sample preparation stage.  Fine blanks were not observed.
 
Specific Gravity
 
AGP observed the specific gravity laboratory equipment, which included a 0.1 g precision A&D GF8000 scale that is calibrated daily.  SG is
determined on dried, wax-coated core samples.  Entrée uses a standard to check the precision of the scale.  The formula used by Entrée was
observed by AGP to be applied correctly.
 
 
Page 12-5
Independent Collection of Core Samples
 
Seven drill hole samples were collected by AGP during the site; four from Blue Hill and three from Ann Mason.  Samples consisted of quarter-
core splits and core fragments, except for two Blue Hill samples (89957 and 89958), which consisted of reverse circulation chips.  The sample
intervals replicated Entrée’s intervals.  AGP packaged the samples on site, and then shipped via courier directly to Activation Laboratories
Ltd., Ancaster, Ontario, an independent laboratory not previously used by Entrée.
 
Samples were analyzed for gold using fire assay with an AA finish (code 1A2-50); copper, silver, and molybdenum were assayed using a
four-acid digestion followed by ICP-OES (Code 8).  The Blue Hill samples were also submitted for CN soluble copper and acid soluble
copper analysis.  All samples showed negligible gold, silver, or molybdenum values.  Three of the Blue Hill samples indicated that most of the
total copper is acid soluble, while one sample (89958) indicated total copper, which was mostly CN soluble and not acid soluble.  From the
assay  results  shown  in  Table  12-1  and  Table  12-2,  AGP  concluded  that  the  general  range  of  values  returned  by  the  character  samples
collected during the site visit correspond well with those reported by Entrée.

Collar coordinates were verified with the aid of a handheld Garmin GPS Map, Model 60CSx.  A series of collars were randomly selected, and
the GPS position was recorded.  As shown in Table 12-3, results indicated an average difference in the X-Y plane of 2.5 m for the five holes
where the instrument was located on the collar.  On the Z plane, an average difference of 1.2 m was recorded.  The differences observed are
well within the accuracy of the hand held GPS unit used.

Ann Mason Deposit
The Anaconda Company, 1970
Introduction
Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing
13
 
13.1
 
Bench-scale metallurgical testwork on samples from the Ann Mason deposit has been carried out in two separate programs: the first by The
Anaconda Company (Anaconda) in 1970, and most recently at Metcon Research (Metcon) in 2011/2012.  The objective in all of the work
conducted to date has been to evaluate the response of the mineralization to conventional sulphide concentration by froth flotation.  Column
leach testing of four composite samples of split drill core was also completed on the Blue Hill deposit.  A summary of the results of these
programs follows.
 
13.2
 
13.2.1
 
The  earliest  available  testwork  results  on  samples  from  the  Ann  Mason  deposit  date  back  to  a  1970  report  written  by  M.J.  Noakes  of
Anaconda (Noakes, 1970).  Diamond drill core assay reject samples, described as “in good condition,” were used for this work.  The program
consisted of head characterization, mineralogy, and preliminary rougher and cleaner flotation tests.
 
A total of 21 samples from 9 different drill holes were crushed down to minus 10 mesh and split into 500 g charges.  A single charge from
each sample was combined to form one overall master composite described as “MN/AM-1.”
 
Polished sections were prepared from two samples taken from separate holes in the deposit: one from a chalcopyrite zone, and the other from
a chalcopyrite-bornite zone.  Mineralogical examination by optical characterization and point counting was carried out by the Geophysical
Division  of  Anaconda.    The  results  indicated  that  the  mineralization  has  a  “simple  mineralogy”  with  no  significant  interlocking  between
sulphides, although very little pyrite was detected in either sample.  The report also characterized the gangue as “unaltered,” and unlikely to
result in excessive slime generation.
 
A grinding series was conducted on the overall composite to determine the effect of particle size distribution on copper recovery in rougher
flotation.  The series consisted of six tests, with lab mill grinding times ranging from 2 to 30 minutes.  Results indicated that grinding finer than
a P80 of 100 µm did not improve copper recovery, and that the optimum grind size lies somewhere between 185 µm (5 minute grind) and 100
µm (10 minute grind).  Size-by-size assays on the tailings samples indicated that a significant increase in mineral liberation was not achieved
beyond 10 minutes of lab mill grinding.  As a result, all subsequent tests used a target grind P80 of 100 µm.
Page 13-1
A standard test procedure was applied to each of the 21 individual composites.  The flowsheet consisted of a 100 µm grind, followed by
rougher flotation for six minutes at pH 10.5 using Dow Z-11 as a collector and MIBC, and a single stage of cleaning for three minutes, also at
pH 10.5.  There was no regrind step prior to cleaning.  Arithmetic averages of the results of these tests are presented in Table 13-1.

Head Sample
 
The results of the flotation testwork on the individual composites were consistent with those from the master composite MN/AM-1.  Rougher
copper recovery ranged from 91.5% to 99.8%, and averaged 94.5%.  Mass recovery to the rougher concentrate ranged from 3.0% to 7.8%.
 
Single stage, open-circuit cleaning without a regrind resulted in an average cleaner copper recovery of 85.9%.  It is reasonable to expect that
losses to the 1st Cleaner tails could be reduced through optimization of the 1st Cleaner stage, addition of a regrind step, and/or the addition of
a cleaner scavenger.
 
Cleaner concentrate grades averaged an acceptable 25.8% Cu, but varied widely from 8.4% Cu to 38.7% Cu.  The poorest grades were
associated with two samples that showed much higher than average S:Cu ratios, on the order of 5:1 to 6:1.  These samples likely contained
elevated concentrations of activated pyrite, which diluted the concentrate.  Conversely, final concentrate grades exceeding 38% Cu were
seen for two of the composites whose S:Cu ratios were well below 1.0.  The presence of bornite in these samples is believed to contribute to
the high copper grades.
 
Molybdenum head grades in the flotation composites ranged from 5 ppm to 88 ppm.  Rougher recovery averaged 69.5% to a concentrate
grading  730  ppm  Mo. 
the  grade  averaged
1,590 ppm Mo.  Copper/molybdenum separation testing was not attempted, due to the low head grade of the sample and the limited mass of
sample available.

In addition to molybdenum, a small amount of silver, averaging 1 ppm, was identified in the head samples.  Flotation results indicated that the
silver follows the copper and molybdenum.
 
13.2.2
 
In July 2011, assay reject samples from the Ann Mason deposit arrived at Metcon in Tuscon, Arizona, for metallurgical testing.  The purpose
of the program was to conduct a preliminary flotation study leading to the development of a process flowsheet for optimal concentration of the
Ann Mason mineralization.
 
Head Characterization
 
Two metallurgical composites were generated, each representing assay reject samples from a single drill hole from two separate sulphide
domains within the Ann Mason deposit.  The first composite was from core drill hole EG-AM-11-003, and included 19 contiguous 2 m intervals
between 768 and 806 m depth within the chalcopyrite-bornite domain.  The second composite was from core drill hole EG-AM-11-009, and
included 18 contiguous 2 m intervals between 194 and 230 m depth within the chalcopyrite domain.  Table 13-2 provides a summary of the
head assays for the composites.

  Note:
 
Copper and molybdenum grades for the new composites were comparable to those from the Anaconda work in 1970.  The sulphur to copper
ratios ranged from 1:1 (EG-AM-11-009) to 0.7:1 (EG-AM-11-009), and were at the lower end of the scale compared to the earlier work.

Quantitative  mineralogical  study  of  the  composite  head  samples  was  conducted  by  Mineral  Liberation  Analyzer  (MLA)  at  the  Center  for
Advanced Mineral and Metallurgical Processing at The University of Montana.  The results indicated that copper mineralization for the EG-
AM-11-003 composite consisted of both chalcopyrite (64%) and bornite (36%), whereas for the EG-AM-11-009 composite the copper was
almost entirely (>99%) chalcopyrite.
 
Mineral locking data indicates that chalcopyrite particles are well liberated in all size fractions, with the exception of the minus 37 µm particles
for composite EG-AM-11-003.  Where present, bornite showed a strong association with chalcopyrite.

Effect of Grind Size on Copper and Molybdenum Recovery in Rougher Flotation
Rougher Flotation Tests
 
A series of batch rougher flotation tests were carried out on 1.5 kg charges of each composite.  The purpose of these tests was to identify
optimum flotation conditions for copper and molybdenum recovery.  Variables evaluated during this testwork included primary grind size, pH,
collector type, and collector dosage.
 
Rougher flotation recoveries at varying primary grind sizes are presented in Figure 13-1.  The results indicate only a very slight increase in
recovery with finer grinding for both composites, within the P80 range of 74 µm to 149 µm.  In comparison, coarser grinding appears to favour
higher molybdenum recoveries, possibly due to increased smearing of molybdenite at longer grind times.  Based on these results, a primary
grind P80 of 105 µm was selected for all subsequent testwork in this program.
 
 Figure 13-1:
 
 
  Note:
 
A series of tests were carried out to evaluate the effect of pulp pH on rougher flotation kinetics.  The tests compared the natural pH (~7.5) of
the mineralazation with pH adjusted to 9.0, 10.0, and 11.0 through the addition of lime.  For both composites, the overall mass pulled to
concentrate decreased as pulp pH increased, but copper, molybdenum, and sulphur recovery was essentially unchanged.  It should be noted,
however, that pH may be an important means of maintaining selectivity against pyrite for zones demonstrating higher S:Cu ratios than those
of the composites tested here.
 
Collector  types  and  dosages  were  looked  at  by  comparing  combinations  of  C-3330  (SIPX)  and  fuel  oil  with  MX-3045  (a  xanthate-ester
blend).  Similar to the effect of grind size and pH, changes in collector had little if any influence on copper recovery under the conditions
tested, with recoveries ranging from 95.5% to 96.5%.  Slightly more variability was observed in the recoveries for molybdenum and silver
between tests, but these differences may be more attributable to very low head grades and analytical uncertainty, rather than any change in
the test conditions themselves.

Label 003 corresponds to composite sample EG-AM-11-003.
Based on the results of the collector series, reagent additions of 10 g/t C-3330 and 28 g/t fuel oil were selected for the rougher circuit.
 
The addition of a surfactant, Triton, was found to have no impact on molybdenum recovery.
 
Cleaner Flotation Tests
 
Batch cleaner flotation tests were carried out to evaluate the effect of sodium silicate and rougher concentrate regrinding on rejecting gangue
minerals, and to evaluate flotation kinetics in the first and second cleaning stages.
 
For both composites, the addition of sodium silicate (in dosages from 100 to 300 g/t) had a negative effect on 1st Cleaner concentrate copper
grade, with no effect on recovery.
 
The effect of regrinding prior to cleaner flotation on metal recovery is presented in
 
Figure 13-2.  The results indicate that for both composites optimum results were achieved with a regrind size P80 of 44 µm.
 
 Figure 13-2:
 
 
 
Page 13-5
Effect of Regrind Size on Copper and Molybdenum Recovery in Cleaner Flotation
Kinetic sampling of the cleaner circuit revealed that moderate flotation times are sufficient for batch flotation using the equipment tested (1st
Cleaner, 6 minutes; 1st Cleaner scavenger, 4 minutes; and 2nd Cleaner, 4 minutes).  For composite EG-AM-11-003, an open-circuit copper
grade of 34.8% was achieved at a recovery of 87.1%.  In comparison, composite EG-AM-11-003 generated a grade of 28.6% Cu at a recovery
of 91.7%.
 
Locked-Cycle Testing
 
The optimized rougher and cleaner flotation conditions discussed in the previous two sections were used to carry out a six-cycle cleaner
flotation test on each of the composite samples.  The test was locked by recycling the rougher scavenger and cleaner scavenger concentrates
from each cycle to the rougher conditioner stage of the subsequent cycle.  In a similar fashion, the second cleaner tailings were recycled to
the first cleaner feed.
 
Both tests demonstrated reasonably good stability between cycles in terms of mass and metal recovery to final concentrate.  Table 13-3 and
Table 13-4 provide a summary of grades and recoveries for the last four cycles from each test.

Locked-cycle copper grades for both composites were similar to the open circuit results.  The achieved copper grades (35.8% for EG-AM-11-
003,  and  26.7%  for  EG-AM-11-009)  can  be  considered  as  saleable.    In  addition,  both  composites  resulted  in  a  copper  recovery  to  final
concentrate of greater than 93%.

Molybdenum, silver, and gold recoveries for the higher-grade EG-AM-11-003 composite were 77%, 70%, and 78%, respectively.
 
Copper/Molybdenum Separation
 
In an effort to evaluate the potential for molybdenum recovery as a separate concentrate, a 30 kg charge of each composite was used to
generate  a  bulk  sample  of  second  cleaner  concentrate  for  a  copper-molybdenum  separation  test.    The  molybdenum  circuit  employed  a
conventional reagent scheme consisting of NaSH conditioning and nitrogen sparging to depress the copper minerals, with fuel oil added to
collect the molybdenite.
 
Figure 13-3 presents the results of successive cleaning stages on grade and recovery to the open circuit concentrate.  The tests had to be
halted before marketable concentrate grades were reached due to low sample weight.  For the higher-grade EG-AM-11-003 composite, this
occurred after three cleaner stages; for the lower-grade composite, only two cleaner stages were possible.  From the results presented here, it
appears that five stages of cleaning would likely be required to reach a 50% Mo grade in the final concentrate.  This would represent a typical
configuration for a copper-molybdenum separation circuit.

The analysis revealed no elements of concern.  Arsenic  levels  in  the  molybdenum  concentrates  were  elevated,  but  are  still  likely  below
penalty  concentrations.    Repeat  assays  were  required  for  phosphorus,  due  to  a  suspected  analytical  interference  on  the  original
measurement; unfortunately, an insufficient quantity of the molybdenum final concentrates were available to carry out the second analysis.

Metcon Research, 2012
13.2.3
 
Follow-up metallurgical testwork was carried out at Metcon between February and July 2012, with the objective of completing additional study
in two areas: a preliminary characterization of Ann Mason mineralization grindability, and variability flotation testing on a lower-grade, high
pyrite zone of the deposit.
 
Grindability Study
 
A single 30 kg composite, made up of samples from four drill holes in the Ann Mason deposit, was submitted to Phillips Enterprises, via
Metcon, for grindability testing.  The samples consisted of 2 m sections of split drill core from each of the four holes.
 
Testwork included a Crushing Work Index (CWI), Abrasion Index (AI), and Bond Ball Work Index (BBWI) at a closing size of 100 mesh (150
µm).  Results of the grindability testwork are presented in Table 13-6.

Results of the grindability testing indicate that the composite tested can be characterized as being of average hardness and abrasivity, as
compared to other low-grade sulphide deposits.
 
Variability Testing: Low-Grade, Cpy-Py Zone
 
New split core samples, representing the chalcopyrite-pyrite zone of the deposit, were delivered to Metcon in March 2012.  The samples were
combined  to  form  two  variability  composites:  a  low-grade  and  a  mid-grade  composites.    Head  analysis  of  the  variability  composites  is
presented in Table 13-7.

Low-Grade Composite
Mid-Grade Composite
 
Head analysis revealed that both composites are lower than the Indicated resource estimate copper grade of 0.33%.  In addition, the sulphur
to copper ratio, which was on the order of 1:1 for the main zone composites, is much higher here, particularly for the low-grade sample.
 
The Anaconda work summarized in an earlier section identified that for samples with S:Cu ratios exceeding 5:1, the final concentrate copper
grade dropped below 10% due to the presence of activated pyrite.  With a S:Cu ratio of more than 15:1, the low-grade composite could be
expected to present some challenges in achieving a saleable concentrate grade.

Rougher  flotation  testwork  indicated  that,  unlike  the  main  zone  composites,  the  Cpy-Py  composites  demonstrated  improved  recovery  at
higher  pH.    Specifically,  at  a  pulp  pH  of  10.0,  the  combined  rougher+scavenger  copper  recoveries  for  the  low-grade  and  mid-grade
composites were 94.9% and 95.7%, respectively, which compares well with the main zone rougher results at natural pH.
 
Initial cleaning tests were carried out under the conditions optimized in the earlier program.  As anticipated, difficulty was encountered in
rejecting  pyrite  in  the  cleaner  circuit,  which  resulted  in  poor  2nd  Cleaner  concentrate  grades.    For  the  low-grade  composite,  the  final
concentrate graded 10.4% Cu and 42.8% S, indicating the extent of the pyrite problem.  Results for the MG composite were better, but the
open-circuit final concentrate grade only reached 19.5% Cu.
 
Efforts to depress pyrite in the cleaner circuit included the addition of HQS (sodium silicate, sodium phosphate, and quebracho), adding a 3rd
Cleaner, and increasing the pulp pH in successive cleaner stages to pH 12.0.  No effect was observed with the addition of HQS, but the
additional cleaning and higher pH in the cleaners did improve the low-grade final concentrate copper grade from 10.4% to 23.9%.
 
A  further  change  to  the  reagent  scheme  was  introduced  with  the  elimination  of  xanthate  in  the  roughers,  leaving  only  the  more  copper-
selective dithiophosphate reagent A-238 as a collector.  This had the effect of significantly reducing pyrite recovery in the rougher flotation
stage, and resulted in an increase of the final concentrate grade for the low-grade composite to 27.4% at improved open-circuit recovery.  The
addition  of  a  small  amount  of  fuel  oil  to  the  primary  grind  was  also  observed  to  have  a  positive  effect  on  copper  and  molybdenum
recovery.    Maximum  final  concentrate  copper  grades  for  the  low-grade  and  mid-grade  composites  were  found  to  be  28.8%  and  31.1%,
respectively.
 
Locked-cycle testing was conducted on the two composites under the optimized reagent and flowsheet conditions.  Each test consisted of six
cycles and included the 3rd Cleaner stage shown to be beneficial in the open-circuit testing.  Table 13-8 provides a summary of the locked-
cycle test results for the variability composites.
 
The  average  concentrate  grades  for  the  locked-cycle  tests  were  found  to  be  somewhat  lower  than  those  achieved  in  the  open-circuit
testing.  This may indicate that further small refinements in reagent additions or flotation times are required in order to properly optimize the
circuit.  Given the low grade of the sample, a larger cycle charge size might also improve performance through better “froth crowding” in the
cleaner stages.

Note:
 
The work summarized here indicates that a potential activated pyrite problem associated with the high S:Cu ratios in the Cpy-Py domain can
be mitigated through minor reagent changes and the addition of a 3rd Cleaner stage.  The extent to which these changes would need to be
incorporated into the plant flowsheet or operating procedures is dependent on the relative distribution of the domains, the mining plan, and the
potential for mill feed blending to achieve an average S:Cu ratio in the plant feed.  Additional testwork in the next phase of the program is
expected to provide more insight in those areas.
 
To complement the results presented here, Metcon has recommended the following components for the next phase of the program:
 
  · copper-molybdenum separation testing on a 200 kg flotation feed sample
 
  · variability flotation testing on production composites from the mine plan
 
 
 
  · environmental testing on flotation products and waste rocks.
 
 
13.2.4
 
The proposed flowsheet for the Ann Mason processing plant consists of a conventional SAG/ball milling circuit to generate a flotation feed
product P80 of ~120 µm.  The flotation circuit would produce separate copper and molybdenum concentrate products for dewatering and
shipment to third party smelters.
 
Table 11-9 presents a summary of the metallurgical projection for the Ann Mason deposit.  Grades and recoveries are based primarily on the
results of the locked-cycle flotation tests from the 2011 Metcon program.

It should be noted that the grade and recovery to the molybdenum concentrate are, at this point, only estimates.  The copper-molybdenum
separation testwork in the 2011 program successfully demonstrated that a separate molybdenum concentrate was achievable, but the target
grade of 50% Mo was not reached during three stages of cleaning.  Additional stages were not possible due to the small mass of the 3rd
Cleaner concentrate.  As a result, the projection includes only an estimate of molybdenum recovery to a concentrate of 50%.  The next phase
of testwork is expected to provide additional characterization of the relationship between grade and recovery for the molybdenum product.

In 2012, Metcon completed column leach testing of four composite samples composed of split drill core from the Blue Hill deposit.  The
objective  of  the  program  was  to  determine  the  amenability  of  Blue  Hill  samples  to  heap  leaching,  including  copper  extraction  and  acid
consumption data (Metcon, 2012c).
 
Three of the composites were from oxide-style mineralization, with calculated head grades ranging between 0.13% Cu and 0.25% Cu.  The
fourth was from mixed oxide-sulphide mineralization grading 0.17% Cu.  Size-by-size analysis of the column head samples crushed to a P80
of ¾" indicated significant upgrading of the copper values in the -2 mm fraction.
 
Mineralogical  characterization  of  the  oxide  sample  was  conducted  by  Tescan  Integrated  Mineral  Analysis  (TIMA),  which  provides  semi-
quantitative  results  using  an  automated  scanning  electron  microsope.    The  results  indicated  that  copper  was  predominantly  present  as
chrysocolla and other minerals including goethite, calcanthite, brocanthite, malachite, and tennantite.  The remaining copper is contained as
minor amounts of sulphides (chalcopyrite, covellite, bornite).
 
The samples were crushed to a P80 of ¾" and acid addition requirements were determined using bottle roll testing and static leaching.  A 40
kg charge of each composite was loaded into separate 3 m x 10 cm diameter columns.  The column charges were acid agglomerated and
cured for five days prior to the onset of irrigation at a flow rate of 7.33 L/h/m2 and a sulphuric acid concentration of 7 g/L.
 
 
Page 13-12
After a 91-day leach cycle, the columns yielded recoveries ranging from approximately 83% in the mixed composite to 87% in the mid-grade
composite.  The average recovery of the four composites was 84.8%.  All composites showed very fast recovery rates, with the four columns
returning indicated cumulative copper extractions averaging 70% after 15 days of leaching.  Sulphuric acid consumption in the four columns
ranged between 8.37 kg/kg Cu and 15.49 kg/kg Cu, and averaged 11.95 kg/kg Cu.  A summary of the column leach results is provided in
Table 13-10.

Kinetic curves for the extraction of copper for each of the four column tests are presented in Figure 13-4.  For all of the tests, rapid copper
extraction  was  observed  at  the  onset  of  column  irrigation,  indicating  that  significant  copper  mineral  dissolution  had  occurred  during  the
agglomeration and curing stages.  By the third week of leaching extraction, kinetics declined dramatically, but slow progress continued until
the end of the test.

High copper extractions and fast kinetics are believed to be attributable to the copper mineralization being localized in the fracture zones of
the host rock.  Hence, a moderate crush size was successful at opening up the mineral surfaces to attack by acid leaching.
 
Recommendations for further study on samples from the Blue Hill deposit include column leaching studies to optimize the acid cure dosage,
irrigation flow rate, crush size, and lift height.  This would be followed up by testing of production composites (i.e., year-by-year composites)
under  the  optimized  conditions.    Additional  mineralogical  study  of  column  leach  feeds  and  residues  is  suggested  in  order  to  better
characterize dissolution of specific minerals and to evaluate variability in the deposit.

MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES
14
 
The  Project  contains  Mineral  Resources  at  the  Ann  Mason  and  Blue  Hill  deposits.    The  two  deposits  are  not  connected,  and  each  was
estimated independent of each other.  Ann Mason is a sulphide-hosted copper-molybdenum porphyry deposit, and Blue Hill is an oxide- and
sulphide-hosted copper-porphyry deposit.
 
Mineral resources at Ann Mason were estimated by Scott Jackson of QG, and Mr. Desautels of AGP is the QP responsible for  the  Blue Hill
resource estimate.  Resources for both deposits are constrained within LG constraining pit shells generated by AGP.
 
The estimates are in compliance with CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, as referenced in NI 43-101.  Copper,
molybdenum, gold, and silver were estimated in 40 m x 40 m x 15 m blocks in both deposits.
 
14.1
 
14.1.1
 
A detailed description of the Ann Mason deposit is provided in Section 7.  Three-dimensional models of the key features at Ann Mason were
built to determine those aspects that affect copper, molybdenum, silver, and gold mineralization and influence the estimation of resources.  As
a specific example, the aim was to test whether or not sulphide species models should be used to build estimation domains for copper and/or
molybdenum, gold, and silver.
 
Geological  models  in  the  form  of  3D  surfaces  and  solids  were  built  by  QG  based  on  geological  and  drilling  information  supplied  by
Entrée.  Sectional strings for lithology, sulphide species, and structure were provided to QG in electronic (DXF) format.  QG loaded the shapes
in MineSight software, and then created valid surfaces and solids from the strings.  The key features relevant to mineralization are discussed
below.
Ann Mason Mineral Resource Estimate
Geological Modelling
Singatse Fault
 
The copper/molybdenum mineralization at Ann Mason is truncated by the Singatse Fault east of 304,400E and between 4,317,300N and
4,318,000N.  Displacement of the faulted portions of the Ann Mason deposit in the hanging wall of the Singatse Fault is estimated to be 4 km
eastward.
 
QG generated a surface of the Singatse Fault based on geological logging in the drill hole database.  The fault was placed at the base of
Tertiary  ignimbrites  and  related  lithologies.    An  oblique  view  of  the  fault  is  presented  in  Figure  14-1.    This  boundary  represents  a  major
unconformity, and material above the fault is considered to be unmineralized.  The fault was used as a hard boundary in estimation.

Figure 14-1:
Oblique View of Singatse Fault and Ann Mason Drilling (showing Cu)
Looking Northeast
Lithology
 
As noted in Section 7.2, the spatial distribution of lithology at Ann Mason is complex, and Entrée's understanding of it is still developing as
more  holes  are  drilled.    In  broad  terms,  there  are  two  packages  of  rock  that  have  been  interpreted  in  the  main  mineralized  zone:  (1)
Granodiorites (Jgd) in the western and upper parts, and (2) Porphyritic quartz monzonites (Jpqm) in the eastern and lower parts.  The dipping
intrusive contact between granodiorite (Jgd) and younger porphyritic quartz monzonite (Jpqm) is thought to play a part in mineralization with a
copper envelope ranging from 200 m to as much as 800 m above or below the intrusive contact.
 
Entrée geologists interpreted the contact between Jpqm and Jgd on 100 m E-W and N-S paper cross–sections, which were first digitized then
supplied  to  QG  in  dxf  format.    These  were  converted  to  MineSight  format  and  modified  slightly  in  order  to  build  a  coherent  surface  for
subsequent statistical analysis.
 
Alteration
 
As  noted  in  Section  7.3.7,  the  primary  alteration  types  at  Ann  Mason  include  a  broad,  main-stage  zone  of  potassic  alteration,  an  outer
propylitic zone, and more restricted late-stage overprints of sodic-calcic (chlorite+albite±epidote), sodic (albite), sericite, zeolite, and gypsum.
 
 
Page 14-2
The complex nature of the spatial distribution of alteration coupled with the drill spacing, has prevented the construction of meaningful 3D
shapes that would assist in estimating copper and molybdenum, particularly the sodic alteration.  QG recommends additional work in this
area once drill spacing is tightened.
 
Structure
 
Porphyry copper-molybdenum deposits of the Yerington district have been rotated 60° to 90° westward by Miocene age normal faulting and
extension.    As  a  result,  mineralized  intercepts  in  vertical  drill  holes  represent  approximately  horizontal  intervals  at  varying  depths  of  the
original pre-tilt geometry of the deposit.
 
A series of ten high-angle faults have been identified at Ann Mason by integrating historical structural data with Entrée’s logging of faults that
were interpreted to have significant amounts of displacement.  These high-angle faults have strike directions ranging from AZ 295° to AZ
325°, and dip 60° to 70° SW.  The criteria used to identify faults with significant amounts of displacement include thickness of clay gouge,
changes in rock type across structures, and the presence of fault breccia or slickensides.
 
QG generated fault surfaces from the “in plan” strings provide by Entrée (Figure 14-3).
 
Sulphide Species
 
Sulphide  domains  at  Ann  Mason  include  an  outer  pyrite-dominated  zone,  a  chalcopyrite-dominated  zone,  and  a  bornite-  chalcopyrite-
dominated  zone.    Copper  mineralization  over  0.15%  coincides  with  a  pyrite:chalcopyrite  ratio  of  approximately  7:1,  based  on  detailed
relationships developed by Anaconda geologists and confirmed by Entrée geologists.
 
A simple sulphide model has been generated based on drilling data, using copper grade, logged pyrite:chalcopyrite ratios, and the presence
of  bornite.    Strings  developed  by  Entrée  were  transformed  to  surfaces  and  solids  by  QG  in  order  to  assess  whether  or  not  they  would
contribute to estimation domains.
 
14.1.2
Estimation Domains
Based on the geological surfaces and solids outlined above and grade distributions for copper and molybdenum, estimation domains were
investigated and built by QG in consultation with Entrée.  The result, discussed below was the development of copper, molybdenum, and
silver envelopes that take into account the orientation of the key structures and lithology contacts.  Various scenarios and groupings were
tested.
 
 
Page 14-3
Copper Envelope
 
As a starting point, some preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA) suggested there was a break in the copper mineralization at the 0.15%
to  0.25%  Cu  threshold.    This  was  supported  with  the  observation  of  a  relatively  sharp  contact  on  the  southwestern  portion  of  the  main
mineralized zone at Ann Mason.
 
Copper grades were then contoured, and it was evident that there was a coherent zone of mineralization with a shape that was relatively
invariant  between  0.15  and  0.2%  Cu.    To  support  this,  an  indicator  kriged  (IK)  estimate  at  0.2%  Cu  was  also  built  to  assist  in  defining
geometry.  Figure 14-2 shows a typical cross-section with the grade shell for 0.15% Cu and 0.2% Cu, and IK outlines at 0.5 used to guide the
original interpretation of the copper envelope.  Figure 14-5 shows the plan view for the same grade shell.
 
As the Entrée drilling progressed through 2010 and 2011 it became evident that the initial interpretations were relatively robust, and additional
drilling  meant  only  minor  changes  to  the  interpretations  needed  to  be  made.    The  main  aim  when  making  the  envelope  was  to  attain  a
geometrically consistent and plausible shape above the 0.15% Cu threshold.  Strings were initially built on E-W sections, and a 3D wireframe
solid.  Following that, strings were also made in N-S sections to refine geological continuity.  When deciding the location of the domain
boundary, some relatively small intercepts of sub-grade material were included to make the shape a lot more geometrically coherent.  Along
the southwestern contact, Fault 1A was used as a guide for the orientation of the boundary, as this is coincident with a break in the copper
mineralization.
 
In  general,  the  mineralization  is  not  closed  off  in  many  directions  at  Ann  Mason  except  for  the  upper  portions  of  the  southwestern
boundary.  Therefore, extending the envelope was limited to approximately 150 m from the outermost drilling (with mineralization).  This
distance was chosen with an idea of preliminary resource classification in mind, as it was then assumed that blocks over 150 m to 175 m
away from drilling were unlikely to be classified (as described in Section 14.1.6 on resource classification).
 
Molybdenum Envelope
 
A  similar  approach  was  taken  to  build  a  grade  envelope  for  molybdenum  as  was  undertaken  for  copper.    EDA  revealed  that  a  0.005%
threshold for molybdenum was an appropriate and logical point to create a relatively coherent grade envelope.  A cross-section is presented
in Figure 14-5.

Silver Envelope
Following  the  resampling  of  a  substantial  amount  of  historical  Anaconda  core,  it  became  possible  to  assess  silver  and  gold
spatially.  Analysis of the data suggested that there was a distinct break in grades around the 0.6 ppm Ag threshold.  This allowed for the
creation of a relatively coherent 3D shape (Figure 14-6).

Analysis – Copper Envelope
 
All variables were analyzed with respect to the copper envelope: summary statistics are presented in Table 14-1.  In all cases, there is a clear
distinction between what is inside and outside the envelope supporting its use in the estimation process.  Further support is given in the
contact plot shown in Figure 14-7, which reveals that when aggregating all data relative to the contact, there is a distinct, sharp drop in grade
upon crossing the boundary.  Note that the statistics presented below are for the final composites, and that preliminary testwork showed
similar results.

Analysis – Silver Envelope
 
As with both the copper and molybdenum envelopes, there are two distinct grade populations for silver inside and outside the 0.6 ppm Ag
envelope.
 
Analysis – Lithological, Structural, and Sulphide Species Controls
 
Analysis of the grade profiles and summary statistics for structural, lithological, and sulphide species domains showed there was no clear
argument to include these features in the resource estimation process.
 
Final Domains
 
Following extensive analysis and test estimates, it was decided that the use of structure, lithology, and sulphide species was not supported
for estimation at the current stage of the project.  Grade profiles across these boundaries were not sufficiently sharp to warrant differentiation
at the estimation stage.  Similarly, preliminary variography did not support the use of such boundaries.  The only late change in the process
was the inclusion of a small modelled Qmp-d dyke in drill hole EG-AM-11-025.  This was the first intrusive encountered at Ann Mason that
was distinctly lower grade and more weakly altered than the surrounding granodiorites and quartz monzonites.  A small, limited 3D shape
was built to reduce the influence of this intercept in the higher-grade material and vice versa.  The shape was extended 50 m to 60 m laterally
from the drill hole.
 
The final domaining decisions for copper were:
 
 
 
  · two main zones: inside and outside the 0.15% Cu envelope
 
  · one small low-grade Qmp-d intrusive shape inside the 0.15% Cu envelope.
 
Molybdenum decisions were similar:
 
 
Page 14-10
· only estimate below the Singatse Fault
· only estimate below the Singatse Fault
· two main zones: inside and outside the 0.005% Mo envelope
 
  · one small low-grade intrusive shape inside the 0.005% Mo envelope.
 
For Silver and gold:
 
 
 
  · two main zones: inside and outside the 0.6 ppm Ag envelope
 
  · one small low-grade intrusive shape inside the 0.005% Mo envelope.
 
Domain codes applied to the composites and blocks are as shown in Table 14-3.

Compositing
14.1.3
 
QG performed several tests on varying composite lengths including 3 m, 5 m, and 10 m, for the 0.15% Cu domain.  Given that, two block
models were initially built with 10 m and 15 m bench heights, 5 m composites were the logical choice.  Table 14-4 shows that there was no
bias  present  in  the  compositing  process.    Composites  for  copper,  gold,  and  silver  were  separately  built  and  split  only  at  the  0.15%  Cu
boundary.  Molybdenum composites were split only at the 0.005% Mo domain boundary.  Gold and silver composites were split at the 0.6 ppm
Ag domain.

Top-Cuts (Capping)
 
Top-cutting is the practice of capping grades above a given threshold to that threshold.  The net effects of applying top-cuts are to reduce the
influence  of  outlier  grades  and  limit  the  quantity  of  metal  present  in  the  estimated  domain.    Decisions  on  top-cutting  rely  on  subjective
judgement, taking into account such considerations as the mineralization style, population distribution, the purpose of the estimate, and, if
possible, reconciliation history.
 
At Ann Mason, neither copper nor molybdenum are highly skewed, therefore no top-cutting was applied prior to estimation.  However, QG
considered it prudent to limit the impact of some very high grades by applying an outlier restriction.  This works by limiting the influence of the
samples above a threshold to a certain distance.  Table 14-5 lists the threshold and distances for samples estimated in the first and second
estimation passes.  The decision to choose 40 m was made through trial and error.  At distances greater than 40 m an unrealistic number of
blocks were being estimated with high grades than are unlikely to occur, given the short scale spatial continuity often associated with grades
at the tail of the distribution.

Variography
14.1.4
 
Spatial analysis for copper and molybdenum was undertaken using variograms in Isatis software.  Variograms were constructed using the
composite data, while variographic analysis for gold and silver was performed using Gaussian transformed data, with models subsequently
transformed back into raw grade values.
 
The experimental variograms for copper were restricted to the 0.15% Cu domain, molybdenum was restricted to the 0.005% Mo domain; and
gold and silver were restricted to the 0.6 ppm Ag domain.
 
In general, variograms were modelled with a weak anisotropy reflecting the orientation of the series of NW-trending faults (Section 14.2.4)
supporting the inference that mineralization is influenced by structures.  An example of a variogram modelled for copper inside the 0.15% Cu
envelope is shown in Figure 14-8.
 
 Figure 14-8
 
 
A summary of the modelled parameters for all elements is included in Table 14-6.  Note that gold and silver variograms were built as part of
the testing process, but QG decided not to estimate these variables.

Ann Mason Block Model 40 m x 40 m x 15 m
Block interpolation was completed using MineSight™ software.  All pertinent data were imported into MineSight™, including collar, survey,
assay and geology, and drill hole data and all wireframes and strings were generated using the same software.
 
Block sizes and model limits were set by QG, and are shown in Figure 14-9.  Some preliminary models were tested using a 40 m x 40 m x 10
m block size.  Potential mining configurations were factored in for the final model; therefore, block size was set to 40 m x 40 m x 15 m.  QG
considers blocks smaller than 40 m x 40 m to be unsupported by the current data configuration.
 
  Figure 14-9:
 
 
Grade  estimation  was  carried  out  using  ordinary  kriging  (OK).    All  estimations  were  performed  in  MineSight™  by  using  the  multi-run
functionality.
 
Copper was estimated within the 0.15% Cu domain, molybdenum within the 0.005% Mo domain, and silver and gold within the 0.6 ppm Ag
domain.
 
Estimation was performed with two estimation passes for all variables in all domains.  The first pass is relatively moderate in search radius,
with a higher minimum number of required samples.  The second pass had the search ellipse expanded, with a lower minimum number of
samples required for estimation.
 
 
Page 14-14
Search  neighbourhoods  were  optimized  using  an  iterative  testing  process,  generally  referred  to  as  quantitative  kriging  neighbourhood
analysis (QKNA) (Vann et al., 2003).
 
The  variogram  analysis  suggested  a  weak  anisotropy,  and  this  was  applied  to  the  search  ellipse  in  the  orientation  of  structures  and
mineralization (Figure 14-10).  For outside the copper domain, an isotropic search was utilized as this zone essentially had no obvious spatial
continuity.
 
  Figure 14-10:
 
 
In  general,  searches  allowed  a  maximum  of  between  28  and  40  composites,  with  7  to  10  samples  per  quadrant  and  a  maximum  of  10
composites from any one hole.  The kriging parameters for copper, molybdenum, silver, and gold are given in Table 14-7 to Table 14-10,
respectively.

Checking
 
Once the model was complete, a series of checks were made to ensure that the model was robust and fit for purpose.  The block model
checking consisted of:
 
 ·creating semi-local “slice” graphs for all variables, comparing input grades, and estimating grades in 120 m slices for easting and northing,
and in 50 m slices for elevation
·visually checking in section and plan, focusing on comparing drill hole grades with surrounding block estimates.
 
Slice graphs for copper showed a good relationship between the input data and output blocks (Figure 14-11 to Figure 14-13).  In these plots,
a  nearest  neighbour  (NN)  estimate  was  also  provided  as  a  proxy  for  the  input  data.    The  graphs  suggested  that  the  estimate  performed
properly and there were no obvious material errors in the estimation process.  Visually, the degree of smoothing in the estimate appears to be
appropriate (Figure 14-14).

Estimation of Bulk Density
 
A description of Entrée’s bulk density sampling program is provided in Section 11.6.  The program involved collecting 4,181 samples from a
representative  range  of  all  rock  types  included  within  the  model  using  the  industry  standard  wax-seal  immersion  methodology.    In  the
volcanics above the Singatse Fault, a single bulk density value (2.34) was used, based on 130 measurements.
 
Bulk Density Variograms
 
QG generated omnidirectional bulk density (BD) variograms inside the 0.15% Cu envelope and for the granodiorite outside the 0.15% Cu
envelope  (Figure  14-16).    There  were  insufficient  samples  to  generate  meaningful  variograms  for  the  PQM  outside  the  0.15%  Cu
envelope.  The two variograms have similar shapes and very high relative nugget effects.  The high nugget effects may relate partly to the
nature of the sampling (as discussed above), but it is also likely that the BD inherently has a high relative nugget effect.  Using this variogram
for OK will result in a highly smoothed estimate, but will reproduce the trend in the data.  Given the data limitations and the trend, OK is an
appropriate  method  compared  with  applying  default  grades.    Given  the  similarity  in  variograms  and  the  likely  gradational  nature  of  BD
boundaries, QG have chosen to krige all the material below the Singatse Fault in a single domain.

Note that it was given that one composite must be within 150 m of the block being estimated.
 
Initially, QG did not utilize a constraint for distance to the nearest sample (see above).  As a result, many blocks were estimated at large
distances from the sample data.  These blocks often revealed non-geological artefacts when visually examined on cross-sections (e.g., lines,
circles, etc.).  QG tested and visualized several distances before selecting 150 m as the maximum distance to a sample.  For the remaining
unestimated blocks, a default density of 2.59 was applied.  This was the average density of the kriged blocks.
 
Bulk Density Validation
 
QG validated the kriged bulk density estimate by:
 
 ·Comparing univariate statistics of the kriged densities to the declustered sample densities (Table 14-13)
 
 ·Slice plots of easting, northing, or R-L against the mean kriged and declustered (via NN) densities
 
 ·Visually comparing the kriged densities to sample densities on each 50 m E-W trending cross-section.

The univariate statistics and slice plots suggested that the kriging of density implemented as expected.  Due to the high variogram nugget, the
kriged estimate is highly smoothed and thus only a limited relationship between a given drill hole and the surrounding drill holes can be
given; however, the kriging appears to have worked as expected.

The resource was classified as Inferred or Indicated, taking into account confidence in the model, data spacing, and various complementary
geostatistical parameters, and based on a number of factors, as follows:
 
 ·Indicated: material inside the 0.15% Cu domain, with a spacing of approximately 100 m x 75 m or less and a slope of regression (a measure

·Inferred: material inside the 0.15% Cu domain with a spacing >100 m, but <175 m (i.e., the rest of the copper domain)
 
 
Page 14-23
· all material outside the 0.15% Cu domain was left unclassified
 
To fulfill the above criteria, strings were made for Indicated material on 50 m sections, using a combination of the slope of regression and
distance to the nearest sample in the block model.  An example section showing the distance to the nearest sample in a block
 
(Figure 14-17) and slope of regression (Figure 14-18) is presented below.  Strings were converted to solids for coding the model.

Consistency  of  mineralization  is  an  important  factor  in  being  able  to  classify  the  large  increase  in  the  Indicated  resource.    All  30  holes
completed by Entrée intercepted thick intervals grading 0.30% Cu or higher.  In addition, the confidence in the continuity of mineralization
from hole to hole has increased as infill results have been received and step-out drilling has proceeded westward.

The current Ann Mason Mineral Resource has been constrained by a Lerchs-Grossman economic pit shell generated by AGP, using the
following parameters:
 
 ·3-year trailing average gross metal values of $3.61/lb Cu, $14.94/lb Mo, $1,425/oz Au, and $27.91/oz Ag
 
  · metallurgical recoveries of 92% Cu, 50% Mo, 50% Au and 55% Ag
 
 ·mining costs: $1.09/t base cost to the 1,605 m level then increasing by $0.02/t/15 m bench below that level
 
 
Page 14-25
·process and general and administrative (G&A) costs of $6.12/t ($5.82/t process plus $0.30/t G&A)
 
  · pit slopes of 52° in the volcanic rock and 44° in the porphyry mineralization.
 
 ·The resources contained within this pit shell were reported in Table 14-14 at various cut-off copper grades.
 
 
14.1.8
 
Resources were summed using “block in/block out.”  Block volumes were converted to tonnage using the model coding for BD.  As shown in
Table 14-14, resources are reported for copper cut-off, not CuEq.  The Ann Mason pit-constrained resource has an effective date of August
14, 2012.

Mineral Resources were estimated using Gems 3D mining software version 6.3 (Gems) supplied by Gemcom Software International, and

14.2.2
 
AGP received drill hole data from Entrée for historical and recent drilling programs, and imported them into a Gems drill hole database.  The
data  was  provided  to  AGP  in  MS  Excel  workbook  format,  and  included  collar  location,  down  hole  survey,  sample  assay,  lithology  and
oxidation, RQD and core recovery, and bulk density data.
 
A  total  of  57  holes  comprise  the  drill  hole  database  provided  by  Entrée;  however,  50  were  used  to  complete  the  model  and  estimate
grade.  The twenty historical drill holes used in the model, were completed between 1960 and 2007, and consisted of diamond drilling and
reverse  circulation  drilling.    Thirty  drill  holes  were  completed  by  Entrée  in  2010  and  2011,  mostly  by  reverse  circulation,  with  six  holes
completed as diamond drill holes.  The seven holes that were not used in the resource estimate are either historical holes with no useful
sampling data or were sufficiently far from the deposit that they could be ignored.
 
The Anaconda sampling was tested for total copper only.  PacMag sampling was tested for copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver.  All Entrée
samples were tested for copper, and molybdenum, and the majority of the sulphide intersections were tested for gold and silver.  Acid soluble
copper was tested for select intervals in the Entrée holes as well.  The number and type of sample (RC or core) are presented in Table 14-15.

AGP modelled mineralization at Blue Hill based on all the available core and RC drill hole data.
 
Sectional interpretations outlining a zone above a cut-off of 0.1% Cu within the oxide and mixed material zones were provided by Entrée;
AGP  modified  this  interpretation  to  include  material  above  0.075%  Cu,  and  included  sulphide  material  below  the  limits  of  the  original
interpretation at the same 0.075% cut-off.

Domaining
The mineralization was defined by polylines prepared on NW-SE cross–sections, which roughly correspond to the drill hole sections, and the
vertices  of  the  lines  were  snapped  to  the  drill  hole  traces,  honouring  their  locations  in  3D.    The  interpretation  was  cross-checked  on
perpendicular sections, and modified locally to enhance the smoothness of the model in 3D.  The section lines were then tied together to form
a closed triangulated wireframe, which represented the mineralization.  The model captured most of the assays above the cut-off.  Some
samples that assayed above the cut-off were excluded from the model on the basis of lacking continuity of mineralization.
 
Two sub-horizontal triangulated surfaces were modelled from drill hole data and used to subdivide the initial wireframe into primary, mixed,
and oxide wireframes.  The ratio between acid-soluble copper and total copper was used as a guide for modelling the boundary between
sulphide and overlying mixed material.  Twenty-five of the thirty drill holes completed by Entrée in 2010 and 2011 were assayed for acid-
soluble copper.  A sharp increase in the ratio of acid-soluble to total copper was used as a modelling parameter to define the change from
sulphide material to mixed material.  Preliminary interpretations of mineralogy type, which were based on observed mineral assemblages,
were within a few metres for most holes, indicating that the logger adequately identified the mineral assemblage.  Five holes completed by
Entrée,  plus  twenty  historical  drill  holes,  were  not  assayed  for  acid-soluble  copper;  interpretations  of  the  boundary  between  primary  and
mixed material for these holes was developed on the basis of mineral assemblages observed in the core or chips.  The boundary between
mixed and oxide material was developed based only on mineral assemblages observed in the core or chips.
 
A surface representing the Blue Hill fault was modelled by AGP and used to cut-off the mineralization from barren material in the hanging wall
to the southeast.  The modelling of the fault was based on an interpretation provided by Entrée that was supported by field mapping and
drilling.
 
A non-mineralized dyke was modelled in the northeastern portion of the deposit that cross-cut mineralization.
 
AGP’s interpretation of the mineralized zone was reviewed and cross-checked against that prepared by Entrée, and was concluded to be
reasonable to use as a constraint in the preparation of the Mineral Resource estimate.  The final wireframes are illustrated in Figure 14-19 to
Figure 14-21.

Sample Grade
 
Histograms, probability plots, scatter plots, and contact plots, along with summary statistics and correlation charts, were used to analyze the
raw assay data within the domains.  These tools were useful in characterizing grade distributions, evaluating domain boundary modelling,
and identifying high-grade outliers.
 
Compilation probability plots illustrating the distribution of copper and molybdenum by domain are presented in Figure 14-22.  The top left plot
clearly shows that the distribution of copper is similar in all three domains.  The top right plot shows that the sulphide domain is the only
domain  with  molybdenum  mineralization,  albeit  low  grade.    Both  the  bottom  left  and  right  plots  demonstrate  that  gold  and  silver  are  not
present in significant quantities.

Contact profiles were reviewed to assess the continuity of copper grade across domain boundaries.  A soft boundary was observed between
the oxide and mixed zones, as well as between the mixed and sulphide zones.  The change in grade from within the mineralized zone to

outside of the zone is sharp, and supports the overall approach to modelling the mineralization above the 0.075% Cu cut-off.
 
RC vs. Diamond Drilling
 
AGP compared basic descriptive statistics of a selection of RC holes completed by Entrée, which were near core drill holes also completed
by  Entrée.    AGP  compared  copper  assays  using  box  and  whisker  plots,  and  the  means  of  the  two  groups  of  samples  and  observed  no
obvious bias between the RC and diamond drill core assays in the oxide and mixed domains.  The holes selected for the comparison did not
extend deep enough to complete an analysis in the sulphide domain.  RC holes EG-BH-10-001, 002, 003, 008, and 009 were compared to
core holes EG-BH-11-015, 016, 017, and 018.
 
 
Page 14-31
Twins of Historical Holes
 
Entrée drilled two twin holes to assess bias between the historical results and their own recent drilling.  One core drill hole and one RC drill
hole  (EG-BH-10-011  and  EG-BH-11-015)  were  completed  as  twins  of  a  historical  diamond  drill  holes  drilled  by  Anaconda  (D177  and
D200).  The number of available samples is not considered by AGP to be statistically significant.  AGP compared composited assay data and
observed the overall trend of mineralization to be visually similar; however, there was an overall bias.  AGP observed that over the same
intervals (three mineralized intervals were compared), the recent twins have average grades 10% to 30% lower than their historical twins
do.  However, after ignoring one high grade composite from a historical hole (D177), the average grades over the interval compared well with
the average grade from the twin hole.
 
To determine if there is a systematic negative bias in the recent drilling compared to the historical drilling, AGP recommends first resampling a
portion of the twin historical core (D177 and D200) using the current primary laboratory to perform the assay testwork.  If the new results are
closer to Entrée’s twin hole sample results, then AGP recommends resampling all of the historical holes and using those results for resource
estimation.  If the new sampling returns similar results to the original tests, then AGP recommends drilling a few more twin holes to confirm the
findings.
 
Core Recovery
 
Core  recovery  data  was  available  for  the  seven  diamond  drill  holes  completed  by  Entrée.    The  distributions  of  sample  recovery  were
compared by domain in a box and whisker plot, and the mean core recovery for each of the domains was 95%.  No issue regarding core
recovery was observed by AGP in the data, and all samples were treated with equal prominence.
 
Bulk Density
 
Bulk density testwork was completed by Entrée on eleven diamond drill holes.  AGP analyzed the data through the use of histograms, box
plots, and summary statistics.  The oxide and mixed domains were observed to have similar bulk density distributions, as did the sulphide and
waste domains.  Table 14-16 presents the median bulk density by domain.

AGP reviewed histograms and probability plots to determine the potential risk of grade distortion from higher-grade samples.  AGP capped
copper assays at 0.75%, which had very little effect on the sample mean, while only slightly reducing the CV.  Descriptive statistics of original
and capped copper grades in raw assays are presented in Table 14-17.  The capping level was supported by a natural break in the grade
distribution, as evident in Figure 14-22, and less than 1% of the samples were capped.  AGP also capped gold at 0.03 g/t and silver at
2 g/t.  No capping was applied to molybdenum.

AGP composited the raw drill hole assays to 5 m lengths, starting at the drill hole collars, and broken by the waste-to-mineralized-domain
boundary.  Composites were not broken by internal boundaries between oxide, mixed, and sulphide domains, since the grade profiles across
these zones demonstrated that they were soft boundaries.
 
Entrée sampled diamond core at 2 m intervals, and RC samples were 1.53 m long.  Historical holes sampled by PacMag were on 3.05 m
intervals.  Historical holes sampled by Anaconda were variable, and most of the holes had samples ranging from as small as 0.03 m to 7.62 m
in length; however, one hole (D261) had much longer sample intervals, ranging from 3.4 to 26.4 m.
 
There were very few missing intervals of copper assay results in the sampling sequence of small lengths, which were treated as zero grade
during the calculation of composites.  On the other hand, there are holes that were not tested for molybdenum, gold, and silver in the sulphide
domain where these elements were estimated.  Composites were not created where these elements were not tested.
 
 
Page 14-33
Compositing
Composites less than 2.5 m in length were added to the previous composite, thereby creating a dataset of composites ranging from 2.5 m to
7.5 m in length.
 
The  effect  of  compositing  reduced  the  sample  variability  while  having  very  little  effect  on  the  mean  grade  of  the  sample
population.  Descriptive statistics of capped copper grades in composites are presented in Table 14-18.

The block model was set up with a block size of 40 m x 40 m x 15 m, aligned with the UTM grid (i.e., no rotation), and with variables including,
but not limited to, the following:

  · pass number used to estimate grade for the block

The size of the blocks was selected to match the block model used in the resource estimate at Ann Mason (described in Section 14.1).  It is
supported at Blue Hill by the data spacing, the size and geometry of the geological domains, and consideration of the selective mining unit
(SMU).  The block model geometry is detailed in Table 14-19.

The wireframes were used to code to the rock type block model.  Any block with at least 50% of its volume filled by a wireframe was coded
with an integer code representing that wireframe.

Copper Grade
 
Blocks coded from the domains representing the mineralized domains were interpolated from the drill hole composites.
 
For all domains, capped inverse distance (ID), uncapped ID, and capped NN copper grades were all stored in blocks.  ID grades were also
estimated for uncapped molybdenum, and capped and uncapped gold and silver.
 
AGP did not evaluate the spatial continuity of grades using variography, as the spacing of the data is too great to give meaningful results.
 
To ensure local reproduction of composite grade trends, and to help control grade smearing, the resource model was interpolated using
multiple passes with successively restrictive search criteria.  Two passes were used to estimate copper grades in the mineralized domain,
both  utilizing  the  same  search  ellipse;  however,  the  first  pass  required  only  two  composites  as  a  minimum,  while  the  second  required  a
minimum of five composites.  Both passes used only the 20 closest composites in the estimate and not more than four composites from a
single hole.  The search ellipse was isotropic in plan view, with major and intermediate axes both 200 m (theoretically including up to five
section lines of drill hole data at 100 m spaced lines) and a minor (vertical) axis of 100 m.  The ellipse was sized in the horizontal direction to
find enough data, and its flattened shape was representative of the overall shape of the mineralized zone in the oxide and mixed zones.
 
 
Page 14-35
The low minimum composite requirement in the first pass enabled the estimator to interpolate grades of blocks using data from at least one
drill hole.  The second pass overwrote blocks only if data from a minimum of two holes was within the search ellipse.
 
In  the  oxide  and  mixed  domains,  99.9%  of  the  blocks  were  estimated  with  a  copper  grade  in  the  first  pass,  and  98.4%  of  them  were
subsequently  overwritten  by  the  second  pass.    The  few  blocks  not  overwritten  in  the  second  pass  were  located  at  the  perimeter  of  the
domains where mineralization was relatively narrow.  Only one block was not estimated.
 
In  the  sulphide  domain,  96.5%  of  the  blocks  were  estimated  with  a  copper  grade  in  the  first  pass,  and  37%  of  them  were  subsequently
overwritten  by  the  second  pass,  mostly  near  the  boundary  between  mixed  and  sulphide,  where  drill  hole  data  support  is  greater  than  at
depth.  Only 3.5%, or 175 of the total sulphide blocks, were not estimated with a copper grade.
 
For copper grade estimation, soft boundaries were applied between all mineralized domains for both passes, and no composite outside of the
mineralized  domains  were  considered  during  grade  estimation.    Molybdenum,  gold,  and  silver  were  estimated  for  blocks  in  the  sulphide
domain only and no composite outside of the sulphide domain was considered during grade estimation.
 
In the sulphide domain, several short drill hole intersections from Entrée holes were not assayed for gold or silver, and none of the Anaconda
drill holes were tested for gold, silver or molybdenum.  When estimating grades for these elements, the untested holes were ignored and not
replaced with zero grades.  Fewer blocks were estimated with grades for these elements due to missing data.
 
Bulk Density
Too few samples have been collected to interpolate bulk density on a block-by-block basis; global bulk density values were assigned to all
blocks on a domain-by-domain basis.  A value of 2.57 was assigned to all blocks in the oxide and mixed domains, and 2.62 were assigned to
all blocks in the sulphide and waste domains.
 
 
14.2.9
 
Four validation exercises were completed on the Blue Hill resource model:
 
 ·Visual comparison of block and composite grades on sections.  No discrepancies between block and composite grades were observed.
 
 ·Global comparison of contained metal between the ID and the NN models.  The NN model reported 11% fewer copper pounds above a
0.075% Cu cut-off.
Block Model Validation
Page 14-36
·Global comparison of contained metal between the capped ID and uncapped ID models.  The capping removed less than 1% Cu metal
above a 0.075% Cu cut-off.
·Local comparison of ID block grade to NN block grades using swath plots.  The ID blocks generally honour the distribution of the nearest
neighbour block grades, indicating that no local bias was observed in the model.  Any deviations noted corresponded to areas where there
are only a small number of blocks.
Classification of Mineral Resources
No errors were observed with the model that would affect Mineral Resource estimation.
 
14.2.10
 
Mineral resources were classified in accordance with the 2010 CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.  In
determining the appropriate classification criteria for Blue Hill, several factors were considered:
 
  · observations of grade and geological continuity on section
 
  · quality of input data and verification of historical results
 
  · NI 43-101/CIM requirements and guidelines.
 
The  deposit  is  at  an  early  stage  of  investigation.    Spacing  of  drill  holes  was  sufficient  to  reasonably  assume  continuity  of  mineralization
between drill holes; however, more drilling at tighter spacing is required in order to better understand local variability in grades and controls
on mineralization.  AGP concluded that blocks within the wireframe representing the mineralized domains could be classified as Inferred
resources, and AGP did not classify any block as Indicated or Measured.
 
14.2.11
 
Mineral resources were reported within a Lerchs-Grossman (LG) pit shell, generated by AGP, above a copper cut-off of 0.10% for the oxide
and mixed zones and 0.15% for the sulphide zone.  The general parameters of the LG pit are as follows:
 
 ·gross metal values of$3.61/lb Cu, $13.50/lb Mo, $1,100/oz Au and $15/oz Ag were used; after adjustment for payables, smelting, refining,
roasting and transportation charges, and transit losses as appropriate, the net metal prices are:

The Blue Hill Mineral Resource estimate has an effective date of July 31, 2012.  Mr. Desautels is the QP for the estimate.  The estimate is
summarized in Table 14-20, above marginal copper cut-offs, and within a resource constraining shell.
 
The sensitivity of the Mineral Resource estimate to changes in the copper cut-off is presented in Table 14-21.  Mineral resources that are not
mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

 Notes:The following notes should be read in conjunction with Table 14-20 and Table 14-21:
 1. Mineral resources are classified in accordance with the 2010 CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.
  2. Mineral resources are reported within a resource constraining shell.
 3. Mineral Resources do not include external dilution, nor was the tabulation of contained metal adjusted to reflect metallurgical recoveries.
 4. Tonnages are rounded to the nearest 10,000 tonnes, and grades are rounded to two decimal places. Rounding as required by reporting
guidelines may result in apparent summation differences between tonnes, grade, and contained metal content.
 5. Material quantities and grades are expressed in metric units, and contained metal in imperial units.
 6. The Blue Hill Mineral Resource is shown at multiple cut-offs to assess the sensitivity to cut-off grade.

Entrée retained BGC in association with AGP to undertake a geotechnical review of the proposed open pit.
 
The geotechnical review was limited to:
 
 ·a compilation and review of the available data relevant to geotechnical evaluations of the open pit slopes
 
 ·a summary of the project setting, including the engineering geology and hydrogeology of the study area based on the available data
 
 ·estimates of ranges of overall pit slope angles, based on existing open pits in similar geologic units, for use in the PEA-level pit
optimizations carried out by AGP
·
· groundwater elevations.
Data Compilation and Review
rock core from exploration drilling
·recommendations for geotechnical assessments of the proposed open pits, to be undertaken as part of a pre-feasibility level study.
 
The details of each component of the geotechnical review are provided below.
 
16.1.1
 
Data available for estimating open pit slope angles for the Ann Mason deposit was limited to the following:
 
 
 
  · the performance of the slopes of the nearby Yerington Pit
 
  · geological interpretations of the project area
 
 
 
Mr. Derek Kinakin and Mr. Warren Newcomen of BGC visited the project site from February 28, 2012 to March 1, 2012.  Available exploration
drill core from five holes in the Ann Mason deposit was reviewed and logged for geotechnical parameters.  The drill holes available for review
were mainly located in the mineralized zones, in the centre of the proposed open pits.  Drill core from the proposed pit slope areas was not
available.  In addition, much of the drill core reviewed had already been cut and sampled for assays.
 
Note  that  the  drill  core  was  HQ  diameter  and  recovered  with  “double  tube”  methods,  typical  of  exploration  geology  drilling.    This  drilling
method is adequate for the recovery of core for geology logging and assay; however, the core can be disturbed and broken by the drilling
process.  As such, RQDs logged by Entrée as part of their basic data collection may under-represent the in situ quality of the rock mass due to
this disturbance.  BGC supplemented Entrée’s data with observations of rock strength, fracture spacing, longest stick, and joint condition for
the sections of drill core reviewed (Table 16-1).

During the site visit by BGC, a tour of the Yerington Pit, in an adjacent property was conducted with Mr. George Eliopulos of Quaterra.  The
Yerington  Pit  was  mined  from  1953  to  1978  and  extracted  copper  oxide  and  sulphide  ore  hosted  in  rocks  similar  to  the  Ann  Mason
Project.  The Yerington Pit is approximately 250 m deep, with slopes developed in alluvium, and poor to fair quality weathered intrusive
bedrock.  Observed inter-ramp angles in the weathered bedrock varied from 40° up to 48° for inter-ramps heights of approximately 100 m,
exposed above the current pit lake level.  Toppling instabilities were observed in the some of the inter-ramp scale slopes.  In general, the
performance of the pit slopes appeared to be adequate, considering the age of the slopes and the lack of ongoing maintenance (i.e., pit
dewatering, water management, etc.).
 
An overview of the geological interpretations for the Ann Mason Project area was provided to BGC by Mr. T. Watkins and Mr. R. Cinits of
Entrée.  Building on the work of Proffett and Dilles (1984), Entrée has developed 3D interpretations of the main rock units and faults of the
area.  BGC was provided with DXF files for these 3D geological interpretations.  Entrée also provided PDF copies of preliminary geological
cross-sections for the Ann Mason and Blue Hill deposit for their review.
 
Entrée drilled a well in the Ann Mason deposit in July 2011 in an attempt to provide a nearby source of water for drilling.  Efforts to complete
the well were unsuccessful and the Company continued to utilize water purchased from the City of Yerington.  The details of the well are
available in the State of Nevada Division of Water Resources well log database.  Water levels for the well have been provided from a U.S.
Geological Survey water resources data report (USGS, 2012).  Two measurements of the depth to water in this well are available.
 
 
Page 16-2
District Geology – Geotechnical Perspective
Geotechnical data relevant to the open pit slopes is limited at this stage of study, which is typical of most mine development projects at the
PEA stage.  Entrée’s work on the geology of the site appears to be of good quality and their development of a fault model at this stage of study
is  commendable.    The  major  data  limitation  identified  is  a  lack  of  geotechnical  drilling  information  outside  of  the  mineralized
zone.  Geotechnical data in the area of the proposed pit slopes will be needed for future geotechnical evaluations.
 
16.1.2
 
The  geological  units  of  the  Yerington  District  include  Quaternary  alluvium,  Cenozoic  volcanic  rocks,  and  Mesozoic  intrusive  rocks  of  the
Yerington batholith.  The bedrock of the district is transected by a series of faults, which resulted in tilting and rotation of the rocks from their
original  attitudes.    The  mapping  compilation  of  Proffett  and  Dilles  (1984)  provides  a  good  overview  and  serves  as  the  basis  of  ongoing
interpretive work done by Entrée.
 
The  Quaternary  alluvial  deposits  include  silts,  sands,  and  gravels  from  lakes,  floodplains,  and  fans.    This  unit  overlies  the  volcanic  and
intrusive rocks of the district.  In the area of the Ann Mason Project, the thickness of these units ranges from 5 m to 15 m.  A limited portion of
the first bench on the west-northwest wall of the proposed Ann Mason open pit may encounter alluvium.  Slope design parameters for the
alluvial deposits have not been estimated as part of the current scope of work, and are not considered material to the geotechnical study of
the overall open pit slopes.
 
A series of Tertiary-aged volcanic rocks, including ignimbrites, tuffs, and lava flows, have blanketed the Yerington District.  These rocks are
exposed in the area of the Ann Mason Project, and overlie rocks of the Yerington batholith.  The volcanic rocks and underlying rocks of the
batholiths are tilted westward due to the regional faulting.  The volcanics are unmineralized, and represent waste rock to be stripped during
mining.    The  volcanic  rocks  are  mainly  observed  overlying  the  Ann  Mason  deposit,  and  are  separated  from  the  rocks  of  the  Yerington
Batholith by the shallow-dipping Singatse Fault.  The thickness of the volcanic rocks varies from less than 20 m to a maximum of 300 m
(average 100 m) in the area of the Ann Mason deposit.
 
A summary of the regional geology and structure is provided in Section 7.
 
16.1.3
 
The rock mass of the Ann Mason deposit may be divided into three main geotechnical units:
 
 
Page 16-3
Rock Mass Character of the Ann Mason Deposit
Tertiary volcanics (AM-VOL)
Structural Geology of the Ann Mason Deposit
granodiorite of the Yerington batholith (AM-GD)
1)
 
  2)
 
  3) quartz monzonite porphyry of the Yerington batholith (AM-QMP).
 
The AM-VOL geotechnical unit is composed of Tertiary volcanic rocks.  From core logging observations, the intact strength of the AM-VOL
unit was estimated to be medium strong (R3) to strong (R4) (Table 16-1).  The “joint condition” (Bienawski, 1976) ranged from 6 to 16, with a
median value of 12, and the RQD (Deere and Deere, 1988) was generally Poor.  Based on the estimated rock mass properties, the qualitative
rock mass rating (RMR) of AM-VOL is Fair.
 
The overlying volcanic rocks have limited the weathering of the underlying granodiorites and quartz monzonites, and as a result, there are no
well-developed  oxides  in  the  Ann  Mason  deposit.    The  AM-GD  geotechnical  unit  is  composed  of  unweathered  Jurassic  granodiorite
rocks.  This unit forms the south and west walls of the proposed Ann Mason pit, and is expected to be up to 700 m high.  From core logging
observations, the intact strength of the AM-GD unit was estimated to be Weak (R2) to Medium Strong/Strong (R3.5).  The “joint condition”
ranged from 6 to 16, with a median value of 12, and the RQD was generally Very Poor.  Based on the estimated rock mass properties, the
qualitative rock mass rating (RMR) of AM-GD is interpreted to be Poor.
 
The AM-QMP geotechnical unit is composed of Jurassic porphyritic quartz monzonite rocks of the Yerington batholith.  This unit forms the
north and east walls of the proposed Ann Mason pit, and is expected to be up to 1,000 m high.  From core logging observations, the intact
strength of the AM-QMP unit was estimated to be Weak (R2) to Medium Strong (R3).  The “joint condition” ranged from 12 to 20, with a
median value of 12, and the RQD was generally Very Poor.  Based on the estimated rock mass properties, the qualitative rock mass rating
(RMR) of AM-QMP is interpreted to be Poor.
 
16.1.4
 
Bedding is the main geological structure observed in the volcanic rocks of the Ann Mason deposit.  The bedding dips on average at 62° to
the west.  This west dip of the bedding is a result of the regional tilting due to the rotation of normal faulting.
 
The main faults of the Ann Mason deposit are the Singatse Fault, the Montana Yerington Fault (1.5 km east of pit), and several possible
southeast-striking normal faults.  The flat, extensional, concave Singatse Fault dips east at about 12° or less.  Originally a moderately-dipping
normal fault, it has been tilted by younger phases of faulting.  The Singatse Fault typically coprises an oxidized red gouge material.  The
Montana Yerington fault is located at the eastern edge of the study area, between the Ann Mason deposit and Yerington Pit.  This fault dips
approximately 50° to the east, and is an example of the younger regional basin and range style normal faults.  Up to ten southeast-striking
normal faults have been interpreted by Entrée near the centre of the Ann Mason deposit, and are included in the 3D geological model.  These
faults strike approximately 145° and dip 60° to 80° south; seven of the ten faults are interpreted over a distance of 330 m to 450 m (Figure
16-1).  If the spacing and continuity of these faults observed in the centre of the Ann Mason deposit is also found in the area of the ultimate
walls, toppling instabilities could develop in southwest walls of a potential open pit.
 
 
Page 16-4
All  of  the  identified  faults  may  include  significant  zones  of  highly  fractured  rock  and  gouge,  which  have  slicken  sided  discontinuity
surfaces.  The intact strength of the rock in the fault zones was typically Very Weak (R1) to Weak (R2).  The RQD was generally Very Poor to
Poor.  Based on the estimated rock mass properties, the qualitative rock mass rating (RMR) of the fault zones is interpreted to be Poor.
 
16.1.5
 
One 118 m deep attempted well was drilled by Entrée within the Ann Mason deposit.  Measurements taken in July and August 2011 indicated
that the water levels ranged between 66 m and 35 m below the current ground surface.  The well was plugged and abandoned following an
unsuccessful attempt to complete the well for the purpose of providing water for exploration drilling.  The recorded water level measurements
are not believed to be representative of the hydrology of the Ann Mason deposit.  At this stage of study, no information is available regarding
the hydraulic conductivity of the rock mass of the Ann Mason Project.

Preliminary Open Pit Slope Angles
16.1.6
 
At this preliminary stage of study, BGC has estimated pit slope angles for the Ann Mason deposit based on:
 
 ·Rock mass quality data from available drill holes; however, considering the limited data, the drill holes’ location in the centre of the zones,
and the general disturbance of core from drilling, drill core data alone is insufficient to develop slope designs at this stage of study.
·Comparison of the Ann Mason deposit to existing open pit mines.  The open pit mines selected as analogues (Table 16-5) have similar
settings and sizes to that proposed for Ann Mason.
·Field observations of the Yerington Pit, particularly the bench and inter-ramp scale slopes observed by BGC during the field visit.
 
Slope design recommendations have been provided for the bench, inter-ramp, and overall slope scales.  With consideration of the preliminary
stage of study, the proposed size of open pit for the Ann Mason deposit, and the associated economic impacts of the pit slope angles, a range
of slope angles (Cases A, B, and C, shown in Figure 16-1) were provided for use by the mine planners.
 
The bench and inter-ramp scale designs (Table 16-2) represent a possible slope configuration that could achieve the overall slope angle
(Figure 16-2); other configurations may be possible, depending on the selection of equipment and the ramp access into the pit.  The maximum
inter-ramp height is limited at this stage of study to 150 m in the Ann Mason deposit; each slope segment is assumed to be separated by
ramps or geotechnical berms that may be wider than the standard berms.  For the current work, ramps and geotechnical berms are assumed
to be the same width.  The ramps or geotechnical berms must be wide enough to provide access for the installation and maintenance of
dewatering  wells,  piezometers,  slope-monitoring  prisms,  or  other  geotechnical  instrumentation.    Limiting  the  inter-ramp  slope  height  also
serves to limit the maximum size of potential inter-ramp scale slope failures.
 
In addition to the slope angles, BGC has summarized some of the typical activities undertaken at large open pit mines to manage the slopes
and achieve the recommended slope designs.  These activities may have capital and or operating costs associated with them.  Costs are not
provided for these activities as part of the current work; however, future stages of work may estimate costs associated with these activities.

Open Pit Database
 
BGC maintains a database of the slope heights and overall angles of operating open pit mines from around the world.  From the 148 slopes in
the database, 72 are from open pits that mine porphyry-related ore bodies; of those, five examples were identified of large (>700 m high)
slopes in mines which target copper porphyry ore zones hosted in granitic rocks
 
(Table 16-3).  While the rock mass quality in each mine is variable, the available descriptions of each mine from the literature (Sjoberg, 1996)
and BGC’s observations of the Ann Mason deposit drill core suggests that the selected cases are appropriate analogues for the current work.

28 to 46 degrees with average cohesion of 0.1
MPa.
Ann Mason Deposit Open Pit Slope Angles
 
The Ann Mason deposit is divided into two domains for estimating open pit slope angles
 
(Table 16-2):
 
  · slopes within the AM-VOL geotechnical unit (Domain I)
 
  · slopes within the AM-GD and AM-QMP geotechnical units (Domain II).
 
Based on the apparent rock mass quality and expected slope heights, the achievable overall angles in Domain I will be limited by the bench
scale slope geometry.  Bench face angles of 65° to 70° (67° on average) are assumed based on the generally fair rock mass quality in this
domain.  A single bench height of 15 m has been used, based on guidance from AGP and due to constraints from the grade model for the
zone; double benching may be possible in Domain I due to the Fair rock mass quality, resulting in a final bench height of 30 m.  With an
estimated minimum catch bench width of 11 m to manage potential rock fall hazards, the maximum inter-ramp angle is 52°.  Assuming that
the proposed 300 m high overall slope in this domain/rock type would be split into two 150 m-high inter-ramp segments by a double lane haul
ramp, the maximum overall slope angle would be approximately 50°.
 
 
Page 16-9
The achievable overall slope angles in Domain II are expected to be limited by the rock mass quality, and have been estimated for three
cases  (Cases  A,  B,  and  C)  based  on  the  range  of  overall  slope  angles  represented  in  the  database  compiled  by  BGC.    Domain  II  is
anticipated to be 1,050 m high; from existing pits with heights approaching this shown in Table 16-3, overall angles of 33°, 37°, and 41°
have  been  assumed  for  Cases  A,  B,  and  C,  respectively,  to  reflect  the  range  of  industry-achieved  pit  slope  angles  in  similar  deposit
types.  Bench face angles may range from 60° to 65° (63° on average) for these cases, based on our experience with benches in other
mines and our observations from the Yerington Pit.
 
A  single  bench  height  of  15  m  has  been  used,  based  on  the  grade  model  for  the  zone;  Domain  II  should  be  limited  to  single  benches,
considering the generally Poor quality of the rock mass observed during our review of the drill core.  Assuming a maximum inter-ramp height
of 150 m so that pit dewatering objectives can be achieved, a 14 m catch bench width is required for Case A (35° inter-ramp angle), an 11 m
catch bench width is required for Case B (39° inter-ramp angle), and an 8 m catch bench width is required for Case C (44° inter-ramp angle).
 
Open Pit Slope Management
 
Blasting
 
Controlled blasting should be assumed for all final rock slopes in the Ann Mason deposit.  Controlled blasting techniques may include trim
and buffer blasting or pre-split blasting.  The goal of the blast design should be to limit disturbance of the rock mass remaining in the final pit
slope.
 
Slope Monitoring
 
The current state of practice for slope monitoring in open pit mines in North America is based on a multi-tiered system, which may include the
following:
 
 
 
  · theodolites (robotic or manual) and a network of survey prisms
 
  · mobile or fixed slope stability radar equipment
· wire extensometers and inclinometers
·
visual inspections
·
piezometers.
Considering the proposed size of the Ann Mason open pit, multiple robotic theodolites would be required to survey the pit slopes.  Depending
on  the  number  of  active  mining  fronts,  two  or  three  slope  stability  radar  systems  may  also  be  required.    This  quantity  of  equipment  is
comparable to existing large open pit operations, such as Goldstrike or Bingham Canyon.
 
 
Page 16-10
· reduce the potential for wet blast holes
Pit Dewatering and Slope Depressurization
 
Dewatering of the open pits is required to:
 
 
 
  · provide a dry pit floor for good working conditions.
 
The proposed pit will likely be developed below the groundwater table, and dewatering will be required.
 
In addition to pit dewatering, a certain level of depressurization of the walls of the open pits will be required to maintain the stability of the
overall slopes.  In general, depressurization of bench scale and inter-ramp scale geological structures, which could contribute to potential
kinematic failures should be undertaken via vertical wells or horizontal drains, as appropriate.  Horizontal drains may be particularly useful for
depressurizing  the  pit  slopes  if  the  steeply  dipping  faults  (1-8)  interpreted  in  the  centre  of  the  Ann  Mason  deposit  are  found  in  the  final
walls.    Considering  the  size  of  the  proposed  open  pit,  a  dedicated  drill  rig  for  the  installation  of  horizontal  drain  holes  may  be
required.  Vertical in-pit and perimeter wells will be required, and some of these wells may have to be replaced as the pit expands and mines
them out.
 
Geotechnical Support Staff
 
Bench  marking  of  large  mines  undertaken  by  Flores  and  Karzulovic  (2002)  suggests  that  the  size  of  the  geotechnical  team  required  to
manage a large open pit excavation varies with production rate.  Open pit mines with production rates of less than 75,000 t/d generally require
no more than five staff on average.  Mines with higher production rates may require significantly more staff for geotechnical support.  It is
assumed  that  the  geotechnical  team  includes  engineers,  geologists,  and  technicians  responsible  for  ongoing  data  collection,  slope
monitoring, and slope design optimizations.  At this stage of study, a minimum five person geotechnical group should be assumed as needed
to manage the day-to-day geotechnical and hydrogeological work during operation of the proposed Ann Mason open pit.

Open pit mining was selected as the method to examine the Ann Mason deposit based on the size of the resource and the tenor of the
grade.  The grades are considered insufficient to support bulk underground mining.

The  resource  model  developed  by  QG,  using  MineSight  software  (Section  14)  is  used  as  the  basis  for  the  examination  of  the  open  pit
potential of the Ann Mason deposit.  From this original model AGP created an engineering block model with additional items for use in the
economic pit shell generation.
 
Table 16-4 shows the boundaries used for the model.

There are two major lithological units in the model: volcanics and porphyry.  As the geological model focused on mineralized material, not all
blocks were coded with a specific gravity.  The volcanics above the Singatse Fault are given a default SG of 2.35 t/m3.  For material below

the fault, but outside of the modeled mineralization, the default specific gravity is 2.59 t/m3.
 
All other grade items in the engineering model remain the same as in the geological model.  A volumetric verification analysis showed the
tonnes and grade of the mineralized material to be identical, providing the confidence necessary to advance work with the model.
 
16.2.3
 
To determine the potential size of a possible open pit, numerous preliminary input parameters were required.  These include estimates of the
expected  mining,  processing,  and  G&A  costs,  as  well  as  metallurgical  recoveries,  pit  slopes  and  reasonable  long-term  metal  price
assumptions.
 
Metallurgical testwork, discussed in Section 13, was completed in advance of the mine planning work.  The information resulting from this
work included expected recoveries of each metal, and estimated plant-operating costs (Section 21.2).  Metallurgical recoveries, shown in
Table 16-5 were used for generating initial economic pit shells based on a 140 µm grind size.

AGP prepared a series of anticipated process plant costs at a preliminary level for the economic pit shell development from 50,000 t/d up to
150,000 t/d in 25,000 t/d increments.  Lower production rates (below 50,000 t/d) in the processing plant were not considered practical, given
the size and grade of the resource being examined.
 
For the mining cost estimate, the same range of expected production rates were assumed and preliminary costs determined.  The incremental
haulage cost below the 1570 level was estimated to be $0.02/15 m bench of lift, irrespective of the production rate being considered.
 
G&A costs were also estimated for the various production rates.  The total G&A cost varies from $10.3 M/a up to $12.4 M/a for the different
throughput cases.  This cost included salaried and hourly personnel associated with the overall running of the operation, plus estimates for
bussing of employees, environmental monitoring, recruitment, and training, and other overhead expenses.  The labour force varied from 51
people to 62 people in this category for normal operations.
 
Labour costs were obtained from the InfoMine U.S.A., Inc. 2011 ‘CostMine’database for mines in Nevada of comparable size.

Pit  shells  were  initially  run  at  two  different  sets  of  metal  prices.    The  3-year  average  prices  as  of  September  17,  2012,  were  used  for
reasonable prospects resource constraint and to determine the possible boundaries for infrastructure.  The set, referred to as the engineering
base case prices were used for the design of the ultimate open pit.
 
 
Page 16-13
To  these  prices,  smelter  or  roasting  terms  and  transportation  costs  are  applied  to  generate  a  net  metal  price.    The  smelter,  refining  and
roasting terms are shown in Table 19-1.  Transportation costs for the copper concentrate were $60/tonne for truck haulage to the port, $5/t for
port costs and $23/t ocean freight.  For the molybdenum concentrate, a truck haulage cost of $65/t was used.  This net price is used in the LG
routine for pit shell development.
 
The metal prices used are shown in Table 16-7.

The  geotechnical  parameters  provided  by  BGC  were  used  for  the  initial  pit  shell  development.    Case  B  was  used  as  guidance  to  help
determine overall wall slope angles, as it represents average possible conditions.  Only two geotechnical zones were outlined: volcanics and
intrusive.  The volcanics have an inter-ramp angle of 52°, with a maximum height of 150 m, between geotechnical berms 32 m wide.  The
intrusive has an inter-ramp angle of 39°, with the same 150 m height, between geotechnical berms and 32 m wide.
 
An examination of the Ann Mason deposit indicated that a maximum of 320 m in height was possible in the volcanics, and that the intrusive
may be mined to a depth of 800 m below the volcanics.  These parameters were then incorporated into overall angle calculations.  For the
volcanics, the overall slope angle would be 48°.  For the intrusive, that angle would be 35.5°.  Those two angles were used in the pit shell
development.
 
A series of economic shells were developed using the LG routine implemented within the MineSight software (LG pit shells).  Operating costs
from  the  100,000  t/d  case  were  used.    All  runs  were  constrained  by  the  existing  property  boundaries.    The  results  of  the  two  pit  shells
generated at the two sets of metal prices are shown in Table 16-8.
 
 
Page 16-14
Further pit shells were generated using the remaining production cost scenarios shown in Table 16-8, using the engineering base case metal
prices shown in Table 16-9.  With the exception of the 50,000 t/d case, these ultimate LG pit shells were all essentially the same size with a
range of 95 Mt of feed.  The larger pit shells were all constrained by the property boundary, with the change in the feed tonnage resulting from
the slight change in mill cut-off internal to the pit shell.  The 50,000 t/d case was slightly smaller than the property boundary, resulting in mill
feed tonnage of 1,153.6 Mt grading 0.30% Cu.  At 50,000 t/d, this represented a potential mine life of 60+ years.

Based  on  these  results,  the  100,000  t/d  case  pit  shell  was  selected  for  detail  pit  design.    A  set  of  internally  nested  pit  shells  were  also
generated  by  incrementally  reducing  the  copper  price.    These  nested  pit  shells  were  then  used  to  guide  the  detailed  pit  phase  design
discussed below.  These detailed phases were used to determine more accurate operating and capital costs to be used in the economic
analysis.
 
16.2.4
 
Using the reduced copper price nested LG shells discussed above, a series of seven phases were designed.  These phases were sized
based on targeting tonnage for several years of mill feed, and sufficient width to accommodate the large mining equipment envisaged.  This
meant a minimum pushback or phase width of 80 m, with normal widths of 130 m or more.

Pit Design and Phase Development
The detailed pit designs were based on Case B of BGC’s slope recommendations.  The inter-ramp angles were 52° in the volcanics and 39°
in the intrusive.  To achieve these angles, the volcanics were double benched, while the intrusive was single benched, with both using an 11
m berm width.  Every 150 m vertically, an extra width geotechnical berm of 32 m was required in the overall design.
 
 
Page 16-15
For haulroad design, AGP considered the use of 360-tonne trucks.  This size of truck requires a ramp width of 38 m to allow proper double
lane traffic.  Double lane traffic in this case refers to three times the operating width of the trucks, plus room for berms and ditches.  Ramp
grades would be 10% for uphill loaded configurations, and 8% for downhill loaded (mining of the volcanics).
 
Seven phases were designed, complete with access to the ultimate pit shell for the 100,000 t/d case for purposes of the throughput trade-off
analysis.  The seven phases have been summarized in Table 16-9.

The milling cut-off was used as the lower grade for reporting tonnes and grade of the mill feed.  This cut-off is based on the metal prices
associated with the engineering base case and shown in Table 16-7.
 
The values for mill feed have been shown as in situ grades, but are considered to be sufficiently diluted.  The model block size is 40 m (E) x
40 m (N) x 15 m (elevation), which is significantly larger than the anticipated selective mining unit for the large equipment considered for
mining.  Contact dilution in the porphyry is expected to be minimal, due to the gradational nature of the contact between mill feed and waste.
 
The seven designed pit phases are shown in Figure 16-3 through Figure 16-9.

Phase 1
 
Phase 1 development utilizes the existing dry gulches as access to the higher portions of the pit phase.  These drainages are at 8% or less,
making them ideal for mining access roads.  The intent of Phase 1 is to initiate the mining and establish a small amount of feed for plant start-
up.  Access to the upper benches is maintained in the pit slope to ease development of Phase 2.
 
 
 
 
 
Page 16-17
Figure 16-3:
Phase 1
Phase 2
 
Phase 2 advances the mining to the north, utilizing the access left from mining Phase 1.  The overall pit is deepened to provide almost double
the  mill  feed  that  the  initial  phase  provided.    At  100,000  t/d,  this  phase  should  provide  approximately  three  years  of  feed  material  to  the
mill.  The strip ratio drops slightly, as a larger block of mill feed is exposed, and less pre-stripping is required.
Figure 16-4:
Phase 2
Page 16-18
Phase 3
 
Phase 3 continues the expansion of the pit in the northern direction with further deepening.  The highest point of the property is reached with
this phase.  As is the case in the previous two phases, the entry point for the pit is at the 1665 level.
 
 
 
 
 
Page 16-19
Figure 16-5:
Phase 3
Phase 4
 
Phase 4 predominantly develops to the northwest.  The overall pit is deepened, and the same height of land is mined as in Phase 3.  The
entry point for this phase is at the 1605 level, slightly lower than the previous phases as a result of the pit expanding westward down the
valley.  Phase 4 contains almost eight years of feed material at a delivery rate of 100,000 t/d.  Phase 4 has the lowest strip ratio at 1.91:1.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Page 16-20
Figure 16-6:
Phase 4
Phase 5
 
Phase 5 again mines deeper and further to the northwest.  The 1605 level is used to enter the pit area.  Mining at the height of land is lower
than in the previous phases, as the intersection of the pit and mountain has passed the crest.  Phase 5 contains slightly more than six years of
feed for a 100,000 t/d plant.  The strip ratio of Phase 5 is slightly higher than for Phase 4.  The LG shell used to guide this phase design is
equivalent to a pit shell with a copper price of $2.00/lb.  Phase 5 represents the ultimate pit for the PEA mine plan.
 
 
 
 
 
Page 16-21

Phase 6
 
Phase  6  is  a  concentric  expansion  of  the  existing  pit.    No  predominant  direction  is  developed,  but  the  overall  depth  of  the  pit  is
increased.  The phase has in excess of 8 years of mill feed material, but with a significantly higher strip ratio than Phase 4 and 5.  Significant
pre-stripping is required before feed from this phase is available for the mill.

Phase 6
Phase 7
 
Phase 7 is the final phase designed for this property.  It is bounded by the property boundary on three sides (north, east, and south).  The pre-
dominate direction for development in this phase is to the west.  Access is still maintained at the 1605 level as in Phase 6.  The strip ratio for
this phase is 3.16:1, as the mineralized material dips to the west, increasing the incremental strip ratio.

An east-west cross-section at Northing 4,317,720 is shown in Figure 16-10 with the copper grades greater than 0.1%.  Each of the phases is
shown in this section.  Phase 1 does produce mill feed, even though this particular section does not show any.  This section intersects the
Phase 7 pit at its deepest point.  The phase shapes highlight the deepening of the pit, initially followed by the westward expansion to target
the higher-grade portions of the deposit.

Production Rate Evaluation
16.2.5
 
Using the pit phase designs developed, mine schedules were created for rates of 50,000 t/d up to 150,000 t/d in 25,000 t/d increments.  For
each of the production rates, operating costs were estimated as shown in Table 16-6.  Capital cost estimates were made for the mine, mill,
and infrastructure.
 
For the net present value (NPV) calculation, the metal prices shown in Table 16-10 were used as a basis of comparison.

Mine capital expenditures include a standard support fleet using track dozers, graders, welding trucks, and other.  The larger units were
estimated on an annual basis with the following annual production capabilities:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With these estimates, annual major equipment requirements were estimated for capital costing purposes.
 
Each  of  the  cash  flows  was  compared  using  a  7.5%  discount  rate.    Table  16-11  shows  the  results  of  this  analysis,  which  is  based  on
preliminary and not final costs estimates.
 
A  review  of  the  results  shows  that  the  net  present  value  increased  as  the  production  rate  increased,  as  expected  with  bringing  revenue
forward.  No peak in the NPV was noticed, as is sometimes the case with smaller resources.
 
Significant  capital  requirements  are  needed  for  the  higher  production  rate  cases.    Cases  with  total  capital  in  excess  of  $2  billion,  were
considered too capital intensive in the opinion of Entrée.

· high grade – 0.20% Cu cut-off.
From mine scheduling iterations during the throughput trade-off analysis, it became apparent that although still economic, the higher strip ratio
Phases 6 and 7 were not improving the 100,000 t/d case NPV, and were therefore discarded for PEA mine planning.  Based on this, the
100,000 t/d Phase 5 case was chosen to advance forward in this study.

The value per tonne cut-off is calculated for each block.  It is equivalent to what is termed the milling cut-off.  The original pit is defined with the
net metal prices after smelting/refining, mining cost, processing cost, G&A, and metal recoveries.  That is termed the “mining cut-off.”
 
The milling cut-off works on the premise that once the pit is defined, material within the pit need only cover the process and G&A costs.  The
milling cut-off does not consider the mining cost, as that is already a sunk cost.  The material must be moved anyway, typically to the waste
management facility.  The material between the low-grade and high-grade cut-offs was stockpiled and processed at the end of the mine
life.  Table 16-12 shows the parameters used to calculate the value per tonne for each block.
 
The net metal prices were determined by applying off site costs.  These include smelting, refining, and roasting terms (Table 19-1) and the
cost of transportation of the concentrates to its final destination.  The copper concentrate has haulage to port costs of $60 /t, port costs of $5/t
and ocean freight of $23/t.  The molybdenum concentrate has a cost of $65/t for haulage applied.

When the resources for each phase were reported the following two cut-offs were applied:
 
  1. a base value per tonne (VLT) cut-off >$0.01 <0.20% Cu
 
  2.
 
The value per tonne calculation was used to define the lower end cut-off, as a simple Cu only cut-off would not properly account for the
variable grades of copper, molybdenum, silver, and gold.  While the other metals do not account for significant value in each block, they still
carry a portion of the overall block revenue that needed to be accounted for in each block.  The copper cut-off of 0.145% Cu is therefore an
approximation of what a straight copper cut-off would be.

This material was exported into the two bins and placed into the scheduling programs for each of the phases.
 
The 100,000 t/d schedule assumes annual production requirements of 36 Mt of mill feed.  The initial year of plant production is assumed to be
only 27 Mt, due to production start-up and commissioning.  All other years are scheduled at full plant capacity.
 
Five of the seven phases are mined for the final schedule, resulting in a mine life of 23 years.  As the bottom of Phase 5 is being mined, full
production to the plant cannot be maintained.  Starting in Year 22, reclaim of stockpiled low-grade material is required to maintain the plant at
full capacity.  In Year 22, a total of 7.8 Mt is reclaimed.  Year 23 requires 28.7 Mt of reclaim from the stockpile.  The final year of processing,
Year 24 is completed with only stockpile material; the plant will run for just over six months before the stockpile will be exhausted.
 
 
Page 16-27
Three years of pre-strip are required prior to plant commissioning.  Phases 1 and 2 start in Year -3, followed by Phase 3 in Year -2.  This early
start is required to ensure sufficient feed material is available for the mill.  The waste rock will be used as construction material for the two
tailings dams near the open pit and for haul roads around the site.
 
Waste stripping is maintained at its highest level in Years -1 to Year 7, where an average of 128 Mt/a is mined.  This is predominately due to
the overlying volcanics above the deposit.  Waste stripping then drops to an average level of 87 Mt/a for Years 8 to 14.  After Year 14, the
stripping requirements drop off until Year 20, at which time no further waste is mined and the bottom of the pit is above cut-off material.  Plant
feed tonnages are shown in
 
Figure 16-11, and plant feed grades in Figure 16-12.  Figure 16-13 illustrates the waste tonnage movement rate on an annual basis by phase.

Waste Rock Management Facility Design
16.2.7
 
For the purposes of this study, waste material from the Ann Mason deposit has been assumed to be non-acid generating.  A brief review of the
sulphur content was completed, but additional specific testwork will be required in the next stage of study.
 
Waste rock is scheduled to be hauled to the waste rock management facility (WRMF) to the southwest of the open pit for storage.  The initial
platform elevation is designed at the 1605 level.  The concept is to expand waste material to the southwest and also connect to the proposed
south tailings dam of the tailings management facility (TMF) at the same level.  In this manner, waste rock from the mine may be utilized for
construction in the two southern dams minimizing quarried material.  The rock will still require crushing and screening for placement in filters,
but the incremental cost of the haul is estimated to be less expensive than quarrying separate material.  With a large component of the waste
rock scheduled in the early years, being volcanics above the Singatse fault, this material should provide suitable rock for dam construction.
 
The 1605 level of the WRMF is developed until Year 7.  The facility will then start to increase in height after Year 7, reaching a maximum level
of 1665.
 
The haulage profiles for the waste rock from the upper levels of Ann Mason have been scheduled as downhill hauls, with reduced travel
speeds.  The remaining hauls are flat from the pit entrance, with a later uphill component.
 
Waste volumes for the facility are determined using a 30% swell factor.  The SG of the material is used to determine the bank volume, and
then the swell factor applied to obtain the loose volume required for storage in the WRMF.
 
The location of the TMF relative to the open pit is illustrated in Figure 16-14.  The two southern dams will benefit from the proximity of the
mine for their waste rock requirements.  The dam near the plant site will be constructed entirely of rock fill from the mine, while the southern
dam will be a mixture of waste rock and cyclone tailings.
The northern dam will require a quarry for its construction.  That dam will be constructed entirely of rock fill.  Due to the distance from the plant,
this was assumed to be the method of construction.  Later stages of study for the Ann Mason project will need to consider if that estimate is the
most cost effective for the overall project.  The smaller dams on the east side of the TMF are constructed entirely from rock fill.
 
All waste rock in the WRMF will be concurrently re-sloped and reclaimed.  The vertical spacing of the lifts (30 m) allows for efficient re-
sloping.

by: (a) incurring expenditures of $1,000,000, making cash payments of $140,000, and issuing 85,000 shares of the Company within three
years  (completed);  (b)  making  aggregate  advance  royalty  payments  totalling  $375,000  between  the  fifth  and  tenth  anniversaries;  and  (c)
delivering a bankable feasibility study before the tenth anniversary of the agreement.  The agreement is currently in good standing.
 
The location of the WRMF may be adjusted in the event Entrée does not exercise its option or the joint venture management committee does
not agree to the use of that portion of the joint venture grounds for the WRMF.

This section describes the parameters used to design a new copper-molybdenum concentrator for the Ann Mason deposit near Yerington,
Nevada, for the base case operating scenario of 100,000 t/d.
 
The fundamental design criteria have been developed using limited testwork, and should therefore be considered preliminary.
 
17.2.1
 
The Ann Mason concentrator is designed as a nominal 3 Mt per month plant.  Mine haul trucks will tip into twin primary gyratory crusher
stations designed for 86% availability.  Surge capacity between the mill and crusher stations is handled by two roughly 40,000-t stockpiles.
 
Material is drawn off the stockpiles using apron feeders.  SAG mill feed control will consist of variable speed feeders with mill feed size
distribution measurement.  The SAG mill discharge classification is achieved as follows:
 
 
Page 17-2
Process Summary
·A trommel screen (40 mm) directs oversize to a series of recycle conveyors and allows undersize to gravitate to the SAG mill discharge
sump.
·The trommel screen undersize material is further classified by a vibrating, multi-angle scalping screen, which cuts at 3 mm, with the oversize
recycling back to the SAG mill, and the undersize feeding forward to the ball mill circuit.
The scalping screen undersize flows by gravity to the ball milling circuit.  The ball mill operates in closed circuit with cyclones.  The cyclone
pack cuts at a P80 of ~120 µm, providing the required liberation for good flotation.
 
The cyclone overflow reports to the feed box of the rougher flotation circuit.  The rougher/scavenger flotation plant consists of nine tank cells
in series, with each cell having independent air flow control.
 
Rougher  flotation  concentrate  is  reground  in  a  ball  mill  to  a  P80  of  45  µm.    The  ball  mill  operates  in  closed  circuit  with  a  cyclone
cluster.  Cyclone overflow reports to the 1st Cleaner feed box.
 
The 1st Cleaner/Scavenger circuit consists of eight tank cells in series.  The 1st Cleaner Scavenger tailings are fed by gravity into the rougher
scavenger concentrate pump box.  The 2nd cleaner circuit consists of five tank cells in series.
 
The second cleaner concentrate is pumped to the conditioning tank in the copper-molybdenum separation circuit.  The molybdenum roughers
consist of six tank cells in series.  The molybdenum rougher concentrate proceeds through five stages of cleaning, with the last two stages in
column cells.  The tailings are fed counter-currently to the feed box of the previous stage.
 
Molybdenum concentrate product from the fifth cleaner stage of the separation circuit and copper concentrate (molybdenum rougher tailings)
are thickened and press filtered.  The copper concentrate is loaded onto trucks and/or stockpiled, while the molybdenum concentrate is rotary
dried and loaded into drums.
 
Flotation tailings from the rougher/scavenger circuit are thickened and pumped to the TMF.
 
Reagents are stored, mixed and distributed from a central reagents area.  Frother, collector, and promoter are pumped from the reagents area
to head tanks in the flotation section, from where peristaltic reagent pumps accurately dose to the process.

Detailed Process Description
17.2.2
 
Crushing – Area 100
 
Mill feed will be delivered to one of two primary tip locations by 360-tonne haul trucks at an average frequency of seven trucks per hour.  Peak
delivery rate is assumed to be 5,500 dmt/h.  Mill feed is discharged directly into the primary crusher throat.  This area is served by a 2,000 ft.lb-
class hydraulic rock breaker to handle oversize rocks.
 
The primary crusher can accept a top size of 400 mm and will run with a 200 mm open side setting.  Grizzly oversize enters the crusher and
after crushing discharges by gravity into a 30-tonne rail lined surge pocket.  An apron feeder is used to withdraw crushed mill feed from the
surge pocket onto a short sacrificial conveyor.  This conveyor discharges onto the main stockpile feed conveyor, which in turn feeds one of
two crushed mill feed stockpiles.
 
The crushed mill feed stockpiles provide a live capacity equivalent to roughly 18 hours of plant production.  Mill feed is withdrawn from the
stockpile via two lined discharge chutes and two apron feeders (one operating, one standby).  Each apron feeder is variable speed and
capable of providing the entire mill feed rate.  Each apron feeder discharges via a discharge chute onto the SAG mill feed conveyor.  The two
SAG mill feed conveyors feed two separate lines, each consisting of SAG milling, ball milling, and rougher/scavenger flotation.
 
Spillage and runoff in both the primary crusher building and the stockpile feeders tunnel is pumped to surface for appropriate handling.  The
primary crusher is served by a 20-ton capacity overhead maintenance crane.
 
SAG Milling – Area 200
 
From the stockpile discharge feeder, mill feed is withdrawn in measured quantities onto the mill feed conveyor.  This conveyor discharges via
the head chute into the mill feed hopper.  The SAG mill feed material size distribution will be monitored and controlled via a high-speed
camera system.
 
Each SAG mill (two total) is a 12.2 m diameter x 6.1 m long, grate discharge, semi-autogenous grinding mill.  Slurry and pebbles exit the mill
after passing through the mill discharge grate, and pebble ports onto a trommel screen fixed to the mill discharge trunnion.  Trommel screen
oversize material (pebbles) is directed by chute onto the SAG mill pebble conveyor for recycling.  Trommel screen undersize gravitates into
the mill discharge sump, where it is further diluted with water.  From the discharge sump, coarse slurry is pumped to the SAG mill scalping
screen  via  a  distributor  box.    Screen  undersize  slurry  gravitates  via  the  screen  underpan  through  a  sampling  plant  to  the  ball  mill
circuit.  Screen oversize material gravitates via the oversize chute back to the SAG mill for regrinding.
 
 
Page 17-4
SAG mill slurry spillage is collected in a drive-in sump, and then returned to process by a submersible slurry pump.
 
The milling area (SAG and ball) is served by a common overhead crane.  Relining is achieved using the common relining machine.
 
SAG mill grinding media is stored in a ball bunker located partway along the mill feed belt.  The bunker is served with a small spillage pump
and a ball loading crane and magnet.  Balls are added to mill feed at timed intervals via a ball loading chute.
 
Ball Milling – Area 220
 
After SAG milling, the particle size is further reduced to P80 -120 µm by conventional, closed-circuit milling in a series of two 7.9 m diameter x
11.5 m long overflow discharge ball mills (four mills total).
 
The SAG mill scalping screen undersize is split between two ball mill discharge sumps, whereupon it is combined with dilution water and ball
mill discharge before being pumped to the cyclone classification cluster for each ball mill.  The clusters consist of six 840 mm cyclones, five
operating, and one standby.
 
Cyclone underflow gravitates to the feed chute of the ball mill.  The cyclone overflow reports to a linear trash screen for removal of woodchips
and other tramp material prior to flotation.  The screened cyclone overflow stream gravitates to the flotation circuit.  The stream of woodchips
and tramp plastic from the linear screen is dewatered by a woodchip sieve bend before being dumped in a storage area.
 
The  screened  cyclone  overflow  reports  to  a  sampling  station  that  consists  of  a  sampling  launder  and  an  automatic  sampler.    Spillage
contained in the ball mill area is pumped to the mill discharge sump for re-treatment.
 
Ball mill grinding media is delivered to the plant in bulk, and is stored in the ball mill ball bunker.  The ball bunker is serviced by a crawl and
electric hoist arrangement, allowing balls to be lifted into a kibble using the ball loading magnet, and tipped into the mill via a ball loading
chute.
 
Rougher Flotation– Area 300
 
Screened cyclone overflow serves as feed to the rougher flotation section.  Each rougher/scavenger bank (four banks total) consists of nine
300 m3 cells operating in series.  Flotation air to each cell is supplied by flotation blowers via a low pressure manifold, and flow is controlled
by modulating valves and vent-captor type flow meters.  Pulp level is maintained by modulating dart valves.
 
 
Page 17-5
Rougher concentrate from the first six cells in the bank is pumped to the regrind mill discharge sump.  Scavenger concentrate from the last
three cells in the bank is collected in a common launder and pumped back to the rougher feed box.  Tailings from the final scavenger cell
report to a sampling launder, then to a primary sampler, and finally the rougher/scavenger tailings thickener.
 
Spillage in the rougher section is collected in a common sump and pumped back into the first rougher cell using a submersible spillage pump.
 
Rougher Concentrate Regrind – Area 320
 
Rougher concentrate from the four flotation lines are fed to the discharge box of two, 3.6 m diameter by 6.1 m long, regrind ball mills.  Each
mill discharge is pumped to a dedicated cluster of eight 380 mm cyclones (7 operating, 1 standby).  Cyclone overflow, with a target P80 of 45
µm, flows by gravity to the feed box of the 1st Cleaner flotation cells, while the cyclone underflow goes to the mill feed inlet.
 
A spillage pump is used to pump the contents of the area sump back into the regrind mill.
 
Cleaner Flotation – Area 330
 
The 1st Cleaner/Scavenger bank consists of eight 20 m3 tank cells in series.  Flotation air is supplied from a low-pressure manifold, and pulp
level is maintained by modulating dart valves.
 
The 1st Cleaner concentrate is collected from the first six cells in a common launder and pumped to the 2nd Cleaner feed box.  The 1st
Cleaner Scavenger concentrate is collected from the last two cells in the bank into a common launder and gravitates to the regrind mill pump
box.  Cleaner Scavenger tails slurry gravitates via a sampling launder and sampler to the Rougher Scavenger concentrate pump box.
 
The 2nd Cleaner bank consists of five 10 m3 tank cells in series.  Flotation air is supplied from a low-pressure manifold, and is flow controlled
by modulating valves.
 
The 2nd Cleaner concentrate is collected in a common launder and pumped to the copper-molybdenum separation conditioning tank.  The
2nd Cleaner tails flow by gravity into the 1st Cleaner feed box.
 
The  Cleaner  area  spillage  is  collected  in  bermed  areas  and  directed  into  the  cleaner  area  spillage  pump,  which  pumps  back  to  the  1st
Cleaner feed box.
 
Copper-Molybdenum Separation – Area 340
 
Second  cleaner  concentrate  is  pumped  to  a  3  m3  agitated  conditioning  tank,  where  sodium  hydrosulphide  (NaHS)  and  fuel  oil  are
added.    The  conditioned  pulp  overflows  to  a  bank  of  six  10  m3  tank  cells  in  series  that  constitute  the  molybdenum  rougher  stage.    The
molybdenum rougher concentrate is pumped forward through five stages of cleaning, with the underflow of each stage feeding by gravity to
the previous cleaner bank.  All of the flotation cells in the copper-molybdenum separation circuit are sparged with nitrogen gas, instead of air,
from a low-pressure manifold.
 
 
Page 17-6
The first, second, and third cleaning stages consist of three DR24 trough flotation cells in series.  The working volume of each cell is 1.4 m3,
and level control is achieved by dart valves at the end of each bank.
 
The fourth and fifth cleaner stages each consist of a single flotation column, 0.91 m in diameter and 6 m high.  Each column includes a
cavitation tube air sparging system, wash water system, and level control.  Concentrate collected from the fifth cleaner column cell is pumped
to the molybdenum concentrate thickener.
 
A spillage pump is used to pump the contents of the area sump back into the conditioning tank.
 
Concentrate Dewatering – Area 400
 
Final  copper  concentrate,  in  the  form  of  molybdenum  rougher  tailings,  is  pumped  to  the  copper  concentrate  thickener-sampling  box  and
sampler before entering the copper concentrate thickener for dewatering.  This thickener is equipped with a rake lift, bed level detection, and
bed mass monitoring.  Thickener overflow gravitates to the spray water tank for recycling, while the thickener underflow is withdrawn from the
cone by a centrifugal underflow pump and pumped forward to the copper concentrate storage tank, or recycled to the thickener feed if of
insufficient density.
The copper concentrate is pumped from the mechanically agitated storage tank to the pressure filter for dewatering.  Filtrate from the pressure
filter is directed to the concentrate thickener for recycling.  Manifold flush pumps withdraw filtrate from the filtrate tank and flush the filter feed
manifold between cycles.  Flushed manifold product gravitates to the filtrate transfer pump and is recycled to the thickener feed.  A cloth wash
tank and pumps allow high pressure washing of the filter cloth at the end of each cycle.
 
Copper  filter  cake  is  discharged  from  the  press  via  two  cake  discharge  chutes  onto  the  cake  transfer  belt,  which  transfers  cake  to  the
concentrate storage shed.  A front-end loader serves the cake stockpile and loads cake into side-tipping trucks that transport the concentrate
to a toll smelter.  Trucks are weighed and auger-sampled at the weighbridge prior to dispatch.
 
Molybdenum concentrate from the overflow of the molybdenum 5th cleaner column cell is pumped to the molybdenum concentrate thickener-
sampling box and sampler before entering the molybdenum concentrate thickener for dewatering.  This thickener is equipped with a rake lift,
bed  level  detection,  and  bed  mass  monitoring.    Thickener  overflow  gravitates  to  the  spray  water  tank  for  recycling,  while  the  thickener
underflow is withdrawn from the cone by a centrifugal underflow pump and pumped forward to the molybdenum concentrate storage tank, or
recycled to the thickener feed if of insufficient density.
 
 
Page 17-7
The molybdenum concentrate is pumped from the mechanically agitated storage tank to the pressure filter for dewatering.  Filtrate from the
pressure filter is directed to the concentrate thickener for recycling.
 
Molybdenum filter cake is discharged from the press via two cake discharge chutes onto the cake transfer belt, which transfers cake to the
rotary screw dryer.  The dryer includes an indirect, diesel-fired heater, inert gas blanketing system, and a wet gas scrubber.  Dried concentrate
is discharged to the feed hopper of a drum filling station.  The loaded drums are auger sampled, sealed, weighed, and shipped by truck to a
toll smelter.
 
Concentrate dewatering area spillage is recovered by pumping back to the respective concentrate thickener.
 
Tailings Dewatering – Area 450
 
The rougher scavenger tailings from the two process lines and the corresponding 1st cleaner scavenger tailings from that section are pumped
to the feed launder for one of two 45 m diameter high rate thickeners.
 
Thickener overflow gravitates to the process water tank, while thickener underflow is pumped to the final tailings tank.  Four centrifugal pumps
(two operating, two standby) transfer the tailings slurry from the tailings tank to the tailings dam.  Each tailings pump is served by a dedicated,
progressive cavity, high-pressure gland service water pump, pumping clean water from the clean water tank.  Area spillage is returned to
process by the spillage pump.
 
Services – Area 500
 
Process water is stored in two insulated 500 m3 tanks, and is distributed to the plant by the process water pumps.  Plant hosing/flushing water
is provided by the hose-down water supply pumps.
 
The process water tank is also used to feed the diesel-powered fire water pump from a separate (lower) offtake, thus guaranteeing availability.
 
Clean water is piped into the plant from wells and stored in the plant clean water tank.  From the storage tank water is pumped around the
plant for use as reagent mixing water, slurry pump gland seal water, and, as required, for mill lubrication system cooling.
 
 
Page 17-8
Plant and instrument air is provided by two compressors.  Air quality is maintained by a filter.  Instrument air is dried using a refrigeration
drier.  An air receiver is provided for compressed and instrument air lines, to allow for surges in demand.
 
Low-pressure air is supplied to the flotation plant by two separate blowers.  The blowers are fixed speed, with manifold pressure controlled by
a modulating valve on an exhaust line.
 
Reagents – Area 600
 
Collector – C3330
 
Sodium isopropyl xanthate (SIPX) pellets are delivered to site in 1-tonne bags and stored in the reagent storage area.  Bags are added to the
mixing tank via the reagent area hoist and collector loading chute.  Collector is mixed to 10% solution strength within the tank, and then
transferred to the storage tank, ready for distribution.  The storage tank capacity and solution strength allow a batch to be mixed every eight
hours.
From  the  storage  tank,  collector  solution  is  continuously  pumped  to  the  collector  head  tank,  which  in  turn  overflows  back  to  the  mixing
tank.  Peristaltic hose pumps meter collector solution to several addition points throughout the plant.
 
Reagent spillage is pumped to the tailings tank for disposal on the tailings dam.  The reagent area is served by a safety shower.
 
Collector – A238
 
Liquid collector A238 is delivered to site in 1 m3 totes.  As delivered (full strength) A238 is pumped directly to the dosing points by dedicated
peristaltic pumps.
 
Frother – MIBC
 
Liquid methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) is delivered to site in 1 m3 totes.  As delivered (full strength), MIBC is pumped directly to the dosing
points by dedicated peristaltic pumps.
 
Promoter – MX-3045
 
Liquid promoter MX-3045 is delivered to site in 1 m3 totes.  As delivered (full strength), MX-3045 is pumped directly to the dosing points by
dedicated peristaltic pumps.
 
Flocculant – Magnafloc 10
 
Flocculant powder is delivered to site in 1-tonne bags and stored in the reagent storage area.  Bags are lifted by the reagent area crane and
added to the flocculant powder hopper.  Powder is withdrawn by the flocculant screw feeder and blown through a venturi to a wetting head
located on top of the mechanically agitated mixing tank.
 
From the mixing tank, mixed flocculant can be fed forward to the storage tanks, or recycled back into the mixing tank to aid mixing.  Once
mixed, the flocculant should be left for several hours to hydrate.  A storage tank provides sufficient volume for storage of flocculant while the
mixed batch hydrates in the mixing tank.  From the storage tank, flocculant is pumped directly to the tailings and concentrate thickeners.
 
 
Page 17-9
Sparging Gas – Nitrogen
 
Liquid nitrogen is delivered in bulk form in tanker trucks.  The nitrogen is pumped from the truck to an on-site storage tank, where it will be
vaporized into a gas and distributed through a low-pressure manifold for use in the flotation circuit.
 
Activator – NaHS
 
Sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS) will be delivered to site as a 40% solution in tanker trucks.  The NaHS will be off-loaded by pump transferring
into the NaHS storage tanks.
 
Collector – Fuel Oil
 
Diesel oil will be delivered to the reagents area by the site fuel truck.  The diesel will be pumped from the truck into the reagent area diesel
storage tank, and distributed to the copper-molybdenum separation circuit by dedicated peristaltic pumps.
 
 
17.2.3
 
The following is a list of general process-specific installation requirements:
 
 ·All slurry pipelines will be self-draining and equipped with flushing and drainage facilities.  Dead legs will be avoided and the exploitation of
gravity flow as a transport mechanism will be practiced wherever feasible.
Process Installation Requirements
·A slope of between 5° and 10° will be applicable in the concrete spillage containment area, where the floors will slope towards the spillage
sumps.
·Concentrate launders will be open and designed to facilitate manual sampling with handheld sample cutters.
 
 ·Flotation cells are to be installed at a sufficient elevation to ensure that all process pump boxes are above ground level, with consideration of

·All slurry sumps will be sized to have a design residence time of at least 90 seconds and a minimum valley angle of 45°.
 
 ·Slurry pipelines will be sized to ensure slurry velocities of between 1.9 and 2.4 m/sec under normal operating conditions.
·All equipment will be designed to minimize spillage and maintenance and maximize availability.
 
  · A step height of 300 mm will be provided between each rougher/scavenger cell.

18.1
 
The Ann Mason mine project infrastructure consists of the following:
 
 
 
 
 
  · process plant, mobile equipment, and maintenance shops
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This infrastructure is required to support the 100,000 t/d open pit operation.
 
18.1.1
 
The  mill  is  to  be  located  to  the  northwest  of  the  open  pit,  northeast  of  the  waste  rock  management  facility  and  south  of  the  tailings
management facility.  The primary crusher, situated near the rim of the open pit, will feed material to the mill complex via an approximately
1.5 km overland conveyor.  Built in close proximity to the mill building will be buildings containing offices, warehousing, welding shops, a
services shop, a mine equipment/maintenance shop, and concentrate storage.  Refer to site plan Figure 18-1.
 
18.1.2
 
The concentrate storage building will be designed to store approximately one-week’s worth of concentrate production (approximately 10,000
tonnes).  The storage building will be unheated, and will consist of reinforced concrete floors and walls covered by an uninsulated fabric
structure to prevent windblown contamination.

Plant Site
Warehouse, Office, and Dry
18.1.3
 
The main warehouse, office, and dry will be located near the mill building.  The office section will accommodate administrative staff and
warehouse personnel.  The dry will accommodate all mine and process plant personnel.  The initial years of mining will see the peak in
labour force.  The average number of persons on the payroll for the first 10 years is expected to average 576, with a peak of 629 in Year 4.
 
18.1.4
 
The maximum fuel consumption early in the life-of-mine (LOM) will be approximately 79,000 L/d, projected to increase later in the LOM to
125,000 L/d.  Tank farm storage capacity will initially be 300,000 L at the beginning of the LOM, increasing to 500,000 L in year five as
demand increases.  The fuel storage tank area will be equipped with containment and spill basins.
Fuel Storage and Handling
Roads
Explosives Storage and Handling
18.1.5
 
The explosives storage and manufacturing facility will occupy an area of approximately 100 m x 100 m located along the tailings access road
at least 500 m from the mill.  All explosive related structures will be located within an appropriately barricaded and fenced area in accordance
with Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) standards.
 
18.1.6
 
The site access road is approximately 16 km (10 miles) from U.S. Highway 95-Alternate; approximately 5 km (3 miles) are paved, with the
remainder  unpaved.    The  roughly  10  km  long  unpaved  portion  of  the  road  will  require  upgrading  or  rerouting  of  sections  where
necessary.  The site will be provided with roads connecting the open pit to the main processing plant, service complex areas, and tailings
facility.
 
18.1.7
 
Approximately 53,180 m3/d of fresh water will be required to satisfy water demand for the process plant.  Tailings recycle water will make up
to 35% of plant process water requirements, with the remainder coming from a series of wells.
 
18.1.8
 
Water required for site services will be pumped from the well(s) to a water storage tank, treated, then pumped to the locations where service
water is required.  Potable water will be provided in bottled containers throughout the site.

18.1.9
 
The  sewage  and  waste  water  treatment  plant  will  be  a  self-contained  rotating  biological  contactor  (RBC)  treatment  plant,  complete  with
clarifiers  on  both  intake  and  outlet.    The  treated  effluent  will  be  discharged  into  the  designated  tailings  impoundment  area  during  the
construction period.  Once the mill begins operation, the treated sewage effluent will discharge into the mill tailings system.
 
18.1.10
 
A recycling policy to minimize both industrial and domestic refuse will be implemented.  Recyclable products will be stored at an appropriate
site storage facility and removed on a regular basis.  Waste products will be transported to a suitable landfill on site.
 
18.1.11
 
Electrical power for the site will be supplied from the existing NV Energy 120 kV transmission line in service just east of the town of Yerington,
NV.  A tap from this transmission line will be constructed along with roughly 10 km (6 miles) of new 120 kV line to service the site.  This
transmission  line,  rated  for  approximately  110  MW,  will  arrive  at  the  main  substation  at  site,  and  will  feed  the  two  main  substation
transformers.  Each of the two main substation transformers will be rated 90/120 MVA, and will be connected to secondary switchgear at
44 kV in such a way that either or both would be able to supply power to the site, as needed.
 
The 44 kV secondary voltage will be distributed throughout the site by a combination of cable ducts and aerial lines.  The mill will be serviced
by five substations, located strategically to accommodate high load concentration areas; the majority of these substations will be fed from high
voltage cable ducts originating at the main substation.  A separate 44 kV substation will be provided for the primary crusher facility using
redundant aerial feeds from the main substation.  Pit loads will be supplied by twin aerial lines originating at the main substation, and will
feature drop locations where portable pit power distribution substations (for shovel/drill loads) can be connected.  The remainder of the site
loads (office, shops, warehouse, reclaim, wells, etc.) will be serviced from a separate 44 kV aerial line networked throughout the site.
 
Backup power will be provided for any essential services of the mill as well as for other facilities at site deemed essential.  It is envisioned that
the backup power requirements will be provided by three or four stand-alone diesel generators strategically located within the site.

Tailings Management Facility
18.2
 
18.2.1
 
The proposed TMF is illustrated in Figure 16-15.  This arrangement provided the lowest height for the tailings dams and added security by
keying the tailings dams into rock contacts for increased stability.  Further study on this layout is required in later levels of study.
 
18.2.2
Design Basis and Operating Criteria
General
South Dam
Tailings Management Facility Embankments
The principal objective of the TMF is to provide secure containment of all the tailings solids generated by the milling process.  The  mill
throughput is planned at 100,000 t/d with 836.4 Mt milled of the 24-year processing plan.  Using a 1.28 t/m3 tailings density, the facility must
accommodate 653.4 Mm3 of tailings.
 
The TMF facility capacity at all stages of the mine life considers that a minimum of 10 m of freeboard is available to the dam crest.  The end of
mine freeboard is designed to be 5 m.
 
18.2.3
 
The tailings dam design for this study considers a total of four separate structures.  Three of these will be constructed entirely of rock fill with
the fourth a combination of rockfill and cyclone tailings.
 
The four dams are named:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The South Dam is the largest of the all the dams with a final length of almost 4 km.  It is located at the south end of the TMF.  The base of the
dam is at the 1525 elevation with the final height at 1650 elevation, yielding an overall height of 125 m.  The volume of this dam when
complete is estimated to be 94.6 Mm3, of which 21.8 Mm3 is rock.  This rock will be furnished by extending the haul of the mine trucks in the
early years to develop the starter dams.  The South Dam will be active for the duration of the mine life and is required at the start of the mine
production.
 
The North Dam is the second largest of the dams with a final length of 3.5 km and located at the north end of the TMF.  The base of the dam is
at the 1585 elevation and with a top of 1650 elevation resulting an overall height of 65 m.  The volume required for this dam is 26.5 Mm3.  The
North dam is not required until the start of Year 3, but once active is active for the duration of the mine life.

Tailings Distribution and Reclaim Water Systems
The Middle Dam is adjacent to the plant area and the third largest dam.  The dam is 1.3 km long with a base at the 1625 elevation and a top of
1650 elevation, providing an overall height of 25 m.  The volume of rock required is 3.3 Mm3.  The dam is not required until Year 16 when the
level of the tailings approaches the 1625 elevation.  Once active, it will remain thus until the end of the mine life.
 
The final dam is the Saddle dam in the northeast corner of the TMF.  This is necessary to ensure sufficient freeboard will exist after mine
closure.  The dam is entirely rock with a requirement of only 61,400 m3.  It will be constructed in the final years.
 
The downstream and upstream slopes of the dams are designed at 3.5:1 (H:V).
 
18.2.4
 
The tailings slurry will be pumped via a 5 km pipeline from the plant to the South Tailings Dam.  Tailings will be distributed to a series of
cyclones on the dam crest and used to construct the dam further.  Process water will be reclaimed from the TMF pond and returned to the
plant via a dedicated reclaim water pumpset and pipeline.
 
Both the tailings and water reclaim line will follow an access road from the plant to the tailings facility.
 
18.2.5
 
The TMF pond plays a key role in the site water management by providing buffering of process water, direct precipitation, and runoff.  The
impact of evaporation and a final water balance have not been completed for this study, but will be required in the next levels of study as the
project advances.
 
Costing for surface diversion ditches along the western edge of the TMF has been included in the capital costing.  This is to capture and
divert water away from the TMF without contact and released back into the environment.
 
Seepage collection ponds and pumping systems are considered in the costing for each of the dams.  This seepage will be returned to the
process plant via the reclaim water system or returned to the TMF.

Water Management
Plant/Mine Site Water Management
18.3
 
The plant site drainage will be collected in a settling pond with disposal to the process water pond.  Wash bay drainage will be directed to an
adjacent settling pond and pumped to the TMF.
 
Mine water collection will be pumped to a small settling pond near the primary crusher.  The water will be used for dust control on the road
surfaces.  Excess water will be sent to the TMF.
 
Surface drainage will be diverted away from the mine where possible to ensure contact with active mining areas does not occur. If contact
does occur, it will be directed to the mine settling pond.

Market Studies and Contracts

This section examines potential smelting and refining terms for the copper and molybdenum concentrates expected to be generated from the
Ann Mason deposit, elements that may affect the Project’s net revenue flow.
 
Increasing  demand  for  copper  in  the  Asian  markets,  commencing  during  the  late  1990s,  has  stimulated  the  expansion  of  processing
capacities for copper raw materials in Asia, and rationalized reduction and/or elimination of similar existing processing capacities elsewhere
in the international market.  The balancing of supply and demand is expected to continue where newly created processing capacity should
absorb much of the new copper concentrate production capacity that will be realized.
 
The quality of the mine’s product will influence the targeted regions for consumption, therefore stressing the importance of the Asian smelting
and refining growth on the overall copper concentrate market.
 
The  quantity  and  estimated  value  of  the  mine’s  product  will  allow  movement  of  product  to  multiple  regions;  therefore,  the  regions  and
consumers providing the least commercial risk and the optimum return to the Project should be considered.
 
The objective is to establish the estimated smelting and refining terms and conditions for the mine’s products, based on the analysis provided,
and to predict the estimated value for the Project.
 
19.1
 
The consolidation of major participants in the copper mining, smelting, and refining market will influence the characteristics of the copper
market, but should not adversely affect market demand for the mine’s product.  The product will be clean, with an average copper content of
30%, and the possibility of higher concentrate grades as the mine matures.  The annual quantity of product is average, and the mine life is
long-term,  estimated  at  twenty-four  years.    The  molybdenum  concentrate,  at  55%,  is  again  average,  and  should  pose  no  issues  for
marketability.
 
The mine should not compete directly with major producers such as BHP-B, RTZ, Codelco, Freeport, Vale, Anglo, Teck, Antofagasta, Xstrata,
or Grupo Mexico; however, it will be influenced by this group’s interaction with the major consumers in China, India, Japan, Korea, and the
Philippines.  Many of the above producers control or influence the operations of copper smelting and refining complexes.
 
 
Page 19-1
General Considerations
AGP recommends that the mine focus upon selective smelting and refining complexes that currently process copper concentrates along the
Pacific  Rim  or  the  United  States  to  reduce  transportation  costs,  but  terms  offered  for  silver  and  gold  content  could  determine  a  different
direction.  The anticipated silver and gold values indicate that it may be sufficient to cover the majority of the transportation costs.
 
The dried molybdenum concentrates will be contained in tote bags, which assist in the overall transportation of the concentrate.  Handling
considerations will be slightly different, but discussions on overall grade accountability and transit losses are applicable for both the copper
and molybdenum concentrates.
 
This report suggests that the mine consider distributing the sale of product among at least three smelters to minimize operational disruptions
risk and maximize leverage of negotiations.  Unless Entrée desires to link product sales with potential financing, the above strategy is highly
recommended.
Logistics must be examined; however, freight costs should not greatly influence the value of the concentrate.  The product value dictates
minimization of the amount of in-process inventory at the mine, in-transit inventory from mine to port, inventory in storage awaiting shipment at
the port, and inventory in-transit from shipping port to receiving discharge port.
 
Normal  deviations  in  moisture  content  and  the  methods  established  to  sample  and  determine  the  settlement  dry  weight  must  be  closely
examined and controlled.  Moisture samples should be taken when product is weighed and sampled for assays at the trailer or car discharge
in the storage area designated for loading the carrying vessels.  Care must be taken to immediately seal the moisture samples, and to follow
the established procedures for drying and determination of dry weight.  Sampling for assay determination should be examined, but will likely
follow normal procedures.  Samples are taken from the transit trailers or cars when departing the mine area, and absolutely upon loading of
the carrying vessel.  Here, a frequently calibrated static scale will be utilized before the trailers or cars are discharged at the storage area,
prior to loading of the vessel.  The trailers or cars must be recorded for tare weight, as well as total weight.  The storage area for loading the
carrying vessels must be very secure, and covered to protect from weather conditions as best as is possible.
 
Assaying, exchange of assay results, and the splitting limits for determination of settlement results must be professionally managed.  Dust
control and wash-down facilities for trucks and rail should be examined, as the Project should avoid unnecessary losses in handling and
transport.  Similar facilities install wash-down facilities for trucks prior to departing the loading area at the mine, as well as at the discharging
area prior to loading onto carrying vessels.  Transit trailers must be tightly covered to avoid wind losses during transit.
 
 
Page 19-2
Terms and Conditions Discussion
AGP suggests shipment in the smallest vessels conducive for the movements required, in order to minimize the in-process inventory.  The
alternative is to demand advanced provisional payments from consumers upon loading of the carrying vessel; however, this procedure may
not be acceptable to some or all consumers, and the consumer (smelter) will attempt to adjust the terms and conditions to reflect the loss of
interest and risk.
 
Professional  surveyors  are  recommended  at  loading  and  discharge  ports.    Professional  support  is  suggested  for  the  Project  to  assist  in
negotiating and drafting the commercial sales Purchase agreements for the product with the various consumers.  This practice would reduce
the exposure to a number of critical elements within the commercial agreements and define how best to manage and control the liquidation
process.
 
Potential smelting facilities for the copper concentrate include the Pacific Rim and the United States.  Smelting facilities exist within Mexico,
but their selection would be dependent upon their precious metal accountabilities and overall economics.  Pacific Rim countries would be
accessed via the port of Stockton, California.
 
19.2
 
19.2.1
 
The actual recovery of payable metals varies by smelting processes; treatment of precious metals and by-product streams; concentration of
payable elements within the standard smelting bed (the desired blend of concentrates entering the process); and the impact of deleterious
elements on processing efficiency, payable metal recovery, and deleterious element containment costs.  A smelter with minimal precious
metal  in  their  overall  feedstock  will  struggle  to  achieve  modest  recovery  of  the  precious  metals  when  compared  to  a  smelter  with  above
average precious metals in their feedstock.  Some smelters have efficient slag cleaning furnaces, while older facilities are not physically able
to improve precious metal recovery.
 
For the purposes of this study, the assumption was made that the precious metals of silver and gold contained within the copper concentrate
would be payable at 97% of the contained metal.
 
19.2.2
 
The proposed smelting and refining terms for each product are consistent with anticipated market trends, reflecting a rise in mine production
to compensate for the immediate market shortages, and higher than usual prices for each accountable metal.  No direct contact or definitive
smelter agreements have been obtained for the concentrate, although, after independent review, the concentrate would not be difficult to
market.  This is due in part to the higher copper grade in the copper concentrate and apparent lack of deleterious elements.  No penalties
need to be applied in the terms for the concentrate.

Summary
20 Environmental Studies, Permitting, and Social or Community Impact
 
20.1
 
Mining activities in Nevada are regulated by the NDEP.  Mining activities on public lands are administered by the BLM.  The Ann Mason
Project is located on both, private and public land.
 
MIM  and  Entrée  U.S.  have  conducted  exploration  activities  on  the  area  surrounding  the  Ann  Mason  deposit  under  an  approved  Plan  of
Operations  (Plan).    The  Plan  allows  for  exploration  activities  consisting  of  drill  sites  and  sump  construction,  road  construction,  road
maintenance, overland travel, exploration drilling, and bulk sampling for a total of 20.2 ha of surface disturbance over a ten year period.  In
order  to  approve  the  Plan,  the  BLM  prepared  an  Environmental  Assessment  (EA)  that  considered  the  potential  impact  on  the
environment.  The BLM determined that no significant impact to the human environment would occur due to the proposed exploration and a
“Finding of No Significant Impact and Decision Record” approving the Plan was issued.
 
Substantial environmental studies were conducted in the preparation of the above EA.  These studies documented that historic and pre-
historic cultural resources, habitat of certain special interest species of plants and/or wildlife, and other concerns exist or could exist near the
Ann Mason Project.  Through coordination with the regulatory agencies, conducting additional comprehensive environmental studies, prudent
project planning and design, and avoiding and/or mitigating potential project environmental impacts, Entrée anticipates being able to obtain
all necessary permits for development of the mine and to operate the mine in an environmentally acceptable manner.  Permits are discussed
in Section 20.3.
 
Entrée is not aware of any environmental issues that would materially affect the Ann Mason Project.
 
20.2
 
Various Federal, State, and local permits will be required for the development and operation of the Ann Mason mine, as discussed below in
Section 20.3.  All aspects of the mine must be designed and operated to avoid and/or minimize environmental impacts, as required by those
permits.  Air quality, water quality, and operating parameters will also be monitored, as required by those permits.  Specific details of the mine
design, operation, and monitoring will be developed through consultation with the appropriate agencies and through preparation of specific
permit applications upon completion of detailed designs in the prefeasibility study.
 
 
Page 20-1
Waste Disposal/Monitoring
Project Permitting Requirements
Seepage control of the TMF, as discussed in Section 18, will continue post-closure.  Seepage at the base of the WRMF will also be contained
and monitored.  If after analysis the seepage is suitable for discharge to the environment, it will be discharged.  In the event that the seepage
quality is not sufficient, it will be returned to the TMF
 
The TMF cover strategies are to be determined upon completion of detail designs in the Prefeasibility after additional testwork on tailings and
the ground water regime have been completed.
 
20.3
 
Mining  has  been  a  significant  business  in  Nevada  for  many  years,  and  many  mines  have  been  permitted  on  the  public  lands  in
Nevada.    Consequently,  the  regulatory  agencies  are  familiar  with  mining  activities,  and  complying  with  the  respective  agency  permit
application requirements allows permits to be issued in a timely manner.
 
The most important, time consuming, and costly permits/approvals required for the Ann Mason Project are:
 
  · Plan of Operations (PoO) approval by the BLM
 
 ·Water Pollution Control Permit from the NDEP – Bureau of Mining Regulation and Reclamation (BMRR)
· Reclamation Permit from the BMRR
· Air Quality Permit from the NDEP – Bureau of Air Pollution Control (BAPC)
 
 ·Special Use Permit from Lyons County and Development Permit from Douglas County.
 
Other permits are necessary, but do not require as much time or effort to acquire and can be acquired during the time period the above permits
are pending.
 
 
20.3.1
 
A critical step in permitting will be obtaining the approval of a detailed PoO from the BLM, which authorizes mining activities on the “public
lands” of the U.S.A.
 
Approval  of  the  PoO  is  considered  an  action  by  the  Federal  Government,  and,  as  such,  is  subjected  to  review  under  the  National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  Federal actions fall into one of five categories of NEPA review:
 
  1)
  2) actions which are categorically excluded from NEPA review
  3)
 
 
Page 20-2
actions which are covered by an existing NEPA review
Plan of Operations (PoO)
actions which are exempt from NEPA
4)actions which require the development of an EA to determine if the potential impact would be significant (if not significant then a Finding of
No Significant Impact or FONSI is reached through a Decision Record (DR))
5)if the potential impact is considered to be significant, then an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is produced to determine the impacts
and the finding is documented in a Record of Decision (ROD).
Development of the Ann Mason Project would most certainly fall into the last category requiring an EIS, and Entrée will request that an EA
review not be undertaken.  An EIS is first issued as a draft for public and agency review.  The BLM will be the Lead Agency under NEPA rules
and will request review of the EIS by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  A 2008 Memorandum of Understanding between the
BLM and the EPA is intended to facilitate the review and coordination of EIS level NEPA documents.
 
Other agencies (such as the NDEP and Lyon and Douglas Counties) will also participate with the BLM in the preparation and review of the
NEPA documents.  The BLM will consider all public and agency comments and issue a Final EIS.
 
The PoO must provide sufficient detail to identify and disclose potential environmental issues for the NEPA review.  Project components that
must be described in the PoO, as appropriate, include:
 
● mining method (open pit/underground)
● mine waste rock storage facilities
● mill feed storage/handling facilities
● crushing facilities
● processing methodology and facilities
● process ponds
● tailings disposal facilities
● haul roads
● other onsite roads
● water supply ponds
● employee information (number/shifts/travel/training)
 
 
Page 20-3
● water wells
● pipelines
● surface drainage control facilities
● electrical generation and transmission facilities
● other surface disturbances
● chemical storage facilities
● explosive magazines
● fuel storage/handling facilities
● noise
● light.
Detailed environmental and engineering information must be included in the PoO, and in other technical reports, describing the following
environmental elements:
 
● air quality
● cultural resources
● environmental justice
● floodplains
● geology and geochemistry
● land use authorization
● noxious weeds, invasive, and non-native species
● social and economic values
● soils
● special status plants and animals
● threatened and endangered species
● vegetation
● visual resources
● wastes (solid and hazardous)
● water (surface and ground)
● wild horses and burros
● wildlife.
● livestock grazing management
● meteorology
● migratory birds
● minerals
● Native American religious concerns
● paleontological resources
 
To address seasonal variability, up to 12 months of baseline data may be required for some of the above elements (such as water quality and
air quality).  Data acquisition for other elements (such as cultural resources) may require extensive fieldwork.  Seasonal aspects for some
environmental elements such as vegetation and wildlife must also be considered.  Baseline data must be submitted with the PoO.  Entrée
understands these requirements and is prepared to undertake the activities.
 
In order to approve Entrée’s existing Plan covering the area surrounding the Ann Mason deposit, the BLM prepared an EA that considered the
potential impact on the above resources as appropriate.  A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) and Decision Record (DR) were issued,
approving the Plan.  Even though an EIS is more thorough and involves more public involvement than an EA and the area to be included in
the EIS review will be much larger than that covered under the Ann Mason EA, no major, insurmountable issues are contemplated in the EIS
NEPA review for the Ann Mason Project.
 
Typically an EIS for a large mining project in Nevada can be expected to take 24 to 36 months to complete.  Entrée understands the EIS
process and the BLM requirements.  Entrée is committed to submitting the necessary documentation in a timely manner to reduce as much as
possible the time required for the review.  However, depending on circumstances out of Entrée's control, the time required to prepare an EIS
for the Ann Mason mine may escalate to three to five years.  Total permitting time, including acquisition of environmental baseline data, can
be expected to be three to five years.
 
 
Page 20-4
The BLM Carson City District (CCD) is currently preparing a comprehensive Resource Management Plan (RMP) and associated EIS to guide
management of BLM administered public lands (surface lands and federal minerals) within the District.  The RMP/EIS will be prepared as a
dynamic and flexible plan to allow management to reflect the changed needs of the planning area and will replace the existing Carson City
Field Office Consolidated Resource Management Plan (2001) and amendments.
 
The need for the CCD RMP/EIS is to respond to new policies, including but not limited to, energy, demand for limited resources, appropriate
protection  of  sensitive  resources,  increases  in  conflict  between  competing  resource  values  and  land  uses,  and  other  issues  that  have
surfaced since approval of the existing RMPs.  The overall objective of the RMP/EIS planning effort is to provide a collaborative planning
approach that assists the BLM in updating the management decisions of the current RMPs.
 
Mining is a large part of the BLM’s resource activities in the CCD, including the Sierra Front Field Office, which has direct management over
the public lands surrounding the Ann Mason Project.  Major changes in how the BLM manages mineral development activities on the public
lands are not anticipated.  The effect the development of the RMP/EIS will have on staff availability in the BLM Sierra Front Field Office is
unknown.
 
 
20.3.2
 
Water  Pollution  Control  Permits  are  administered  by  the  Regulatory  Branch,  BMRR,  NDEP,  Department  of  Conservation  and  Natural
Resources.
 
The Water Pollution Control Permit typically requires a zero discharge of potential water contaminants, which effectively requires containment
of all process fluids.  The application for a Water Pollution Control Permit requires a rather extensive amount of material.  Much of the required
information would be included in the PoO, but more specific information is required by the BMRR for some facilities.  The information must be
sufficiently detailed to allow the agency to determine the potential sources of water pollution, the methods to prevent water pollution, and the
methods to monitor to insure pollution does not occur.  A summary of the information required follows:

NDEP-BMRR Reclamation Permit
20.3.3
 
Reclamation Permits are administered by the Reclamation Branch, BMRR, NDEP, Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.
 
Reclamation requirements will be a substantial part of the PoO to be approved by the BLM.  Information required for the BMRR application for
a Reclamation Permit includes the requirements of the BLM.  Entrée will prepare a reclamation plan for the NDEP-BMRR, which will satisfy
both agencies.  The reclamation plan must include maps and drawings of all facilities and methods to reclaim each facility commensurate
with that facility.  It is important that measures be undertaken to salvage, store and protect topsoil/growth medium; prevent wind and water
erosion; ensure long-term stability of reclaimed structures; and return disturbed lands to a productive post-mining land use approved by the
BLM.
 
A reclamation bond must be posted with the BLM prior to surface disturbance and prior to the construction of facilities.  The bond may be
placed in stages depending on the particular mine phase.  The bond may also be recovered in stages as reclamation of mine facilities no
longer needed for operations are reclaimed to agency satisfaction.
 
20.3.4
 
The EPA has delegated the authority to issue Air Quality Permits to the state of Nevada through the Nevada State Implementation Plan
(SIP).  The SIP insures compliance with the federal Clean Air Act.
 
The permitting branches in the Bureau of Air Pollution Control issue air quality operating permits to stationary and temporary mobile sources
that  emit  regulated  pollutants  to  ensure  that  these  emissions  do  not  harm  public  health  or  cause  significant  deterioration  in  areas  that
presently have clean air.  This is achieved by stipulating specific permit conditions designed to limit the amount of pollutants that sources may
emit into the air as a regular part of their business processes.
 
Any  process  activity  that  is  an  emission  source  requires  an  Air  Quality  Permit.    An  emission  source  is  defined  as  “any  property,  real  or
personal,  which  directly  emits  or  may  emit  any  air  contaminant.”    An  air  contaminant  is  defined  as  “any  substance  discharged  into  the
atmosphere except water vapor and droplets.”
 
The following thresholds are a guide to the various air quality permit types:
 
 ·Class 1 – Typically for facilities that emit more than 100 st/a for any one regulated pollutant or emit more than 25 st/a total hazardous air
pollutant (HAP) or emit more than 10 st/a of any one HAP or is a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) source or major Maximum
Achievable Control Technology (MACT) source.
NDEP-BAPC Air Quality Permit
Page 20-6
·Class 2 – Typically for facilities that emit less than 100 st/a for any one regulated pollutant and emit less than 25 st/a total HAP and emit less
than 10 st/a of any one HAP.
·Class 3 – Typically for facilities that emit 5 st/a or less in total of regulated air pollutants and emit less than one-half ton of lead per year, and
must not have any emission units subject to Federal Emission Standards.
Lyon County/Douglas County Permits
· SAD – Surface Area Disturbance of >5 acres.
 
 The Ann Mason Mining Project will require a SAD permit for surface disturbing activities.  Depending on the amount of air pollutant
emissions for all sources of the Project, a Class 1 or Class 2 permit will be required.  Determination of the type of permit required will be
conducted early in the design stage of the mine.  A Class 1 permit application requires the collection of substantial meteorology data and
ambient air quality data, and also emission modelling.  The air quality permitting effort would run concurrently within the time frame of the
PoO approval process.
 
20.3.5
 
A Special Use Permit is required for mining operations in Lyon County.  The permit application will undergo a public process involving the
County Planning Commission and the County Commissioners for approval.  Public input is allowed.  The permitting process can be expected
to take up to three months after a complete application is filed with the County.  Much of the information for the application can be taken from
the BLM PoO and from various NDEP permit applications with additional information specific to county needs.
 
Lyon County is supportive of mineral development within the County and has promulgated the following policy:
 
Lyon  County  recognizes  that  the  development  of  its  abundant  Mineral  Resources  is  desirable  and  necessary  to  the  state  and  the
nation.  Therefore, it is the policy of Lyon County to encourage mineral exploration and development consistent with custom and culture and
to eliminate unreasonable barriers to such exploration and development, except for those that arise naturally from a recognition of secured
private property rights and free market conditions.
Under the current study, only a portion of the tailings impoundment would be located in Douglas County; however, mining uses, as defined in
Section 20.660.070 of the Douglas County Consolidated Development Code, include mineral processing.  Furthermore, all land disturbing
activities in Douglas County require a Development Permit.
 
 
Page 20-7
Social/Community Issues
Permitting  in  Douglas  County  can  be  expected  to  follow  the  same  general  procedure  as  permitting  in  Lyon  County.    The  Lyon
County/Douglas  County  permitting  efforts  would  run  concurrently  within  the  time  frame  of  the  PoO  approval  and  the  NDEP  permitting
processes.
 
 
20.4
 
In general, Lyon County and the state of Nevada are receptive to metal mining activities, and mining provides a large part of local and state
revenue.  Entrée will work with Lyon and Douglas Counties and nearby towns including Yerington, Weed Heights, Mason, and communities
in Smith Valley to reduce potential impacts.  The Special Use Permit and Development Permit required by Lyon and Douglas Counties,
respectively, are anticipated to specify conditions to reduce impacts on the Counties.  Entrée does not anticipate any substantial impacts to
social or community issues.
 
20.5
 
As described above, reclamation of mine activities will be a significant part of the BLM PoO and the Nevada BMRR, and plans for closure
must  be  approved  by  both  agencies  prior  to  initiation  of  mining  activities.    Entrée  will  work  with  both  agencies  to  develop  cost  effective
reclamation methods including reclamation concurrently with mine operations as appropriate.
 
Reclamation costs will be developed along with detailed mine development plans, and an acceptable reclamation bond will be posted with
the BLM.

The capital costs for the open pit mine are based on conventional open pit equipment for copper porphyries.  Rotary drills with 229 mm bits
will be used for the production drilling.  Haulage trucks with 360-tonne capacity were matched with 55.8 m3 electric cable shovels.  Support
equipment includes track dozers, graders, rubber-tired dozers, and additional ancillary equipment.  Table 21-3 and Table 21-4 show the open
pit capital breakdowns, by equipment and by period, respectively.
 
 
Page 21-1
Indirect and contingency costs for the open pit mine were estimated at 10% each.  Initial capital (Year -3 to Year 1) represents 49% of the life-
of-mine (LOM) capital requirements.  Pre-production mining costs were treated as an operating cost and therefore were not capitalized.

The total direct cost for the process plant is $421.6 million.  Indirect costs total $76.9 million, with the main sub-components being the EPCM
contract ($46.4 million), consumables and spares ($13.4 million), and site establishment ($9.3 million).  A contingency equivalent to 15.2% of
the direct costs has also been included.
 
Sustaining capital of $4.2 million is also included in the LOM capital, which brings the total direct costs of the process plant to $425.9 million
and a LOM total capital cost of $568 million.
 
The estimation method for the processing plant described in this study is presented in the following section.
 
21.1.4
 
Mechanical Equipment
 
 ·Estimated costs for major mechanical equipment (i.e., mills, conveyors, crusher, thickener, etc.) were taken from budget quotes from recent
projects and from database information.
Basis for Estimation
Page 21-3
·Major equipment weights (for installation costing) were provided by vendors or taken from database information.  Smaller equipment masses
were estimated using recent project data.
·An installation rate (per tonne) for each piece of mechanical equipment was based on an estimate of labour-hours required and rates from
similar projects in North America.
·Transportation costs for each piece of equipment used recent quotations for 6.1 m and 14.9 m containers.  All equipment shipped
transcontinentally is assumed to be packed in 14.9 m containers.  Transportation cost per item assumes a percentage of container volume,
and thus cost.
Civil Works
 
 ·An estimate of civil works costs was made by factoring from the mechanical equipment cost, based on recent projects of similar size and
scope.
Structural
 
 ·An estimate of structural costs was made by factoring from the mechanical equipment supply cost, based on recent projects of similar size
and scope.
· The direct cost includes transportation to site.

A 10 km power line needs to be built from the main power line at an estimated cost of $350,000/km.  A tap off the main line will cost in the
order of $1.2 million.  A number of substations will be required throughout the mine and mill area in addition to the distribution system.  This
amounts to a total of $45.4 million for electrical transmission, distribution, and substation infrastructure.
 
The equipment maintenance facility has been sized to accommodate the mobile equipment fleet.  Maintenance on the shovels and drills will
be handled in the field as required.  The shop will be a 15 bay configuration with electrical, welding, and tire areas to accommodate the large
equipment fleet.
 
The tailings dam component of the infrastructure cost is the initial construction costs of the dams.  In the case of the north, middle, and saddle
dams, the entire dams will be constructed of rock fill.  The south dam will be constructed of both rock fill and cyclone tailings.
 
The final total volume of material required for the south dam is 94.6 Mm3.  Of this, 30% will be rock fill with the remainder from cyclone
tailings.  The rock fill will be directed from mining operations in the pre-strip phase of the pit.  The tonnage required is based on 28.4 Mm3 of
rock; using an SG of 2.59 t/m3 and a 30% swell, this equates to 56.5 Mt.  An incremental cost of $0.50/t has been applied to the rock fill from
the mine to determine the capital cost.  This equates to a value of $28.2 million.  Additional to this is the cost of sand and gravel filters inside
the  dam  to  avoid  buildup  of  the  phreatic  surface.    The  cost  to  crush  and  screen  waste  rock  from  the  mine  has  been  estimated  at  $3
million.  The total cost of the initial south dam is the sum of these two costs, $31.2 million.
 
The north dam has a required volume of 26.5 Mm3 of material.  Using a rock specific gravity of 2.59 t/m3 and swell of 30%, a total of 15.8 Mt
will be required.  A quarry cost of $2/t has been applied to this for the cost of dam construction, for a cost of $31.6 million.  As part of the dam,
a series of filters and sized material will be used.  An estimate of $1 million in additional cost is included.  The dam is not required to be
complete until the end of Year 2, when the tailings level rises to the point of needing the dam.
 
The middle dam, adjacent to the plant site, is also constructed out of pure rock fill.  In this case the material will be provided by the open pit,
with  only  an  incremental  haulage  cost  of  $0.50/t  over  the  cost  to  haul  to  the  waste  rock  management  facility.    The  volume  required  for
construction has been estimated at 3.3 Mm3.  Using the same density of the rock and swell, that equates to a tonnage of 6.6 Mt.  With a
$0.50/t incremental cost, the rock portion of the dam is expected to cost $3.3 million.  The sand and gravel filters from sizing a portion of the
rock hauled will add an additional $1 million to the cost.  This dam is not required until Year 15 when the tailings level rises to that elevation.
 
The small saddle dam is constructed near the end of the mine life in Year 21.  This dam only requires a total of 61,400 m3 of rock or 122,000
tonne.  Due to its small-scale nature, a construction cost of $5/t was estimated, for a dam cost of $611,000.  Filters add an additional $100,000
to the cost of the saddle dam.
 
 
Page 21-6
Environmental
The  tailings  pipeline  and  reclaim  water  lines,  extending  electrical  power  to  the  dam,  and  dam  geotechnical  instrumentation,  have  been
estimated to cost in the order of $13.5 million.
 
Diversion ditches and small dams to divert the surface runoff were estimated to cost in the order of $4 million.
 
An overland conveyor is included in the infrastructure capital.  This conveyor is designed for 100,000 t/d and will extend level for 1.4 km.  This
conveyor allows the primary crusher to be placed near the pit to reduce the truck requirements for mill feed transportation.
 
Access roads to and around the site have been considered at a PEA level for costing.  The cost of the roads was estimated considering 10 km
of roads needing to be built, and existing roads to be diverted at a cost of $500,000/km.  The estimated 5 km of on-site roads, with their larger
width requirements and gradients, are expected to cost in the order of 5 km at $1/km or $5 million.
 
21.1.6
 
Daily environmental monitoring is included in the G&A cost category as an operating cost.  Concurrent waste rock management facility re-
sloping is considered a best practice for mining operations, and has been assumed and included as part of the mine operating cost.  It is
anticipated that, as lifts are developed, lower lifts and sections will undergo re-sloping.  The final sloping and closure of the mine is shown as
a capital cost item.  This cost was estimated at $37 million.  This includes fencing of the open pit upon closure, final re-sloping and seeding of
the  waste  rock  management  area,  removal  of  infrastructure  and  reclamation  of  site  areas,  and  reclamation  associated  with  the  tailings
management area.
 
Financial assurance regarding the reclamation has also been estimated, based on disturbed land on an annual basis.  It is expected to cost
$38.3 million for the bond interest.
 
21.1.7
 
The indirect costs, as previously noted, vary between capital cost categories.  Table 21-7 shows the percentages that were applied to each
category.  This is to account for various items, including construction supervision, erection of equipment, first fills, construction offices, and
others. Also included in the indirect costs are an estimate of some of the Owner’s costs associated with water rights and land purchases.

Operating costs were developed for a 100,000 t/d mining and milling operation with a 24-year milling life.  The pre-strip requirements add an
additional three years prior to milling commencement.
 
All prices in the PEA study are quoted in 3Q 2012 U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.  Diesel fuel pricing is estimated at $1/L using a
$100/barrel reference price.  This estimate was derived from a price quotation for off-road diesel fuel delivered to site with applicable taxes
considered.  The price for electrical power was set at $0.064/kWh, based on current Nevada industrial pricing.
 
The Ann Mason pit will be developed using conventional open pit technology, with large-scale equipment.  This includes rotary drills with
large electric cable shovels loading 360-tonne haul trucks.  The open pit has a LOM strip ratio of 2.16:1, with three years of pre-stripping
required to prepare sufficient material for continuous plant operation.  A total of 836.4 Mt of material will be fed to the mill over the 24-year
processing life.  A further 1,809 Mt of material will be placed in the waste rock management facility.
 
 
Page 21-8
Mill feed material will be available from Year -1 and stockpiled adjacent to the proposed primary crusher.  A total of 4.5 Mt will be stockpiled
and then reclaimed in Year 1.  Processing will be at a 100,000 t/d rate, with a brief ramp up period in Year 1, which assumes 75% capacity
from the mill in Year 1.
 
Stockpiling of lower grade material (<0.2% Cu) will start in Year 1 and continue at variable rates, depending upon higher grade availability,
until Year 21.  This material will be reclaimed in Year 22 until the end of the mine life to ensure plant capacity is maintained at its design rate.
 
The process plant is designed to operate at a nominal rate of 100,000 t/d.  The plant will use conventional grinding and flotation with a
molybdenum separation circuit to make separate copper and molybdenum concentrates.  Tailings will be pumped horizontally 5 km to the
tailings management area, where a portion will be cycloned to be used in the construction of the south dam.
 
G&A  costs  are  based  on  an  average  of  53  people;  16  staff  and  37  hourly.    Additional  charges  for  public  relations,  recruitment,  logistics,
bussing, etc. are also included in the G&A costs.  Mine employees will be located in the immediate area, and no camp will be provided or
required.
 
Concentrate  transportation  costs  are  estimated  using  values  from  logistics  firms.    Delivery  of  the  concentrate  will  be  by  bulk  trailers  and
hauled either to the port of Stockton, California, or by truck/rail to Coos Bay, Oregon, or Vancouver, Washington, for delivery to customers
overseas.    The  molybdenum  concentrate  will  be  stored  in  tote  bags  and  delivered  to  locations  in  the  United  States,  either  Arizona  or
Pennsylvania.
 
Port costs consider the handling of the bulk material, assaying, and cost of the referee on the concentrate grade.
 
Shipping to smelter cost is based on current seaborne rates for delivery to various smelters in the Pacific Rim for the copper concentrate.
 
Table 21-9 shows a summary of all the operating cost categories on a cost per tonne mill feed basis over the total mill feed tonnage.  Costs
associated with those items directly attributable to the concentrate are reported in cost per tonne of concentrate.

Mine  operating  costs  were  developed  from  base  principles  using  vendor  rates  on  equipment  and  current  production  rates  from  North
American operations.
 
Key inputs into the mine operating cost estimate are fuel, electricity, and labour.  The diesel fuel cost for this study was estimated at $1/L
based on a local quotation and using a world price of $100/barrel.  Electricity uses the current Nevada industrial rate of $0.064 /kWh.
 
Labour costs for the various job classifications were estimated using InfoMine U.S.A. Inc. 2011 “Cost Mine” information from large scale mines
currently in operation in Nevada.  Burdens were calculated to average 40% for both salaried and hourly personnel, based on a review of
current practices at Nevada operating mines.  Mine shifts are using a 12-hour shift schedule.
 
Open  pit  mining  utilizes  proven  technology  and  equipment.    Rock  drilling  is  accomplished  with  the  use  of  229  mm  rotary  blasthole
drills.    Material  loading  is  primarily  accomplished  with  electric  cable  shovels  with  dipper  capacities  of  55.8  m3.    Supplementary  loading
capacity will be provided by large front-end loaders with 40.5 m3 buckets.  Rock haulage is completed with a fleet of 360-tonne trucks.  To
assist  in  and  around  the  primary  crusher,  an  11.5  m3  front-end  loader  will  be  used  to  keep  the  area  clean  and  help  with  temporary
stockpiles.  The large equipment is required to maintain reasonable operating costs.  Track dozers, graders, and rubber-tired dozers round out
the  major  equipment  list.    Support  equipment  includes  water  trucks,  small  backhoes  with  rock  hammers,  utility  loaders,  pickup  trucks,
mechanics’ and welders’ trucks, pumps, and light plants.
 
Mine equipment requirements are highest in the early years with the initial removal of the volcanics overlying the deposit.  This peak stripping
period requires the full fleet from Year 1 to Year 10.  This includes thirty-two 360-tonne trucks, four cable shovels, and two large loaders.  As
the haulage distance increases (both in distance and lift), the strip ratio improves sufficiently that the capital replacement of trucks after 10
years does not require replacement of the full fleet.
 
 
Page 21-10
Major Mine Equipment Requirements
The large loaders are brought in initially in Year -3 to prepare the working areas prior to the arrival of the larger and more efficient cable
shovels.  As the mine matures in its development after the peak, the loader responsibility will fall to 10% of the mill feed tonnage and 10% of
the waste tonnage, although there are periods of higher utilization that will coincide with new phase establishment or the first 10 years of
production.

Mine engineering and general operating costs are included in the mine operating cost.  This covers the mine operations department, both
supervision and staff, and the mine engineering and geology costs.
 
Drilling in the open pit will be performed using rotary drills, each with 229 mm diameter bits.  The pattern size varies, depending on whether it
is for mill feed or waste to assist the plant operations.  The drill pattern parameters are shown in Table 21-11.

The slightly wider pattern for waste material was designed to provide coarser rock for the waste management facility.  The greater sub-drill
was included to allow for caving of the holes in the weaker zones, avoiding re-drilling of the holes or short holes that would affect bench floor
conditions, thereby increasing tire and overall maintenance costs.

Loading costs were estimated using the cable shovels as the primary material movers.  The front-end loaders play a key role in the first
couple of years in the pre-strip and preparation of the phases for the shovels.  The first two shovels start production in Year -2, with the
addition of a shovel each in both Year -1 and Year 1.  The average loading percentages by loading unit are shown in Table 21-14.
 
The trucks present at the loading unit refers to the percentage of time that a truck is available to be loaded.  To maximize truck productivity
and reduce operating costs, it is more efficient to slightly under-truck the shovel.  The single largest operating cost item is the haulage, and
minimizing this cost by maximizing truck productivity is crucial to lower operating costs.  The value of 80% comes from the standby time
shovels typical encounter due to a lack of trucks.

Haulage profiles were determined for each pit phase for the primary crusher or the waste rock management facility destinations.  From these
profiles, Caterpillar’s FPC software (FPC) was used to determine haulage cycle times.  These cycle times were applied to the appropriate
yearly tonnage by destination and phase to estimate the haulage costs.
 
Support equipment costs were determined using a percentage applied to either the truck hours or the loading hours.  As indicated earlier,
these percentages resulted in the need for four large track dozers, four smaller track dozers, four graders, and two rubber-tired dozers.  Their
tasks include cleanup of the shovel face, roads, dumps, and blast patterns.  The graders will maintain the plant feed and waste haul routes.  In
addition, three large water trucks have responsibility for patrolling the haul roads and controlling fugitive dust for safety and environmental
reasons.
 
The  equipment  rates  applied,  less  the  operating  labour  costs,  are  shown  in Table  21-15.    All  rates  include  consumables  such  as  fuel,
electricity, tires, drill steel, bits, and required maintenance parts.  Fuel consumption is estimated from basic principles and, where possible,
with the FPC software as a check.  Operating labour is calculated separately.

The mining cost is calculated by year to take into account changing haulage routes, and the resulting equipment requirements.  Sampling
costs were added to the mine operating cost.  It was assumed that every blasthole was sampled to help identify mill feed boundaries.  A cost
of $40 per sample was applied.
 
The LOM average cost for the total material moved is shown in Table 21-16.

Milling
 
The process plant operating cost is estimated at $184.6 M/a, or $5.13/t processed.  The majority of costs are confined to three areas: power,
reagents, and grinding media.  A breakdown of these costs by area is provided in Table 21-17.
 
Details of the estimating methods used for each of the major cost areas are discussed below.
 
Labour
Process Plant Operating Cost
Labour costs were calculated using typical plant staffing levels.  Pay scales were based on recent database rates.  The plant schedule is
assumed to be 12-hour shifts, with two shifts at site and two shifts on leave at all times.  Table 21-18 shows the estimated labour breakdowns.
 
The mill is estimated to require a total complement of 144 persons at an annual cost of $10.2 million, or $0.29/t.

The total connected power is taken from the mechanical equipment list, with load factors applied for each piece of equipment.  A power
supply rate of $64/MWh has been provided by the client.  This equates to an annual operating cost of $1.22/t of mill feed treated.
 
Reagents
 
Reagent costs were estimated using unit costs from vendors and consumption rates from the lab testwork.  A summary of the costs for each
reagent is presented in Table 21-20.  The total reagent cost amounts to $1.02/t of mill feed, or roughly 20% of the total operating cost for the
plant.

Maintenance and Supplies
 
An allowance for plant maintenance was factored from the mechanical supply cost for each area.  The cost includes transportation, but labour
costs for replacement, installation, and maintenance are included in the labour allowance shown earlier in this section.
 
Similar amounts were factored from the overall mechanical supply cost to cover electrical/instrumentation maintenance and piping.
 
Fixed allowances were included to cover minor costs associated with lubricants, assay lab supplies, and safety equipment.  Costs in this area
include training, monitoring equipment, first aid supplies, and personal protective equipment.  Shipping supplies covers the costs of drums for
molybdenum concentrate shipment.
Conveyor
 
The  conveyor  will  cover  a  length  of  1,400  m  from  the  primary  crusher  to  the  plant  site.    Costs  to  operate  the  conveyor  include  power
($1,095,000/a) and maintenance and wear parts ($345,000), including repair splices.
 
Tailings
 
The tailings management cost is independent of the process plant cost.  The cost for the tailings covers the expected cost from the outlet at
the plant to the TMF and the TMF’s operations.  The annual cost is expected to be $9 million, or $0.25/t.  This will cover the cost of the
cycloning  of  the  tailings,  water  reclaim  to  the  mill  and  maintenance  of  the  tailings  dam  and  subsequent  raising  of  the  dam  as  the  mine
progresses.

G&A costs include the cost of the 16 staff and 37 hourly employees.  Employees will be located in the immediate area, and no camp is
planned or required.
 
The  G&A  cost  in  the  cash  flow  starts  in  Year  -3  at  a  slightly  reduced  rate  during  mine  start-up,  but  reaches  a  maximum  value  of  $10.9
M/a.  The cost for G&A in Year 2 is $0.30/t mill feed, but the LOM average is $0.34/t mill feed, due to the G&A cost in the pre-strip period with
no offsetting production (Table 21-22).  As pre-production G&A costs were treated as an operating cost, they were not capitalized.

The copper concentrate is a bulk product.  An average of 336,900 dmt of concentrate will be produced annually, the initial five years having
an average production of 340,800 dmt.  The first five years average 947 t/d of copper concentrate, with the LOM average at 923 t/d.  It is a 310
km haul from the mine to the port facility at Stockton, California.  The cost to transport the concentrate to the port is estimated at $60/t.  The
port at Stockton is a bulk facility and can accommodate the concentrate, plus it reduces the losses from transferring the material from trucks to
rail cars.
 
 
Page 21-18
Concentrate Transportation

Other options include hauling the concentrate by truck to the rail siding near Reno, Nevada, and then railing it to either Coos Bay, Oregon, or
Vancouver, Washington.  These remain viable options for the concentrate as well.
A third potential, although not considered in this study, is to extend the rail line to Yerington to reduce the truck haulage.  This may work well
in conjunction with Nevada Copper’s Pumpkin Hollow project.
 
The copper concentrate will have on average a copper grade of 30% and have a moisture percentage of 8%.
 
The quantity of molybdenum concentrate will be significantly less than that of the copper concentrate, with a LOM average annual production
of 1,265 tonnes.  The molybdenum concentrate will be stored in 1-tonne super sacks, and different existing shipping possibilities include
hauling it to Freeport’s roaster in Green Valley, Arizona, or to Pennsylvania for roasting at the Thompson Creek facility.
 
The molybdenum grade is estimated at 50% with a 4% concentrate moisture.
 
21.2.6
 
The port charge has been estimated at $5/t of concentrate.

The copper concentrate is expected to be shipped overseas to countries in the Pacific Rim.  Current shipping rates are in the $23/tonne range
for 10,000 wmt units.  This has been applied to the study.

This  preliminary  economic  assessment  is  preliminary  in  nature,  and  it  includes  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  that  are  considered  too
speculative  geologically  to  have  the  economic  considerations  applied  to  them  that  would  enable  them  to  be  categorized  as  mineral
reserves.  There is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized.  Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do
not have demonstrated economic viability.
 
The tonnes and grades reported in Section 16 for the open pit phases were used in the discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.  The breakdown
of Indicated and Inferred material utilized in the analysis is shown in Table 22-1 for the benefit of the reader to highlight the percentage of

A  decision  to  use  100,000  t/d  as  the  production  rate  with  a  five-phase  sequence  was  determined  earlier  in  the  study.    This  provided  a
reasonable net present value (NPV) while maintaining LOM capital below $2 billion.  The waste management facility and other infrastructure
have been designed to allow further expansion of the mine design to include Phases 6 and 7 should it be decided in the future to include
them without incurring rehandling costs.

All mine development work was completed using what is termed as Engineering Base Case metal prices as described in Section 16.  The
DCF analysis was completed using different metal prices with low, base, high and spot price cases examined.  All of the prices in those
options were below the three year trailing average prices for each of the metals as of September 17, 2012.  The case metal prices have been
highlighted in Table 22-3.

The Base Case is the scenario chosen by AGP and Entrée Gold, with the other scenarios showing price sensitivities.  The results of the DCF
analysis are shown in Table 22-4.  The detailed cash flow sheet has been included in Section 22.3.
 
The results for the Base Case indicate the potential for a Pre-tax NPV at 7.5% discount rate of $1,106 million with an internal rate of return
(IRR)  of  14.8%.    The  payback  period  is  6.4  years,  with  payback  occurring  in  the  seventh  year  of  production.  The  Post-tax  NPV  at  7.5%
discount rate is $690 million with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 12.6%.  The Post-tax payback is 7.1 years.
 
Potential revenue from the various metal streams with the Base Case pricing had copper as the dominant value from the project at $14.6
billion or 93.2% of the total revenue.  This is followed by molybdenum at $449 million for 2.9% of the revenue, then gold $432.8 million (2.8%)
and silver $172.2 million (1.1%).
 
For the calculation of the metal revenue, the following metal terms, as shown in Table 22-5, were applied for smelting, roasting, and refining.
Various production estimates pertaining to the metals produced have been tabulated in Table 22-6.  This includes cash costs anticipated for
copper and molybdenum.

Sensitivity Analysis
22.2
 
The project sensitivity to various inputs was examined on the Base Case.  The items that were varied were recovery, metal prices, capital
cost, and operating cost.
 
The results of the analysis are shown in two spider diagrams, Figure 22-1 and Figure 22-2.
 
  Figure 22-1:
 
 
 
 
 
Page 22-5
Spider Graph of Sensitivity of NPV at 7.5% (Post-Tax)
Spider Graph of IRR Sensitivity (Post-Tax)
Figure 22-2:
 
 
The greatest sensitivity in the project is metal prices.  The base case prices that are used consider a price of copper at $3.00/lb.  Three-year
trailing average price for copper as of September 17, 2012 was $3.61/lb.  The base case copper price is 27% lower than the three-year
average.  A further 20% reduction of that price would see a copper price of $2.40/lb, eqivalent to the -20% sensitivity.  However, given the
higher copper price regime at present, the project economics benefit greatly.
 
The second most sensitive parameter is recovery.  To calculate the sensitivity to recovery, a percentage factor was applied to each metal
recovery  in  the  same  proportion.    Therefore,  while  sensitivity  exists,  actual  practice  may  show  less  fluctuation  than  is  considered  in  this
analysis.  Recovery testwork has not indicated recoveries in the range of 75% which the -20% change in recovery would represent.  As
copper represents 93.2% of the revenue, this large a swing in recovery has the obvious effect of influencing the project, but may not be
realistic.
 
 
Page 22-6
The  operating  cost  is  the  next  most  sensitive  item.    With  the  mine  being  a  bulk  mining  operation,  focus  on  this  cost  is  instrumental  to
maintaining attractive project economics.  Any opportunity to shorten waste hauls would have a positive impact on the project economics.
 
The least most sensitive item is capital cost.  While changes in the cost have an effect, in comparison to the other three parameters, its effect
is more muted.  If the capital costs go up by 20%, the post-tax net present value change from the base drops to $475 million from $690 million.
 
22.3
 
The  base  case  cash  flow  has  been  included  in  Table  22-7  and  Table  22-8.    This  includes  the  mine  schedule,  concentrate  calculations,
operating and capital costs, revenue estimates, and cumulative cash flow on which the NPV and IRR have been determined for both the pre-
tax and post-tax cases.
 
22.4
 
Federal  and  Nevada  State  taxes  have  been  considered  applying,  among  other  matters,  the  appropriate  depreciation  and  depletion
calculations.
Taxes and Royalties
Detailed Cash Flow
Taxable income for income tax purposes is as defined in the Internal Revenue Code and regulations issued by the Department of Treasury
and  the  Internal  Revenue  Service.    The  Federal  income  tax  rate  is  approximately  35%  in  accordance  with  Internal  Revenue  Service
Publication 542.
 
Nevada does not have a State corporate income tax.
 
Nevada has a Net Proceeds of Mining Tax, which is an ad valorem property tax assessed on minerals mined or produced in Nevada when
they are sold or removed from the State.  The tax is separate from, and in addition to, any property tax paid on land, equipment and other
assets.  In general, while the tax rate applied to the net proceeds is based on a sliding scale depending on the net proceeds as a percentage
of gross proceeds, the effective rate is 5%.
 
No royalties are applicable for the project as currently set out in the PEA at the time of writing.

23.1
 
The following is mainly summarized from three Technical Reports (Tetra Tech, 2009; Tetra Tech, 2012; and M3 Engineering, 2012 posted on
the  www.sedar.com  website  and  completed  on  behalf  of  Quaterra.    Many  of  the  lengths  are  originally  reported  in  feet,  but  have  been
converted  to  metres  for  consistency  within  this  report.    The  authors  of  this  Technical  Report  have  not  verified  the  information  presented
below.  The information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Ann Mason Project.
 
Quaterra holds rights to the Yerington and MacArthur projects, which are contiguous to each other in a north-south direction, and are adjacent
to the east of Entrée’s Ann Mason Project.  The Yerington Project is held by Quaterra’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Singatse Peak Services,
LLC (SPS), while the MacArthur Project is held by another wholly-owned subsidiary, Quaterra Alaska, Inc.  Together, these two projects cover
roughly 3,500 ha and host three principal mineralized deposits: Yerington, MacArthur, and Bear (Figure 4-2).
 
23.1.1
 
Quaterra has been exploring MacArthur since acquiring the project in 2007, and has completed over 60,000 m of drilling in 173 drill holes (58
core and 343 RC).  The drilling has outlined a 15 m to 46 m thick tabular zone of secondary copper (oxides and chalcocite) covering an area
of approximately 3.8 km2.    This  western  edge  of  the  defined  mineralization  occurs  approximately  1.5  km  east  of  the  Ann  Mason  Project
boundary.  According to Quaterra, the mineralized zone has only been partially delineated, and remains open for extension to the north, west,
and south.
 
The most common copper mineral is chrysocolla, with minor malachite, azurite, and neotocite.  The flat-lying zones of oxide copper mirror
topography, exhibit strong fracture control, and range in thickness from 15 m to 30 m.  Secondary chalcocite mineralization forms a blanket up
to  15  m  thick  that  is  mixed  with,  and  underlies,  the  oxide  copper.    Primary  chalcopyrite  mineralization  has  been  intersected  in  several
locations mixed with and below the chalcocite.  The extent of the primary copper is unknown, as most of the drill holes bottomed at 122 m or
less.
 
In May 2012, Quaterra filed a PEA for MacArthur based on the resource estimates shown below.  The PEA presented a solvent extraction and
electrowinning (SX/EW) mining scenario with the following highlights:
 
 
Page 23-1
MacArthur Project
·An open pit mine based on a subset of the acid-soluble Measured and Indicated Resources of 159 Mst at 0.212% Cu, and an Inferred
resource of 243 Mst at 0.201% Cu.
·Recovery of 747 Mlb of copper over the 18-year mine life at an average mining rate of 15 Mt/a.
 
  · Initial capital expenditure of $232.7 million.
 
  · Average LOM operating costs of $1.89/lb.
 
 ·An after tax NPV of $201.6 million at an 8% discount rate, and a base case copper price of $3.48/lb.  The project breaks even at a copper
price of $2.56/lb, and at $2.23/lb after the first three years when the capital is paid off.
· An after tax IRR of 24.2%, with a 3.1-year pay back.
 
As shown in Table 23-1, the currect resource estimate is dated May 23, 2012.  The results are reported as in the Technical Report, in short
tons.

The  Yerington  project  comprises  the  historical  Anaconda  Yerington  pit,  approximately  3  km  east  of  the  Ann  Mason  Project
boundary.  Quaterra acquired the Yerington Project from Arimetco in April 2011, and in the same year drilled 42 holes (6,671 m), including 14
core holes and 28 RC holes.  All of the core holes, plus four of the RC holes are twins of historical drilling, while the remaining 24 RC holes
are exploration holes.  The drilling program has tested or twinned both extensions and zones of previously identified oxide copper, chalcocite
enrichment, and primary sulphide mineralization.  Quaterra successfully verified assay data for 558 historical holes for inclusion in the current
database through records research, data capture, and the re-assay of selected remaining core from 45 Anaconda drill holes.  Results of the
2011 program allowed the company to establish a drill hole database suitable for converting and expanding the historical estimates into NI
43-101 compliant resources.

Mineralized porphyry dykes in the Yerington deposit are associated with three phases of intrusive activity related to the Yerington batholith,
and form an elongate body of mineralization that extends over 2,000 m along a strike of N62°W.  The mineralization has an average width of
600 m, and has been defined by drilling to an average depth of 76 m below the Yerington Mine pit bottom at the 1,160 m elevation.  Because
of the economic constraints of low copper prices at the time, many of the 558 historical Anaconda drill holes used in the Quaterra study were
stopped in mineralization, and very few were drilled below the 1,035 m level, where the porphyry system remains nearly unexplored.
 
Tetra Tech, Inc. (Tetra Tech) of Golden, Colorado, has completed an NI 43-101 compliant independent resource estimate for mineralization,
in  and  around  the  historic  Yerington  Mine.    Using  a  cut-off  of  0.2%  TCu,  the  Yerington  mine's  Measured  and  Indicated  primary  copper
resource totals 71.8 Mst averaging 0.30% TCu (430 M lb of copper), and an Inferred primary copper resource of 63.9 Mst averaging 0.25%
TCu (323 Mlb of copper).  Acid-soluble oxide/chalcocite mineralization includes a Measured and Indicated resource of 9.4 Mst averaging
0.30% TCu (57 Mlb of copper), and an Inferred resource of 8.6 Mst averaging 0.28% TCu (47 Mlb of copper).
 
The Yerington project also includes a portion of the Bear Deposit, another of the known copper deposits located in the Yerington District,
located about 4.5 km to the north of the Yerington pit.  Bear was discovered in 1961 by Anaconda during condemnation drilling in the sulphide
tailings disposal area.  The Bear Deposit does not outcrop, and chalcopyrite-bornite mineralization is hosted in a porphyry system below 150
m to 300 m of valley fill and unmineralized Tertiary bedrock, and below the low-angle Bear Fault (Doebrich et al., 1996).  Historical (not NI 43-
101-compliant) resources estimated for the Bear Deposit are more than 500 Mst of material averaging 0.4% Cu (Dilles, 1995).  The deposit is
known to extend beyond the boundaries of Quaterra’s properties, and the percentage of the deposit controlled by Quaterra is unknown.
 
Quaterra has announced plans to commence exploration drilling on the Bear Deposit in 2012.

The Minnesota iron mine is immediately (less than 100 m) to the north of the Ann Mason Project area, in the extreme northwest corner.  The
Minnesota Mine
following information is taken from Moore (1971).  The information presented below has not been verified by the authors of this Technical
Report, and is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Ann Mason Project.
 
The mine was originally developed as a copper deposit; however, only a small amount of copper was produced during World War I.  It was
not until World War II that iron was mined, and between 1943 and 1945 about 1,500 st were mined and used as high-density aggregate in
cement for ship ballast.  From 1952 to 1966, Standard Slag Company produced about 4 Mst of iron ore for the steel industry.  Initially, high-
grade direct ship ore was produced for the steel industry in Japan.  A magnetic concentrating plant was built in 1957, after which concentrate
was shipped.

In the Minnesota Mine, magnetite with minor pyrite and chalcopyrite, replaces dolomitic marble of the Late Triassic Mason Valley Limestone
(Dilles and Proffett, 1995).  This unit dips sub-vertically in the mine area, trends north-south, and is approximately 150 m thick.  Weakly altered
Jurassic porphyritic dykes are common throughout the area.  Magnetite ore is reported to have averaged 0.07% Cu and local molybdenite is
reported at deeper levels with quartz veining and silicification.

25.1
 
25.1.1
 
Since 2009, through a company merger with PacMag, option agreements, purchases and ground staking, Entrée has consolidated a group of
mineral claims west of the town of Yerington, Nevada comprising 1,053 unpatented lode mining claims and 20 patented lode mining claims,
covering a total area of approximately 8,005 ha.  Together these claims now form the Ann Mason Project and cover a significant area on the
west side of the Yerington Mining District, a historical copper mining district that covers the eastern side of the Project in Lyon County.
 
The Ann Mason deposit is a copper-molybdenum porphyry hosted by granodiorite and quartz monzonite.  Blue Hill is a copper oxide and
sulphide deposit located at approximately 1.5 km northwest of the Ann Mason deposit.  These and several other copper oxide and sulphide
targets are located throughout the Project area.
 
Since acquiring the Project, Entrée’s exploration work has focused on increasing and upgrading the Mineral Resources of the Ann Mason
deposit,  defining  initial  Mineral  Resources  at  Blue  Hill,  and  identifying  and  drill  testing  new  copper  targets  on  other  areas  of  the
Project.  Based on the favourable exploration results at Ann Mason, Entrée has recently shifted the focus towards the completion of this PEA.
 
25.1.2
 
Ann Mason
 
The Ann Mason deposit has the characteristics of a typical, large copper-molybdenum porphyry system.  Projected to the surface, the 0.15%
Cu  envelope  covers  an  area  approximately  2.3  km  northwest  and  up  to  1.3  km  northeast.    At  depth,  this  envelope  extends  more  than  a
kilometre below surface.  The mineralization remains open in most directions.
 
The  deposit  is  hosted  by  several  phases  of  the  Jurassic  Yerington  batholith,  including,  granodiorite  (Jgd),  porphyritic  quartz  monzonite
(Jpqm), quartz monzonite (Jqm) and younger quartz monzonite porphyry dykes (Qmp-a, Qmp-b and Qmp-c).  Copper mineralization primarily
occurs within a broad zone of main-stage potassic alteration containing chalcopyrite and bornite and an assemblage of chalcopyrite-epidote
or chalcopyrite-epidote-quartz mineralization that locally overprints main-stage potassic alteration and copper mineralization.
 
 
Page 25-1
Geology, Alteration, Mineralization
Within the Yerington district, Mesozoic host rocks and copper-molybdenum porphyry deposits have been rotated 60° to 90° westward by
Miocene  age  normal  faulting  and  extension.    As  a  result,  mineralized  intercepts  in  vertical  drill  holes  through  Ann  Mason  represent
approximately horizontal intervals across the original pre-tilt geometry of the deposit.
 
Within  the  0.15%  Cu  envelope  the  highest  grades  occur  within  a  200  m  to  800  m  thick,  west-plunging  zone  that  surrounds  the  intrusive
contact between granodiorite and porphyritic quartz monzonite.  Within this zone, the highest copper grades are dependent on vein density,
sulphide species, frequency and relative age of quartz monzonite porphyry dykes and the mafic content of the granodiorite.  Mineralization is
also closely associated with Qmp-a and Qmp-b quartz monzonite porphyry dykes.
 
The copper sulphide zoning is that of a typical porphyry copper with an outer pyritic shell, and concentric zones of increasing chalcopyrite and
decreasing pyrite progressing inward to a central zone of chalcopyrite-bornite.
 
Within  the  northeast,  southeast,  and  southwest  quadrants  of  the  deposit,  chalcopyrite  and  chalcopyrite-bornite  are  the  primary  sulphide
domains.  This mineralization is the most dominant in terms of overall deposit tonnage and continues to the drilled depth of the deposit.  In the
northwest quadrant, the primary sulphide domain is chalcopyrite ≥ pyrite; a domain that forms thick intervals of >0.3% Cu, with only minor
bornite  present  at  depth,  near  the  granodiorite-porphyritic  quartz  monzonite  contact.    Copper  mineralization  >0.15%  Cu  in  this  northwest
portion of the deposit coincides with a pyrite:chalcopyrite ratio of less than 7:1.
 
Chalcopyrite occurs as individual grains in veins and disseminated in rock, as fillings in brecciated pyrite grains, attached to or included in
pyrite grains, and attached to or included in bornite; bornite occurs as separate grains in veins, and disseminated in rock and attached to
chalcopyrite.  Chalcocite occurs as replacement rims on chalcopyrite, but more commonly as replacement rims or exsolution replacement of
bornite.
 
Molybdenum  occurs  as  molybdenite  in  quartz  veins  and  on  fracture  or  shear  surfaces  as  molybdenum  paint  in  several  of  the  copper
domains.  In the current resource model molybdenum is  constrained within a >0.005% Mo grade envelope that occurs almost entirely within
the 0.15% Cu envelope and extending further below, where sodic (albite) alteration has removed copper mineralization, leaving molybdenum
largely in place.  The molybdenum mineralization also remains open towards the north.
 
Silver ≥0.6 g/t and gold ≥0.06 g/t are closely associated with the occurrence of bornite within the chalcopyrite-bornite sulphide domain.
 
 
Page 25-2
Alteration types include a broad, main-stage zone of potassic alteration (secondary biotite, K-feldspar), an outer propylitic zone (chlorite and
epidote occurring with pyrite) and restricted late-stage overprints of sodic-calcic (chlorite+oligoclase±epidote), sodic (albite), sericite, zeolite
and gypsum.
 
Late-stage  sodic  and  sericite  alteration  occur  along  late,  high-angle  faults  and  as  local,  pervasive  alteration  of  rocks.    In  areas  of  strong
(>15%) albite or sericite alteration, the copper grades can locally be greatly reduced, resulting in copper grades < 0.2% and in places, <
0.05%.    Molybdenum  mineralization  is  not  significantly  affected  by  the  late  sodic  alteration,  beyond  partial  remobilization  from  veins  into
nearby fractures and shears.
 
Two prominent faultsform structural boundaries to the Ann Mason resource:
 
 ·The relatively flat Singatse Fault truncates the upper surface of the 0.15% Cu envelope over portions of the deposit and juxtaposes sterile,
Tertiary volcanic rocks on top of the mineralized intrusives.
·A high-angle, northwest-trending, southwest dipping fault located along the southwest margin of the resource juxtaposes chlorite-altered
rocks with pyrite mineralization in the hanging wall against potassically-altered rocks with copper-molybdenum mineralization in the
footwall.  Copper-molybdenum mineralization in the footwall remains open at depth along the entire strike length of the fault.
Other late, high-angle faults, either with or without sodic or sericite alteration, cross the deposit in various orientations.
 
Blue Hill
 
The Blue Hill Target is about 1.5 km northwest of Ann Mason and occurs in a very similar geologic environment, but in a separate fault
block.  Two main styles of porphyry mineralization have been identified here:
 
  · near surface, oxide/mixed-copper mineralization.
 
  · underlying copper-molybdenum sulphide mineralization.
 
Both  styles  of  mineralization  are  hosted  primarily  by  quartz  monzonite  with  lesser  amounts  of  porphyritic  quartz  monzonite  and  quartz
monzonite porphyry.  The low-angle, southeast dipping Blue Hill Fault strikes northeast through the middle of the target, cutting off a portion of
the near-surface oxide mineralization.  However, sulphides continue below the fault to the southeast.
 
The oxide zone is exposed on surface and has been traced by drilling as a relatively flat-lying zone covering an area of about 900 m x 450 m,
and continuing for several hundred metres further to the west as a thinner zone.  Significant copper oxides, encountered in both RC and core
drill holes extends from surface to an average depth of 124 m.  Oxide copper mineralization consists of malachite, chrysocolla, rare azurite,
black copper-manganese oxides, copper sulphates, and copper-bearing limonites.  Mineralization occurs primarily on fracture surfaces and in
oxidized veins or veinlets.  A zone of mixed oxide/sulphide mineralization with minor chalcocite is present below the oxide mineralization up
to depths of 185 m or an average depth of 160 m.  The copper oxide zone remains open to the northwest.
 
 
Page 25-3
Oxide copper mineralization at Blue Hill is interpreted to be the result of in-place oxidation of copper sulphides with only minor transport of
copper into vugs, fractures, and faults or shear zones.  No significant zones of secondary enrichment have been observed.
 
The copper-mineralized sulphide zone underlies the southern half of the oxide mineralization and continues to depth towards the southeast
below the Blue Hill fault.  Mineralization consists of varying quantities of pyrite, chalcopyrite, and molybdenite.  Local, higher-grade sulphide
mineralization  commonly  occurs  within  zones  of  sheeted  veins  containing  chalcopyrite,  magnetite,  and  secondary  biotite.    Significant
amounts of disseminated molybdenum mineralization have been observed locally, often in contact with dykes.  To the northwest, below the
oxides only a few holes have tested the sulphide potential, however in this direction the sulphides appear to be increasingly pyritic with only
minor amounts of copper.
 
Alteration assemblages are similar to Ann Mason except that original zoning is difficult to discern in areas of pervasive oxidation.  Within
zones  of  sulphide  mineralization,  propylitic  alteration  is  more  widespread  and  potassic  alteration  is  more  restricted  to  quartz  monzonite
porphyry dykes and immediately adjacent rocks of the Yerington batholith.  Late stage sodic alteration locally reduces copper grades, similar
to what has been observed at Ann Mason.
 
The sulphide mineralization remains open is several directions, most importantly, to the southeast, towards Ann Mason.
 
25.1.3
 
Entrée has been actively exploring the Ann Mason Project continuously since mid-2010, focused primarily on drilling at the Ann Mason and
Blue Hill deposit areas.
 
At Ann Mason, drilling has concentrated on expanding and upgrading the Mineral Resources within the 0.15% Cu envelope, and defining
zones  of  higher  grade  mineralization.    At  Blue  Hill,  drilling  was  primarily  RC,  designed  to  test  the  extent  of  shallow  oxide  copper
mineralization, but also to establish the potential for deeper, sulphide mineralization.
 
In August 2010, a 52.2 lin km dipole-dipole IP and resistivity survey was conducted by Zonge on the Ann Mason and Blue Hill areas.  The
chargeability results at 600 m depth show a strong 1.5 km wide anomaly extending northwestward from Ann Mason to beyond Blue Hill.  The
current 0.15% Cu envelope at Ann Mason occurs at the southeastern limit of the chargeability anomaly and then continues northwest along
the central portion of the anomaly.  Blue Hill occurs in the central portion of the anomaly.  A large portion of the anomaly between Ann Mason
and Blue Hill remains untested by drilling.  Further northwest, the Blackjack IP Anomaly covers an area 3.0 km east-west by 1.2 km north-
south.  The anomaly has not been drill tested and remains a priority exploration target for Entrée.
 
 
Page 25-4
Exploration
In 2012, Entrée embarked on a soil and rock geochemical sampling and geological mapping program over areas to the north of Blue Hill and
to the south of Ann Mason, covering approximately 750 ha.  The soil geochemistry (619 samples) extends and in-fills sampling done by
previous  operators  between  2006  and  2010.    A  total  of  186  selected  rock  samples  were  collected  to  characterize  alteration  and
mineralization.  The work resulted in the definition of three high priority target areas for future exploration: Ann Mason South, Blackjack Oxide,
and the area between the Ann Mason and Blue Hill deposits.  Each of these areas has potential to host additional near-surface oxide and/or
sulphide mineralization, which could add to the current Mineral Resources at both Ann Mason and Blue Hill.  Positive evaluation of the oxide
copper targets could result in one or more satellite deposits and provide additional material for a potential heap leach and SX/EW operation at
Blue  Hill.    Additional  sulphide  mineralization  around  the  Ann  Mason  could  reduce  the  current  strip  ratio  in  the  Ann  Mason  Preliminary
Economic Assessment mine design and help to enhance project economics.
 
The  recently  completed  diamond  drill  program  at  Ann  Mason  was  designed  to  increase  both  the  size  and  confidence  of  the  resource
model.  To date, 30 holes (EG-AM-10-001 to 030) totalling 32,833 m have been completed and all have been incorporated into the current
Mineral Resource estimate.  All sampling from Entrée’s drilling includes copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver analyses.
 
Fourteen RC exploration holes were drilled on the Blue Hill copper oxide target in 2010 and an additional ten RC holes, plus six core holes in
2011.  The Blue Hill drill program successfully outlined copper oxide mineralization over an area of 900 by 450 m, and has defined a sulphide
mineralized porphyry target that partially underlies the oxides and remains open to the southeast.
 
All Entrée drilling has been accompanied by a thorough QA/QC program, which currently includes the regular insertion of coarse blanks, core
twins, coarse duplicates, pulp duplicates and standards with each batch.  A review of the regular QC data indicates that the copper and
molybdenum  assays  are  of  acceptable  precision  and  accuracy  to  be  used  in  the  Mineral  Resource  estimate.    At  the  completion  of  the
assaying, a percentage of the pulps are sent to an independent secondary laboratory for check assays, which indicate no significant bias
exists between the primary and secondary labs for copper, molybdenum and gold grades.  Silver grades at Skyline, the current primary lab
appear to be biased low, indicating the lab may be underestimating the grades by 10% to 30%.
 
 
Page 25-5
Mineral Resource Estimate
A portion of the Anaconda historical core has been re-assayed through programs initiated by both PacMag, and more recently by Entrée, and
no  significant  bias  was  noted  for  either  copper  or  molybdenum  between  the  various  sampling  campaigns.    The  re-assay  work  has  also
increased the database of molybdenum, gold, and silver assays and to allow these to be brought into the current estimates.
 
25.1.4
 
The  Project  contains  Mineral  Resources  at  the  Ann  Mason  and  Blue  Hill  deposits.    The  two  deposits  are  not  connected,  and  each  was
estimated independent of each other.  Ann Mason is a sulphide-hosted copper-molybdenum porphyry deposit, and Blue Hill is an oxide- and
sulphide-hosted copper-porphyry deposit.
 
Mineral resources at Ann Mason were estimated by Mr. Jackson of QG, and Mr. Desautels of AGP is the QP responsible for the Blue Hill
resource estimate.   Resources for both deposits are constrained within LG constraining pit shells generated by AGP.  Mineral Resources that
are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.
 
Ann Mason Deposit
 
The  current  pit-constrained  resource  estimate  at  Ann  Mason  is  based  on  approximately  33,000  m  of  recent  drilling  in  30  holes  and
approximately  49,000  m  of  historical  drilling  in  116  holes.    The  resource  database  also  includes  re-assaying  of  6,142  samples  from
44 historical Anaconda core holes, to allow molybdenum, gold and silver values to be estimated.  At a base case cut-off of 0.20% Cu, the
deposit is estimated to contain an Indicated Mineral Resource of 1,137 Mt at 0.33% Cu, 0.006% Mo, 0.02 g/t Au and 0.57 g/t Ag and an
inferred Mineral Resource of 873 Mt at 0.29% Cu, 0.004% Mo, 0.03 g/t Au and 0.65 g/t Ag.
 
Blue Hill Deposit
 
The  current  pit-constrained  resource  was  completed  by  AGP,  based  on  Entrée’s  recent  drilling  of  30  RC  and  core  holes  totalling
approximately 6,822 m.  In addition, the estimate incorporates approximately 2,381 m of RC drilling (7 holes) and 1,057 m of core drilling
(2 holes) completed by PacMag, and 10 historical Anaconda RC and core holes totalling approximately 2,927 m.  At a base case cut-off of
0.10% Cu, the deposit is estimated to contain 72.13 Mt averaging 0.17% Cu of combined oxide and mixed material containing 277.5 Mlb of
copper.  Underlying the oxides and mixed styles of mineralization is an additional 49.86 Mt of sulphide mineralization averaging 0.23% Cu (at
a 0.15% Cu cut-off) containing 253.5 Mlb of copper.

Geotechnical
25.2
 
Entrée retained BGC in association with AGP to undertake a geotechnical review of the proposed open pit.
 
The geotechnical review was limited to:
 
 ·a compilation and review of the available data relevant to geotechnical evaluations of the open pit slopes
 
 ·a summary of the project setting, including the engineering geology and hydrogeology of the study area based on the available data
 
 ·estimates of ranges of overall pit slope angles, based on existing open pits in similar geologic units, for use in the PEA-level pit
optimizations carried out by AGP
· Tertiary volcanics (AM-VOL)
·recommendations for geotechnical assessments of the proposed open pits, to be undertaken as part of a pre-feasibility level study.
 
The rock mass of the Ann Mason deposit may be divided into three main geotechnical units:
 
 
 
  · granodiorite of the Yerington batholith (AM-GD)
 
  · quartz monzonite porphyry of the Yerington batholith (AM-QMP).
 
Bedding is the main geological structure observed in the volcanic rocks of the Ann Mason deposit.  The bedding dips on average at 62° to
the west.  This west dip of the bedding is a result of the regional tilting due to the rotation of normal faulting.
The main faults of the Ann Mason deposit are the Singatse Fault, the Montana Yerington Fault (1.5 km east of pit), and several possible
southeast-striking normal faults.  The flat, extensional, concave Singatse Fault dips east at about 12° or less.
 
Slope design recommendations have been provided to AGP by BGC for the bench, inter-ramp, and overall slope scales.  With consideration
of the preliminary stage of study, the proposed size of open pit for the Ann Mason Deposit, and the associated economic impacts of the pit
slope angles, a range of slope angles (Cases A, B, and C) were provided for use by the mine planners.  Case B was ultimately chosen by the
mine planners.
 
The Ann Mason deposit is divided into two domains for estimating open pit slope angles:
 
  · slopes within the volcanics (AM-VOL) geotechnical unit (Domain I)
 
 ·slopes within the granodiorite (AM-GD) and quartz monzonite porphyry (AM-QMP) geotechnical units (Domain II).
 
 
Page 25-7
The maximum inter-ramp height is limited at this stage of study to 150 m in the Ann Mason deposit; each slope segment is assumed to be
separated by ramps or geotechnical berms, which may be wider than the standard berms.  The ramps or geotechnical berms must be wide
enough  to  provide  access  for  the  installation  and  maintenance  of  dewatering  wells,  piezometers,  slope-monitoring  prisms,  or  other
geotechnical instrumentation.  Limiting the inter-ramp slope height also serves to limit the maximum size of potential inter-ramp scale slope
failures.
 
Based on the apparent rock mass quality and expected slope heights, the achievable overall angles in Domain I will be limited by the bench
scale slope geometry.  Bench face angles of 65° to 70° (67° on average) are assumed based on the generally fair rock mass quality in this
domain.  A single bench height of 15 m has been used.  Double benching may be possible in Domain I due to the Fair rock mass quality,
resulting in a final bench height of 30 m.  With an estimated minimum catch bench width of 11 m to manage potential rock fall hazards, the
maximum inter-ramp angle is 52°.
 
The achievable overall slope angles in Domain II are expected to be limited by the rock mass quality.  Bench face angles may range from 60°
to 65° (63° on average) for these cases, based on our experience with benches in other mines and our observations from the Yerington
Pit.  A single bench height of 15 m has been used. Domain II should be limited to single benches, considering the generally Poor quality of
the  rock  mass  observed  during  BGC’s  review  of  the  drill  core.    Assuming  a  maximum  inter-ramp  height  of  150  m  so  that  pit  dewatering
objectives can be achieved, an 11 m catch bench width is required for Case B (39° inter-ramp angle).
 
25.3
 
The  Ann  Mason  project  uses  both  Indicated  and  Inferred  resources  in  the  overall  mine  plan.    Inferred  resources  are  considered  too
speculative  geologically  to  have  the  economic  considerations  applied  to  them  that  would  enable  them  to  be  categorized  as  Mineral
Reserves.  The open pit plans described in this study are preliminary in nature and there is no certainty that the operational LOM Plans can
be realized.
 
The LOM mill feed percentages are 67% Indicated resource and 33% Inferred resource.
 
The open pit will send 562.3 Mt of Indicated material to the mill for processing with average grade of 0.32% Cu, 0.004% Mo, 0.025 g/t Au, and
0.55 g/t Ag.  Inferred material send to the mill will total 274.1 Mt with average grades of 0.29% Cu, 0.003% Mo, 0.034 g/t Au and 0.638 g/t
Ag.  The strip ratio for the life of the mine is 2.16:1.  A period of three years prior to milling commencing will be required to ensure that
sufficient material is available for continuous milling operation.  Waste stripping is at its highest level from Years -1 to Year 7 with an average
of 128 Mt/a mined.  The stripping level then drops to 87 Mt/a for Years 8 to 14.  After Year 14, the waste stripping requirements tail off until
Year 20 at which time all the remaining material in the pit is above cutoff grade.  The pit design is comprised of five phases all with detailed
accesses included in the designs.  The fifth phase was designed using a LG shell that had used a $2.00/lb Cu price to define the limits.
 
 
Page 25-8
Open Pit Mining
Production in the pit will be accomplished with the use of a variable fleet of large equipment.  Peak material movement occurs in Year 5.  At
that time the major equipment will be made up of five rotary drills (229 mm bits), two front-end loader (40.5 m3), four electric cable shovels
(55.8 m3), and thirty-two haul trucks (360-tonne) in addition to the support equipment (dozers, graders, water trucks).  The LOM mining cost
has been estimated at $1.18/t of material moved.
 
The rock in the project is assumed to be non-acid generating.  Waste material will be stored in the WRMF located on the southwest side of the
open pit.  A portion of the waste material from the pre-stripping operation will be directed to the South Dam of the TMF to prepare the facility
rather than quarrying.  The WRMF will have an elevation of 1,605 m until Year 7 at which time it will start to add lifts.  Final design elevation is
1,665 m.  Concurrent resloping and reclamation of the WRMF will occur to minimize final reclamation requirements.
Metallurgy and Process
Additional geotechnical review is required to enhance the pit slopes by sector with consideration for design ramps.
 
Condemnation drilling is required in all areas currently proposed for waste or tailings placement.
 
25.4
 
Samples from the Ann Mason Project consisting of sulphide composites from the Ann Mason deposit and oxide and mixed zone composites
from the Blue Hill deposit have been submitted for metallurgical testwork.
 
25.4.1
 
Scoping level study has indicated that the Ann Mason sulphide feed is amenable to concentration using a conventional SAG mill/ball mill
grinding  circuit,  followed  by  flotation.    The  following  conclusions  regarding  the  Ann  Mason  deposit  composites  can  be  drawn  from  the
metallurgical testwork completed to date:
 
 ·Grindability testing of a composite sample from the Ann Mason deposit revealed a moderate Bond Ball Work Index of 15.65 kWh/t and an
Abrasion Index of 0.2830.
Ann Mason
·The composite samples were found to be amenable to conventional concentration using froth flotation at a primary grind size P80 of 100-120
µm.
Page 25-9
·A final copper concentrate of saleable grade at a copper recovery of 93.5% was found to be achievable for the samples tested.
 
 ·Low copper, high sulphur composites from the chalcopyrite-pyrite zone of the deposit were found to yield good grades and recoveries under
the flotation conditions developed for the main zone composites with relatively minor changes in reagent addition and circuit configuration.
·No potential penalty elements have been detected in the final concentrates as tested.
 
 ·The production of a separate molybdenum concentrate may be achievable by conventional copper/molybdenum separation, but more work
is needed to prove this result.
Based on the results of the testwork, a scoping level plant design was completed to process the Ann Mason sulphide feed at a nominal rate of
100,000 t/d. The design combines industry standard unit process operations into a flowsheet that can be considered to be of low to medium
complexity.
 
25.4.2
 
Preliminary testwork conducted on composite samples from the Blue Hill oxide deposit has indicated that:
 
 ·The Blue Hill composites are amenable to copper extraction by sulphuric acid heap leaching.
 
 ·Four composite samples were evaluated by standard column testing at a crush size P80 of ¾” with copper recoveries averaging 84.8 % after
91 days of leaching.
Blue Hill
Infrastructure and Site Layout
· Acid consumption for the column tests averaged 11.95 kg/kgCu, or 18.04 kg/t.
 
25.5
 
The infrastructure and site plan designs are based on information from published data and from previous work on similar operations.  Several
assumptions were made in the costing of this portion of the Project, and subsequent testing will provide more accurate data for refining the
site plan design and associated infrastructure costs.
 
The site for the mill and operations was chosen for the following reasons:
 
 
 
  · site is on top of a relatively flat height of land
 
  · proximity to existing electrical infrastructure and water sources.

For the purposes of this study, water sources required for operations will be supplied by nearby wells, recycle water from the tailings area,
and water from mine dewatering operations.
 
This  study  assumed  that  the  electrical  capacity  at  point  of  connection  to  the  NV  Energy  grid  can  support  the  load  associated  with  this
project.  It is anticipated that this load is approximately 110 MW.  Other potential projects in this area of the grid are being evaluated, and
residual grid power is available on a first-come, first-served basis.
 
The TMF is located to the west of the Ann Mason Pit.  It is required to provide secure containment for the planned 653.4 Mm3 of tailings.  A
tailings density of 1.28 t/m3 was used for the volume calculation and slopes of 3.5:1 (H:V).
 
The TMF will ultimately require four separate dams and their parameters are:
 
 
 
  - 4 km long, 125 m high (rock fill and tailings)
 
  - 94.6 Mm3 total volume with 21.8 M of rock fill
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The freeboard during operation is set at 10 m and the end of mine freeboard is designed for 5 m.
 
Tailings slurry will be pumped via a 5 km pipeline from the plant to the South Tailings dam. Cyclones will be used to construct the upper
portion of the South Dam by segregating coarse and fine material.  Process water will be reclaimed from the TMF and returned to the plant via
a dedicated reclaim water pumpset and pipeline.
 
The TMF plays a key role in site water management by providing buffering of process water, direct precipitation and runoff. The detailed water
balance has not been completed for this study.  Costing for surface diversion ditches along the western edge of the TMF has been included in
the capital costing.  This is to capture and divert water from the TMF without direct contact to mine activity.

Economic Analysis
Seepage collection ponds and pumping systems are considered in the costing for each of the dams and will be returned to the process plant
via the reclaim water system or to the TMF.
 
The plant site drainage will be collected in a settling pond with disposal to the process water pond.  Mine water collection will be pumped to a
small settling pond near the primary crusher.  This water will be used to water the roads with excess water sent to the TMF.  Surface drainage
will be diverted away from the mine where possible to ensure direct contact with active mining areas does not occur.  If contact does occur, it
will be directed to the mine settling pond.
 
25.6
 
The PEA study has shown that a mine life of 24 years is possible with a 100,000 t/d operation.  The project has a Pre-tax NPV of $1,106
million with a 7.5% discount rate.  The IRR for the project is 14.8% on a pre-tax basis.  Post-tax the NPV is $690 million with a 7.5% discount
rate  and  an  IRR  of  12.6%.    The  metal  prices  used  to  determine  the  above  values  were  $3.00/lb  for  copper,  $13.50/lb  for  molybdenum,
$1,200/oz for gold and $22/oz for silver.  The pre-tax payback period is estimated at 6.4 years and post-tax is 7.1 years.
 
The greatest sensitivity in the project is metal prices.  The base case prices that are used consider a price of copper at $3.00/lb.  Three-year
trailing average price for copper as of September 17, 2012 was $3.61/lb.  The base case copper price is 27% lower than the three-year
average.  A further 20% reduction of that price would see a copper price of $2.40/lb, eqivalent to the -20% sensitivity.  However, given the
higher copper price regime at present, the project economics benefit greatly.
 
The second most sensitive parameter is recovery.  To calculate the sensitivity to recovery, a percentage factor was applied to each metal
recovery  in  the  same  proportion.    Therefore,  while  sensitivity  exists,  actual  practice  may  show  less  fluctuation  than  is  considered  in  this
analysis.  Recovery testwork has not indicated recoveries in the range of 75% which the -20% change in recovery would represent.  As
copper represents 93.2% of the revenue, this large a swing in recovery has the obvious effect of influencing the project, but may not be
realistic.
 
The  PEA  is  preliminary  in  nature,  it  includes  Inferred  Mineral  Resources  that  are  considered  too  speculative  geologically  to  have  the
economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves and there is no certainty that the
PEA will be realized.  Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

Introduction
Drilling
· Phase 1 Drilling –$2.3 million
· Phase 2 Drilling – $16.1 million
Recommendations
· Phase 2 PFS Work – $8 to 10 million.
26
 
26.1
 
Based on the results of the PEA study completed for the Ann Mason Project, AGP recommends that Entrée proceed to the next stage of the
study for the project; a PFS.  As part of the PFS, a two-phase, results-driven drill program is recommended to complete an initial regional
exploration program on some of the key target areas and then, to bring the Mineral Resources within the current Phase 5 pit to a minimum
Indicated  Mineral  Resource  category.    The  recommendations  and  associated  budgets  are  described  in  the  sections  below.    The  overall
budget to complete the recommended work is summarized as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blue Hill and the peripheral oxide targets remain as very strong priorities for Entrée that will see a portion of the Phase 1 drilling.  Although not
included  in  the  current  PEA,  results  of  future  work  will  determine  whether  the  Blue  Hill  Deposit  will  be  included  in  the  PFS.    A  small
metallurgical program is recommended for Phase 2.
 
26.2
 
QG and AGP recommend a two-phase, results-driven work program that includes drilling and the associated studies to take the Project to a
PFS level.  The total budget to complete the recommended work programs is approximately $18.4 million and is provided in Table 26-1 and
Table 26-2.
 
Phase 1 includes core drilling along the northern edge of the currently defined Ann Mason deposit; RC drilling at both the Blue Hill deposit
and its periphery and initial drilling at the Blackjack IP anomaly and at the Blackjack oxide target.
 
Phase 2 drilling is contingent upon favourable results from Phase 1 and includes a detailed in-fill drilling program within the current Ann
Mason Mineral Resource area, and additional drilling to test for lateral extensions of the Ann Mason deposit.  The in-fill program is designed
to collect data for grade estimation at a confidence level high enough to support a PFS level.
 
Additional details regarding the Phase 1 and 2 programs are provided in Sections 26.2.1, 26.2.2, and 26.2.3.
 
 
Page 26-1
26.2.1
 
QG and AGP recommend that the following drilling be completed during Phase 1:
 
 ·Blue Hill Deposit (1,600 m) – approximately 8 widely-spaced RC holes, averaging 200 m in depth to better define, and test for extensions of
the known oxide mineralization.  This includes several holes to test the area to the east of Blue Hill, around previous hole EG-BH-11-31.
Phase 1 Drilling
·Blackjack oxide target (1,800 m) – approximately 9 widely-spaced RC holes, averaging 200 m in depth to test the newly defined Blackjack
oxide target to the north of Blue Hill.
·Ann Mason Deposit (3,250 m) – six widely spaced core holes, averaging about 540 m in depth to test for extensions of the known Ann
Mason deposit to the north, within the Phase 5 LOM pit.  These holes will have RC pre-collars through the overlying volcanic rock.
·Blackjack IP Anomaly (2,000 m) – two, widely spaced holes, averaging 1,000 m in depth to test the Blackjack IP Anomaly.
 
Completion of the Blue Hill Deposit and Blackjack target oxide drilling, as well as the Blackjack IP anomaly drilling will establish if potentially
viable targets occur at depth in these areas that will require further drilling, and to further guide the placement of proposed infrastructure,
related to the Ann Mason Project.
AGP recommends drilling HQ diameter for the core holes and 136 mm diameter for the RC holes.  AGP also recommends following the
logging and sampling protocols as well as the rigorous QA/QC program currently in use by Entree.  The locations of all holes should be
permanently marked in the field, and accurately located by a surveyor.  Borehole deviation should be regularly tested as each drill hole
deepens.  Samples should be collected from core holes at regular intervals for SG tests. Prior to initiating the analytical work, Entree should
ensure that the silver assaying technique provides improved accuracy from the previous campaign.

Based on positive results from the Phase 1 program described above, QG and AGP recommend a phase of in-fill drilling to bring the overall
drill hole density at the Ann Mason Deposit to approximately 100 m within the current resource block model, but restricted to the area of the
Phase 5 Pit.  This sampling density is designed to bring the Inferred resources to a minimum Indicated resource category in order to support
the PFS.
 
The drill spacing considers the 30 holes previously drilled by Entree and all of the historical holes drilled by Anaconda and PacMag.  QG
estimates that 32,550 m in 67 holes averaging about 490 m in length will be required.  These holes will have RC pre-collars through the
overlying volcanic rock
 
Concurrent with the in-fill drilling, QG also recommends additional drilling outside of the current Mineral Resource, but still within the Phase 5
pit.  These holes will be drilled on an approximate 200 m by 200 m to 400 m by 400 m grid spacing to test for extensions of the current
resource in all directions.  Similar to the in-fill program, the holes will be core, but have RC pre-collars.  QG estimates that 19,250 m in 41 core
holes averaging 470 m in length will be required.
 
In total, the Phase 2 drilling will include 108 core holes totalling 51,800 m.  Table 26-2 shows the proposed budget for Phase 2.

Phase 2 Core Re-Sampling at Blue Hill
Total Phase 2
 
26.2.3
 
Since  the  historical  drilling  completed  by  Anaconda  at  Blue  Hill  did  not  include  the  analysis  of  molybdenum,  silver,  and  gold,  AGP
recommends Entrée extend its core re-sampling program to test for these elements.  This will be important to validate the historical copper
values and update the database with these new copper grade as well as molybdenum, gold, and silver.  AGP believes that the additional data
will increase confidence in the model.
 
It is estimated that re-sampling should include approximately 2,400 m of Anaconda core (about 1,200 samples, including QC).
 
AGP also recommends collecting bulk density samples in the Tertiary volcanics to the east of the Blue Hill fault, which is currently inside the
resource constraining pit shell and has only been sampled by RC drilling.
 
26.3
 
AGP estimates that a PFS for Ann Mason would be in the range of $8 to $10 million to complete although the scope of the PFS remains to be
thoroughly reviewed and a detailed budget determined.  The PFS would cover areas such as:

· capital and operating cost estimation
· tailings management facility design and site geotechnical
 
  · environmental management studies and data collection
 
  · concentrate marketing and sales studies
 
 
 
 
 
  · project management and administration.
 
Aspects of the study can take place concurrent with the Phase 2 Drilling program described in Section 26.2.3.  Environmental and social work
and some of the geotechnical and metallurgical work would occur at this time.
 
The following subsections provide some detail on some of the components of the PFS.
 
26.4
 
The following work is recommended at the PFS level stage of study to support the estimation of open pit slope angles for the Ann Mason
Deposit, based on site-specific data.
 
26.4.1
 
Rock mass quality and structural geology data are needed for the proposed wall rocks of the Ann Mason Deposit.  This includes geotechnical
drilling in the area of the final slopes.  A minimum of four inclined core holes should be completed, each of which may be up to 800 m
long.    All  holes  should  be  completed  using  a  “triple  tube”  coring  system  with  splits  in  the  core  tube.    HQ3  diameter  core  would  be
preferred.  All core should be logged for the appropriate geotechnical parameters.
 
26.4.2
 
As the rock mass quality may be generally poor throughout the Ann Mason deposit, traditional core orientation tools are not expected to
provide  good  structural  geology  data.    As  a  result,  all  geotechnical  drill  holes  should  be  surveyed  with  a  borehole  televiewer
system.  Geological structures can be identified from the resulting images; the orientation and frequency of these structures are an important
input into PFS level slope stability assessments of the proposed open pits.
 
26.4.3
 
Packer  testing  should  be  undertaken  in  each  of  the  geotechnical  drill  holes  to  estimate  the  hydraulic  conductivity  of  the  rock  mass.    In
Hydrogeology Field Assessments
Borehole Televiewer Surveys
Geotechnical Drilling
Geotechnical
addition,  piezometers  should  be  installed  in  each  drill  hole  to  monitor  the  seasonal  fluctuations  in  the  groundwater  elevation  of  the
site.  Grouted-in vibrating wire piezometers are preferred for the inclined drill holes.  The data resulting from these field assessments will be
used in PFS level assessments of the groundwater inflows to the proposed pits and the preliminary design of a pit dewatering system.
 
 
Page 26-5
Laboratory Testing
Geotechnical Mapping
Groundwater Monitoring
26.4.4
 
Core samples should be selected from the geotechnical drill holes for laboratory testing.  Uniaxial compressive strength, tensile strength, and
small scale direct shear strength testing should be undertaken.  The results of these tests are required to further characterize the rock masses
of the pit proposed for the Ann Mason Project, and to conduct stability assessments of the open pit slopes.
 
26.4.5
 
BGC  understands  that  the  existing  water  well  in  the  Ann  Mason  deposit  is  not  available  for  on-going  monitoring  as  it  has  been
plugged.    Previous  measurements  of  the  water  elevation  and  records  of  pumping  from  the  well  in  the  Ann  Mason  Deposit  should  be
maintained.  The previously collected data may be useful for future hydrogeology assessments.  Once additional piezometers have been
installed in the geotechnical drill holes, Entrée should undertake an ongoing program of reading these instruments.  The locations of the
piezometers and the frequency of the instrument readings should be discussed at the next stage of work.
 
26.4.6
 
Geotechnical mapping of outcrop should be carried out in the proposed pit areas to provide additional data for rock mass characterization and
structural geology assessments.  Outcrops of the volcanic rocks are accessible and should yield very good data.  The potential for mapping
outcrops of the intrusive rocks should be reviewed.
 
26.4.7
 
Entrée has developed a preliminary three-dimensional model for the Ann Mason Deposit.  Interpretations of the main rock types, alteration
zones, depth of weathered zones, and major geological structures should be advanced.  The extents of the model should encompass the
outer  limits  of  the  largest  proposed  Ann  Mason  pit.    This  geological  model  is  required  for  future  slope  stability  and  hydrogeological
assessments as the stability of the slopes is closely related to the geologic and hydrogeologic models, as discussed below.
 
26.4.8
 
Based on the results of the geotechnical drilling, laboratory testing, and updated geological modelling, a preliminary geotechnical model of
the study area should be developed.  The geotechnical model includes the characterization of the geotechnical units and the development of
structural  domains.    These  will  be  combined  into  geotechnical  domains,  which  will  serve  as  the  basis  for  PFS  level  open  pit  slope
designs.    Open  pit  slope  designs  should  be  completed  for  the  Ann  Mason  Deposit  based  on  the  compiled  project  specific  data.    These
designs would be used by the mine planners for pit optimizations and the layout of the open pit phases.
 
 
Page 26-6
Geotechnical Model Development and Open Pit Slope Designs
Geological Modelling
Review the Potential for Toppling Failure Mode
Hydrogeological Model and Pit Dewatering Assessments
26.4.9
 
There is insufficient data at this stage of study to assess the potential for toppling instabilities in the final walls of the proposed Ann Mason
pit.    However,  considering  the  structural  geology  of  the  area  and  some  of  observations  of  toppling  in  the  Yerington  Pit,  the  potential  for
toppling slopes should be reviewed at the next stage of design.  Specifically, the proposed southwest walls of the Ann Mason open pit should
be assessed for toppling with consideration of the southeast striking normal faults interpreted by Entrée.
 
26.4.10
 
A conceptual hydrogeological model should be developed for the project area based on the geological model and available hydrogeological
field data.  Pit inflow estimates should be made based on this model and the proposed open pit phases.  These estimates may be made via a
3D numerical hydrogeological model or using an analytical solution.  The results of this work will be needed for the overall project water
balance and the preliminary design of the in-pit water management infrastructure.
 
Based  on  the  results  of  the  slope  stability  assessments  a  slope  depressurization  system  may  be  required  for  the  Ann  Mason  pit.    A  3D
numerical model can be used to estimate the distribution of pore pressure in the open pit slopes and assist in the preliminary design of a
slope depressurization system.
 
26.5
 
All mill feed material within the pit boundaries needs to be brought to Indicated or Measured resource categories in order to proceed to PFS
Open Pit Mining
level work.
 
ARD testwork needs to be completed on the material from the pit and potential quarry sites to ensure that there are no long-term  waste
storage issues that may exist.  From this, variations in the waste storage options would need to be considered.  Humidity cell testwork takes
six months or longer to accurately predict.
 
Other areas for waste storage that may improve haulage times need to be examined for their suitability.
 
 
Page 26-7
Rock strength parameters suitable for accurate blasting estimation needs to be undertaken.  The fragmentation size possible will then be
used to assist in the design of the primary crusher and other milling functions.
 
Comprehensive costing of labour, explosives, and equipment needs to be undertaken.  Further examination of in-pit or near-pit crushing
should be considered for plant feed and potentially waste to reduce operating and capital cost requirements.
 
Condemnation drilling needs to be considered under all waste storage locations, including the tailings dams, plus the plant site and around
Blue Hill.
 
26.6
 
To complement the results presented here, additional metallurgical characterization of the Ann Mason deposit is recommended as follows:
 
 ·Further study of the relationship between primary grind size and rougher flotation recovery in order to optimize grinding power input.
 
 ·Detailed grindability study including SAG mill sizing tests (SPI, SMC, JK Drop Weight) and variability testing for work index and abrasion
index across the deposit.  Results to be incorporated into a preliminary model of the comminution circuit.
Metallurgy and Processing
·Optimisation of frother addition, including testing of alternative reagents, to reduce flotation operating costs in this area.
 
 ·Development of operating parameters for the molybdenum circuit through piloting or 10kg batch flotation testing of the copper circuit on a
bulk sample.
·Detailed minor element analysis of representative concentrates generated from the bulk sample.
 
 ·Flowsheet confirmation testing on variability composites based on lithology and production composites from the mine plan.
 
 ·Static settling and filtration tests on the concentrate products and final tailings to generate preliminary sizing of dewatering equipment.
 
 ·Mineralogical study of optimized flowsheet tailings to characterize metal losses and identify potential opportunities for additional recovery.
 
Recommendations for future work on samples from the Blue Hill deposit include:
 
 ·further study of the effect of crush size, acid addition, and column height on copper extraction and acid consumption
 
 ·additional characterization and column leach testing of the mixed zone of the deposit
 
 
Page 26-8
·ongoing mineralogical study of the Blue Hill oxide deposit to improve the understanding of the constituent minerals, their variability in the
deposit, and their effect on copper extraction and acid consumption.
Infrastructure and Site Layout
26.7
 
Additional testing and data is required to further define the infrastructure and site layout requirements and associated costs in these areas:
 
 ·Topographical information to provide more detail for infrastructure design, including power line routing, access road rehabilitation, and
building placement.
·Geotechnical testing and data to further develop construction requirements for the mill, tailings and services sites.
 
 ·Hydrogeology and water quality testing on water sources surrounding the mine site to determine available volumes and quality of water
required to support the mill and services infrastructure.
·Additional electrical study is necessary in order to validate the conceptual design and the assumed load capacity at the NV Energy grid
connection.  The local electrical utility (NV Energy) can perform an Electrical Service Agreement (ESA) study in order to model the effect of
this connection and provide comment on any stability concerns.  In the event that changes to the NV Energy grid are required to support this
connection, the ESA will provide a cost estimate for the necessary capital upgrades.
·Materials testing and quarry location scoping for design and construction cost estimates.
 
 ·Foundation testing, quarry placement, and material suitability studies need to be completed for the plant site and all the tailings dam
locations.
·Alternate tailings location study for proper sizing and locating of the tailings facility.
 
  · Condemnation drilling under the plant, WRM, and tailings areas.
 
  · Environmental and socioeconomic studies.
 
26.8
 
A complete hydrogeological review of water in the mining area needs to be undertaken.  This entails both quantity and quality sufficient for
operation of the process plant and mine.  In addition, the precipitation and drainage areas need to be determined for proper estimating of
diversion dam/ditches to minimize contact of fresh water with mining areas.
 
 
Page 26-9
Waste and Water Management
Environmental
The tailings management facility and waste rock management facility areas need to have complete hydrological evaluations completed for
surface runoff, ground water, and seepage.
 
ARD and metal leaching testwork needs to be completed for proper waste rock characterization and development of storage options.
 
26.9
 
Entrée’s Plan of Operations (PoO) for the Ann Mason Project focused on exploration activities and in minimizing and mitigating the impact on
the environment.  With the PEA completed and some understanding of the potential size and scope of the project now understood, the data
collection and testwork can begin in earnest to prepare for the next stage of study and ultimately permit applications.
 
Basic data collection needs to commence immediately covering a wide range of diverse subjects, including: weather, water flows, vegetation,
wildlife, and socio-economic.  A comprehensive program will need to be established to collect the required information necessary to comply
with the respective agency permit application requirements.  This is of critical importance to ensure that the permits may be issued in a timely
manner.
 
A detailed Prefeasibility plan will also be required to build upon the other information collected.  These two items will require advancing
forward in parallel with the technical experts providing input into the permit application process.  Detailed environmental and engineering
information must be collected in at least the following areas:
 
● air quality
● cultural resources
● environmental justice
● floodplains
● geology and geochemistry
● land use authorization
● livestock grazing management
● meteorology
● migratory birds
● minerals
● native American religious concerns
● paleontological resources
 
Seasonal data of at least 12 months may be required for some of the elements above.  The programs should start as soon as possible.
 
 
Page 26-10
● noxious weeds, invasive, and non-native species
● social and economic values
● soils
● special status plants and animals
● threatened and endangered species
● vegetation
● visual resources
● wastes (solid and hazardous)
● water (surface and ground)
● wild horses and burros
● wildlife.
