<p>The Government of Norway welcomes the recommendations made during its 
</p>
<p>Universal Periodic Review, which was held on 28 April 2014, and is pleased to provide the 
</p>
<p>following responses, to be included in the outcome report. 
</p>
<p><b>131.1</b> <b>Not</b> <b>accepted</b>. Norway is party to the vast majority of human rights 
</p>
<p>conventions and considers ratifying new conventions on an ongoing and case-by-case basis. 
</p>
<p>Norway has an obligation to fulfil all its international obligations, regardless of how they 
</p>
<p>are incorporated or transformed into Norwegian law. The question of whether or not new 
</p>
<p>conventions should be incorporated into Norwegian law, and if so, how, is also considered 
</p>
<p>on a case-by-case basis. However, as a general principle Norwegian law is presumed to be 
</p>
<p>in accordance with Norway&#8217;s international obligations. Where possible, Norwegian law is 
</p>
<p>therefore to be interpreted in such a way that it does not conflict with the rules of 
</p>
<p>international law by which Norway is bound, even if the conventions have not been 
</p>
<p>incorporated into Norway&#8217;s domestic legal order. 
</p>
<p><b>131.2</b> <b>Accepted</b>. The Norwegian Penal Code satisfies most of the obligations set out 
</p>
<p>in the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against 
</p>
<p>Women and Domestic Violence, but some amendments are necessary in order to ratify the 
</p>
<p>Convention. A public consultation on the suggested amendments has been launched. 
</p>
<p><b>131.3 and 131.4 Accepted</b><i>. </i>It is a human rights priority for the Norwegian 
</p>
<p>Government to prepare for ratification and full implementation of the UN Convention for 
</p>
<p>the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. </p>
<p><b>131.5</b>&#8211;<b>131.8 Not accepted. </b>Norway has ratified the core ILO conventions on 
</p>
<p>workers&#8217; rights, which also apply to residents who are foreign nationals. 
</p>
<p><b>131.9 Not accepted. </b>Norway&#8217;s interpretative declarations on the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities were made upon ratification in 2013, after careful 
</p>
<p>consideration. They are consistent with the prevalent understanding among the States 
</p>
<p>Parties and are &#8211; in the Government&#8217;s view &#8211; fully compatible with the Convention. 
</p>
<p><b>131.10 Not accepted. </b>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs<b> </b>intends to commission an 
</p>
<p>independent study on the possible consequences of becoming a party to the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b>131.11 and 131.12 Not accepted. </b>Norway is currently not in a position to ratify the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>131.13 Not accepted. </b>Norway is currently not in a position to ratify the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.<b>  </b> 
</p>
<p><b>131.14 Not accepted. </b>See response to recommendation 131.10. 
</p>
<p><b>131.15 Not accepted. </b>See responses to recommendations 131.3, 131.12 and 131.13. 
</p>
<p><b>131.16</b> <b>Not</b> <b>accepted</b>. It is the view of the Norwegian Government that young 
</p>
<p>offenders should be imprisoned as a last resort only, and the current penal policy is strongly 
</p>
<p>influenced by restorative justice principles. Until recently, Norway has not had separate 
</p>
<p>detention centres for juveniles. Thus, there would be a high risk that the very few juveniles 
</p>
<p>who are imprisoned would be completely isolated if the principle of separating juveniles 
</p>
<p>from adults were to be adhered to. A trial project with separate prison units for young 
</p>
<p>offenders is currently being conducted. The aim of this is to prevent juveniles from having 
</p>
<p>to serve their sentences in prisons together with adults or in total isolation. The 
</p>
<p>aforementioned reservations cannot, however, be lifted and they are therefore being upheld. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p><b>131.29</b> <b>Accepted, already implemented</b>.1 
</p>
<p><b>131.30</b> <b>Partially accepted</b>. Norwegian criminal law (the Penal Code) covers many 
</p>
<p>violent offences where in practice the victims are often women and girls. Some of the 
</p>
<p>relevant penal provisions have been introduced partly to prevent and address violence 
</p>
<p>against women and girls, but the Penal Code is not gender-specific.  Although it is deemed 
</p>
<p>adequate, some amendments aimed at further strengthening relevant provisions are 
</p>
<p>currently under public consultation, including the ones referred to in the responses to 
</p>
<p>recommendations 131.2, 131.22 and 131.32.

</p>
<p><b>131.34 Accepted, already implemented. 
</b></p>
<p><b>131.35 Partially accepted.</b> The Norwegian authorities are considering amending the 
</p>
<p>legal definition of &#8216;rape&#8217;. This is partly due to a recommendation from the UN Committee 
</p>
<p>on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). A proposal to widen the 
</p>
<p>definition of rape to include all kinds of non-consensual sexual activity has been subject to 
</p>
<p>public consultation. The Ministry of Justice and Public Security has not yet made a decision 
</p>
<p>on the matter. 
</p>
<p><b>131.36 Accepted. 
</b></p>
<p><b>131.37 Partially accepted. </b>The Ministry considers on a regular basis whether or not 
</p>
<p>national legislation is in line with international standards and principles. The Ministry will 
</p>
<p>in the future consider looking into the issue of allowing citizens to appeal to the court in 
</p>
<p>election-related matters.  
</p>
<p><b>131.38</b> <b>Not accepted.</b> The prohibition of torture is transformed into Norwegian law 
</p>
<p>through section 117 a of the Penal Code. Norway has an obligation to fulfil all its 
</p>
<p>international obligations, regardless of how they are incorporated or transformed into 
</p>
<p>Norwegian law. The question of whether or not new conventions should be incorporated 
</p>
<p>into Norwegian law, and if so, how, is considered on a case-by-case basis. However, as a 
</p>
<p>general principle Norwegian law is presumed to be in accordance with international 
</p>
<p>obligations. Where possible, Norwegian law is therefore to be interpreted in such a way that 
</p>
<p>it does not conflict with the rules of international law by which Norway is bound, even if 
</p>
<p>the conventions have not been incorporated into Norway&#8217;s domestic legal order. See also 
</p>
<p>response to recommendation 131.32. 
</p>
<p><b>131.39</b> <b>Accepted, already implemented.5</b> 
</p>
<p><b>131.40 Not accepted. </b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/3/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b>131.41 Not accepted.</b> The penal provision on blasphemy has not been retained in 
</p>
<p>the new Penal Code. However, as stated in the response to recommendation 131.39, hate 
</p>
<p>speech is already criminalised providing that the human right to freedom of speech is 
</p>
<p>upheld. In Norwegian criminal law, determining the penalty in any criminal case is to a 
</p>
<p>large extent left to the discretion of the judge. The judge looks to case law for general 
</p>
<p>guidance. For rape involving sexual intercourse, the law stipulates a minimum sentence of 
</p>
<p>three years in prison. 
</p>
<p><b>131.42 Accepted, already implemented.6</b> 
</p>
<p><b>131.43</b>&#8211;<b>131.52 Accepted.</b> Regarding the recommendation on the establishment of a 
</p>
<p>National Institution for Human Rights, the Storting (Norwegian parliament) decided on 19 
</p>
<p>June 2014 to establish a new national institution administratively organised under the 
</p>
<p>Storting, and effective from 1 January 2015. 
</p>
<p><b>131.53 Not accepted.</b> The Norwegian Centre for Human Rights has decided to 
</p>
<p>terminate its role as the national institution. A decision has therefore been made to establish 
</p>
<p>a new institution under the Storting (Norwegian parliament). See response to 
</p>
<p>recommendation 131.43. 
</p>
<p><b>131.54</b>&#8211;<b>131.64 Accepted</b>. See response to recommendation 131.43. 
</p>
<p><b>131.65 Accepted. 
</b></p>
<p><b>131.66 Not accepted. </b>In 2014 the Equality and Anti-Discrimination Ombudsperson 
</p>
<p>will receive approximately NOK 54 million (USD 9 million) in basic funding. The 
</p>
<p>Ombudsperson operates independently within his or her field of expertise, and cannot be 
</p>
<p>instructed by the Ministry. The Ombudsperson is free to give priority to specific challenges 
</p>
<p>within his or her area of competence.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>131.67. Partially accepted. </b>The Norwegian Government gives consideration to 
</p>
<p>national plans and priorities in its international cooperation activities. 
</p>
<p><b>131.68. Not accepted. </b>An action plan is not considered the optimal measure at this 
</p>
<p>point in time. The topic of human rights is well integrated into educational curricula. 
</p>
<p>Higher education and teacher training institutions are particularly encouraged to increase 
</p>
<p>their cooperation on human rights education. This is expected to lead to intensified efforts 
</p>
<p>while preserving institutional autonomy in higher education. 
</p>
<p><b>131.69 Partially accepted. </b>Efforts, including a new action plan, are under 
</p>
<p>consideration.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>131.70 Accepted.  
</b></p>
<p><b>131.71 Accepted, already implemented. 
</b></p>
<p><b>131.72 Accepted. 
</b></p>
<p><b>131.73 Partially accepted. </b>The Norwegian Government has already taken actions to 
</p>
<p>curb the over-sexualisation of women in the media. For example, in section 204 of the 
</p>
<p>General Civil Penal Code, it is set out that any person who publishes, sells or in any other 
</p>
<p>way attempts to disseminate pornography shall be liable to fines or imprisonment for a term 
</p>
<p>not exceeding three years. Furthermore, section 2 a of the Marketing Control Act sets out 
</p>
<p>that the marketer and the designer of the marketing shall ensure that the marketing does not 
</p>
<p>conflict with the equality of the sexes and that it does not exploit the body of one of the 
</p>
<p>sexes or convey an offensive or derogatory appraisal of women or men. 
</p>
<p>The Norwegian Government aims to curb the over-sexualisation of both sexes in the media. 
</p>
<p>We do however believe in freedom of speech, also for the media, and will therefore not 
</p>
<p>prohibit all statements with sexualised content. </p>

</p>
<p><b>131.139 Accepted</b>. Efforts are being made on a continuous basis to improve 
</p>
<p>detention conditions. 
</p>
<p><b>131.140 Partially accepted. </b>The Directorate of Norwegian Correctional Services is 
</p>
<p>currently in the process of ensuring the compilation of detailed statistics on the use of 
</p>
<p>solitary confinement. The tool which is being installed to obtain the said statistics (ASKS)

</p>
<p><b>131.141</b>&#8211;<b>131.143 Accepted. 
</b></p>
<p><b>131.144 Partially accepted.</b> (&#8216;Preventive detention&#8217; is understood as &#8216;pre-trial 
</p>
<p>detention&#8217;.) The Norwegian police has in recent years increased the fight against organised 
</p>
<p>criminal groups committing thefts. Many of the arrested suspects are foreign nationals. This 
</p>
<p>has created a strong increase in the use of pre-trial detention. Use of isolation in pre-trial 
</p>
<p>detention is a restriction decided by the court, if there is an imminent danger that the 
</p>
<p>detainee may interfere with the evidence of the case. The conditions to use isolation as well 
</p>
<p>as the possibilities to prolong the isolation period are strict. Children cannot be fully 
</p>
<p>isolated. Steps are currently being taken to reduce the effects of isolation on people in 
</p>
<p>police holding cells. 
</p>
<p><b>131.145</b> <b>Accepted, already implemented.8</b>

</b></p>
<p><b>131.148</b> <b>Accepted, already implemented.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>131.149</b> <b>Partially accepted</b>. On 20 January 2012, a law amendment entered into 
</p>
<p>force under which minors may only be held in custody when &#8216;compellingly necessary&#8217;. The 
</p>
<p>threshold for remanding children in custody is, thus, very high. The establishment of 
</p>
<p>separate juvenile units is meant to enable the segregation of children and adult prisoners. As 
</p>
<p>long as there is space in a juvenile unit, children will &#8211; as a rule &#8211; not be placed in ordinary 
</p>
<p>prisons. Once both adult and juvenile units are operational there may, however, still be 
</p>
<p>occasions when children are placed in ordinary prisons together with adults, for instance 
</p>
<p>when they need to be close to their home or it  is considered to be in the best interest of the 
</p>
<p>child for other reasons. 
</p>
<p><b>131.150. Accepted, already implemented.9 
</b></p>
<p><b>131.151.</b> <b>Accepted.</b> Norway is in the process of implementing further measures to

</b></p>
<p><b>131.158</b> <b>Partially accepted.</b> Measures are being taken to process cases within the 
</p>
<p>14-day statutory deadline. When it comes to shelters for children under the age of 18, the 
</p>
<p>Children&#8217;s Houses do not provide accommodation of this kind. Rather, crisis centres 
</p>
<p>(shelters) and child welfare services provide accommodation for children in need. 
</p>
<p><b>131.159 Partially accepted. </b>All children in Norway should be protected from 
</p>
<p>serious neglect, mistreatment and abuse, regardless of their background or citizenship. A 
</p>
<p>placement outside the home that is against the will of the parents can only be issued when 
</p>
<p>the child is subject to serious neglect, mistreatment or abuse, and when voluntary measures

</b></p>
<p>Under the Norwegian Child Welfare Act, when a child is placed outside the home due 
</p>
<p>regard shall be paid to the desirability of continuity in a child's upbringing and to the child's 
</p>
<p>ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic background. This can be a challenge in the case of 
</p>
<p>children with minority backgrounds. It is an important priority for the Government to 
</p>
<p>recruit more foster families with different ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic 
</p>
<p>backgrounds. Norway is also taking other measures to strengthen cultural expertise in the

</p>
<p>asylum, however, are not refugees and will be returned, unless they are given a right to stay

</b></p>
<p>Unaccompanied asylum seekers between the ages of 15 and 18 are offered accommodation 
</p>
<p>in reception centres run by the immigration authorities while their applications are being

<p>processed. The immigration authorities have the responsibility of care. Unaccompanied 
</p>
<p>asylum seekers below the age of 15 are given accommodation in care centres run by the 
</p>
<p>child welfare service, who also have responsibility of care for these children. 
</p>
<p>All unaccompanied minors below the age of 18 who are seeking asylum receive care and 
</p>
<p>are given access to health services and education. Despite the fact that accommodation 
</p>
<p>during the asylum-seeking process is offered by different authorities, the child welfare

<p><i>Notes 
</i></p>
<p> 
 1 Domestic law satisfies the relevant international obligations, but amendments to domestic legislation 
</p>
<p>are necessary in order to ratify the conventions referred to in recommendations 131.2 and 131.22. 
</p>
<p> 2 The penal provision specifically targeting domestic violence (section 219 of the Penal Code) entered 
</p>
<p>into force on 1 January 2006. 
</p>
<p> 3 Norwegian law is considered to be in conformity with the convention. Nevertheless, Norway has 
</p>
<p>stated that it will consider including other relevant types of discrimination in the provisions on torture, 
</p>
<p>as part of technical and material amendments in the new Penal Code following its entry into force, 
</p>
<p>which is planned for the second half of 2015. 
</p>
<p> 4 The existing legislation is considered to be in conformity with Norway&#8217;s human rights obligations, 
</p>
<p>including the right to freedom of belief, conscience and religion. Before draft legislation is presented 
</p>
<p>to the Storting (Norwegian parliament), the Government considers whether the proposed legislation is 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/3/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p> 
consistent with human rights. The right to freedom of belief, conscience and religion is also protected 
</p>
<p>by conventions that are incorporated into Norwegian law through the Human Rights Act. In the event 
</p>
<p>of conflict between norms, these conventions prevail over other Norwegian legislation. 
</p>
<p> 5 Hate speech, discriminating statements and incitement to violence &#8211; in any context &#8211; are criminal 
</p>
<p>offences providing that the human right to freedom of speech is upheld. 
</p>
<p> 6 The penal provision specifically targeting domestic violence (section 219 of the Penal Code) entered 
</p>
<p>into force on 1 January 2006. 
</p>
<p> 7 Provisions in the Penal Code cover many statements that may be described as hate speech. When 
</p>
<p>made in public, hateful and discriminating statements, incitement to violence and the disclosure of 
</p>
<p>certain private information are all considered criminal offences providing that the human right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of speech is upheld. The same applies to harassment and threats. 
</p>
<p> 8 (&#8216;Preventative detention&#8217; is understood as &#8216;pre-trial detention&#8217;.) A number of measures have been 
</p>
<p>taken the last few years to ensure that pre-trial detention of children is being used only as a measure 
</p>
<p>of last resort; in accordance with international human rights obligations. The number of children 
</p>
<p>under the age of 18 years in pre-trial detention has, thus, been reduced and is now at a minimum. 
</p>
<p> 9 In order to ensure that prison is only used as a measure of last resort and that the best interest of the 
</p>
<p>child is also a primary consideration in the case of juveniles in conflict with the law, a new, non-
</p>
<p>custodial sanction entered into force on 1 July 2014. This is intended to be an alternative to prison for 
</p>
<p>juveniles who have committed serious and/or repeated crimes. Another measure aimed at less serious 
</p>
<p>crimes entered into force simultaneously. Both of these measures are based on restorative justice 
</p>
<p>principles. 
</p>
<p> 10 The efforts being made in connection with the ongoing national strategy for increased voluntariness in 
</p>
<p>mental health services will continue throughout 2015. The results will then be evaluated and any need 
</p>
<p>for further follow-up will be considered. 
</p>
<p> 11 Relevant measures are being implemented, but this work is not yet finished, as it is part of the 
</p>
<p>aforementioned national strategy for increased voluntariness in mental health services (2012&#8211;2015). 
</p>
<p> 12 The regulations have been implemented. The right to specialised health care is decided on the basis of 
</p>
<p>an individual assessment of the person&#8217;s health, and is normally based on a referral from the person&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>GP. 
</p>
<p> 13 Securing the rights of the child is essential to Norway. Norway has recently, as a one-off solution, 
</p>
<p>allowed families who have been in Norway for three years or more at a given date and meet certain 
</p>
<p>conditions to obtain a residence permit. The Government has also proposed a permanent arrangement 
</p>
<p>to ensure that greater emphasis is placed children&#8217;s situation. 
</p>
<p>  Furthermore, the Government has proposed changes to the Immigration Regulations, to further clarify 
</p>
<p>the justification needed for decisions involving children. The immigration authorities are also 
</p>
<p>currently following up the recommendations of an external report. These recommendations concern 
</p>
<p>how the Immigration Appeals Board applies the child&#8217;s right to be heard and how it assesses the 
</p>
<p>situation of children in asylum cases.
