<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council established the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>the rights of persons with disabilities in its resolution 26/20. In resolution 26/20, the 
</p>
<p>Council expresses deep concern that, in all parts of the world, persons with disabilities 
</p>
<p>continued to face barriers in their participation as equal members of society and violations 
</p>
<p>of their human rights. Recognizing that greater attention was needed to address these 
</p>
<p>challenges, the Council appointed the Special Rapporteur for an initial period of three 
</p>
<p>years, to work together with other human rights bodies and mechanisms and the broader 
</p>
<p>global community towards a better realization of the rights of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>Catalina Devandas-Aguilar took office as the first mandate holder on 1 December 2014. 
</p>
<p>2. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 26/20, the Special Rapporteur will 
</p>
<p>report annually to the Council, starting from its twenty-eighth session, and to the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur describes her vision of the 
</p>
<p>mandate, her working methods and a work plan for the first three years. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background: towards a human rights-based approach to 
</b></p>
<p><b>disability 
</b></p>
<p>3. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities 
</p>
<p>brings the issue of disability to the family of human rights mandate holders and 
</p>
<p>mechanisms under the auspices of the Human Rights Council. The mandate strengthens the 
</p>
<p>United Nations system in its efforts to realize the rights of persons with disabilities and 
</p>
<p>reinforces an important message: persons with disabilities are holders of human rights on an 
</p>
<p>equal basis with others, and the global community must work together to promote their 
</p>
<p>inclusion from a human rights-based approach. 
</p>
<p>4. The establishment of the new mandate comes as important recognition of how far 
</p>
<p>the global community has come in the recent past in the advancement and the promotion of 
</p>
<p>the rights of persons with disabilities. In a very short period of time, there has been an 
</p>
<p>extraordinary paradigm shift, a change in the way persons with disabilities have been 
</p>
<p>perceived and hence treated. From its initial focus on charity and medical considerations, 
</p>
<p>the international community has moved towards a model that recognizes that social and 
</p>
<p>environmental barriers are the real obstacles for the enjoyment of human rights by persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities. It is in that interaction between a person with an impairment and his or her 
</p>
<p>environment where discrimination and rights violations arise, resulting in disability, and it 
</p>
<p>is only by addressing those social aspects that persons with disabilities will be fully 
</p>
<p>included in their communities.  
</p>
<p>5. The United Nations system has been responsive to this shift in paradigm and 
</p>
<p>become, over the years, a main actor in promoting a human rights-based approach to 
</p>
<p>disability. While the General Assembly started to include persons with disabilities in its 
</p>
<p>resolutions in the 1950s, human rights language became visible in the 1970s through the 
</p>
<p>adoption of two declarations: the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons 
</p>
<p>of 1971,1 and the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons of 1975.2 The United 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 General Assembly resolution 2856 (XXVI). 
</p>
<p> 2 General Assembly resolution 3447 (XXX). It is important to note that while these declarations 
</p>
<p>contain language that is today considered derogatory towards persons with disabilities, they played an 
</p>
<p>important role in advancing the understanding of the rights of persons with disabilities at that time. </p>


<p>Nations system paid increasing attention to persons with disabilities throughout the 1980s, 
</p>
<p>adopting in 1982 the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons,3 and 
</p>
<p>proclaiming the period 1983-1992 the United Nations Decade of Disabled Persons.4 
</p>
<p>6. In 1993, the General Assembly adopted the Standard Rules on the Equalization of 
</p>
<p>Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities.5 This non-binding document anchored the issue 
</p>
<p>of disability in a framework of non-discrimination and equal opportunity, and served as an 
</p>
<p>instrument to advance the rights of persons with disabilities in the context of social 
</p>
<p>development and beyond. The Rules created a monitoring mechanism within the 
</p>
<p>framework of the Commission for Social Development, namely, a Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>Disability, tasked with assisting States in assessing and measuring their progress in 
</p>
<p>implementing the Rules, providing advisory services, identifying obstacles and suggesting 
</p>
<p>suitable measures that would contribute to the successful implementation of the Rules. The 
</p>
<p>monitoring mechanism also included a panel of experts created by international 
</p>
<p>organizations representing persons with disabilities. Between 1994 and 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Commission appointed three Special Rapporteurs on Disability,6 who played an 
</p>
<p>instrumental role in advancing the global disability agenda. 
</p>
<p>7. In parallel to these disability-specific developments, and guided by the Charter of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>human rights framework continued to grow with the adoption in 1966 of two international 
</p>
<p>covenants &#8211; one on civil and political rights, the other on economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights &#8211; and subsequent thematic human rights treaties throughout the following decades. In 
</p>
<p>this context, persons with disabilities were viewed mainly from an anti-discrimination 
</p>
<p>perspective, first implicitly under &#8220;any other status&#8221;. In 1989, the Convention on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of the Child was the first binding treaty to explicitly mention disability as a ground of 
</p>
<p>discrimination. Although persons with disabilities were in theory equally protected under 
</p>
<p>the core human rights treaties, however, they would remain at the margins of human rights 
</p>
<p>discourse until the new millennium. 
</p>
<p>8. By 2001 it had become evident that, despite the various efforts made by the United 
</p>
<p>Nations system to advance the situation of persons with disabilities, they were not sufficient 
</p>
<p>to ensure the equal and effective enjoyment of human rights by persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>Following a recommendation made by States at the World Conference against Racism, 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, held in Durban, South Africa, 
</p>
<p>from 31 August to 8 September 2001, the General Assembly established in its resolution 
</p>
<p>56/168 an ad hoc committee to consider proposals for a thematic convention on the 
</p>
<p>promotion of the rights of persons with disabilities. The Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities was negotiated in a relatively short period of time, between 2002 
</p>
<p>and 2006. The negotiations were characterized by the active participation of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and their representative organizations, bringing to the drafting process a 
</p>
<p>remarkable and previously unprecedented level of ownership by rights-holders and their 
</p>
<p>support networks. The Convention and the Optional Protocol thereto were adopted by the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly by its resolution 61/106, and came into force on 3 May 2008. 
</p>
<p>9. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ties the social 
</p>
<p>understanding of disability to a legal framework, defining duty-bearers and rights-holders, 
</p>
<p>and implementation and accountability frameworks. In doing so, it anchors disability to a 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 General Assembly resolution 37/52. 
</p>
<p> 4 General Assembly resolution 37/53. 
</p>
<p> 5 General Assembly resolution 48/96, annex.  
</p>
<p> 6 Bengt Lindqvist (Sweden), from 1994 to 2002; Sheikha Hessa Khalifa bin Ahmed al-Thani (Qatar), 
</p>
<p>from 2003 to 2009; and Shuaib Chalklen (South Africa), from 2009 to 2014. </p>


<p>human rights-based approach and serves as a starting point for work in all areas of life, 
</p>
<p>including as a tool for promoting this approach to development. In its preamble, the 
</p>
<p>Convention recognizes that disability is an evolving concept that results from the 
</p>
<p>interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers 
</p>
<p>that hinders their full and effective participation in society. Through the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>Convention, the global community took a decisive step from approaches based on 
</p>
<p>considerations of charity and rehabilitation to social and human rights models &#8211; and from a 
</p>
<p>soft law framework to a legally binding human rights treaty that clarifies that persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities are holders of human rights on an equal basis with others.7 
</p>
<p>10. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities accelerated the 
</p>
<p>momentum with regard to the rights of persons with disabilities, and increased attention to 
</p>
<p>the issue within the global community. The eight years since the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>Convention have witnessed a mobilization within the United Nations system towards 
</p>
<p>greater protection of the rights of persons with disabilities, the key developments including: 
</p>
<p>(a) The establishment of the Conference of States Parties to the Convention, on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which convened for the first time in 2008 at 
</p>
<p>Headquarters in New York.8 The annual Conference and its parallel events gather an 
</p>
<p>important number of stakeholders to exchange views on progress and challenges in 
</p>
<p>implementing the Convention. 
</p>
<p>(b) The creation in 2008 of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with 
</p>
<p>Disabilities, which held its first session in Geneva in 2009. In response to a rapidly 
</p>
<p>increasing number of ratifications, the amount of State party received, and the need for 
</p>
<p>interpretation and guidance on Convention provisions, the Committee has grown from 12 to 
</p>
<p>18 members and meets for two four-week sessions and two pre-sessional working group 
</p>
<p>sessions annually. To date, the Committee has reviewed 19 States party initial reports, held 
</p>
<p>three days of general discussion and issued two general comments: on equal recognition 
</p>
<p>before the law (art. 12),9 and on accessibility (art. 9).10 
</p>
<p>(c) The inclusion of the rights of persons with disabilities in the work of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council. The Council adopted its first resolution on the human rights of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities, resolution 7/9, in 2008, in which it decided to hold an annual 
</p>
<p>interactive debate on the issue. Since its tenth session, the Council has held an annual 
</p>
<p>discussion on a broad variety of topics, each time requesting the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to present a thematic report on 
</p>
<p>the issue under discussion.11 In addition, the Council has advanced in making its work 
</p>
<p>accessible to and inclusive of persons with disabilities, and in mainstreaming disability in 
</p>
<p>other areas of work. 
</p>
<p>(d) Increased attention by United Nations programmes, fund and agencies on the 
</p>
<p>promotion of the rights of persons with disabilities, and the mobilization of two inter-
</p>
<p>agency mechanisms: the Inter-Agency Support Group on the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities and the United Nations Partnership to Promote the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities. Many agencies have also created and/or strengthened focal points 
</p>
<p>on disability and are gradually adopting a human rights-based approach to their work.

<p>11. The above-mentioned developments have contributed to building a structure within 
</p>
<p>which the global community is better prepared to respond more effectively and to work in 
</p>
<p>unity towards achieving the full enjoyment of the rights of persons with disabilities. The 
</p>
<p>establishment of the mandate of Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities was a welcome step in this series of positive developments. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Setting up the mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Mandate 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 26/20, decided to appoint, for a 
</p>
<p>period of three years, a Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities with 
</p>
<p>the following mandate: 
</p>
<p>(a) To develop a regular dialogue and to consult with States and other relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, regional human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms, national human rights institutions, national independent monitoring 
</p>
<p>frameworks designated under article 33, paragraph 2 of the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities, persons with disabilities and their representative organizations, 
</p>
<p>and other civil society organizations to identify, exchange and promote good practices 
</p>
<p>relating to the realization of the rights of persons with disabilities and their participation as 
</p>
<p>equal members of society; 
</p>
<p>(b) To gather, request, receive and exchange information and communications 
</p>
<p>from and with States and other relevant sources, including persons with disabilities and 
</p>
<p>their representative organizations and other civil society organizations, on violations of the 
</p>
<p>rights of persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p>(c) To make concrete recommendations on how to better promote and protect the 
</p>
<p>rights of persons with disabilities, including on how to contribute to the realization of 
</p>
<p>internationally agreed development goals for persons with disabilities, including the 
</p>
<p>Millennium Development Goals, how to promote development that is inclusive of and 
</p>
<p>accessible to persons with disabilities, and how to promote their role as both agents for and 
</p>
<p>beneficiaries of development; 
</p>
<p>(d) To conduct, facilitate and support the provision of advisory services, 
</p>
<p>technical assistance, capacity-building and international cooperation in support of national 
</p>
<p>efforts for the effective realization of the rights of persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p>(e) To raise awareness of the rights of persons with disabilities, to combat 
</p>
<p>stereotypes, prejudices and harmful practices that hinder their opportunity to participate in 
</p>
<p>society on an equal basis with others, to promote awareness of their positive contributions 
</p>
<p>and to inform persons with disabilities about their rights; 
</p>
<p>(f) To work closely with the special procedures and other human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, the treaty bodies, in particular the Committee on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and other relevant United Nations agencies, 
</p>
<p>programmes and funds, including the United Nations Partnership to Promote the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities and the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Disability and 
</p>
<p>Accessibility, within their respective mandates, with a view to avoiding unnecessary 
</p>
<p>duplication; 
</p>
<p>(g) To cooperate closely with the Conference of States Parties to the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Commission for Social Development, 
</p>
<p>including by participating in their annual sessions upon request; </p>


<p>(h) To integrate a gender perspective throughout the work of the mandate and to 
</p>
<p>address multiple, intersecting and aggravated forms of discrimination faced by persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities. 
</p>
<p>13. In addition, in resolution 26/20, the Human Rights Council requested the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur to report annually to the Human Rights Council, starting from its twenty-eighth 
</p>
<p>session, and to the General Assembly, in accessible formats and according to their 
</p>
<p>respective programmes of work, and the Secretary-General to bring the reports of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur to the attention of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with 
</p>
<p>Disabilities, the Conference of States Parties and the Commission for Social Development 
</p>
<p>for their information and to avoid unnecessary duplication. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur commends the establishment of the mandate and the many 
</p>
<p>opportunities for change that it brings. As a new mandate within the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>and a particularly broad one, it embraces the many ongoing processes at the national, 
</p>
<p>regional and international levels relating to the advancement of the rights of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, and covers fields of work in which a stronger and systematic disability 
</p>
<p>perspective is needed. The Special Rapporteur also foresees a considerable workload that 
</p>
<p>may bring about challenges in the implementation phase. The magnitude of the efforts that 
</p>
<p>are needed to engage fruitfully in each of the processes and activities presents particular 
</p>
<p>challenges in terms of human and financial capacity. While careful prioritization will be a 
</p>
<p>key factor in identifying the areas where the Special Rapporteur can contribute with a clear 
</p>
<p>added value, the mandate holder is hopeful that, in a spirit of collaboration and in order to 
</p>
<p>secure the effective implementation of her mandate, she would benefit from the support of 
</p>
<p>States, partners and other stakeholders, which would thus reaffirm their commitment to the 
</p>
<p>promotion of the rights of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Framework for the implementation of the mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The Convention as the guiding standard 
</b></p>
<p>15. In the preamble of Human Rights Council resolution 26/20, in which the Council 
</p>
<p>established the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, the Council also recalled the 
</p>
<p>universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms. In that spirit, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the entire 
</p>
<p>United Nations regulatory framework applies to persons with disabilities on an equal basis 
</p>
<p>with others. Many positive developments have already taken place in which the United 
</p>
<p>Nations system has advanced in the direction of including the rights of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities in non-disability specific arenas, such as in the current negotiations of the post-
</p>
<p>2015 development framework,12 in the work of human rights treaty bodies beyond the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and various areas of thematic work of 
</p>
<p>the Council, as well as in intergovernmental processes, including the upcoming third World 
</p>
<p>Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction. Much more, however, is needed to achieve the full 
</p>
<p>inclusion of the rights of persons with disabilities in all endeavours of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>and the broader global community. This will be highlighted by the Special Rapporteur as a 
</p>
<p>need to further promote a cross-cutting approach throughout her mandate. 
</p>
<p>16. As the jointly agreed and highest international standard on the rights of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities should guide all 
</p>
<p>actions related to the advancement of the rights of persons with disabilities, including the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 12 For further information on the post-2015 process and the work of the Open Working Group on 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Development Goals, see https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org.  </p>


<p>work of the Special Rapporteur. The Convention has had an overwhelmingly positive 
</p>
<p>reception; since 2006, it has been ratified or acceded to by 150 States and the European 
</p>
<p>Union, and the Special Rapporteur has joined other stakeholders in a call for universal 
</p>
<p>ratification. This demonstrates an acceptance by the global community of the Convention as 
</p>
<p>a universal standard and a collectively agreed benchmark against which progress is to be 
</p>
<p>measured. 
</p>
<p>17. Owing to the participatory nature of the negotiations on the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities, it can be argued that the Convention enjoys ipso facto a 
</p>
<p>certain level of unprecedented legitimacy, accorded to it not only by a large number of 
</p>
<p>States but also by the rights-holders themselves. Persons with disabilities and their 
</p>
<p>representative organizations were not merely consulted in the drafting process; their 
</p>
<p>expertise was recognized and valued, and they became part and parcel of the negotiating 
</p>
<p>process. This had a direct impact on the text of the Convention, where participation and 
</p>
<p>inclusion are present throughout, including as a general principle (art. 3), a general 
</p>
<p>obligation of States parties in relation to any decision-making process (art. 4) and a specific 
</p>
<p>obligation in relation to developing a national implementation and monitoring framework 
</p>
<p>(art. 33). The Special Rapporteur attaches great importance to such an outstanding 
</p>
<p>participatory approach and wishes to maintain and reinforce it in her work. 
</p>
<p>18. As highlighted in the outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly on the realization of the Millennium Development Goals and other 
</p>
<p>internationally agreed development goals for persons with disabilities: the way forward, a 
</p>
<p>disability-inclusive development agenda towards 2015 and beyond,13 the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities has the unique strength of being a human rights 
</p>
<p>instrument with a development perspective, equally protecting the rights of all persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities in all parts of the world. The Special Rapporteur sees this dual approach as a 
</p>
<p>concrete result of how the disability work within the United Nations has been built up, with 
</p>
<p>strong participation from stakeholders from the global South, and as a tool for promoting 
</p>
<p>sustainable development, based on the standards, norms and principles of human rights, and 
</p>
<p>inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities. The mandate of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur embodies the added value of working towards sustainable development from a 
</p>
<p>human rights-based approach, as described in Human Rights Council resolution 26/20. In 
</p>
<p>this spirit, the Special Rapporteur wishes to capitalize on both the human rights and the 
</p>
<p>development agendas, to address the real challenges that persons with disabilities face in 
</p>
<p>their everyday lives, in which the two cannot be separated: in situations of extreme poverty 
</p>
<p>and exclusion, deprived of their most basic rights and too often with a precarious standard 
</p>
<p>of life. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Overarching considerations of the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur will be guided by the following overarching considerations 
</p>
<p>in all aspects of her work: 
</p>
<p>(a) Participation. In the spirit of the Convention and the nature of the disability 
</p>
<p>movement, the Special Rapporteur aims to carry out her work in a participatory, 
</p>
<p>consultative and open manner, and actively involve persons with disabilities and their 
</p>
<p>representative organizations in her work. 
</p>
<p>(b) Inclusiveness. The Special Rapporteur will work in an inclusive manner, 
</p>
<p>aiming to ensure that the needs and concerns of persons with all different kinds of 
</p>
<p>impairment are taken into equal consideration and that her work is age-sensitive, paying 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 13 General Assembly resolution 68/3. </p>


<p>special attention to children, adolescents and older persons with disabilities. She will be 
</p>
<p>attentive to the specific situation of persons with disabilities who may be subject to multiple 
</p>
<p>or aggravated forms of discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, language, religion, 
</p>
<p>political or other opinion, national, ethnic, indigenous or social origin, property, birth, age 
</p>
<p>or other status, and the multiple layers of barriers that these intersections may create. She 
</p>
<p>will also work across social and economic groups and layers and do her utmost to ensure 
</p>
<p>that no one is left behind in her deliberations. 
</p>
<p>(c) Embracing human diversity. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities are part of human diversity and should be respected and embraced as such. 
</p>
<p>This idea was introduced among the general principles of the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities as &#8220;respect for difference and acceptance of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities as part of human diversity and humanity&#8221;. Many of our societies have to date 
</p>
<p>failed to embrace this idea. Building on the notion of human diversity, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur will in her work promote the dignity and pride of persons with disabilities as 
</p>
<p>part of humanity, bringing forth different experiences and fighting against negative and 
</p>
<p>excluding perceptions related to disability. 
</p>
<p>(d) Gender sensitivity. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, international and 
</p>
<p>national efforts on disability have to a certain degree failed to systematically take into 
</p>
<p>account a gender perspective; she therefore aims to pay special attention to gender 
</p>
<p>sensitivity in her work, considering, in the first instance, the multifaceted discrimination 
</p>
<p>and marginalization and the compounded violations of human rights that women and girls 
</p>
<p>with disabilities face in most societies, as well as other persons or groups who may 
</p>
<p>experience discrimination due to their sex or disability. 
</p>
<p>(e) Accessibility. In the work of the Special Rapporteur, accessibility will be 
</p>
<p>relevant mainly in two interdependent ways. First, there is an aim to ensure full 
</p>
<p>accessibility of events, meetings and documentation in the official duties of the mandate 
</p>
<p>holder. Second, accessibility will be seen as a cross-cutting issue in the substantive work of 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur, ensuring that it is fully present in national legislative frameworks, 
</p>
<p>and in policy and programming, as well as a priority area of United Nations agencies, funds 
</p>
<p>and programmes and other close partners. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>20. The core of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s work will consist of three interrelated 
</p>
<p>activities:  
</p>
<p>(a) Gathering, requesting, receiving and exchanging information and 
</p>
<p>communications from and with States and other relevant sources, including persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and their representative organizations and other civil society organizations, on 
</p>
<p>violations of the rights of persons with disabilities;  
</p>
<p>(b)  Annual reports on the activities undertaken in fulfilling her mandate 
</p>
<p>submitted to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly, including thematic 
</p>
<p>studies on key issues related to the advancement of the rights of persons with disabilities;  
</p>
<p>(c)  Country visits at the invitation of Governments (see para. 23 (d) below).  
</p>
<p>21. In addition and within the framework of her mandate, the Special Rapporteur intends 
</p>
<p>to undertake her tasks through the following working methods: 
</p>
<p>(a) Collaborative efforts. As requested by the Human Rights Council in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 26/20, the Special Rapporteur will develop a regular dialogue and consult with 
</p>
<p>States and other relevant stakeholders to identify, exchange and promote good practices </p>


<p>relating to the realization of the rights of persons with disabilities and their participation as 
</p>
<p>equal members of society. In this spirit, she is committed to building a mandate based on 
</p>
<p>participation, dialogue and consultation. 
</p>
<p>(b) Facilitating cooperation and building bridges. Even though considerable 
</p>
<p>advances have been made at the global, regional, national and local levels on advancing the 
</p>
<p>rights of persons with disabilities, projects or initiatives often take place in isolation. To 
</p>
<p>address this challenge, the Special Rapporteur sees her role as facilitating cooperation 
</p>
<p>among stakeholders and building bridges between projects, initiatives and stakeholders, and 
</p>
<p>countries and continents, with a view to creating platforms for the exchange of good 
</p>
<p>practices and lessons learned. She also aims to serve as a catalyst for unified action to 
</p>
<p>strengthen impact. 
</p>
<p>(c) Technical assistance and knowledge development. In accordance with 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 26/20, the Special Rapporteur will conduct, facilitate and support the 
</p>
<p>provision of advisory services, technical assistance, capacity-building and international 
</p>
<p>cooperation to support national efforts aimed at the effective realization of the rights of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities. Furthermore, whenever relevant and with a view to informing her 
</p>
<p>technical advisory role, she aims to contribute to the development of knowledge and 
</p>
<p>standards on the rights of persons with disabilities, focusing on thematic issues which have 
</p>
<p>emerged as a priority in discussions with stakeholders. The Special Rapporteur also aims to 
</p>
<p>convene expert meetings in order to be informed of the latest developments with regard to 
</p>
<p>specific thematic issues and relevant laws, policies and practices. 
</p>
<p>(d) Disability-inclusive perspective. The Special Rapporteur aims to support and 
</p>
<p>promote disability-specific efforts on the one hand, and to an important extent, to ensure an 
</p>
<p>inclusive perspective in efforts and processes with a general scope on the other. This dual 
</p>
<p>approach in the advancement of the rights of persons with disabilities is of particular 
</p>
<p>importance since, despite various efforts made to achieve inclusion, persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities have often remained invisible and excluded from non-disability-specific 
</p>
<p>discussions and processes. 
</p>
<p>(e) Building ownership. The Special Rapporteur believes that efforts that are 
</p>
<p>fully owned by the concerned societies are the only ones that bring about sustainable 
</p>
<p>change. There is no single model that fits all; responses that are successful in one part of the 
</p>
<p>world may be detrimental in another. For this reason, it will be important to build on 
</p>
<p>ownership and culturally tailored responses at the national level in the advancement of the 
</p>
<p>rights of persons with disabilities. In her work, the Special Rapporteur will thus aim to 
</p>
<p>promote efforts compliant with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</p>
<p>and solutions related to advancing the implementation of the rights of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities that at the same time take into account cultural and national contexts and 
</p>
<p>particularities. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Promoting the inclusion of the rights of persons with 
</b></p>
<p><b>disabilities in international processes and national agendas 
</b></p>
<p>22. In the light of the mandate entrusted to the Special Rapporteur by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council in its resolution 26/20, the mandate holder aims to put particular emphasis on 
</p>
<p>promoting the inclusion of the rights of persons with disabilities in a set of national and 
</p>
<p>international processes which she regards as priorities. </p>


<p><b> A. Promoting the inclusion of the rights of persons with disabilities in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>national agenda  
</b></p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that a very important part of the mandate is to 
</p>
<p>support States in the development of their national efforts to advance the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the rights of persons with disabilities. To accomplish this, the Special Rapporteur will put 
</p>
<p>particular emphasis on the following activities: 
</p>
<p>(a) Supporting law reform processes. Most legal systems in the world still 
</p>
<p>contain provisions that discriminate against persons with disabilities and violate their 
</p>
<p>human rights, from the denial of legal capacity or the right to vote to education laws that 
</p>
<p>exclude children with disabilities from the general education system. Although efforts have 
</p>
<p>been made to harmonize national legislation with the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
</p>
<p>with Disabilities, much remains to be done. The Special Rapporteur aims to contribute to 
</p>
<p>these processes by providing technical advice and exchanging good practices with a view to 
</p>
<p>supporting and promoting legal reform that is inclusive of the rights of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, and by promoting the effective involvement of and consultation with persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities and their representative organizations in legislative reform. 
</p>
<p>(b) Fostering capacity-building of national stakeholders. The Convention brings 
</p>
<p>about many concepts and new ideas that challenge outdated perceptions of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities. The Special Rapporteur aims to support national stakeholders, including 
</p>
<p>government officials, in translating internationally agreed norms and standards to national 
</p>
<p>laws, policies, programmes and practices, and to advise them in challenges that they may 
</p>
<p>face in implementing the rights of persons with disabilities. In cooperation with relevant 
</p>
<p>United Nations agencies and other organizations, the mandate holder will explore the 
</p>
<p>feasibility of developing training modules for national stakeholders to support the effective 
</p>
<p>advancement of the rights of persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>(c) Promoting the establishment and/or strengthening of national mechanisms for 
</p>
<p>implementation and monitoring. Guided by article 33 of the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities,14 many States are in the process of setting up a national 
</p>
<p>framework for implementing and monitoring the Convention. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>wishes to work together with the mechanisms called for in article 33 (government focal 
</p>
<p>points and coordination mechanisms, independent monitoring bodies and civil society), 
</p>
<p>support their efforts and address their potential challenges with a view to reinforcing the 
</p>
<p>development of Convention-compliant national implementation and monitoring 
</p>
<p>frameworks. 
</p>
<p>(d) Country visits. The Special Rapporteur will, at the invitation of 
</p>
<p>Governments, undertake country visits to learn about national realities and observe relevant 
</p>
<p>laws, policies and programmes, and identify good practices and areas of cooperation and 
</p>
<p>technical support to advance constructive dialogue and further developments in the field of 
</p>
<p>the rights of persons with disabilities. She will study national legislation, policies, 
</p>
<p>programmes and practices, and regulatory frameworks and institutions, to provide guidance 
</p>
<p>to States in their activities &#8211; including, where relevant, by supporting them in implementing 
</p>
<p>recommendations made by human rights mechanisms &#8211; in seeking to advance the rights of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities in accordance with the Convention. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 14 See the thematic study prepared by OHCHR on the role of national mechanisms for the 
</p>
<p>implementation and monitoring of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/13/29). </p>


<p>(e) Statistics and data-collection. With a view to promoting the inclusion of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities in national data-collection systems, and guided by article 31 of the 
</p>
<p>Convention, the Special Rapporteur will support efforts to collect adequately disaggregated 
</p>
<p>data and statistics to enable States to formulate and implement policies to give effect to the 
</p>
<p>Convention. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Promoting the inclusion of the rights of persons with disabilities in 
</b></p>
<p><b>international processes</b>  
</p>
<p>24. While positive steps have been taken to include the rights of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities in a range of human rights and development processes at the international level, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur considers it important to contribute to these efforts by providing 
</p>
<p>technical advice and advocating for a human rights framing in all disability-related work. 
</p>
<p>25. Guided by Human Rights Council resolution 26/20 and the call made in the 
</p>
<p>Convention for international cooperation that is inclusive of and accessible to persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, the Special Rapporteur will pay particular attention to promoting the role of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities as both agents for and beneficiaries of development, and make 
</p>
<p>recommendations thereon. In development cooperation efforts, she will, in particular, seek 
</p>
<p>to promote South-South and triangular cooperation that reinforces national ownership of 
</p>
<p>efforts. In addition, she will engage in the final stages of the process leading to the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a new international development agenda beyond 2015, joining other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders in advocating for the post-2015 period that is sustainable, inclusive and 
</p>
<p>accessible. The focus of the mandate holder will be on ensuring that achievements are 
</p>
<p>retained and that goals and targets are translated into meaningful and inclusive indicators, 
</p>
<p>and on developing efficient and inclusive implementation and monitoring frameworks for 
</p>
<p>the new agenda. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to working closely together with other special 
</p>
<p>procedures mandate holders and aims, as an initial step, to contact all mandate holders with 
</p>
<p>a call to harmonize efforts and build upon each other&#8217;s work. Attention will be paid to the 
</p>
<p>mandate&#8217;s call to address multiple and aggravated forms of discrimination by working in 
</p>
<p>close collaboration with other mandates focusing on groups, such as the mandate holders on 
</p>
<p>the rights of indigenous peoples, violence against women, the sale of children, the human 
</p>
<p>rights of migrants, minority issues and internally displaced persons, older persons and 
</p>
<p>discrimination against women in law and in pPractice. She also sees important connections 
</p>
<p>between her mandate and those focusing on specific economic and social rights, such as the 
</p>
<p>special procedures on the rights to health, education, extreme poverty, adequate housing, 
</p>
<p>water and sanitation, and to food, as well as those focusing on civil and political rights, 
</p>
<p>such as the Special Rapporteur on torture, extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
</p>
<p>and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. 
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur attaches great importance to the work of United Nations 
</p>
<p>human rights treaty bodies and their jurisprudence. She sees a natural link between her 
</p>
<p>work and that of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and extends her 
</p>
<p>full support and availability to collaborate with the Committee whenever relevant for both 
</p>
<p>mechanisms in order to contribute to and build upon each other&#8217;s work in a way that 
</p>
<p>advances the rights of persons with disabilities in a coherent manner and maximizes the use 
</p>
<p>of available resources. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to contact other treaty bodies 
</p>
<p>with a view to sharing information gathered on thematic issues that might be of interest in 
</p>
<p>their respective area of work. She extends her support for collaborating for the 
</p>
<p>harmonization of standards and sharing of information that can be of relevance to the 
</p>
<p>respective bodies. </p>


<p>28. In accordance with the mandate, the Special Rapporteur will cooperate closely with 
</p>
<p>the Conference of States Parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
</p>
<p>Disabilities and the Commission for Social Development by exchanging regularly and 
</p>
<p>participating in their annual sessions upon request. She appreciates the first exchange she 
</p>
<p>had with the Commission at its fifty-third session, in February 2015, and looks forward to 
</p>
<p>continuing to bring to these platforms updates on her work and findings from country visits 
</p>
<p>and on thematic issues. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur will join the disability community in advocating for 
</p>
<p>disability-inclusive disaster risk reduction ahead of the third World Conference on Disaster 
</p>
<p>Risk Reduction, to be held in March 2015, and engage in the process leading to the World 
</p>
<p>Humanitarian Summit in 2016 in the light of article 11 of the Convention, which calls for 
</p>
<p>measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of 
</p>
<p>risk, including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the occurrence 
</p>
<p>of natural disasters. She will also engage in efforts to ensure that the rights of women and 
</p>
<p>girls with disabilities are adequately reflected in the process of the 20-year review of the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and its outcome. 
</p>
<p>30. As invited by the General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur envisages to support 
</p>
<p>the United Nations system, and in particular the Statistical Commission, as appropriate and 
</p>
<p>within the scope of the mandate and existing resources, to update existing methodologies of 
</p>
<p>disability data collection and analysis for persons with disabilities, to obtain internationally 
</p>
<p>comparable data on the situation of persons with disabilities and to regularly include 
</p>
<p>relevant disability data or relevant qualitative facts, as appropriate, in relevant United 
</p>
<p>Nations publications in the field of economic and social development.15 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur will liaise closely with United Nations agencies, funds and 
</p>
<p>programmes working in the area of disability, and welcomes the exchange of information 
</p>
<p>and mutual sharing of findings and developments. In accordance with her mandate, she 
</p>
<p>envisages to work closely with the United Nations Partnership to Promote the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities with a view to seeking collaboration. The Special Rapporteur will 
</p>
<p>also exchange with the Inter-Agency Support Group on the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities in recognition of the institutional mandate to promote the rights of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities of the Group and each of its members. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur believes that regional bodies play an important role in 
</p>
<p>interpreting international standards at the regional level and advancing the rights of persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities within relevant cultural and economic regional contexts. In this light, she 
</p>
<p>will be available to provide advice upon request, taking into account the work plans and 
</p>
<p>priorities of regional organizations in processes involving the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>the rights of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Areas of concern and priority issues for the mandate  
</b></p>
<p>33. Given the broad scope of the mandate and the fact that it is subject to the availability 
</p>
<p>of resources for its implementation, the Special Rapporteur has decided to mainly focus on 
</p>
<p>a few priority areas of concern, which in her view present the most urgent challenges for 
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of human rights by persons with disabilities. These areas of concern have 
</p>
<p>been grouped into three complementary, mutually reinforcing clusters: 
</p>
<p>(a) Promoting citizenship. Supporting the active participation of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities in all decision-making process affecting their lives, including through the right 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 15 General Assembly resolution 69/142, para. 18. </p>


<p>to equal recognition before the law, the right to freedom and security of the person, the 
</p>
<p>right to live independently and to be included in the community and other interrelated rights 
</p>
<p>in the civil and political sphere.  
</p>
<p>(b) Combating poverty: Addressing the root causes of poverty among persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities that prevent them from enjoying their economic and social rights and being 
</p>
<p>active contributors to their communities, including by supporting the development and 
</p>
<p>implementation of social protection systems that are inclusive of persons with disabilities, 
</p>
<p>by promoting access to inclusive education and employment, and by contributing to the 
</p>
<p>inclusion of persons with disabilities in all national and international development 
</p>
<p>processes and programmes. 
</p>
<p>(c) Promoting change in social perceptions about persons with disabilities. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur, guided by article 8 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
</p>
<p>Disabilities and paragraph 2 (<i>e</i>) of Human Rights Council resolution 26/20, intends to 
</p>
<p>challenge and to contribute to changing negative perceptions of persons with disabilities 
</p>
<p>with a view to fostering respect for the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities, 
</p>
<p>combating stereotypes, prejudice and harmful practices relating to persons with disabilities, 
</p>
<p>promoting awareness of the positive contributions of persons with disabilities to society and 
</p>
<p>informing persons with disabilities, their families and communities about their rights. 
</p>
<p>Awareness-raising activities will be undertaken as stand-alone activities, such as social 
</p>
<p>media campaigns and contributing to the visibility of the annual International Day of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities, and as components of her mandated work. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. First steps in setting up a framework for collaboration 
</b></p>
<p>34. In her first months as mandate holder, the Special Rapporteur took initial steps to set 
</p>
<p>up a framework for collaboration. Grateful for the positive welcome that she has received, 
</p>
<p>she has already had the chance to exchange with a large number of stakeholders and looks 
</p>
<p>forward to further opportunities of interaction. 
</p>
<p>35. Upon taking up her duties, on 3 December 2014 the Special Rapporteur issued her 
</p>
<p>very first statement together with the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</p>
<p>and the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Disability and Accessibility, in which 
</p>
<p>these human rights mechanisms called jointly for the inclusion of the rights of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities in relevant ongoing processes, ranging from defining the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda to climate negotiations and the third World Conference on Disaster 
</p>
<p>Risk Reduction, and called for universal ratification of the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto. While respecting the 
</p>
<p>independence and specificity of each mandate, these mechanisms will continue to work 
</p>
<p>together in a coherent manner to build upon each other&#8217;s work and to collaborate when 
</p>
<p>relevant. The three mechanisms have started to coordinate their work informally with the 
</p>
<p>aim of exchanging information on a regular basis and identifying areas where joint action is 
</p>
<p>of added value and can bring about a stronger impact. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur has also taken first steps towards collaborating with other 
</p>
<p>special procedures mandate holders. Initial efforts of collaboration have included a joint 
</p>
<p>statement made on Human Rights Day, on 10 December 2014, with other special 
</p>
<p>procedures mandate holders on climate change and human rights, and joined efforts 
</p>
<p>regarding issues of common concern with the mandate holders on the right to food, older 
</p>
<p>persons and the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
</p>
<p>physical and mental health. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur participated in the fifty-third session of the Commission for 
</p>
<p>Social Development, at which she spoke under the agenda item 3(6), on the review of </p>


<p>relevant United Nations plans and programmes of action pertaining to the situation of social 
</p>
<p>groups, on her plan of work and its contribution to the work of the Commission, in 
</p>
<p>particular in its efforts in the context of a sustainable development agenda inclusive of the 
</p>
<p>rights of persons with disabilities. She has also approached the Conference of States Parties 
</p>
<p>to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to define her engagement in 
</p>
<p>that context. 
</p>
<p>38. In addition, the Special Rapporteur has commenced coordination with the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Partnership to Promote the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; initial discussions 
</p>
<p>have been held on exploring how to coordinate geographic and thematic focus in national 
</p>
<p>efforts. The Special Rapporteur has also had exchanges with a number of disability focal 
</p>
<p>points of United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, and other international 
</p>
<p>organizations and bodies to identify areas of collaboration and feed into each other&#8217;s work. 
</p>
<p>39. In setting up her mandate, the Special Rapporteur has started to engage with the 
</p>
<p>Centre for Disability Law and Policy of the National University of Ireland, Galway and the 
</p>
<p>University of Costa Rica in order to obtain academic support in particular areas of research 
</p>
<p>and knowledge development. She will continue to pursue opportunities for academic liaison 
</p>
<p>throughout her mandate.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>40.<b> The Special Rapporteur sees her mandate as a celebration of the rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons with disabilities and recognition of their importance in the global agenda of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights and development. The creation of the mandate is a welcome step 
</b></p>
<p><b>towards building a United Nations system that responds more effectively in the area of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the rights of persons with disabilities. 
</b></p>
<p>41.<b> In accordance with her mandate described by the Human Rights Council in its 
</b></p>
<p><b>resolution 26/20, the Special Rapporteur aims to respond to the expectations of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>broad range of stakeholders of an acceleration in the advances made in the rights of
