<p><b>A/HRC/23/44/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>2</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Proposed amendments to the report of the Special 
Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced 
persons by the Government of the Republic of the Sudan 
</b></p>
<p><b> I.  General comments 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraph 4 of the report (Political context), it has been stated that (Following its 
independence from the United Kingdom in 1956, Sudan has been affected by long standing 
civil wars, between the north and the south, and in the eastern and western regions of the 
country.) end of quote. This totally contradicts the basic historical fact that the rebellion in 
Southern part of the Sudan started in August 1955 before Sudan&#8217;s independence from the 
</p>
<p>British colonization. Rebel movements that are supported by external parties raised arms in 
later stages.  
</p>
<p>2. In Para 6 of the report, it was mentioned that &quot; &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. which marked Sudan's first 
multi-party elections in 24 years, although these came under criticism by international 
observers&quot; this statement is not true and contradicts the reports of different credible 
observers including the United Nations Mission in Sudan- UNMIS and the Carter Center as 
well as other independent international, regional and national observers. This part is based 
on BBC News information (foot note 3- page5), that lacks the impartiality and sufficient 
standards to be a reference in  such an international professional report. The 2010 
Legislative and Presidential elections is indeed the first multi-party election after the CPA 
in 2005.  
</p>
<p>3. In the same Para 6 the report refers to the International Criminal Court, which is not 
relevant to the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, and the SR knows for sure that, adhering 
to any international treaty is governed by the Vienna Convention on the law of treaties 1969 
and 1978, and the consent of sovereign state to be bound. The other issue is that the part is 
not an integral, relevant or essential part to the introduction; hence, the Government of 
Sudan requests its deletion from the report. This part is also based on BBC News 
information as mentioned in foot note 3 &#8211;page 5, and GOS would like to express its 
rejection to take such a source as a reference in this report. 
</p>
<p>4. In the same Para 6, the SR refers to the constitution making process in Sudan, its 
transparency, participatory and inclusiveness, and as a matter of neutrality and credibility of 
the report, the SR should have also highlighted the efforts and activities undertaken by the 
government in collaboration with UNDP by reflecting these efforts in the report, since it 
had been made known to him during his visit. 
</p>
<p>5. The report in different paragraphs refers to millions of IDPs and gives specific 
number in different areas of Sudan. In this regard the government is challenging the 
accuracy of the numbers given , the below table shows the actual statistics: 
</p>
<p><i>State  No. of IDPs Returnees 
</i></p>
<p>South Kordofan 180.000  
</p>
<p>Blue Nile 60.000 32.000 
</p>
<p>South Darfur 330.000  
</p>
<p>East Darfur 105.000 (Affected by 
Labado and Mahajria 
Incidents but not IDPs) 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/44/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>3</b> 
</p>
<p><i>State  No. of IDPs Returnees 
</i></p>
<p>Central Darfur 120.000  
</p>
<p>North Darfur 183.000  
</p>
<p>West Darfur 72.000  
</p>
<p>6. In Para. 19 the report referred to the Child Act 2008 while it is the Child Act 2010 
which is applicable now. 
</p>
<p>7. The report in different Paragraphs mentioned impediments and restrictions to 
humanitarian access which, the government considered as inaccurate because regulating the 
work and ensuring the sovereignty of the state can never be considered as restriction. 
</p>
<p>8. Para 36 stresses the concern of IDP leaders whom he met with regard to the 
humanitarian situation in the camp which they deem deteriorated significantly since the 
expulsion of NGOs in 2009. The government also considered it in-accurate because the 
information and documents handed to the SR during his visit shows clearly that, providing 
humanitarian service continues as usual with the help of national NGOs and other 
international actors.  
</p>
<p>9. Para 38 refers to one of our major problems that is &quot;part of the family would remain 
in the IDPs camp in order to maintain their registration and access to services&quot; we expected 
the report to make specific recommendations in relation to this. 
</p>
<p>10. Para 39 is very controversial, it did not take into consideration all the developments 
in the area of speeding the process of the investigations and ignored the role of different 
actors including, the Ministry of Justice through the issuance of circulars, establishment of 
Darfur Prosecutor Office and others. Also efforts by the Ministry of Interior and the order 
of the Minister to facilitate lifting the immunity to insure accountability for any wrongful 
action or inaction, in addition to that the existence of the female police in Darfur. 
</p>
<p>11. Para 43 make reference to the promotion of an inter-Darfurian dialogue, the 
conference took place in February in the presence of different international, regional and 
national actors. We expected that to be reflected in the report as one of the major 
achievements. 
</p>
<p>12. Para 47 refers to availability of services e.g. education at reasonable distance. In this 
regard we emphasize the existence of mobile schools that move with nomads.   
</p>
<p>13. In Para 48 the report is drawing the conclusion that the absence of NGOs in areas of 
return, and the lack of capacity of local government impacted negatively ensuring sustained 
social services, although there are many national NGOs working there and prove to be 
professional in handling and providing humanitarian and other services. 
</p>
<p>14. In Part (B) of the report entitled &quot;Persons of South Sudanese Origin&quot; the three 
paragraphs under this title, that is 54 &#8211; 55 did not reflect the positive efforts of Sudan and 
also did not establish clearly the responsibility and obligation of South Sudan towards its 
own citizens. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Comments on the recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Government would like to commend the useful recommendation of the SR, but 
our expectation is that the recommendations in relation to the issue of IDPs should go to the 
following stakeholders: </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/44/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Government of Sudan  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Other parties to the conflict 
</p>
<p>&#8226; International Community  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Government of South Sudan 
</p>
<p>&#8226; IDPs Community 
</p>
<p> The report limits itself to the first three stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>16. The recommendations in relation to &quot;prevention and mitigation&quot; and &quot;information 
collection and dissemination&quot; we are requesting the SR if he could share with the 
government any successful experience, that Sudan can benefit from. 
</p>
<p>17. The recommendation in relation to ensuring all necessary safeguards against 
possible statelessness should stress the obligation of the government of South Sudan to 
resolve this issue immediately. 
</p>
<p>18. The Government of Sudan expected more and strong recommendations to the other 
parties to the conflict, including but not limited to : 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Stop the conflict immediately and join the peace process. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Stop targeting civilians including IDPs. 
</p>
<p>19. Also the recommendations to the international community should include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Stop any logistical support to the parties to the conflict and encourage them to join 
the peace process. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Delivering humanitarian assistance should not be a pre-condition to providing 
assistance or enough funding. 
</p>
<p><b> III.  General observations 
</b></p>
<p>20. The report focuses mainly on the characterization of the internal political instability 
as the main cause for the displacement while ignoring other key factors. The overall 
economic deficit in Sudan is mainly attributed to the augmenting burden of debts and the 
unjust economic policies of international financing institutions, further increased by the 
unilateral and multilateral unjustified sanctions imposed on Sudan by some powerful states 
for mere political indifferences. 
</p>
<p>21. The report, when talking about the IDPs in Darfur, South Kordofan and the Blue 
Nile, turned a blind eye to the deliberate policy used by the rebels in these areas in 
displacing civilians as a method of warfare. The employment of such abhorrent method is 
intended, in the first place, to create humanitarian crises so as to attract the attention of the 
international community to the political issue. This inhumane practice is substantiated by 
the fact that those tribal leaders who call for voluntary return of the IDPs have been 
targeted and executed by the rebels.   
</p>
<p>22. The intransigence of the rebels to reach peaceful solutions, despite the existence of 
multiple platforms for negotiations, and its continued fragmentation, exacerbated the 
humanitarian toll of the IDPs and instead of finding a solution to their protracted suffering, 
the IDPs themselves became key elements in the conflict. The IDPs camps have turned to 
platforms wherefrom political and sometimes military activities are carried out by pro-rebel 
elements.       </p>

</p>
<p><b> IV.  Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>23. The Government of Sudan would like to assure the SR that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The IDPs rights are one of its major concern and priorities. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Durable solution is our ultimate objective. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ending the conflict and enhancing the security is a strategic goal that we intend to 
achieve soon.
