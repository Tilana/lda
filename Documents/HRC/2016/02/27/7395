<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In her first annual report submitted to the Human Rights Council in accordance with 
</p>
<p>resolution 22/9, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food explores the obstacles faced by 
</p>
<p>those wishing to seek remedy for violations related to the right to food by analysing the 
</p>
<p>current international legal framework, and identifying examples of good practice as a 
</p>
<p>means of encouraging States to develop judicial remedies in accordance with the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The report 
</p>
<p>will also examine the question of extraterritorial implementation in relation to the 
justiciability of the right to food. This report will build on the work of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessors in this area.1 
</p>
<p><b> II. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overview 
</b></p>
<p>2. The right to food was first recognized in article 25 of the Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights. Since then it has been recognized in a number of international instruments, 
</p>
<p>with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (hereinafter &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>Covenant&#8221;) representing the most significant treaty on the right to food. The Covenant (to 
</p>
<p>date ratified by 162 States) has been vital in shaping and developing the normative 
</p>
<p>framework on the right to food. The treaty defines the right to food as a distinct and 
</p>
<p>fundamental right to be free from hunger and to have sustainable access to food (art. 11). It 
</p>
<p>outlines specific obligations for all States parties to take measures to progressively attain 
</p>
<p>the full realization of the right to food.  
</p>
<p>3. In the wake of the momentum generated by the 1996 World Food Summit,2 which 
</p>
<p>highlighted the need to further &#8220;clarify the content of the right to adequate food and the 
</p>
<p>fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger&#8221;,3 the Committee on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights in 1999 adopted general comment No. 12 on the right to 
</p>
<p>adequate food (hereinafter, &#8220;general comment No. 12&#8221;) which clarifies the implications of 
</p>
<p>three levels of State obligation, including the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil (paras. 
</p>
<p>14 and 15).  
</p>
<p>4. In addition to legally binding treaties, the right to food has also been enunciated in 
</p>
<p>various international standards, the most significant of which are the Voluntary Guidelines 
</p>
<p>to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of 
</p>
<p>National Food Security (Right to Food Guidelines). The Right to Food Guidelines were 
</p>
<p>developed as a practical tool for States to assist them in implementing their obligations at 
</p>
<p>the domestic level under article 11 of the Covenant. The year 2014 marked the tenth 
</p>
<p>anniversary of the guidelines and provided an opportunity to evaluate the impact thereof on 
</p>
<p>national implementation. The present report will highlight some examples of good practice 
</p>
<p>in that regard. 
</p>
<p>5. While some critics suggest that the voluntary nature of the Right to Food Guidelines 
</p>
<p>limits their usefulness, they were adopted by member States of the Food and Agriculture 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See references in the reports of the former Special Rapporteurs, Jean Ziegler (E/CN.4/2002/58) and 
</p>
<p>Olivier De Schutter (A/68/288). 
</p>
<p> 2 See Rome Declaration on World Food Security. 
</p>
<p> 3 1996 World Food Summit Plan of Action, objective 7.4. </p>


<p>Organization (FAO) by consensus. States cannot therefore claim to be unaware of or refuse 
</p>
<p>to comply with the guidelines. Over the years, in many formal settings, the Governments 
</p>
<p>have reiterated their commitment to and support for the guidelines. 
</p>
<p><b> B. A new era: adoption of the Optional Protocol and access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>6. The interdependence and indivisibility of economic, social and cultural rights and 
</p>
<p>civil and political rights have long been asserted within international law, yet in practice 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights have typically been relegated to second place within 
</p>
<p>the international framework, with civil and political rights taking centre stage, particularly 
</p>
<p>when it comes to implementation. While the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights includes an explicit provision requiring States &#8220;to develop the possibilities of 
</p>
<p>judicial remedy&#8221; (art. 2, para. 3 (b)), no such specific provision is explicitly mentioned in 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It should be noted, 
</p>
<p>however, that the Committee has clarified that the obligation under article 2, paragraph 1, 
</p>
<p>of the Covenant to &#8220;take steps &#8230; by all appropriate means&#8221; includes the provision of 
</p>
<p>judicial remedies.4 
</p>
<p>7. The reluctance of a number of States to recognize that economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights are justiciable has done much to propagate unfounded misconceptions thereon. Those 
</p>
<p>countries opposed to the justiciability of those rights argue that such a notion may interfere 
</p>
<p>with State sovereignty5 claiming that it is inappropriate for courts to adjudicate on social 
</p>
<p>and economic policy. There is also a perception that social and economic rights set forth 
</p>
<p>political objectives and are too vague to be enforceable.6 The suggestion that these rights 
</p>
<p>are resource-dependent and cannot be satisfied where there is a lack of capital, and the idea 
</p>
<p>that these rights only impose positive obligations on States and civil and political rights 
</p>
<p>give rise to negative ones, has also led to resistance from some States.  
</p>
<p>8. The justiciability debate continues to provoke controversy at the international level. 
</p>
<p>However despite strong opposition from a number of States an Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Covenant, establishing an individual complaints procedure, was finally adopted in 2008. Its 
</p>
<p>subsequent entry into force in May 2013 was hailed as &#8220;potentially one of the most 
</p>
<p>important developments in human rights protection at the UN level in a generation&#8221;.7  
</p>
<p>9. The Optional Protocol is intended to complement rather than replace national legal 
</p>
<p>systems and should not be considered as the principal means of seeking justice. The 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol grants individuals, or groups of individuals under the jurisdiction of a 
</p>
<p>State party, the right to submit communications about alleged violations of any economic, 
</p>
<p>social or cultural right to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (art. 2).8  
</p>
<p>10. Article 2 of the Optional Protocol requires that authors of communications must be 
</p>
<p>under the jurisdiction of the State party responsible for the violation, and that the State must 
</p>
<p>have ratified both the Covenant and the Optional Protocol. However, the Covenant 
</p>
<p>indicates no restriction to territorial jurisdiction and it will remain to be seen whether the

</p>
<p> 8 The development of a communication process encompassing all economic, social and cultural rights 
</p>
<p>represents an innovative approach to ensuring remedy for victims of violations. </p>


<p>cases to be examined under the Optional Protocol concentrate principally on the territorial 
</p>
<p>link.9 
</p>
<p>11. Victims of violations now have a means of making effective appeals through an 
</p>
<p>international mechanism, once they have exhausted the grievance mechanisms within their 
</p>
<p>own countries, or if there is an excessive delay in processing their claims through national 
</p>
<p>procedures. The Optional Protocol also provides for interim measures for victims in 
</p>
<p>exceptional circumstances in order to prevent irreparable damage to victims (art. 5).  
</p>
<p>12. The Optional Protocol also permits States to declare that they recognize the 
</p>
<p>competence of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to review inter-
</p>
<p>State communications in cases where one State party considers that another State party has 
</p>
<p>failed to fulfil its obligations under the Covenant. The Committee may also have recourse 
</p>
<p>to an inquiry procedure whereby it would consider allegations from reliable sources 
</p>
<p>indicating grave or systematic violations by a State party of any of the rights set forth in the 
</p>
<p>Covenant.10 While the Covenant does not have a mechanism to enforce decisions, findings 
</p>
<p>and decisions by the Committee can increase awareness and scrutiny of specific violations 
</p>
<p>at the international level. An international peer review mechanism such as the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review could be employed as a means of highlighting the failure of States to 
</p>
<p>implement decisions under the Covenant.11  
</p>
<p>13. As outlined above, the right to food was once considered a controversial &#8220;positive&#8221; 
</p>
<p>right, however recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in terms of the global discourse 
</p>
<p>on the right to food, with progress in jurisprudence and academic deliberations affirming 
</p>
<p>that the right to food is justiciable.12 With the ratification of the Covenant, the right to food 
</p>
<p>will have greater publicity, especially when NGOs and individuals start to use various 
</p>
<p>remedies. The right to food is now a right than can be legitimately claimed. Complaint 
</p>
<p>procedures remind governments of their responsibility to respect, protect and fulfil the right 
</p>
<p>to adequate food. The Optional Protocol will be influential in ensuring the implementation 
</p>
<p>of the right to food at the international and national level.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Recent framework laws, jurisprudence and the justiciability 
of the right to food  
</b></p>
<p>14. The Right to Food Guidelines have done much to raise awareness and increase 
</p>
<p>recognition of the right to adequate food and nutrition as a human right. They have also 
</p>
<p>been instrumental in promoting the importance of recognizing the right to food in national 
</p>
<p>legal frameworks. Guideline 7, in particular, invites States to initiate constitutional or 
</p>
<p>legislative review to facilitate the progressive realization of the right to adequate food in the 
</p>
<p>context of national food security. States are also advised to envisage &#8220;administrative, quasi-
</p>
<p>judicial and judicial mechanisms to provide adequate, effective and prompt remedies 
</p>
<p>accessible, in particular, to members of vulnerable groups&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>15. Constitutional provisions and framework laws can be effective means of promoting 
</p>
<p>the progressive realization of the right to food at the domestic level. The adoption of

<p>sectoral legislation will ensure that States adequately address various sectors that impact 
</p>
<p>significantly on various dimensions of food security.  
</p>
<p>16. Over the last few years, there has been an important increase in the number of States 
</p>
<p>that have adopted provisions containing explicit recognition of the right to food or freedom 
</p>
<p>from hunger.13 The following section will provide an overview of some recent examples of 
</p>
<p>case law in relation to the justiciability of the right to food at the domestic and regional 
</p>
<p>level. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Latin America 
</b></p>
<p>17. Latin America has shown itself to be the region of the world that has made the most 
</p>
<p>progress in terms of developing legal frameworks that promote the right to food. With more 
</p>
<p>than eight countries possessing specific laws aimed at promoting and protecting the right to 
</p>
<p>food and a number of bills pending in National Assemblies for consideration,14 the right to 
</p>
<p>adequate food is also referred to or explicitly recognized in several constitutions, including 
</p>
<p>those of Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Nicaragua and Paraguay.15 In 
</p>
<p>some cases, the constitutional provisions refer directly to the right to food, and its 
</p>
<p>applicability to the whole population.16 In other cases, the right is directed at specific 
</p>
<p>groups,17 while State signatories of the Covenant provide that it be applied directly through 
</p>
<p>the constitution. The following cases are examples of where the right to food has been used 
</p>
<p>as a legal argument to protect social rights. 
</p>
<p>18. In a 2013 decision,18 the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of 
</p>
<p>El Salvador admitted a habeas corpus writ petition against the penitentiary administration in 
</p>
<p>relation to a claimant in detention suffering from diabetes and hypertension. The applicant 
</p>
<p>argued that the failure to provide him with adequate food and an appropriate diet violated 
</p>
<p>his right to health and physical integrity. While the detainee&#8217;s petition was rejected on the 
</p>
<p>grounds that medical evidence did not support the claim, the case demonstrates the 
</p>
<p>willingness of the court to consider the protection of economic, Social and cultural rights 
</p>
<p>under habeas corpus procedures. The judgment handed down in this case is significant on 
</p>
<p>two counts: firstly, it demonstrates that all human rights are interconnected and indivisible; 
</p>
<p>and, secondly, even though medical evidence was insufficient, the court makes the 
</p>
<p>connection between those suffering from diabetes and their need for adequate and healthy 
</p>
<p>food, which creates an important precedent for future cases.  
</p>
<p>19. Judicial protection of land as a source of livelihood can be seen in judgments by the 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Court of Colombia. One such significant case involves the community of 
</p>
<p>Las Pavas, whose members occupied unused land in 1997 and began farming activities to 
</p>
<p>feed themselves. Over the years, the community had been repeatedly subjected to various 
</p>
<p>forms of intimidation and harassment, including attacks by paramilitary groups and the 
</p>
<p>destruction of crops and food. A formal eviction order was issued in 2009 at the request of

<p>two private companies, who claimed ownership of the land. In 2011, the Colombian 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Court delivered its judgment, finding that the actions leading to the eviction 
</p>
<p>of the families of Las Pavas were unlawful and violated the right to a dignified existence, 
</p>
<p>among other rights.19 
</p>
<p>20. In 2013, a coalition of NGOs <i>Guatemala sin Hambre</i> engaged in strategic litigation 
</p>
<p>to claim the right to food of children suffering from chronic malnutrition and living in 
</p>
<p>conditions of extreme poverty. The judgements were delivered in April 2013 by the Child 
</p>
<p>and Adolescence Court of the Zacapa Department which, based on the facts, found 
</p>
<p>violations of the right to food, the right to life, the right to housing and the right to an 
</p>
<p>adequate standard of living. Specifically with regard to the right to food, the court grounded 
</p>
<p>its reasoning on article 51 of the Constitution, which protects the right to food for children, 
</p>
<p>as well as on article 11 of the Covenant and article 25 of the Universal Declaration. To 
</p>
<p>define the right to food and the obligations that stem from it, the court cited general 
</p>
<p>comment No. 12.20 
</p>
<p><b> B. Asia 
</b></p>
<p>21. The constitutional jurisprudence of India provides for the justiciability of economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights based on &#8220;the right to life&#8221;. This constitutional right was central to 
</p>
<p>the case of People&#8217;s Union for Civil Liberties (&#8220;PUCL&#8221;) v. <i>Union of India</i>. In mid-2001, 
</p>
<p>public food and employment programmes failed to provide food to deprived people in the 
</p>
<p>impoverished and drought-stricken State of Rajasthan. The Supreme Court of India was 
</p>
<p>petitioned by PUCL to compel the Government to respond to the hunger emergency. In 
</p>
<p>response to the submissions, the Supreme Court held that the right to food was enshrined in 
</p>
<p>the Constitution under the right to life provision in article 47, which requires that the State 
</p>
<p>undertake measures to improve the nutritional state of the population. The Court handed 
</p>
<p>down a series of resolutions which commenced in 2001 requiring State governments in 
</p>
<p>India to implement food distribution programmes for the most disadvantaged. The Court&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>resolution had a considerable impact on the realization of the right to food in India,21 and 
</p>
<p>provides an example of the influential role played by the judiciary in encouraging a 
</p>
<p>legislative body to develop human rights legislation.  
</p>
<p>22. India has led the way, not only at the regional level, but also globally, in terms of 
</p>
<p>developing jurisprudence on economic, social and cultural rights. Its Constitution provides 
</p>
<p>a strong legal framework for the protection and promotion of human rights, with article 47 
</p>
<p>noting that &#8220;States shall regard the raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living 
</p>
<p>of its people and the improvement of public health as among its primary duties&#8221;. It has also 
</p>
<p>recently joined a select group of countries that are legally obliged to ensure the distribution 
</p>
<p>of subsidized food grains to its people. With the historic passing of its National Food 
</p>
<p>Security Act in September 2013, India has pledged to provide heavily subsidized food 
</p>
<p>grains to approximately two thirds of its population.22 The National Food Security Act will 
</p>
<p>amount to the largest food security programme in the world, and aims to reduce 
</p>
<p>malnutrition and improve food security. It also promotes gender-based rights and social 
</p>
<p>inclusion of women, and includes provision for social monitoring and complaint 
</p>

<p>mechanisms. While the Act has received criticism, particularly owing to its failure to 
</p>
<p>address the nutritional aspect, and for placing too much emphasis on public distribution23 
</p>
<p>without tackling the root causes of poverty and hunger, the Special Rapporteur commends 
</p>
<p>Indian efforts to address chronic malnutrition, and encourages India to work with relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders to tackle any potential gaps that may prevent this innovative approach from

<p><i>Rights Group International on behalf of Endorois Welfare Council</i> v. <i>Kenya</i>, the Endorois, 
</p>
<p>a primarily pastoralist indigenous community, were removed from their lands by the 
</p>
<p>Government of Kenya to establish a wildlife reserve. The African Commission found 
</p>
<p>Kenya to have violated articles 8, 14, 17, 21 and 22 of the African Charter. The 
</p>
<p>Commission noted that, as a consequence of its removal, the community had been 
</p>
<p>&#8220;relegated to semi-arid land&#8221;, which was unsuitable for pastoralism. The ability to graze 
</p>
<p>animals, a key means of subsistence for the community, had become impossible as a result 
</p>
<p>of loss of their land and this threatened the community&#8217;s survival.24  
</p>
<p>24. In its case <i>SERAC</i> v. <i>Nigeria</i>, the African Commission held that the treatment by 
</p>
<p>Nigeria of the Ogoni indigenous community violated the right to food implied in the 
</p>
<p>African Charter. In their statement to the African Commission, the NGOs submitting the 
</p>
<p>claim contended that: &#8220;the Nigerian government ... destroyed and threatened Ogoni food 
</p>
<p>sources through a variety of means. The government ... participated in irresponsible oil 
</p>
<p>development that poisoned much of the soil and water upon which Ogoni farming and 
</p>
<p>fishing depended. In their raids on villages, Nigerian security forces have destroyed crops 
</p>
<p>and killed farm animals. The security forces have created a state of terror and insecurity 
</p>
<p>that ... made it impossible for many Ogoni villagers to return to their fields and animals. 
</p>
<p>The destruction of farm lands, rivers, crops and animals created malnutrition and starvation 
</p>
<p>among certain Ogoni communities.&#8221;25 
</p>
<p><b> D. Europe 
</b></p>
<p>25. While on the whole European countries have been more reluctant to accept the 
</p>
<p>justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights, there have been some significant cases. 
</p>
<p>For example, in the 2012 German Federal Constitutional Court judgment 1 BvL 10/10, the 
</p>
<p>court ruled on whether cash benefits for asylum seekers provided by the Asylum Seekers 
</p>
<p>Benefit Act were compatible with its Constitution. The court relied on earlier decisions to 
</p>
<p>reiterate that the State is under an obligation to ensure a &#8220;dignified minimum existence&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>defined as a &#8220;comprehensive fundamental rights guarantee&#8221; which includes access to food, 
</p>
<p>clothing, household items, housing, heating, hygiene health and social assistance to persons 
</p>
<p>in need. The benefits awarded to the asylum seekers under the law in question were deemed 
</p>
<p>insufficient to guarantee a dignified minimum existence. The court also reaffirmed that 
</p>
<p>benefits must be calculated on the basis of &#8220;real and actual needs&#8221; and thus be measured 
</p>
<p>realistically. The court noted that the benefits prescribed under the Asylum Seekers Benefit 
</p>
<p>Act had not increased since 1993, even though the cost of living in Germany had risen by 
</p>

</p>

<p>30 per cent in that period. As a result, a number of provisions of the act were declared 
</p>
<p>unconstitutional. The court ordered the enactment of new legislation that would ensure a 
</p>
<p>dignified minimum standard of living and introduced a transitional scheme that would 
</p>
<p>provide higher cash benefits in the interim.26 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Obstacles to justiciability and the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>26. While there has been considerable legislative and judicial progress in many 
</p>
<p>countries throughout the world since the adoption of the Right to Food Guidelines (see 
</p>
<p>A/68/288), examples of cases whereby national courts have actually issued rulings on the 
</p>
<p>regulations relating to the right to food are scarce.27 The only way that the full realization of 
</p>
<p>the right to adequate food and nutrition can be achieved is by ensuring that the rights of 
</p>
<p>victims are protected. Restrictions on justiciability must therefore be prevented. This 
</p>
<p>section will seek to highlight some of the obstacles that continue to hamper progress in this 
</p>
<p>regard. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Resistance from some States and lack of political will 
</b></p>
<p>27. A rights-based approach to food security is paramount to ensure that the 
</p>
<p>fundamental right to be free from hunger is upheld, with States obliged to do everything in 
</p>
<p>their power to guarantee that everyone has access at all times to adequate, safe and nutrient-
</p>
<p>rich food in order to lead healthy lives. Yet, despite the fact that the right to food has been 
</p>
<p>enshrined in international law, many States remain reluctant to recognize it and to 
</p>
<p>constitutionalize it as a basic right with justiciable effect.28  
</p>
<p>28. While the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Covenant represented a 
</p>
<p>significant step in terms of ensuring justice for the victims of violations of economic, social 
</p>
<p>and cultural rights, to date only 15 States are currently party thereto, in comparison with 
</p>
<p>115 parties to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights.29 This in itself is representative of the fact that many States have failed to develop a 
</p>
<p>judicial culture of recognition in practice, or the necessary legal frameworks required to 
</p>
<p>ensure that the rights enshrined in the Covenant, including the right to food, are justiciable. 
</p>
<p>In some countries, it is the case that international human rights conventions are not 
</p>
<p>considered as formal sources of law and, even where they may be incorporated into national 
</p>
<p>law, these rights may not provide criminal punishment or financial compensations, but 
</p>
<p>rather expresses a moral conviction without legal force.30 In some States, even when 
</p>
<p>justiciable rights are enshrined in the Constitution, there is a reluctance to acknowledge 
</p>
<p>their relevance. There is also certain reluctance at the regional level, with many European 
</p>
<p>States failing to recognize the direct applicability of the Covenant in domestic law.31 In 
</p>
<p>Africa, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights provides no option for 
</p>
<p>complaints relating to the violation of the right to food.  
</p>
<p>29. Accountability at international, regional and national levels is paramount to ensuring 
</p>
<p>that the right to food and its correlative obligations are being implemented. At the domestic 
</p>
<p>level, it is imperative that constitutional principles and framework laws are established as a 
</p>

<p>means of providing an appropriate institutional structure to ensure the progressive 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to food. In some cases, however, even where States have taken the 
</p>
<p>necessary steps to develop framework laws and policies in order to promote the right to 
</p>
<p>food, a lack of political will has prevented implementation and enforcement of these laws.32  
</p>
<p><b> B. Lack of awareness and obstacles for rights holders 
</b></p>
<p>30. A lack of awareness of legal rights and entitlements, as well as the State&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>obligations and duties to protect these rights, is a major barrier to achieving the enjoyment 
</p>
<p>of the full range of rights, including economic, social and cultural rights. General 
</p>
<p>knowledge and understanding of judicial and adjudicatory mechanisms as a means of 
</p>
<p>enforcing basic rights is severely lacking in many countries.  
</p>
<p>31. Access to public information in relation to the adoption of new laws or amendments 
</p>
<p>to existing legislation is crucial for ensuring justiciability. States are obliged to ensure that 
</p>
<p>this information is made readily available and easily accessible for everyone without 
</p>
<p>discrimination. Particular effort should be made to disseminate information in a format that 
</p>
<p>is user-appropriate, taking into consideration the individual needs of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, and those with low levels of literacy. Migrants and minority groups should not 
</p>
<p>be prevented from accessing information owing to linguistic barriers, and materials should 
</p>
<p>be adapted accordingly. Logistical and financial barriers should also be addressed by taking 
</p>
<p>into consideration the difficulties faced by those living in remote rural areas and those 
</p>
<p>living in poverty.  
</p>
<p>32. Awareness of the right to food and the obligations pertaining thereto need to be 
</p>
<p>heightened amongst rights holders. It is essential that lawyers receive training to enable 
</p>
<p>them to argue effectively for the upholding of the right to adequate food and judges need to 
</p>
<p>acquire the knowledge to grasp and accept such arguments as appropriate. Effective access 
</p>
<p>to legal institutions facilitates the inclusion of marginalized people in the development 
</p>
<p>process, and provides citizens with a means to file actionable grievances against the 
</p>
<p>government for the failure to progressively meet economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>33. Women, in particular, face significant barriers to accessing justice given their 
</p>
<p>subordinate position in many societies, and the lack of information and knowledge about 
</p>
<p>their rights and the ways to claim their protection. Indeed, women in rural areas often are 
</p>
<p>unaware of their legal rights. In many rural areas, sociocultural norms make women fearful 
</p>
<p>of retribution or ostracism if they pursue land claims or seek protection from violence. As a 
</p>
<p>result, women tend to be denied access to justice more often than men, and are also more 
</p>
<p>likely to be denied justice altogether.33  
</p>
<p><b> C. Institutional and structural barriers 
</b></p>
<p>34. In addition to a lack of awareness of their rights, victims of violations face 
</p>
<p>considerable institutional and structural barriers. For many, particularly for those living in 
</p>
<p>rural and remote areas and peri-urban settings, simply accessing a court is in itself a 
</p>
<p>significant challenge. In many countries, municipal courts do not exist and the legal 
</p>
<p>epicentre is located in the capital only, with logistical and monetary implications for those 
</p>
<p>who live beyond the city. In countries where municipal and subnational mechanisms are

<p>Women and Access to Justice&#8221; (2013), p. 5. </p>


<p>available, a lack of affordable and dedicated legal assistance and judicial corruption often 
</p>
<p>hinders access. In cases where rights holders have the means to submit a case, often 
</p>
<p>ordinary courts, which are more accessible for families facing food security,34 are unaware 
</p>
<p>of the issue &#8212; with the right to food not considered as related to other citizen&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>Complex and inflexible court systems also have a significant impact on victims, often 
</p>
<p>requiring a high burden of proof for applicants. Some courts may also be averse to 
</p>
<p>accepting collective, or public interest mechanisms or innovative fact-gathering or remedial 
</p>
<p>procedures. In such cases, victims are dissuaded from submitting claims. Some countries, 
</p>
<p>however, have tackled the problem by establishing public interest litigation procedures that 
</p>
<p>authorize individual and collective claims.35 
</p>
<p>35. The role played by judges also has a significant impact on the judicial interpretation 
</p>
<p>of economic, social and cultural rights. In many countries, it is often the case that judges 
</p>
<p>based outside of urban area have little knowledge of human rights law, and are therefore 
</p>
<p>less inclined to consider international standards when making a judgement. The reliance of 
</p>
<p>the judiciary on the State for its legitimacy and the appointment of judges also has 
</p>
<p>considerable influence over the decision-making process, with historical relations between 
</p>
<p>the State and the judiciary often coming into play. 
</p>
<p>36. Ensuring justiciability of the right to food is also hindered by the fact that individual 
</p>
<p>cases often end up stagnating within the court system amidst protracted, costly and 
</p>
<p>bureaucratic proceedings, while in some instances collective cases influenced by politically 
</p>
<p>motivated activities take precedence and serve as sensationalist media fodder. As a result, 
</p>
<p>many cases have been neglected with no follow-up.  
</p>
<p>37. Quasi-judicial bodies, such as ombudspersons, have the potential to consider cases 
</p>
<p>of human rights violations. However, more often than not, they tend to focus solely on civil 
</p>
<p>and political rights, with few having taken the necessary steps to introduce complaint 
</p>
<p>mechanisms for economic, social and cultural rights. A general lack of awareness by 
</p>
<p>affected populations that such a mechanism for filing a grievance exists has also done little 
</p>
<p>to encourage applications. However there are some examples of progress in this regard, 
</p>
<p>such as the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office in Ecuador that took the initiative and established a unit 
</p>
<p>for economic, social and cultural rights, while the <i>Procuradoria</i> for Human Rights in 
</p>
<p>Guatemala has been submitting reports on the right to food since 2007, in line with its Food 
</p>
<p>and Nutrition Security Law of 2005.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Extraterritorial obligations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Economic globalization and right to food 
</b></p>
<p>38. The universality of human rights has been the underlying inspiration for all human 
</p>
<p>rights law and standards. While much emphasis has been placed on achieving the universal 
</p>
<p>acceptance of the content of rights, less attention has been given to attaining universality as 
</p>
<p>to the content of obligations.36 Economic globalization and the increasing involvement of 
</p>
<p>corporate entities in State affairs have challenged the traditional understanding of 
</p>
<p>territoriality of human rights. The powerful influence of transnational corporations

<p>(TNCs)37 and international financial institutions (IFIs) has led to a marked change in the 
</p>
<p>way in which the principles of territoriality intersect with international human rights 
</p>
<p>standards. 
</p>
<p>39. Within the food and agriculture sector, approximately ten corporations control and 
</p>
<p>monopolize the commercial seed and global pesticide markets, as well as food retailers.38 In 
</p>
<p>addition to their financial power, TNCs significantly influence law and policymaking 
</p>
<p>processes both at the international and national level.39 Similarly, IFIs exercise considerable 
</p>
<p>influence over national decision-making in relation to food and agricultural policies. Many 
</p>
<p>developing countries are compelled to implement projects that jeopardize economic, social, 
</p>
<p>and cultural rights in return for economic and financial aid. In recent decades, there have 
</p>
<p>been significant efforts to alter the policy approach undertaken by IFIs, especially the 
</p>
<p>World Bank, in relation to supporting development projects that have a harmful effect on 
</p>
<p>human rights and the environment. Moreover<b>, </b>bilateral, and regional foreign trade 
</p>
<p>agreements have facilitated the privatization, deregulation and growth of extractive 
</p>
<p>industries around the globe, a development that has had significant impacts on food security 
</p>
<p>and health. Globalization has highlighted and exacerbated socioeconomic disparities 
</p>
<p>throughout the world, with the result that global social inequality is not only expressed in 
</p>
<p>terms of inter-State justice, but as implicating human rights obligations as well.40 States are 
</p>
<p>often placed in a precarious situation as a result of dubious corporate activities. Developing 
</p>
<p>countries are particularly vulnerable, as in an attempt to attract foreign investors they accept 
</p>
<p>trade rules that adversely impact agricultural policies and follow growth-oriented economic 
</p>
<p>policies to achieve short-term political and budgetary benefits.  
</p>
<p>40. Development-induced displacement is an increasingly widespread phenomenon with 
</p>
<p>devastating impact. An estimated 15 million people each year are forced to relocate and 
</p>
<p>resettle as a result of such interventions.41 Despite some of the more recent efforts to 
</p>
<p>highlight land dispossession, as yet global institutions have been unable to discourage the 
</p>
<p>practices and processes that undermine land rights, prevent equitable access and establish 
</p>
<p>the context for large and small-scale displacements.42 The expanding mining sector has 
</p>
<p>contributed to strong economic growth in some countries, with mining and oil concessions 
</p>
<p>dramatically increasing in countries. The industry has however also generated social 
</p>
<p>conflict in many States, particularly in rural areas, with mining activities coming into direct 
</p>
<p>competition with small-scale agriculture. Indigenous peoples are particularly vulnerable as 
</p>
<p>they are often forced to leave their land and sources of livelihood. A lack of engagement

</p>
<p><b> B. Extraterritorial obligations of States  
</b></p>
<p>41. In recent years the scope of a State&#8217;s human rights obligations has progressively 
</p>
<p>evolved to include duties to exercise jurisdiction over activities that are connected to one 
</p>
<p>State but have an impact in another. In principle, corporations can also be held accountable 
</p>
<p>either by States responsible for regulating, monitoring and preventing human rights 
</p>
<p>violations; or through intergovernmental instruments or voluntary codes of conduct.  
</p>
<p>42. Although international human rights law presupposes the consent of a State to 
</p>
<p>establish an obligation, the evolution of human rights has included the extension of duties 
</p>
<p>under international law directly to non-State actors, including individuals and business 
</p>
<p>enterprises.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Obligation to respect  
</b></p>
<p>43. States should ensure that their policies and practices do not lead to violations of the 
</p>
<p>right to food, either directly or indirectly, for people living in other countries, as well as 
</p>
<p>their own citizens. This obligation is simply the extension of the &#8220;no harm&#8221; principle of 
</p>
<p>States in international law. The extraterritorial obligations of States in relation to the right 
</p>
<p>to food are referred to in general comment No. 12 which notes that &#8220;food should never be 
</p>
<p>used as an instrument of political and economic pressure&#8221;. States should therefore refrain 
</p>
<p>from implementing food embargoes or similar measures that endanger conditions for food 
</p>
<p>production and water supply, and access to goods and services essential for securing the 
</p>
<p>right to food.43 Similarly IFIs should also refrain from taking decisions<b> </b>that could lead to 
</p>
<p>potential violations of the right to food in other countries. As multi-State actors, IFIs should 
</p>
<p>be held accountable for human rights violations by other member States that have ratified 
</p>
<p>the Covenant.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Obligation to protect 
</b></p>
<p>44. The majority of extraterritorial cases derive from the host States failure to fulfil its 
</p>
<p>obligation to protect where private companies are impacting upon human rights. While 
</p>
<p>home States of companies operating abroad have an obligation to clearly set out the 
</p>
<p>expectation that such companies respect human rights throughout their operations, it is the 
</p>
<p>host States which have the primary responsibility to prevent human rights violations, 
</p>
<p>including by TNCs operating within its jurisdiction. However, agreements between TNCs 
</p>
<p>and host governments often limit the host State&#8217;s ability to perform these duties. Indeed 
</p>
<p>some States have even taken retrogressive steps in this regard. A recent study44 indicates 
</p>
<p>that some jurisdictions have formulated laws that effectively shield business from being 
</p>
<p>held accountable for human rights violation and make it difficult for victims to obtain an 
</p>
<p>effective remedy. In some instances, States themselves may have been complicit in 
</p>
<p>perpetrating violations. In many cases, however, TNCs also impact positively on a

<p>country&#8217;s development, the political relevance of which can significantly influence the 
</p>
<p>judicial process.45 
</p>
<p>45. Implementing national legislation is essential to ensuring that States hold TNCs 
</p>
<p>accountable abroad. Indeed, member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-
</p>
<p>operation and Development (OECD) have already made voluntary commitments in this 
</p>
<p>regard by developing a code of conduct. The European Union has also developed a 
</p>
<p>resolution for European corporations operating in developing countries. Under international 
</p>
<p>law, however, States are generally not liable for the conduct of non-State actors, unless the 
</p>
<p>non-State actors are de facto agents of the State, or were acting &#8220;on the instructions of, or 
</p>
<p>under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the [wrongful] conduct&#8221;.46 To 
</p>
<p>date, there is no international jurisprudence on the issue of home State accountability for 
</p>
<p>TNC actions.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>46. Some States have failed to take vigorous steps to ensure that victims have access to 
</p>
<p>judicial remedies for human rights abuses that have arisen extraterritorially owing to the 
</p>
<p>activities of businesses or their subsidiaries. By creating or allowing these obstacles and 
</p>
<p>barriers to remain, States have failed in their duty to protect human rights by ensuring 
</p>
<p>access to effective remedy through the judicial process.47  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Obligation to fulfil 
</b></p>
<p>47. Besides being responsible for the activities of TNCs operating abroad, governments 
</p>
<p>have also a duty to support and cooperate in ensuring the fulfilment of the right to food in 
</p>
<p>poorer countries.48 General comment  No. 12 suggests that developing States that do not 
</p>
<p>possess the necessary resources for the full realization of the right to food are obliged to 
</p>
<p>actively seek international assistance, and wealthier States have a responsibility to help 
</p>
<p>(para. 38). The Right to Food Guidelines request that assistance be provided by States in 
</p>

<p><b> C. Holding transnational corporations accountable 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Interpretative efforts 
</b></p>
<p>48. International obligations with extraterritorial dimensions are enunciated in a number 
</p>
<p>of international treaties49 that emphasize the importance of international cooperation among 
</p>
<p>States to ensure the protection of human rights. At the same time, international human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments refer to how non-State actors have duties to uphold human rights 
</p>
<p>standards. For example, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states in its preamble 
</p>
<p>&#8212; and binding provisions in universal and regional human rights documents also indicate

<p>&#8212; duties for private actors, while the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/17/31), endorsed by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 17/4 in 2011, 
</p>
<p>elaborate on the responsibility of business enterprises to respect human rights. 
</p>
<p>49. Another consideration supporting the necessity of extraterritoriality is the principle 
</p>
<p>of non-discrimination. It is a fundamental part of human rights law, and the logical 
</p>
<p>extension of the universality principle. If States are able to treat individuals in other 
</p>
<p>countries differently from the way they may treat individuals in their own territory, this is 
</p>
<p>discriminatory practice and goes against the principles of universality of rights enjoyment.50  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>50. The application of extraterritorial obligations is supported indirectly by the 
</p>
<p>International Court of Justice, in its advisory opinion on the <i>Legal Consequences of the 
</i></p>
<p><i>Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. </i>The Court observed that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;while the jurisdiction of States is primarily territorial, it may sometimes be exercised 
</p>
<p>outside the national territory&#8221;.51 At the regional level the American Convention on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights extends to persons &#8220;subject to [the] jurisdiction&#8221; of the State party, and the Inter-
</p>
<p>American Commission on Human Rights held that in relation to the American Convention, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;jurisdiction [is] a notion linked to authority and effective control, and not merely to 
</p>
<p>territorial boundaries&#8221;. The European Court of Human Rights has also indicated that &#8220;as an 
</p>
<p>exception to the principle of territoriality, a Contracting State&#8217;s jurisdiction under article 1 
</p>
<p>may extend to acts of its authorities which produce effects outside its own territory&#8221;.52 </p>
<p>51. There are a number of cases involving TNCs and right to food violations at the 
</p>
<p>domestic level; however, in many of these cases, claims are either based on tort or criminal 
</p>
<p>law rather than human rights legislation, or decisions focus on the involvement of the 
</p>
<p>Government in the violation of rights, and not the company. The case against Nigeria 
</p>
<p>submitted through the African Commission on Human Rights is an example thereof.53 
</p>
<p>Another example is the case brought to<b> </b>the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>on behalf of indigenous Guarani people living in the Oriente region in Ecuador<b> </b>against the 
</p>
<p>oil exploitation activities by their own Government and Texaco.54 
</p>
<p>52. There are many relevant domestic court decisions in Brazil, India, Namibia, South 
</p>
<p>Africa and Uganda. Examples can be found also from Australia, Canada and the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in which TNCs were held responsible under 
</p>
<p>tort law for complicity in human rights violations abroad. In the United States of America, 
</p>
<p>under the Alien Tort Claims Act, TNCs can be held accountable for complicity in the 
</p>
<p>violation of human rights outside of the United States. However, in 2013 the United States 
</p>
<p>Supreme Court in <i>Kiobel </i>v. <i>Royal Dutch Petroleum</i> case created a most significant barrier 
</p>
<p>to accessing judicial remedies for human rights violations that occur in a host State.55 
</p>
<p>53. In the European Union, the notion of extraterritorial jurisdiction is not as 
</p>
<p>problematic when businesses are domiciled in the European Union. The situation in 
</p>
<p>Switzerland is similar.56 Barriers exist across all jurisdictions, despite differences in 
</p>
<p>legislation, the approaches of courts, human rights protections at the national level and

<p>legal traditions. These barriers have been overcome in only some instances and, in those 
</p>
<p>cases, usually as a result of innovative approaches adopted by lawyers, the patience of 
</p>
<p>victims and responses by perceptive judges.57 
</p>
<p>54. If TNC activities are criminally justiciable and reasonable compensation is 
</p>
<p>enforceable, the issue of extraterritoriality may not arise. However, in cases of indirect 
</p>
<p>violations of the right to food, for instance by way of voluntary displacement or not being 
</p>
<p>able to farm because of a lack of access to necessary resources such as water because of 
</p>
<p>privatization, or seeds because of a monopoly by TNCs, human rights adjudication 
</p>
<p>becomes vital. Consequently, such remedies should provide enforceable compensation and 
</p>
<p>restitution. The remedies currently available for individuals whose economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights are violated are somewhat limited. Considerable improvements in this regard 
</p>
<p>are essential for cases involving violations of the right to food to be protected from 
</p>
<p>violations committed by foreign and national actors.58 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Private arbitrations and dispute mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>55. In relation to<b> </b>IFIs, private dispute mechanisms have been developed, including the 
</p>
<p>establishment of an ombudsperson for international finance corporations, as have complaint 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, such as the World Bank&#8217;s International Centre for Settlement of Investment 
</p>
<p>Disputes (ICSID) and the contact point procedure under the OECD Guidelines for 
</p>
<p>Multinational Enterprises.59 Under these mechanisms ICSID States and private actors are 
</p>
<p>on an equal footing. The flip side is that corporations are in a position to sue governments.  
</p>
<p>56. Developing countries are increasingly subject to dispute procedures brought by 
</p>
<p>private companies. For example, high water prices and poor water quality following the 
</p>
<p>privatization of the water supply in the Bolivian town of Cochabamba, culminated in 
</p>
<p>protests against Aguas de Tunari, a subsidiary of the United States firm Bechtel.60 The 
</p>
<p>Government succumbed to public pressure and reversed the decision to privatize, which 
</p>
<p>prompted the company to bring the Government before ICSID. The case posed the 
</p>
<p>fundamental question of whether the property rights of the company could trump the rights 
</p>
<p>to food and to access water and sanitation. In the end, civil society pressure led to a 
</p>
<p>settlement and, as a result, Bolivian water laws were amended with the 2009 Constitution 
</p>
<p>guaranteeing the right to access to water.61  
</p>
<p>57. Other examples include a lawsuit brought by the Oceana Gold mining company 
</p>
<p>against El Salvador through ICSID for US$301 million for failure to grant a mining permit. 
</p>
<p>It was alleged that the project posed a risk to the country&#8217;s livelihood. Having failed to 
</p>
<p>change the domestic law to relax regulation, the company initiated arbitration measures to 
</p>
<p>pressure El Salvador into paying for lost exploration costs and future profits.62 These cases 
</p>
<p>demonstrate how intervention is necessary to prevent democratic rights from being 
</p>
<p>undermined by global norms.

<p><b> 4. Permanent peoples</b>&#8217;<b> tribunal  
</b></p>
<p>58. In recent years, the human rights violations perpetrated by private actors, including 
</p>
<p>those committed by TNCs, have been subject to several Permanent Peoples&#8217; Tribunals. Of 
</p>
<p>particular relevance to the right to food are the tribunals on: Agrochemical Transnational 
</p>
<p>Corporations (2001), Neoliberal Policies and European Transnationals in Latin America 
</p>
<p>and the Caribbean (2008), the Role of Transnationals Corporations in Columbia (2006&#8211;
</p>
<p>2008), and Global Corporations and Human Wrongs (2000).63 Permanent Peoples&#8217; 
</p>
<p>Tribunals are only beneficial in raising public awareness of human rights abuses that 
</p>
<p>otherwise cannot be heard. They offer no legal remedy, but are important politically.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Extraterritoriality in the United Nations treaty bodies and special procedures 
</b></p>
<p>59. United Nations treaty bodies and special procedures have addressed extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>human rights issues in their various reports, including for the universal periodic review and 
</p>
<p>general comments. According to a recent report from the International Network for 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in the last seven years the various mechanisms of 
</p>
<p>OHCHR have touched upon extraterritorial obligations some 26 times. In so doing, these 
</p>
<p>bodies have played an important role in developing and consolidating an understanding of 
</p>
<p>how to apply the concepts of jurisdiction to the actions and omissions of States.64 They 
</p>
<p>expressed their concerns and made recommendations on a number of issues addressing 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial obligations, especially on the human rights impact of the exploitation of 
</p>
<p>natural resources in third countries and the role of TNCs in large-scale development 
</p>
<p>projects with respect to forced land evictions, all of which impact directly on the right to 
</p>
<p>food.  
</p>
<p>60. General comments do not establish legal obligations, but elaborate on the practical 
</p>
<p>implications of those obligations. The treaty bodies, however, have legally binding powers. 
</p>
<p>In February 2013, the Committee of the Rights of the Child adopted general comment No. 
</p>
<p>16 (2013) on State obligations regarding the impact of the business sector on children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights to elaborate on the practical implications of those obligations. The Committee also 
</p>
<p>noted that the existing instruments and guidance did not sufficiently address the particular 
</p>
<p>situation and needs of children.65 The treaty bodies have also contributed to the protection 
</p>
<p>of the rights of groups such as indigenous people and small-scale farmers, whose rights are 
</p>
<p>routinely disregarded by foreign States and private actors based in third countries. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, in recent years a number special procedure mandate holders have sent various 
</p>
<p>communications to States concerning the application of extraterritorial obligations, 
</p>
<p>especially in cases involving allegations of corporate abuse of human rights in host States. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Codes of conducts and voluntary guidelines 
</b></p>
<p>61. Recent years have witnessed various attempts to regulate the impact of business 
</p>
<p>activities on human rights outside of the territorial boundaries of the home State. Notably 
</p>
<p>the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (2011) underlined that States 
</p>
<p>&#8220;should set out clearly the expectation that all business enterprises domiciled in their 
</p>
<p>territory and/or jurisdiction respect human rights throughout their operations&#8221; and clarified 
</p>
<p>the responsibility of TNCs and other business enterprises to respect human rights. Similarly 
</p>
<p>The United Nations Global Compact (2000) urges TNCs to respect workers&#8217; rights and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 63 See www.tni.org/archives/peoplestribunal-lima.

<p> 64 <i>Global Economy, Global Rights: A practitioner</i>&#8217;<i>s guide for interpreting human rights obligations in 
</i></p>
<p><i>the global economy</i> (2014), p. 9. 
 65 See Committee on the Rights of the Child, concluding observations on Australia, CRC/C/AUS/CO/4, 
</p>
<p>paras. 27 and 28, and Turkey, CRC/C/TUR/CO/2-3, paras. 22 and 23.  </p>


<p>human rights; and the OECD Guidelines call on enterprises to respect human rights. In 
</p>
<p>2011, a group of experts in international law and human rights adopted the Maastricht 
</p>
<p>Principles on Extraterritorial Obligations of States in the Area of Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights, which provide that States are responsible for violations of economic, social 
</p>
<p>and cultural rights by non-State actors, including corporations in cases where these non-
</p>
<p>State actors act under the instructions or direct control of the State, or are empowered by 
</p>
<p>the State to exercise elements of governmental authority. 
</p>
<p>62. The Guiding Principles are considered the most authoritative statement of the human 
</p>
<p>rights responsibilities of corporations and corresponding State duties adopted at the United 
</p>
<p>Nations level. The Guiding Principles offer a noncommittal voice on extraterritoriality but 
</p>
<p>are rapidly developing and cited in established international standards, such as the revised 
</p>
<p>version of the 2011 OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the updated 
</p>
<p>International Finance Corporation Performance Standards; the European Union has also 
</p>
<p>cited the Guiding Principles in its latest Corporate Social Responsibility strategy, and many 
</p>
<p>national governments are recognizing the need to regulate in the area of business and 
</p>
<p>human rights. These rules that place obligations on corporations can develop out of the 
</p>
<p>complex interplay between various States and non-State systems and this multidimensional 
</p>
<p>aspects give them legitimacy.  
</p>
<p>63. The OECD guidelines&#8217; implementation mechanism, the &#8220;National Contact Points&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>emphasize due diligence responsibility for human rights. There have been more than 100 
</p>
<p>cases to date, in which different human rights organizations had approached the National 
</p>
<p>Contact Points alleging violations of the guidelines by corporations and thus violations of 
</p>
<p>human rights law.66 The Maastricht Principles are also an example of progressive 
</p>
<p>development efforts of international law. A range of academic experts and non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations endorsed the Maastricht Principles in September 2011, and 
</p>
<p>they have been acknowledged in paragraph 61 of the Guiding Principles on Extreme 
</p>
<p>Poverty and Human Rights, which were adopted by consensus by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council (resolution 21/11) in September 2012.  
</p>
<p>64. All of these mechanisms have the common of preventing and addressing human 
</p>
<p>rights abuse by business enterprises but fail to provide sufficient monitoring mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>The voluntary nature of soft law instruments is generally not sufficient to protect human 
</p>
<p>rights and thus fails to close the existing &#8220;accountability gap&#8221; of extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>responsibilities.67 However, one should not be too quick to rule out categorically the legal 
</p>
<p>applicability of such declarations just because they are of a voluntary nature. Law is not 
</p>
<p>limited to what States set forth. Legal norms can also be formed in society. To treat the 
</p>
<p>concept of law as being entirely dependent on the State is to overlook the unique nature of 
</p>
<p>social norms.68  
</p>
<p>65. The legally binding nature of voluntary rules may also emerge with the help of 
</p>
<p>national law. Voluntary standards can often be enforced in accordance with competition or 
</p>
<p>consumer laws, where they include relevant representations to the consumer. Thus, a 
</p>
<p>corporation&#8217;s non-adherence to its own codes can be enforced before courts in the country 
</p>
<p>of the corporation&#8217;s headquarters.69  
</p>
<p>66. Transnational campaigns by civil society are also important in developing good 
</p>
<p>practice. For example, Oxfam&#8217;s &#8220;Behind the Brands&#8221; campaign called upon TNCs to stop 
</p>
<p>land grabbing. As a result PepsiCo, Coca-Cola and Nestle responded by committing to a

<p>&#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; policy within their supply chains in relation to land grabbing and 
</p>
<p>protecting the land rights of rural and indigenous communities.70 These are important 
</p>
<p>victories, yet monitoring and proper enforcement by the companies is essential to ensure 
</p>
<p>that these committments are upheld.  
</p>
<p>67. The question of accountability in relation to TNCs and IFIs is still a grey area in 
</p>
<p>international law. However, there has been significant progress on the part of some States, 
</p>
<p>human rights organizations, and even some TNCs in developing guidelines to ensure the 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights and the environment. Providing a uniformly enforced regulatory 
</p>
<p>framework may actually encourage foreign investment in developing countries by levelling 
</p>
<p>the business playing field for ethical corporations.
 
</p>
<p>Some companies have begun to 
</p>
<p>recognize the merits of operating under enforceable standards that apply to all their 
</p>
<p>competitors, rather than voluntary standards that only really influence companies with 
</p>
<p>prominent public profiles.71  
</p>
<p>68. Following the unanimous adoption of the Guiding Principles on Business and 
</p>
<p>Human Rights in June 2011, the Human Rights Council subsequently called on all Member 
</p>
<p>States in June 2014 to develop national action plans to further the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles within their respective national contexts. This development followed 
</p>
<p>similar requests to Member States made by the European Union in 2011 and 2012 and 
</p>
<p>Council of Europe in 2014. However, as of 1 December 2014, only six States have 
</p>
<p>developed and published NAPs on business and human rights: Denmark, Italy, the 
</p>
<p>Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom.72 At the same time, a number of other 
</p>
<p>governments have begun the process of developing national action plans on business and 
</p>
<p>human rights or have publicly announced an intention to do so.73 The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>congratulates those States which have developed plans and encourages others to do so as a 
</p>
<p>matter of priority. In order to encourage more States, business enterprises and civil society 
</p>
<p>actors to engage in the process, the Working Group on Business and Human Rights on 
</p>
<p>1 December launched its guidance on national action plans.74 
</p>
<p>69. In June 2014, the Human Rights Council decided to establish an open-ended 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental working group with a mandate &#8220;to elaborate an international legally 
</p>
<p>binding instrument to regulate, in international human rights law, the activities of 
</p>
<p>transnational corporations and other business enterprises&#8221; (resolution 26/9). It was decided 
</p>
<p>that the open-ended intergovernmental working group would hold its first session in 2015 
</p>
<p>&#8220;to collect inputs &#8230; on possible principles, scope and elements of such an international 
</p>
<p>instrument&#8221; and that the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the working group should prepare 
</p>
<p>elements for the draft instrument for substantive negotiations at the commencement of the 
</p>
<p>working group&#8217;s third session.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessor, Olivier De Schutter, in a statement of March 
</p>
<p>2014 underlined that international human rights law has already gone a long way towards 
</p>
<p>recognizing duties of States to regulate the activities of corporations, and that the

<p>negotiation of a new legally binding instrument is one among many alternative ways 
</p>
<p>through which the fight against impunity for human rights violations could be further 
</p>
<p>strengthened. He also suggested that States cooperate with one another in order to ensure 
</p>
<p>that victims are provided with effective remedies in transnational cases. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur supports the recommendations made by her predecessor and urges States to 
</p>
<p>consider bringing his proposals to the Human Rights Council for further clarification on the 
</p>
<p>States&#8217; obligation in relation to non-regulatory means; to identify best practices regarding 
</p>
<p>cooperation between States; and for the adoption of a resolution to draw attention to the 
</p>
<p>Maastricht Principles<i>.</i> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>establish a mechanism to explore the feasibility of seeking an advisory opinion from the 
</p>
<p>International Court of Justice to determine the legal obligations associated with the 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial implementation of the right to food. The advisory opinion of the Court 
</p>
<p>would itself have no legally binding effect, however, as the highest international court, it 
</p>
<p>has an interpretative authority with respect to particular legal questions. Legal clarification 
</p>
<p>would increase the influence of voluntary regulatory efforts having the goal of reaching 
</p>
<p>legally binding agreements.

<p><b>indivisible, and should be protected as such. Economic, social and cultural rights are 
</b></p>
<p><b>more than mere aspirations, they are necessary conditions for the stability of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>democratic order, and economic power must be subject to democratic control. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>newly ratified Optional Protocol is an effort to equalize and operationalize those two 
</b></p>
<p><b>categories of rights and empower the justiciability of the economic, social and cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights. The Special Rapporteur intends to work closely with civil society and States to 
</b></p>
<p><b>promote ratification and use of the Optional Protocol and bring violations to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as a practical 
</b></p>
<p><b>means of eradicating hunger and promoting the right to adequate food. The Optional 
</b></p>
<p><b>Protocol has the potential to contextualize and operationalize the right to food at 
</b></p>
<p><b>international and national levels. However, we should not be complacent as much 
</b></p>
<p><b>remains to be done beyond the scope of the Optional Protocol. Wealthy States not only 
</b></p>
<p><b>have moral obligations to address poverty and hunger beyond their borders, they are 
</b></p>
<p><b>also legally obliged to do so under international law. International cooperation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>development assistance must become the legal norm in an increasingly global world. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Despite established duties in a number of human rights documents and voluntary 
</b></p>
<p><b>principles, significant barriers and loopholes exist in relation to the extraterritorial 
</b></p>
<p><b>application of States obligations in human rights law. A coordinated international 
</b></p>
<p><b>response is essential in order to maintain international peace and security and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure protection of the most vulnerable in times of economic globalization. </b> 
</p>
<p>72. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that States: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) For those that have not already done so, ratify the Optional Protocol to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as a matter of 
</b></p>
<p><b>priority; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure recognition of the justiciability of the right to food by judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>and quasi-judicial bodies at the national, regional and international levels;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure renewed political commitment to the progressive realization of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the right to adequate food by adopting policies, constitutional principles and </b></p>


<p><b>framework laws that provides an appropriate institutional structure; and sectoral 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation addressing various sectors that impact significantly on levels of food 
</b></p>
<p><b>security in this regard;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Provide mechanisms that offer adequate, effective and timely remedies 
</b></p>
<p><b>in cases of violations of the right to food, in particular to groups such as communities 
</b></p>
<p><b>living in remote rural areas, communities living in situations of extreme poverty, 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons with disabilities and indigenous communities, either through collective or 
</b></p>
<p><b>public interest remedies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensure the empowerment of women by guaranteeing their basic right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>access adequate food and take steps to implement gender-mainstreaming in relation to 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic policies on agricultural, property and inheritance rights;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Ensure that everyone, without discrimination, is afforded access to social 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection as a means of offering economic, social, and cultural rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Cooperate with civil society organizations to organize training 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes for rights holders and duty bearers in order to operationalize the 
</b></p>
<p><b>justiciability of the right to food; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Develop awareness-raising campaigns to ensure that rights holders have 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to information pertaining to the right to food and the obligations pertaining 
</b></p>
<p><b>thereto; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Ensure policy coherence when implementing national food strategies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>paying particular attention to the correlation between trade and investment policies, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and economic development plans; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Develop the necessary legal structure in order to protect resources 
</b></p>
<p><b>directly related to the right to access adequate and nutritious food, such as water 
</b></p>
<p><b>sources, access to land and seed production; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) </b>Enable further clarification on States&#8217; extraterritorial obligations in 
</p>
<p><b>relation to non-regulatory means; identify best practices regarding cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b>between States; and adopt within the Human Rights Council a resolution to draw 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention to the Maastricht Principles; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Consider requesting an advisory opinion from the International Court of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Justice to determine the legal obligations relating to the extraterritorial 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the right to food.
