<p><b>I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In 2011, pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 17/19, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights submitted a report to the Council in which she 
</p>
<p>described a pattern of discrimination and violence directed at people in all regions on the 
</p>
<p>basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity.1 Almost three years on, in its resolution 
</p>
<p>27/32, the Council requested the High Commissioner to update the above-mentioned report 
</p>
<p>with a view to sharing good practices and ways to overcome violence and discrimination, in 
</p>
<p>application of existing international human rights law and standards. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report draws on recent findings of United Nations human rights bodies, 
</p>
<p>regional organizations and non-governmental organizations, and information submitted by 
</p>
<p>Governments, including 28 replies to a note verbale addressed to Member States on 29 
</p>
<p>December 2014.2  
</p>
<p><b> II. Recent developments 
</b></p>
<p>3. In recent years, Governments in all regions have pursued a variety of initiatives 
</p>
<p>aimed at reducing levels of violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and 
</p>
<p>gender identity. For example, since 2011, 14 States have adopted or strengthened anti-
</p>
<p>discrimination and hate crime laws, extending protection on grounds of sexual orientation 
</p>
<p>and/or gender identity and, in two cases, also introducing legal protections for intersex 
</p>
<p>persons. Three States have abolished criminal sanctions for homosexuality; 12 have 
</p>
<p>introduced marriage or civil unions for same-sex couples nationally; and 10 have 
</p>
<p>introduced reforms that, to varying degrees, make it easier for transgender persons to obtain 
</p>
<p>legal recognition of their gender identity.  
</p>
<p>4. In dozens of countries, police, judges, prison guards, medical staff and teachers are 
</p>
<p>receiving gender and sexuality sensitivity training, anti-bullying programmes have been 
</p>
<p>launched in schools, and shelters have been built to house homeless lesbian, gay, bisexual 
</p>
<p>and transgender (LGBT) youth. Popular television programmes have integrated LGBT 
</p>
<p>characters in a positive way and celebrities have helped to raise awareness by &#8220;coming out&#8221; 
</p>
<p>as LGBT persons themselves or speaking out in support of members of the LGBT 
</p>
<p>community. In all regions, LGBT and intersex3 human rights defenders are more vocal and 
</p>
<p>visible &#8211; in several cases successfully challenging in the courts attempts by authorities to 
</p>
<p>restrict their legitimate activities. 
</p>
<p>5. While these advances are welcome, they are overshadowed by continuing, serious 
</p>
<p>and widespread human rights violations perpetrated, too often with impunity, against 
</p>
<p>individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. Since 2011, hundreds of 
</p>
<p>people have been killed and thousands more injured in brutal, violent attacks &#8211; some of 
</p>
<p>which are chronicled below. Other documented violations include torture, arbitrary 
</p>
<p>detention, denial of rights to assembly and expression, and discrimination in health care, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 A/HRC/19/41. 
</p>
<p> 2 Replies are available on the website of the Office of the High Commissioner at 
</p>
<p>www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Discrimination/Pages/SOGIHRC29Replies.aspx. 
</p>
<p> 3 While &#8220;LGBT&#8221; is used in the present report, other terms are used in different regions. References are 
</p>
<p>also included to violations against intersex persons, who may have any sexual orientation or gender 
</p>
<p>identity. United Nations human rights mechanisms have repeatedly addressed such violations together 
</p>
<p>with those directed at LGBT persons. </p>


<p>education, employment and housing. These and related abuses warrant a concerted response 
</p>
<p>from Governments, legislatures, regional organizations, national human rights institutions 
</p>
<p>and civil society, as well as from United Nations bodies &#8211; the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>included.  
</p>
<p>6. Concerns regarding the extent and gravity of violence and discrimination against 
</p>
<p>LGBT and intersex persons have been raised repeatedly by United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies and special procedures. In recent years, the Office of the High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>(OHCHR) has published a range of guidance and public information materials &#8211; including 
</p>
<p>factsheets, booklets and short videos &#8211; and has sought to engage States in a constructive 
</p>
<p>dialogue on ways to better protect the rights of LGBT and intersex persons. In July 2013, 
</p>
<p>the High Commissioner launched UN Free &amp; Equal (www.unfe.org), a global education 
</p>
<p>campaign to combat homophobia and transphobia that has so far reached more than a 
</p>
<p>billion people around the world through events and via traditional and social media. 
</p>
<p>7. The rights of LGBT persons have also been a focus of work going on across the 
</p>
<p>wider United Nations system. In his message to the Oslo Conference on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, the Secretary-General described the fight against 
</p>
<p>homophobia and transphobia as &#8220;one of the great, neglected human rights challenges of our 
</p>
<p>time&#8221; and pledged to work for an end to criminalization and for action to tackle violence 
</p>
<p>and prejudice. United Nations agencies are increasingly integrating issues of sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation and gender identity into their programmatic work, including in the areas of 
</p>
<p>development, education, labour rights, child rights, gender equality, refugee protection, 
</p>
<p>HIV and public health.4  
</p>
<p>8. Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity have also been addressed by 
</p>
<p>regional organizations in Africa, the Americas and Europe. In 2014, the African 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights passed a resolution in which it condemned 
</p>
<p>violence and other human rights violations based on real or imputed sexual orientation and 
</p>
<p>gender identity; the Organization of American States approved its seventh resolution on 
</p>
<p>human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity, having in 2013 adopted the 
</p>
<p>Convention against all forms of Discrimination and Intolerance, which addresses these 
</p>
<p>issues; the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights established the mandate of 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the rights of LGBT and intersex persons, having established a dedicated unit 
</p>
<p>in 2011; the European Union adopted guidelines on the promotion and protection of human 
</p>
<p>rights of LGBT and intersex persons, and both the European Parliament and the 
</p>
<p>Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted resolutions on the subject; and 
</p>
<p>the European Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>issued several judgements affirming the rights of LGBT persons to equal treatment and 
</p>
<p>protection under the law. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Applicable international standards and obligations 
</b></p>
<p>9. Application of international human rights law is guided by the fundamental 
</p>
<p>principles of universality, equality and non-discrimination. All human beings, irrespective 
</p>
<p>of their sexual orientation and gender identity, are entitled to enjoy the protection of 
</p>
<p>international human rights law with respect to the rights to life, security of person and 
</p>
<p>privacy, to freedom from torture and ill-treatment, discrimination and arbitrary arrest and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p>Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity&#8221;, OHCHR, 2014.  </p>


<p>detention, and to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, and all other 
</p>
<p>civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>10. States have well-established obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the human 
</p>
<p>rights of all persons within their jurisdiction, including LGBT and intersex persons. These 
</p>
<p>obligations extend to refraining from interference in the enjoyment of rights, preventing 
</p>
<p>abuses by third parties and proactively tackling barriers to the enjoyment of human rights, 
</p>
<p>including, in the present context, discriminatory attitudes and practices. Specific related 
</p>
<p>obligations are elaborated below, building on analysis in the previous report 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/19/41) and evolving work of United Nations human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> A. To protect individuals from violence  
</b></p>
<p>11. States have an obligation to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, punish 
</p>
<p>and redress deprivation of life and other acts of violence. United Nations mechanisms have 
</p>
<p>called upon States to fulfil this obligation by taking legislative and other measures to 
</p>
<p>prohibit, investigate and prosecute all acts of targeted, hate-motivated violence and 
</p>
<p>incitement to violence directed at LGBT and intersex persons, and to provide remedy to 
</p>
<p>victims and protection against reprisals.
5
 They have called for State officials to publically 
</p>
<p>condemn such acts, and to record statistics on such crimes and the outcomes of 
</p>
<p>investigations, prosecutions and remedial measures.
6
 The application of the death penalty 
</p>
<p>on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity violates fundamental State obligations 
</p>
<p>to protect the rights to life, privacy, equality before the law and freedom from 
</p>
<p>discrimination.7 
</p>
<p>12. States also have an obligation not to return refugees to places where life or freedom 
</p>
<p>would be threatened on account of actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender 
</p>
<p>identity.8 
</p>
<p><b> B. To prevent torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>13. States have an obligation to protect all persons, including LGBT and intersex 
</p>
<p>persons, from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in 
</p>
<p>custodial, medical and other settings. This obligation extends to prohibiting, preventing, 
</p>
<p>investigating and providing redress for torture and ill-treatment in all contexts of State 
</p>
<p>control, including by ensuring that such acts are offences under domestic criminal law.9 
</p>
<p>State responsibility is engaged if public officials, including prison and police officers, 
</p>
<p>directly commit, instigate, incite, encourage, acquiesce in or otherwise participate or are 
</p>
<p>complicit in such acts, as well as if officials fail to prevent, investigate, prosecute and 
</p>
<p>punish such acts by public or private actors.10  
</p>
<p>14. The medical practices condemned by United Nations mechanisms in this context 
</p>
<p>include so-called &#8220;conversion&#8221; therapy, forced genital and anal examinations, forced and 
</p>

<p>otherwise involuntary sterilization and medically unnecessary surgery and treatment 
</p>
<p>performed on intersex children.11 
</p>
<p><b> C. To decriminalize homosexuality and to repeal other laws used to punish 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity 
</b></p>
<p>15. States have an obligation to protect the rights to privacy, liberty and security of the 
</p>
<p>person, including the right not to be subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention. United 
</p>
<p>Nations mechanisms have called upon States to fulfil these obligations by repealing laws 
</p>
<p>used to punish individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, including 
</p>
<p>laws criminalizing homosexuality and cross-dressing, and have rejected attempts to justify 
</p>
<p>such laws on grounds of the protection of public health or morals.12 States must refrain 
</p>
<p>from arresting or detaining persons on discriminatory grounds, including sexual orientation 
</p>
<p>and gender identity.13 
</p>
<p><b> D. To protect individuals from discrimination on grounds of sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>orientation and gender identity 
</b></p>
<p>16. The protection of rights to equality before the law, equal protection of the law and 
</p>
<p>freedom from discrimination is a fundamental obligation of States under international law, 
</p>
<p>and requires States to prohibit and prevent discrimination in private and public spheres, and 
</p>
<p>to diminish conditions and attitudes that cause or perpetuate such discrimination.14 To this 
</p>
<p>end, States should enact comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation that includes sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation and gender identity among protected grounds.15 States should review and repeal 
</p>
<p>discriminatory laws and address discrimination against LGBT and intersex persons, 
</p>
<p>including in the enjoyment of the rights to health, education, work, water, adequate housing 
</p>
<p>and social security.16 
</p>
<p>17. States also have obligations to address discrimination against children and young 
</p>
<p>persons who identify or are perceived as LGBT or intersex. This includes harassment, 
</p>
<p>bullying in schools, lack of access to health information and services, and coercive medical 
</p>
<p>treatment.17 United Nations mechanisms have called upon States to legally recognize 
</p>
<p>transgender persons&#8217; preferred gender, without abusive requirements, including 
</p>
<p>sterilization, forced medical treatment or divorce.18 They have called upon States to develop 
</p>
<p>education campaigns and train public officials to combat stigma and discriminatory 
</p>
<p>attitudes, to provide victims of discrimination with effective and appropriate remedies, and 
</p>

<p>to ensure that perpetrators face administrative, civil or criminal responsibility, as 
</p>
<p>appropriate.19 States should also provide legal recognition and protection to same-sex 
</p>
<p>couples20 and protect the rights of their children, without discrimination.21 
</p>
<p><b> E. To protect rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to take part in the conduct of public affairs 
</b></p>
<p>18. States have obligations to protect rights to freedom of thought and expression, 
</p>
<p>association and peaceful assembly without discrimination on the grounds of sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation or gender identity. To that end, they should review and repeal discriminatory 
</p>
<p>provisions in domestic legislation that have a disproportionate impact on the exercise of 
</p>
<p>these rights by LGBT persons and others advocating for their rights. States should refrain 
</p>
<p>from directly interfering with these rights and protect LGBT persons exercising these rights 
</p>
<p>from attacks and reprisals through preventive measures and by investigating attacks, 
</p>
<p>prosecuting perpetrators and ensuring remedy for victims.22 
</p>
<p>19. States must protect the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs, without 
</p>
<p>discrimination, and ensure that LGBT and intersex persons and organizations defending 
</p>
<p>their rights are consulted with regard to legislation and policies that affect their rights.23 
</p>
<p>States should take measures to empower LGBT and intersex persons, and to facilitate their 
</p>
<p>participation in economic, social and political life.24 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Homophobic and transphobic violence</b>25<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Context 
</b></p>
<p>20. Due diligence requires States to ensure the protection of those at particular risk of 
</p>
<p>violence &#8211; including, in the present context, those targeted because of their sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation and gender identity.  
</p>
<p>21. United Nations human rights mechanisms continue to receive reports of homophobic 
</p>
<p>and transphobic violence committed in all regions. Such violence may be physical 
</p>
<p>(including murder, beatings, kidnapping and sexual assault) or psychological (including 
</p>
<p>threats, coercion and the arbitrary deprivation of liberty, including forced psychiatric 
</p>
<p>incarceration). These attacks constitute a form of gender-based violence, driven by a desire 
</p>
<p>to punish individuals whose appearance or behaviour appears to challenge gender 
</p>
<p>stereotypes. 
</p>
<p>22. In addition to &#8220;street&#8221; violence and other spontaneous attacks in public settings, 
</p>
<p>those perceived as LGBT remain targets of organized abuse, including by religious 
</p>

<p>extremists, paramilitary groups and extreme nationalists.26 LGBT and gender non-
</p>
<p>conforming youth are at risk of family and community violence. Lesbians and transgender 
</p>
<p>women are at particular risk because of gender inequality and power relations within 
</p>
<p>families and wider society.27

<p>23. Violence motivated by homophobia and transphobia is often particularly brutal, and 
</p>
<p>in some instances characterized by levels of cruelty exceeding that of other hate crimes.28

<p>Violent acts include deep knife cuts, anal rape and genital mutilation, as well as stoning and 
</p>
<p>dismemberment.29 
</p>
<p>24. United Nations experts have condemned the persistence of impunity for these 
</p>
<p>violations and repeatedly called for investigation, prosecution and punishment, and 
</p>
<p>reparations for victims.30
 
Reported shortcomings include ineffective police action, failure to 
</p>
<p>register cases, loss of documents, inappropriate classification of acts, including physical 
</p>
<p>assault as a minor offence, and investigations guided by stereotypes and prejudices.31
 
 
</p>
<p>25. In most countries, the absence of effective systems for recording and reporting hate-
</p>
<p>motivated violence, or &#8220;hate crimes&#8221;, against LGBT persons masks the true extent of 
</p>
<p>violence. Where they exist, official statistics tend to understate the number of incidents.32 
</p>
<p>Victims are often reluctant to report their experiences for fear of extortion, breach of 
</p>
<p>confidentiality or reprisals. In addition, prejudicial and inexact categorization of cases 
</p>
<p>results in misidentification, concealment and underreporting.33 Failure to investigate, 
</p>
<p>prosecute and punish violations when reported also contributes to incomplete assessments 
</p>
<p>of the scale of violence.34 
</p>
<p><b> B. Killings 
</b></p>
<p>26. Hate-motivated killings of LGBT individuals have been documented in all regions. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has noted 
</p>
<p>&#8220;grotesque homicides&#8221; perpetrated with broad impunity, allegedly at times with the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;complicity of investigative authorities&#8221; (A/HRC/26/36/Add.1, para. 85). Treaty bodies, 
</p>
<p>special procedures and United Nations agencies continue to express alarm at such killings 
</p>
<p>and related patterns of violence, including the murder of transsexual women in Uruguay35 
</p>
<p>and of Black lesbian women in South Africa.36 In an assault in Chile, a gay man was beaten 
</p>
<p>and killed by neo-Nazis, who burned him with cigarettes and carved swastikas into his

<p> 37 OHCHR, briefing note on Chile, 30 March 2012. </p>


<p>27. Data are patchy but, wherever available, suggest alarmingly high rates of homicidal 
</p>
<p>violence. In Brazil, one of relatively few countries where the Government publishes an 
</p>
<p>annual report on homophobic violence, the authorities documented 310 murders in 2012 in 
</p>
<p>which homophobia or transphobia was a motive.38 The Inter-American Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights reported 594 hate-related killings of LGBT persons in the 25 States 
</p>
<p>members of the Organization of American States between January 2013 and March 2014.39 
</p>
<p>In its resolution 275, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights condemned 
</p>
<p>increasing violence and other human rights violations based on imputed or real sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation or gender identity. The European Parliament (resolution 2013/2183(INI) and the 
</p>
<p>Council of Europe (resolution 1948 (2013) have also regularly expressed their concerns. 
</p>
<p>28. Reporting from non-governmental organizations underscores the prevalence of fatal 
</p>
<p>violence. The Trans Murder Monitoring project, which collects reports of homicides of 
</p>
<p>transgender persons in all regions, lists 1,612 murders in 62 countries between 2008 and 
</p>
<p>2014, equivalent to a killing every two days.40 The National Coalition of Anti-Violence 
</p>
<p>Programs in the United States of America reported 18 hate violence homicides and 2,001 
</p>
<p>incidents of anti-LGBT violence in the United States in 2013.41  
</p>
<p>29. Terrorist groups may target LGBT persons for punishment, including killings.42 In 
</p>
<p>February 2015, photos appeared to show several men, allegedly accused of homosexual 
</p>
<p>acts, being pushed off a tower to their deaths by militants of the so-called Islamic State in 
</p>
<p>Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).43 
</p>
<p>30. LGBT persons have also been victims of so-called &#8220;honour&#8221; killings, carried out 
</p>
<p>against those seen by family or community members to have brought shame on a family, 
</p>
<p>often for transgressing gender norms or for sexual behaviour, including actual or assumed 
</p>
<p>homosexual conduct.44  
</p>
<p><b> C. Other violence, including sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>31. United Nations experts continue to express their alarm at non-lethal violence 
</p>
<p>directed at individuals on the grounds of their sexual orientation or gender identity. 
</p>
<p>Examples include cases of gay men who have been kidnapped, beaten and humiliated, with 
</p>
<p>film clips of their abuse shared on social media,45 and of lesbians assaulted and raped 
</p>
<p>because of their sexual orientation.46 In the Syrian Arab Republic, there have been reports 
</p>
<p>of rape and torture of men assumed to be gay perpetrated by security agents and by non-
</p>
<p>State armed groups.47 Concerns have also been expressed about the risk to human rights

<p>defenders working to uphold the rights of LGBT persons, some of whom have been 
</p>
<p>subjected to violence, threats and verbal denigration.48 
</p>
<p>32. In the United States, recent government figures show that the number of bias-
</p>
<p>motivated incidents based on sexual orientation ranks second only to racist incidents among 
</p>
<p>single-bias hate crimes.49 A Europe-wide survey of 93,000 LGBT persons conducted in 
</p>
<p>2013 for the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights found that a quarter of all 
</p>
<p>respondents had been attacked or threatened with violence in the previous five years.50 A 
</p>
<p>survey conducted in 2012 by the non-governmental organization Stonewall in the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland found that one in six LGBT respondents 
</p>
<p>had experienced a hate crime or incident in the previous three years; of those, 75 per cent 
</p>
<p>had not reported the experience to the police.
51
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>33. Treaty bodies and special procedures continue to express concern at rhetoric used to 
</p>
<p>incite homophobic and transphobic hatred and related violence.52 Such language is used by 
</p>
<p>some political and community leaders to promote negative stereotypes, stir up prejudice 
</p>
<p>and harass particular individuals, especially during electoral periods. The High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner has expressed concern at inflammatory rhetoric used in Belarus, the Gambia 
</p>
<p>and Honduras.53 The Committee on the Rights of the Child has criticized statements by the 
</p>
<p>Holy See as contributing to the stigmatization of, and violence against, LGBT adolescents 
</p>
<p>and children raised by same-sex couples,54 and about the negative impact of hate speech on 
</p>
<p>LGBT and intersex adults and children in Switzerland.55 
</p>
<p><b> D. Torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Committee against Torture and the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
</p>
<p>cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment have continued to express concerns at 
</p>
<p>the torture and ill-treatment of LGBT persons in detention by or with the acquiescence of 
</p>
<p>State officials.56 
</p>
<p>35. Reported cases include the arrest, beating and ill-treatment by police in Zimbabwe 
</p>
<p>of 44 members of an LGBT organization.57 Sixteen gay and transgender individuals in the 
</p>
<p>United States were allegedly subjected to solitary confinement, torture and ill-treatment, 
</p>
<p>including sexual assault, while in detention in immigration facilities.58 A woman was 
</p>
<p>reportedly arrested in Bangladesh for being a lesbian, and subsequently beaten and raped by 
</p>
<p>police while in custody.59 In Egypt, four people arrested on the basis of their alleged sexual

<p>orientation and/or gender identity reportedly faced sexual assault by other inmates while in 
</p>
<p>detention.60 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences has 
</p>
<p>highlighted similar cases, noting that those with a non-heterosexual orientation, or whose 
</p>
<p>gender expression did not fall into exact categories of female and male, were vulnerable to 
</p>
<p>targeted abuse both by staff and by other prisoners. She expressed concern about lesbian 
</p>
<p>women being placed in cells with men if they refused the sexual advances of prison staff. 
</p>
<p>Female prisoners whom guards viewed as &#8220;masculine&#8221; in appearance were subjected to 
</p>
<p>harassment, physical abuse and &#8220;forced feminization&#8221;. Transgender prisoners face 
</p>
<p>particularly harsh circumstances. In one case, in Guatemala, a transgender woman was 
</p>
<p>allegedly raped more than 80 times while in detention.61 
</p>
<p>37. Some States continue to subject men suspected of homosexual conduct to anal 
</p>
<p>examinations in order to &#8220;prove&#8221; their homosexuality. Such examinations have been 
</p>
<p>described as &#8220;medically worthless&#8221; and condemned by the Committee against Torture, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on torture and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; all have held 
</p>
<p>that the practice contravenes the prohibition on torture and ill-treatment.62 
</p>
<p>38. Other medical procedures that can, when forced or otherwise involuntary, breach the 
</p>
<p>prohibition on torture and ill-treatment include &#8220;conversion&#8221; therapy, sterilization, gender 
</p>
<p>reassignment, and unnecessary medical interventions involving intersex children (see paras. 
</p>
<p>14 above and 52, 53 and 70 below). 
</p>
<p><b> E. Positive developments since 2011 
</b></p>
<p>39. States have adopted a range of measures with a view to addressing homophobic and 
</p>
<p>transphobic violence, including some highlighted in responses to the note verbale soliciting 
</p>
<p>inputs for the present report. New or strengthened anti-hate crime laws have been enacted 
</p>
<p>in several States, including Albania, Chile, Finland, Georgia, Greece, Honduras, Malta, 
</p>
<p>Montenegro, Portugal and Serbia. Such laws can play an important role in facilitating the 
</p>
<p>prosecution and punishment of perpetrators of hate-motivated violence and in establishing 
</p>
<p>homophobia and transphobia as aggravating factors for the purposes of sentencing. 
</p>
<p>40. Other notable initiatives include the establishment of specialized hate crime 
</p>
<p>prosecution units (Brazil, Honduras, Mexico, Spain), and an interagency working group on 
</p>
<p>urgent cases (Colombia); improved police training and sensitization (Canada, Denmark, 
</p>
<p>France, Montenegro, Philippines) and new policing guidelines (Spain, United Kingdom); 
</p>
<p>national hotlines to report homophobic incidents (Brazil, Netherlands) and surveys to 
</p>
<p>improve hate-crime data collection (Belgium (Flanders), Canada); a national task force on 
</p>
<p>gender- and sexual orientation-based violence (South Africa); policies and protocols for 
</p>
<p>ensuring the dignity and safety of transgender prisoners (Brazil, Canada); training materials 
</p>
<p>on the rights of LGBT prisoners (Ecuador); and investigations by the human rights 
</p>
<p>commission of allegations of torture and ill-treatment of LGBT and intersex detainees 
</p>
<p>(Nepal).

<p><b> V. Discrimination</b>63<b> 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Human Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights have repeatedly urged States to tackle both direct and indirect discrimination against 
</p>
<p>all persons, including LGBT and intersex persons.64 States have an obligation to ensure that 
</p>
<p>laws, policies and programmes executed by State authorities do not discriminate against 
</p>
<p>individuals. They also have an obligation to address discriminatory practices, including by 
</p>
<p>private actors, and to take action to prevent, diminish and eliminate the conditions and 
</p>
<p>attitudes that contribute to substantive or de facto discrimination. 
</p>
<p>42. Discrimination against LGBT individuals is often exacerbated by other identity 
</p>
<p>factors, such as sex, ethnicity, age and religion, and socioeconomic factors, such as poverty 
</p>
<p>and armed conflict.65 The impact of such multiple forms of discrimination may be felt at an 
</p>
<p>individual level and a societal one, as LGBT persons, deprived of access to such basic 
</p>
<p>rights as employment, health, education and housing find themselves in poverty, cut off 
</p>
<p>from economic opportunity.66 Studies undertaken in several countries suggest that rates of 
</p>
<p>poverty, homelessness and food insecurity are higher among LGBT individuals than in the 
</p>
<p>wider community.67 The World Bank has documented the negative impact of homophobia 
</p>
<p>on economic growth and development.68 
</p>
<p><b> A. Discriminatory laws 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Laws criminalizing homosexuality and other laws used to penalize individuals because 
</b></p>
<p><b>of sexual orientation or gender identity 
</b></p>
<p>43. States that criminalize consensual homosexual acts are in breach of international 
</p>
<p>human rights law since these laws, by their mere existence, violate the rights to privacy and 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination. Arrests and the detention of individuals on charges relating to sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation and gender identity &#8211; including offences not directly related to sexual conduct, 
</p>
<p>such as those pertaining to physical appearance or so-called &#8220;public scandal&#8221; &#8211; are 
</p>
<p>discriminatory and arbitrary.69 Since its landmark decision in <i>Toonen v. Australia</i> 
</p>
<p>(communication No. 488/1992) in 1994, the Human Rights Committee and other 
</p>
<p>mechanisms have repeatedly urged States to reform laws criminalizing consensual same-
</p>
<p>sex conduct, and welcomed their repeal.  
</p>
<p>44. At least 76 States retain laws that are used to criminalize and harass people on the 
</p>
<p>basis of sexual orientation and gender identity or expression, including laws criminalizing

<p>consensual, adult same-sex relationships.70 Sometimes inherited as colonial-era legislation, 
</p>
<p>these laws typically prohibit certain types of sexual activity or any intimacy between 
</p>
<p>persons of the same sex. Cross-dressing or &#8220;imitating the opposite sex&#8221; is also sometimes 
</p>
<p>penalized.71 Wording often refers to vague and undefined concepts, such as &#8220;crimes against 
</p>
<p>the order of nature&#8221; or &#8220;morality&#8221;, &#8220;debauchery&#8221;, &#8220;indecent acts&#8221; or &#8220;grave scandal&#8221;.72 
</p>
<p>Penalties include lashings, life imprisonment and the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>45. Human rights mechanisms continue to emphasize links between criminalization and 
</p>
<p>homophobic and transphobic hate crimes, police abuse, torture, family and community 
</p>
<p>violence and stigmatization, as well as the constraints that criminalization put on the work 
</p>
<p>of human rights defenders.73 The Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief has 
</p>
<p>noted that these laws may give a pretext to vigilante groups and other perpetrators of hatred 
</p>
<p>for intimidating people and committing acts of violence.74 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>46. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan and Yemen, 
</p>
<p>and in parts of Nigeria and Somalia, the death penalty may be applied in cases of 
</p>
<p>consensual homosexual conduct. Death is also the prescribed punishment for 
</p>
<p>homosexuality in the revised penal code of Brunei, although relevant provisions have yet to 
</p>
<p>take effect.  
</p>
<p>47. The application of the death penalty in this context represents a grave violation of 
</p>
<p>human rights, including the rights to life, privacy and non-discrimination. The Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have 
</p>
<p>repeatedly expressed concern about death sentences for consensual adult sexual conduct.75 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has reiterated 
</p>
<p>that death sentences may only be imposed for the most serious crimes and that offences 
</p>
<p>related to homosexual conduct and sexual relations between consenting adults do not meet 
</p>
<p>that threshold.76  
</p>
<p><b> 3. </b>&#8220;Anti<b>-</b>propaganda&#8221; laws <b> 
</b></p>
<p>48. In the past two years, laws have been enacted or proposed in several States that seek 
</p>
<p>to restrict public discussion of sexual orientation under the guise of &#8220;protecting minors&#8221; 
</p>
<p>from information on so-called &#8220;non-traditional sexual relations&#8221;.77 These laws, sometimes 
</p>
<p>called &#8220;anti-propaganda&#8221; laws, are often vaguely worded and arbitrarily restrict the rights to 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression and assembly. They also contribute to ongoing persecution of 
</p>
<p>members of the LGBT community, including young persons who identify or are perceived 
</p>
<p>as LGBT.78 The Special procedures mandate holders on human rights defenders, on 
</p>
<p>freedom of opinion and expression and on freedom of peaceful assembly and of association

<p>have expressed concerns in this context about developments in Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Uganda and Ukraine.79  
</p>
<p>49. In some cases, these laws have been accompanied by bans on non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations receiving funding from abroad, allegedly in order to curb the influence of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;foreign agents&#8221;.80 Such measures put defenders at risk of arrest, violence and 
</p>
<p>discrimination, and can threaten rights relating to, inter alia, health, education, cultural 
</p>
<p>expression and information.81 
</p>
<p><b> B. Discriminatory practices</b>82<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Health care 
</b></p>
<p>50. Laws criminalizing homosexuality and the discriminatory policies, practices and 
</p>
<p>attitudes of health-care institutions and personnel adversely affect the quality of health 
</p>
<p>services,83 deter individuals from seeking services,84 and may lead to the denial of care or to 
</p>
<p>an absence of services that respond to the specific health needs of LGBT and intersex 
</p>
<p>persons.85  
</p>
<p>51. The negative health impact of laws criminalizing homosexuality has been widely 
</p>
<p>acknowledged, including by the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Development Programme (UNDP), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 
</p>
<p>(UNAIDS), the treaty bodies and the special procedures of the Human Rights Council.86 
</p>
<p>The Global Commission on HIV and the Law found, for instance, that in Caribbean 
</p>
<p>countries with laws that criminalize homosexuality, almost one in four men who have sex 
</p>
<p>with men is HIV positive; the equivalent figure in Caribbean countries with no such laws is 
</p>
<p>one in 15.87  
</p>
<p>52. There is mounting concern about so-called &#8220;conversion therapies&#8221; intended to 
</p>
<p>&#8220;cure&#8221; homosexual attraction. Such therapies have been found to be unethical, unscientific 
</p>
<p>and ineffective and, in some instances, tantamount to torture &#8211; leading to successful legal 
</p>
<p>challenges and bans in several countries.88 In Ecuador, concerns have been raised about

<p>&#8220;rehabilitation clinics&#8221; where lesbians and transgender youths have been forcibly detained 
</p>
<p>with the collusion of family members and subjected to torture, including sexual abuse.89  
</p>
<p>53. Many intersex children, born with atypical sex characteristics, are subjected to 
</p>
<p>medically unnecessary surgery and treatment in an attempt to force their physical 
</p>
<p>appearance to align with binary sex stereotypes. Such procedures are typically irreversible 
</p>
<p>and can cause severe, long-term physical and psychological suffering. Those to have called 
</p>
<p>for an end to the practice include the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Committee 
</p>
<p>against Torture, the special procedures mandate holders on the right to health and on 
</p>
<p>torture.90  
</p>
<p>54. Transgender persons often face particular difficulties in their access to appropriate 
</p>
<p>health care. Health-care professionals may be insensitive to their needs, lack relevant 
</p>
<p>knowledge and treat transgender persons in a discriminatory manner. Gender reassignment 
</p>
<p>therapy, where available, is often prohibitively expensive. In certain situations, it is 
</p>
<p>coerced.91  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Education 
</b></p>
<p>55. Many children and adolescents perceived as LGBT or gender non-conforming 
</p>
<p>experience discrimination, harassment and, in some cases, violent abuse both in and outside 
</p>
<p>of school.
 92 Such abuse can force students to skip or drop out of school, and can lead to 
</p>
<p>feelings of isolation and depression, even suicide. 
</p>
<p>56. High levels of bullying have been recorded in all regions. A European Union study 
</p>
<p>found that 80 per cent of school-age children surveyed heard negative comments or saw 
</p>
<p>negative conduct directed at schoolmates perceived as lesbian, gay, bisexual or 
</p>
<p>transgender.93 A survey conducted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Organization (UNESCO) of students in Thailand found that more than half of 
</p>
<p>LGBT respondents had been bullied in the previous month, and more than 30 per cent had 
</p>
<p>experienced physical abuse.94 These findings mirror those of studies conducted in other 
</p>
<p>countries. 
</p>
<p>57. Limiting or obstructing information related to sexuality or using materials that 
</p>
<p>contain stereotypes and prejudices can contribute to violence and expose young LGBT 
</p>
<p>persons to health risks.95 Comprehensive sexuality education is part of the right to 
</p>
<p>education and can be a tool for combating discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Employment 
</b></p>
<p>58. In most States, national laws do not provide adequate protection from employment-
</p>
<p>related discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity.96 In the absence

<p>of such laws, employers may fire or refuse to hire or promote people simply because they 
</p>
<p>are seen as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.97 Where laws do exist, they may be poorly 
</p>
<p>applied. Workplace benefits available to heterosexual employees may be denied to their 
</p>
<p>LGBT counterparts. Surveys indicate that discrimination and verbal and other forms of 
</p>
<p>harassment in the workplace are commonplace.98 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Housing 
</b></p>
<p>59. LGBT persons may experience discrimination in access to housing as a result of 
</p>
<p>unfair treatment by public and private landlords. Concerns include LGBT individuals and 
</p>
<p>same-sex couples denied leases and evicted from public housing,99 harassed by neighbours 
</p>
<p>and forced out of their homes.100 Many LGBT-identifying adolescents and young adults are 
</p>
<p>thrown out of home by disapproving parents and end up on the streets, resulting in 
</p>
<p>disproportionately high rates of homelessness among this group. A recent survey of 354 
</p>
<p>homeless support agencies in the United States suggested that some 40 per cent of homeless 
</p>
<p>youth identify as LGBT, with family rejection the leading cause of homelessness among 
</p>
<p>this group.101  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Freedom of expression, association and assembly 
</b></p>
<p>60. United Nations human rights experts continue to highlight discriminatory 
</p>
<p>restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly of LGBT 
</p>
<p>persons and those defending their rights.102 Concerns include direct censorship, bans on 
</p>
<p>dissemination of information and restrictions on advocacy.103  
</p>
<p>61. LGBT organizations continue to have registration applications rejected, reviews 
</p>
<p>delayed and legal registration revoked on discriminatory grounds.104 Permission to hold 
</p>
<p>meetings, workshops and cultural events may be denied in an attempt to suppress political 
</p>
<p>and artistic expression.105 Police officers have raided the offices of LGBT groups, arrested 
</p>
<p>and harassed staff and volunteers, and confiscated materials, sometimes putting the privacy 
</p>
<p>and safety of staff and supporters at risk.106 The offices of LGBT organizations have been 
</p>
<p>targets of vandalism, burglary and arson,107 and such incidents are seldom investigated 
</p>
<p>promptly.108

<p>62. Private and State agents target &#8220;pride&#8221; marches, where LGBT persons and their 
</p>
<p>supporters are sometimes subjected to violence and<b> </b>harassment.109 In some States, such 
</p>
<p>events are denied police protection or permits, sometimes under guise of threats to public 
</p>
<p>morals or safety, abrogating the State&#8217;s duty to uphold freedom of assembly and to protect 
</p>
<p>LGBT persons from violence.110 In the absence of proper police protection, marchers have 
</p>
<p>been physically attacked and harassed by State and non-State actors, including far-right 
</p>
<p>&#8220;skinhead&#8221; groups.111 
</p>
<p>63. Women defenders and those advocating for gender- and sexuality-related rights are 
</p>
<p>often at particular risk because they are seen as challenging traditional assumptions about 
</p>
<p>the role and status of women in society.112  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Asylum and migration 
</b></p>
<p>64.  Asylum and migration policies in this context vary considerably. The Office of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that some 42 States 
</p>
<p>have granted asylum to individuals with a well-founded fear of persecution owing to sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation or gender identity. At international borders, migrants and refugees may be 
</p>
<p>subjected to invasive physical screenings and examinations and denied entry on 
</p>
<p>discriminatory grounds.113 
</p>
<p>65. Practices in States granting asylum sometimes fall short of international standards. 
</p>
<p>Officials may be insensitive to the conditions facing LGBT asylum-seekers, and review of 
</p>
<p>applications is sometimes arbitrary and inconsistent.114 In its judgement of 2 December 
</p>
<p>2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union ordered States to cease use of intrusive 
</p>
<p>questioning and medical tests purportedly designed to reveal applicants&#8217; sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>Refugees and migrants are sometimes subjected to violence and discrimination while in 
</p>
<p>detention facilities,115 and when resettled, may be housed within communities where they 
</p>
<p>experience additional sexuality- and gender-related risks. The refoulement of asylum 
</p>
<p>seekers fleeing such persecution exposes them to the risk of violence, discrimination, 
</p>
<p>criminalization and the death penalty.116  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Family and community 
</b></p>
<p>66. States&#8217; responsibility to protect individuals from discrimination extends to the 
</p>
<p>family sphere, where rejection and discriminatory treatment of and violence against LGBT 
</p>
<p>and intersex family members can have serious, negative consequences for the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>human rights. Examples include individuals being physically assaulted, raped, excluded 
</p>
<p>from family homes, disinherited, prevented from going to school, sent to psychiatric 
</p>
<p>institutions, forced to marry, forced to give up custody of their children, punished for 
</p>
<p>activist work and subjected to attacks on personal reputation. In States where 
</p>
<p>homosexuality is criminalized, victims may be reluctant to report violence perpetrated by a

<p>family member for fear of the criminal ramifications of revealing their sexual orientation.
 
</p>
<p>Lesbians, bisexual women and transgender persons are often especially at risk owing to 
</p>
<p>gender inequalities and restrictions on autonomy in decision-making about sexuality, 
</p>
<p>reproduction and family life.117  
</p>
<p><b> 8. Recognition of relationships and related access to State and other benefits 
</b></p>
<p>67. While States are not required under international law to recognize same-sex 
</p>
<p>marriage,118 the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has called upon States 
</p>
<p>to provide for legal recognition of same-sex couples.119 As at April 2015, 34 States offered 
</p>
<p>same-sex couples either marriage or civil unions, which bestow many of the same benefits 
</p>
<p>and entitlements as marriage.120 Wherever States provide benefits such as pension and 
</p>
<p>inheritance entitlements for unmarried heterosexual couples, the same benefits should be 
</p>
<p>available to unmarried homosexual couples.121 
</p>
<p>68.  Lack of official recognition of same-sex relationships and absence of legal 
</p>
<p>prohibition on discrimination can result in same-sex partners being treated unfairly by 
</p>
<p>private actors, including health-care providers and insurance companies. The United 
</p>
<p>Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the 
</p>
<p>Inter-American Court of Human Rights have expressed concern at discrimination against, 
</p>
<p>and the lack of legal protection of, children of same-sex couples.122  
</p>
<p><b> 9. Gender recognition and related issues 
</b></p>
<p>69. In spite of recent advances in several countries, transgender persons are generally 
</p>
<p>still unable to obtain legal recognition of their preferred gender, including a change in 
</p>
<p>recorded sex and first name on State-issued identity documents. As a result, they face 
</p>
<p>multiple rights challenges, including in employment and housing, applying for bank credit 
</p>
<p>or State benefits, or when travelling abroad. 
</p>
<p>70. Regulations in States that recognize changes in gender often impose abusive 
</p>
<p>requirements as a precondition of recognition &#8211; for example, by requiring that applicants be 
unmarried and undergo forced sterilization, forced gender reassignment and other medical 
</p>
<p>procedures, in violation of international human rights standards.123

<p><b> C. Positive developments since 2011 
</b></p>
<p>71. Three States (Mozambique, Palau and Sao Tome and Principe) have decriminalized 
</p>
<p>consensual same-sex conduct, and several others have accepted recommendations to do so. 
</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and several states in Australia have adopted measures to expunge the 
</p>
<p>criminal records of individuals convicted of consensual homosexuality-related offences. 
</p>
<p>72. Fiji has added an anti-discrimination clause in its Constitution prohibiting 
</p>
<p>discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, and 
</p>
<p>Malta has added gender identity to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination included 
</p>
<p>in its Constitution. Anti-discrimination laws have also been strengthened in several States, 
</p>
<p>including Chile, Cuba, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, Montenegro, as well as in 
</p>
<p>Australia and Malta, which became the first countries to expressly prohibit discrimination 
</p>
<p>against intersex persons.  
</p>
<p>73. Legal recognition of same-sex relationships was introduced in at least 12 additional 
</p>
<p>States, either in the form of civil marriage (Brazil, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, New 
</p>
<p>Zealand, United Kingdom, Uruguay) or civil unions (Chile, Croatia, Ireland, Liechtenstein, 
</p>
<p>Malta). Argentina, Denmark and Malta established new laws that allow transgender persons 
</p>
<p>to obtain legal recognition of their gender identity on the basis of self-determination, while 
</p>
<p>Australia (Australian Capital Territory), the Netherlands and Sweden removed abusive 
</p>
<p>sterilization, forced treatment and divorce requirements. Argentina furthermore established 
</p>
<p>access to free gender-affirming treatment for those who wish to receive such treatment. 
</p>
<p>Nepal and Bangladesh created a legal &#8220;third gender&#8221; category, and new passport policies in 
</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand allow individuals to choose male, female or indeterminate 
</p>
<p>gender markers. The Supreme Court of India affirmed the right of transgender persons to 
</p>
<p>determine their own gender, and called upon the Government to ensure equal rights for 
</p>
<p>transgender persons, including in access to health care, employment and education. Malta 
</p>
<p>became the first State to prohibit sex-assignment surgery or treatment on intersex minors 
</p>
<p>without their informed consent. 
</p>
<p>74. Other initiatives include the development of a new judicial protocol to guide 
</p>
<p>adjudication of cases involving human rights violations on grounds of sexual orientation 
</p>
<p>and gender identity (Mexico); implementation of employment-related anti-discrimination 
</p>
<p>protections (Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Botswana); new guidance materials and 
</p>
<p>training for police, teachers and/or other officials (Canada, Colombia, Croatia, Denmark, 
</p>
<p>Montenegro, Norway, Mexico, Serbia, Spain); expansion of anti-bullying programmes and 
</p>
<p>other anti-discrimination measures in schools (Albania, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Taiwan 
</p>
<p>province of China, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden, United Kingdom), and annual reporting on 
</p>
<p>discrimination and violence in schools (Brazil); LGBT suicide prevention programmes 
</p>
<p>(Belgium, Japan, United Kingdom); a human rights-based comprehensive sexuality 
</p>
<p>education curriculum for schools (South Africa); scholarships for transgender persons who 
</p>
<p>enrol in vocational training (Brazil); construction of homeless shelters for LGBT youth 
</p>
<p>(Albania, United States); and no longer requiring external corroboration of sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation or gender identity for LGBT asylum-seekers (Italy, Portugal). 
</p>
<p>75. National plans of action were developed to tackle discrimination against LGBT 
</p>
<p>persons in Brazil, Canada (Quebec), France, Norway, South Africa and the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom, and, in Uruguay, a plan to combat the social exclusion of transgender persons. 
</p>
<p>Several States also launched national public education campaigns to counter homophobia 
</p>
<p>and transphobia (Argentina, Australia, Belgium (Flanders), Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, 
</p>
<p>Montenegro, Serbia, South Africa, United Kingdom, Uruguay). Mexico has officially 
</p>
<p>designated 17 May as the National Day against Homophobia.  </p>


<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> The present study is the second on violence and discrimination based on sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>orientation and gender identity requested by the Human Rights Council. While some 
</b></p>
<p><b>progress has been made since the first study in 2011, the overall picture remains one 
</b></p>
<p><b>of continuing, pervasive, violent abuse, harassment and discrimination affecting 
</b></p>
<p><b>LGBT and intersex persons in all regions. These constitute serious human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations, often perpetrated with impunity, indicating that current arrangements to 
</b></p>
<p><b>protect the human rights of LGBT and intersex persons are inadequate. There is as 
</b></p>
<p><b>yet no dedicated human rights mechanism at the international level that has a 
</b></p>
<p><b>systematic and comprehensive approach to the human rights situation of LGBT and 
</b></p>
<p><b>intersex persons.  
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> The recommendations below describe measures to protect individuals from the 
</b></p>
<p><b>kinds of human rights violations documented above. They draw from good practices 
</b></p>
<p><b>observed in the course of compiling the report and recommendations of United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations human rights mechanisms.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. States  
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> The High Commissioner recommends that States address violence by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Enacting hate crime laws that establish homophobia and transphobia as 
</b></p>
<p><b>aggravating factors for purposes of sentencing; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Conducting prompt, thorough investigations of incidents of hate-
</b></p>
<p><b>motivated violence against and torture of LGBT persons, holding perpetrators to 
</b></p>
<p><b>account, and providing redress to victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Collecting and publishing data on the number and types of incidents, 
</b></p>
<p><b>while providing for the security of those reporting;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Prohibiting incitement of hatred and violence on the grounds of sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>orientation and gender identity, and holding to account those responsible for related 
</b></p>
<p><b>hate speech;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Training law enforcement personnel and judges in gender-sensitive 
</b></p>
<p><b>approaches to addressing violations related to sexual orientation and gender identity;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Ensuring that police and prison officers are trained to protect the safety 
</b></p>
<p><b>of LGBT detainees, and holding to account State officials involved or complicit in 
</b></p>
<p><b>incidents of violence;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Banning </b>&#8220;conversion&#8221; therapy, involuntary treatment, forced 
</p>
<p><b>sterilization and forced genital and anal examinations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Prohibiting medically unnecessary procedures on intersex children; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Ensuring that no one fleeing persecution on grounds of sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>orientation or gender identity is returned to a territory where his or her life or 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom would be threatened, that asylum laws and policies recognize that 
</b></p>
<p><b>persecution on account of sexual orientation or gender identity may be a valid basis 
</b></p>
<p><b>for an asylum claim; and eliminating intrusive, inappropriate questioning on asylum 
</b></p>
<p>applicants&#8217; sexual histories<b>, and sensitizing refugee and asylum personnel.  
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> States should address discrimination by: </b></p>


<p><b>(a) Revising criminal laws to remove offences relating to consensual same-
</b></p>
<p><b>sex conduct and other offences used to arrest and punish persons on the basis of their 
</b></p>
<p><b>sexual orientation and gender identity or expression; ordering an immediate 
</b></p>
<p><b>moratorium on related prosecution; and expunging the criminal records of 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals convicted of such offences; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Repealing so-</b>called &#8220;anti<b>-</b>propaganda&#8221; and other laws that impose 
</p>
<p><b>discriminatory restrictions on freedom of expression, association and assembly; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensuring that anti-discrimination legislation includes sexual orientation 
</b></p>
<p><b>and gender identity among prohibited grounds, and also protects intersex persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>from discrimination; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Integrating analysis of violations based on sexual orientation and gender 
</b></p>
<p><b>identity in national plans of action, thereby ensuring coordination and adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>resourcing of related activities, accountability for perpetrators, and redress for 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Sensitizing health-care workers to the health needs of LGBT and 
</b></p>
<p><b>intersex persons, including in the areas of sexual and reproductive health and rights, 
</b></p>
<p><b>suicide prevention, HIV/AIDS and trauma counselling; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Establishing national standards on non-discrimination in education; 
</b></p>
<p><b>developing anti-bullying programmes and establishing helplines and other services to 
</b></p>
<p><b>support LGBT and gender-non-conforming youth; and providing comprehensive, 
</b></p>
<p><b>age-appropriate sexuality education; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Ensuring that housing policies do not discriminate against tenants based 
</b></p>
<p><b>on sexual orientation and gender identity; and establishing shelters for homeless 
</b></p>
<p><b>LGBT persons, with specific attention to youth, older persons and those in emergency 
</b></p>
<p><b>situations;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Providing legal recognition to same-sex couples and their children, 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensuring that benefits traditionally accorded married partners </b>&#8211;<b> including those 
</b></p>
<p><b>related to benefits, pensions, and taxation and inheritance </b>&#8211;<b> are accorded on a non-
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory basis; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i)  Issuing legal identity documents, upon request, that reflect preferred 
</b></p>
<p><b>gender, eliminating abusive preconditions, such as sterilization, forced treatment and 
</b></p>
<p><b>divorce; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Supporting public education campaigns to counter homophobic and 
</b></p>
<p><b>transphobic attitudes, and addressing negative, stereotypical portrayals of LGBT 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons in the media; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Ensuring that LGBT and intersex persons and organizations are 
</b></p>
<p><b>consulted with regard to legislation and policies that have an impact on their rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. National human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The High Commissioner recommends that national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>address violence and discrimination against LGBT and intersex persons in the context 
</b></p>
<p><b>of their respective mandates to promote and monitor effective implementation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights standards at the national level. </b></p>


<p><b> C. Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> As the intergovernmental body with responsibility for promoting and 
</b></p>
<p><b>protecting human rights worldwide, the Human Rights Council should keep itself 
</b></p>
<p><b>regularly informed of patterns of violence and discrimination linked to sexual 
</b></p>
<p><b>orientation and gender identity, as well as emerging State responses. To this end, 
</b></p>
<p><b>OHCHR stands ready to submit further reports upon request, and current special 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures mandate holders should be encouraged to continue to report on related 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations within their respective mandates.  
</b></p>
