</p>
<p><i> Recalling further </i>the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951 and the

</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the 
Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour (Convention No. 182) and recommendation 190 
on the Worst Forms of Child Labour of the International Labour Organization, and recognizing 
that migrant children, especially unaccompanied children, are more vulnerable to the worst 
forms of child labour, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> previous resolutions on the human rights of migrants and on the rights of the 
child adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, the Council and the General Assembly, the

24 December 2008, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with appreciation</i> its accomplishment of the Guidelines for the Alternative Care of 
Children, transmitted to the General Assembly,<b> </b>according to which States should seek to provide 
appropriate care and protection for vulnerable children, including children of migrant workers, as 
part of efforts to prevent separation of children from their parents,<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Taking note </i>of general comment No. 6 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child on the 
treatment of unaccompanied and separated children, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting with appreciation </i>the report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
migrants (A/HRC/11/7), in which he addresses the protection of children in the context of 
migration, 
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining </i>the importance of the Council in promoting respect for the protection of the 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of all, including migrants, recognizing the increasing 
participation of children in international migration movements and stressing the need to ensure 
the protection of children from all forms of abuse, neglect, exploitation and violence,  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned </i>about the large and growing number of migrants, especially children, 
attempting to cross international borders without the required travel documents, and recognizing 
the obligation of States to respect the human rights of all migrants,  
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> that policies and initiatives on the issue of migration, including those that 
refer to the orderly management of migration, should promote holistic approaches that take into 
account the causes and consequences and challenges and opportunities of the phenomenon and 
full respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of migrants, with due regard for the 
specific needs of children in vulnerable situations, such as unaccompanied children, girls, 
children with disabilities and those who may be in need of international refugee protection,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon </i>States to promote and protect effectively the human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of all migrants, especially those of children, regardless of their status, in 
conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international instruments to 
which they are party, and therefore: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Underlines that the international legal framework for the protection of the child 
applies irrespective of his/her migration status and that of his/her parents or family members, and 
calls upon States to respect and ensure the protection of the human rights of every child within 
their jurisdiction, without discrimination of any kind; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Calls upon States to establish or strengthen policies and programmes aimed at 
addressing the situation of children in the context of migration that have a human rights-based 
approach and are<b> </b>based on general principles, such as the best interests of the child, 
non-discrimination, participation and survival and development;  
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Also calls upon States that have not signed and ratified or acceded to the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocols thereto, and the International Convention 
on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families to 
consider doing so as a matter of priority; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 2. <i>Also</i> <i>calls</i> <i>upon</i> States of origin to take appropriate measures to promote and protect 
effectively the rights of children who are left behind in their country of origin by migrating 
family members, including by: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Development of data on the situation of children left behind in countries of origin in 
order to better understand the impact of migration processes on their well-being and enjoyment 
of their human rights;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Undertaking, in cooperation with relevant organizations, information campaigns with 
a child perspective aimed at clarifying prospects, limitations, potential risks and rights in the 
event of migration, in order to enable everyone, in particular children and their family members, 
to make informed decisions and to prevent them from becoming victims of trafficking or falling 
prey to transnational organized networks of smugglers or organized criminal groups; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Strengthening relevant national institutions to address the particular needs of children 
left behind in their country of origin;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further calls upon </i>States to protect the human rights of children in the context of 
migration, and therefore: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Calls upon States parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime and the supplementing protocols thereto, namely, the Protocol against the 
Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, to implement them fully, and calls upon 
States that have not yet ratified or acceded to them to consider doing so as a matter of priority;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Encourages States to establish institutionalized services and implement programmes 
to provide age- and gender-sensitive support and protection to migrant children, with due regard 
for the specific needs of children in vulnerable situations, such as unaccompanied children, girls, 
children with disabilities and those who may be in need of international refugee protection;  
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Requests all States to take concrete measures to prevent the violation of the human 
rights of migrant children while in transit, and to train public officials to detect and treat them 
respectfully, in a sensitive and age-appropriate manner and in accordance with their international 
obligations;  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Calls upon States to ensure that migrant children, especially those who are 
unaccompanied and those who are victims of violence, exploitation, persecution and conflict, 
receive special protection and assistance, in accordance with their international obligations;  
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Encourages all States to apply a gender perspective when developing migration 
policies and programmes in order to take the necessary measures to better protect girls against 
dangers and abuse during migration; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) Urges States to ensure that repatriation mechanisms allow for the identification and 
special protection of children, and that repatriation processes fully respect the rights of the child<b> 
</b>and take into account, in conformity with their international obligations and commitments, the 
principles of the best interests of the child and non-refoulement, and family reunification; <b> 
</b></p>
<p> 4. <i>Reaffirms </i>that the arrest, imprisonment or detention of a child should be in 
conformity with the law and the international obligations of the State, and recalls in this context 
article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which provides that such measures 
should be taken only as a last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time, and urges 
States to protect effectively the rights of children affected by the detention of their parents, 
guardians or family members because of their migratory status and, in this regard: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Encourages States to consider positively alternatives to detention for children and the 
family group, when children or their parents are detained on the sole basis of their migratory 
status, recalling in this context the recommendations of human rights mechanisms that the 
treatment of irregular migration of children as a criminal offence can have a negative impact on 
the enjoyment of their human rights, and taking into account the necessary balance between the 
need to protect family unity and the best interests of the child;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Reaffirms emphatically the duty of States parties to ensure full respect for and 
observance of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, in particular with regard to the 
right of all foreign nationals, regardless of their immigration status, to communicate with a 
consular official of the sending State in the event of arrest, imprisonment, custody or detention, 
and the obligation of the receiving State to inform the foreign national without delay of his or her 
rights under the Convention;  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon </i>States of destination to protect effectively the human rights of children in 
the context of migration, without discrimination of any kind and, in this regard: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To ensure for migrant children, regardless of their legal status, the enjoyment of all 
human rights and access to health care, social services and education, on an equal basis with 
others, including through the prevention and elimination of discriminatory policies, in 
accordance with international legal obligations; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Also to ensure that every child preserves his or her identity, including nationality, 
name and family relations as recognized by law, without unlawful interference, including by 
ensuring the registration and issuance of birth certificates for every child, irrespective of his or 
her immigration status and that of his or her parents or family members; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To take all reasonable steps to avoid the difficulties associated with statelessness for 
migrant children, in line with international obligations;  
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To deal with applications to enter or leave a State for the purpose of family 
reunification in a positive, humane and expeditious manner, while ensuring that the submission 
of such requests entail no adverse consequences for the applicants and for the members of their 
family;  
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To consider the possibility of adopting immigration programmes that allow migrants 
to integrate fully into the host countries, facilitate family reunification and promote a harmonious 
and tolerant environment; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to promote and raise 
awareness of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and to 
support, as appropriate, the building of greater synergies between the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child and the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families, and to strengthen cooperation for the protection of migrant children; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
continue to elaborate and disseminate training and awareness-raising material on the rights of 
children in the context of migration, and to continue to contribute to national efforts in the 
development and implementation of policies and programmes that promote and protect their 
rights and, upon the request of States, to continue to provide assistance in the training of 
immigration officials;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Also requests </i>the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a study on challenges 
and best practices in the implementation of the international framework for the protection of the 
rights of the child in the context of migration, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, 
including States, regional organizations, civil society organizations and national human rights 
institutions, and requests that the study be available on the website of the Office prior to the 
fifteenth session of the Council, and to disseminate it to all relevant international forums.
