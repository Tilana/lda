Statements contained in this material, particularly those regarding possible or assumed future performance, costs, dividends, production levels or rates,

may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward looking statements depending on a variety of factors.
Competent Persons’ Statement
Information in this report relates to exploration results or mineral resources that are based on information compiled in the 2011 Troy Resources Limited
(Troy) annual report. The Company is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information provided in the 2011 Troy
Resources annual report and that all of the previous assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the previous announcement
have not materially changed.
The reported resource estimates are consistent with the 2004 JORC Code guidelines and are not reported in accordance with the JORC 2012 Code and a
Competent Person has not completed sufficient work to accurately classify the 2004 estimates as Mineral Resources under the JORC 2012 Code. Indeed
it is uncertain if, following further exploration, the 2004 estimates will be able to be reported as Mineral Resources in accordance with the JORC 2012
Code. The Company intends to upgrade the Mineral Resources to JORC 2012 as an integral element of the planned Prefeasibility Study.
There is a low level of geological confidence associated with Inferred Mineral Resources and there is no certainty that further exploration work will result in
the conversion of Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated Mineral Resources or that the production target itself will be realised.

Sandstone Gold Project - Summary
• Acquired a 100% interest in the Sandstone gold project in Western
Australia.
• Comprises two adjacent, granted and fully permitted Mining Leases
collectively covering 20 square kilometres.
• Mineral Resources (JORC 2004) of ~11Mt grading 1.4g/t Au for 480,000
ounces of gold, plus considerable resource and exploration upside.
600ktpa CIP gold processing plant on care & maintenance, associated 
infrastructure, spares & camps.
•
• Anticipated near-term production (Q3 2017).
• Exceptional brownfields targets associated with the Two Mile Hill
tonalite & BIF.
• Numerous greenfields exploration targets within project & stranded
third-party deposits in the district.
• Acquisition cost of A$2.5M, represents a value of US$4 per resource 
ounce, considerably below the comparable global industry average.

Location & Tenure
• Proximal to the settlement of
Sandstone, 600km northeast of 
Perth.
• Town lies on all-weather, sealed
road between the towns of Mt 
Magnet and Leinster.
• Processing facility situated 
some 12km to the south of 
Sandstone.
• Two granted (2031) Mining
Leases of 20 square km that 
pre-date Native Title; M57/128 
& M57/12920.
• Operating licence, permitted
tailings storage facility, licenced 
bore field.

Geology
• Gold mineralisation is
hosted within the Archaean 
Sandstone greenstone 
belt.
• Triangular shaped belt
within the Southern Cross 
Province that forms the 
central spine of the 
Archaean Yilgarn Block.
• Sandstone greenstone belt 
forms a classic ‘hourglass’ 
structure at the northern 
end of the Diemals Dome.
• Two major trans-current 
structures, the Edale and 
Youanmi faults, 
respectively confine the 
eastern & western margins 
of the belt.

Transaction Summary
• Headline value of A$2.5M (A$2.4M) under a binding asset sale agreement (ASA)
with Black Oak Minerals Limited (in Liquidation) (Receivers and Managers 
appointed) (Black Oak), which is to be paid as follows:-
 A$250,000 non-refundable deposit, paid 8 May 2016.
 A$1.25M at completion, paid 11 July 2016.
 A$500,000 at 18 months following completion (or $400,000 if paid before 11 October
2016).
 A$500,000 on first gold production.
• At some US$4 per resource ounce, the acquisition cost (including the $500,000 
payment predicated on production) compares very favourably with comparable 
global averages for gold assets on care & maintenance and in development.
Legacy royalties payable to Troy & Herald/National Resources Exploration.

Production Potential
• SXG completed pit optimisations
on Two Mile, Shillington & 
Shillington North deposits in 2013.
• Modelling based on treating
~500,000tpa from Shillington &
Two Mile open pit cut-backs & 
extensions.
• Average stripping ratio of ~5:1 over
an initial period ~2.5 years.
• Benign metallurgy.
• Optimisation of remaining deposits
indicates further potential mill feed.
• Drilling indicates considerable
potential to rapidly expand 
resource base.
• Sole plant within ~100km provides 
opportunity to deal on or toll-treat 
stranded, third-party deposits.
