<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 12/2, the Human Rights Council reiterated its concern at continued 
reports of intimidation and reprisals against individuals and groups who seek to cooperate, 
or have cooperated, with the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field 
of human rights. The Council condemned all acts of intimidation and reprisal by 
Governments and non-State actors against these individuals and groups. It also expressed 
deep concern at the seriousness of reported reprisals and the fact that victims suffer 
violations of their human rights, including the rights to life, to liberty and security of 
person, as well as the right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment.  
</p>
<p>2. In resolution 12/2, the Human Rights Council invited the Secretary-General to 
submit an annual report to the Council on alleged reprisals for cooperation with the United 
Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of human rights.  
</p>
<p>3.  In my statement at the opening of the twenty-first session of the Human Rights 
Council, I defined reprisals as one of the challenges faced by the Council and the United 
Nations as a whole. I also stressed that the cases of reprisals included in my reports were 
only the &#8220;tip of the iceberg&#8221;, given that far too many people are fearful of reporting 
reprisals aimed at silencing them. I further recalled that States had the responsibility to 
respect human rights and to protect those who advocate for fundamental rights; when they 
failed to do so, the United Nations had to stand up and speak out. 
</p>
<p>4. Pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 18/118, the Council convened a panel 
discussion on the issue of intimidation or reprisal against individuals and groups who 
cooperate or have cooperated with the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms 
in the field of human rights on 13 September 2012. The panel highlighted a number of 
possible measures to strengthen the response to reprisals, such as observation of trials 
involving human rights defenders; networking with non-governmental organizations; 
establishing a central registry of cases of reprisals to ensure proper follow-up; guaranteeing 
freedom of expression and the criminalization of exacerbating circumstances where human 
rights defenders were the subject of criminal activity; strengthening judicial efforts, 
combined with concrete steps to assist victims; nominating focal points at the national level 
who could act as interlocutors in cases of alleged reprisals; establishing national witness 
protection programmes; attributing a special role in the protection of individuals subjected 
to threats and harassment to national human rights institutions; and improving coordination 
between various actors, particularly with regional organizations and bodies.1  
</p>
<p>5. In their work, United Nations human rights mechanisms and the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) rely, to a large extent, on 
information from civil society actors operating on the ground. On many occasions, the High 
Commissioner and the Deputy High Commissioner have strongly condemned acts of 
reprisal and called for the protection of human rights defenders. In her statement made 
during the panel discussion on 13 September 2012, the High Commissioner underlined the 
fact that the cooperation of individuals and groups with the United Nations in the field of 
human rights in a free and safe manner was a key factor in ensuring an efficient approach to 
the promotion and protection of human rights, and regretted that responses by States had 
been insufficient.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 See A/HRC/22/34. </p>


<p>6. The role of the President of the Human Rights Council is described as ensuring that 
the Council proceeds with the appropriate level of dignity and respect in its work to 
promote and protect human rights, which implies that Members of the Council and all 
observers, including non-governmental organizations, must be able to contribute freely to 
the Council&#8217;s work. When incidents of harassment of civil society representatives are 
raised, the President reacts, including through public statements, meetings and exchanges of 
letters, with the delegations of the States concerned. Such actions are consistent with the 
outcome of the review of the Council2 and necessary to preserve its credibility. At the 
above-mentioned panel discussion, the former President expressed her satisfaction at the 
fact that the Council had reacted to unacceptable acts of reprisal or intimidation. In the view 
of the President, the Council should remain a place where all voices, even dissenting ones, 
may be heard, and it is the Council&#8217;s responsibility to ensure that all individuals 
participating in its meetings and cooperating with it are safe from intimidation and 
reprisals.3 At the end of the twenty-third session, the President emphasized that, as stressed 
by many delegations, any acts of intimidation or reprisal against individuals and groups 
who cooperate or have cooperated with the United Nations and its representatives were 
unacceptable and must end. Referring to the outcome of the review of the Council in 2011, 
he urged States to prevent and ensure adequate protection against such acts. 
</p>
<p>7. Special procedures have raised reprisals-related issues in many of their reports 
submitted to, and during interactive dialogues with, the Human Rights Council. During the 
above-mentioned panel discussion, the Chairman of the Coordination Committee of Special 
Procedures described some measures developed by special procedures, individually and 
jointly, to address reprisals. He suggested that any reprisal against a witness cooperating 
with a mandate holder should be treated as an attempt to undermine the mandate itself, and 
consequently called for a rapid and systematic response from States Members of the 
Council. The Chairman also stated that the Chairperson of the Coordination Committee 
should be able to intervene immediately and publicly in cases of intimidation or reprisal 
brought to his or her attention by a mandate holder. He also called for more systematic 
follow-up on cases raised in the communications and reports of special procedures.  
</p>
<p>8. With regard to action by human rights treaty bodies, in November 2012, the 
Committee against Torture designated two rapporteurs on reprisals. The Subcommittee on 
the Prevention of Torture continues to pay attention to the question of reprisals, in 
particular in the context of its field visits, and the prohibition of reprisals is systematically 
raised by the Subcommittee with relevant authorities (prior to and during visits, and as a 
follow-up to visits). At its sixteenth session, in February 2012, the Subcommittee decided 
to establish an ad hoc working group on the issue of reprisals, which is currently drafting a 
policy paper on the issue that will be published shortly. During the above-mentioned panel 
discussion , the Chairperson of the Committee against Torture emphasized the importance 
of preventing reprisals and of creating an environment in which everybody was able to 
enjoy and uphold human rights. 
</p><p>9. During the general debate under agenda item 5 (&#8220;Human rights bodies and 
mechanisms&#8221;) at the twenty-second session of the Human Rights Council, a group of 56 
States, led by Hungary, issued a statement expressing appreciation for the strong stance 
against reprisals taken by the Secretary-General, the High Commissioner, successive 
Presidents of the Council and by human rights mechanisms. In the statement, the States 
highlighted the recommendations made during the above-mentioned panel discussion, and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
  See General Assembly resolution 65/281, annex. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 Ibid., paras 11-12. </p>


<p>stressed that the summary of the discussion should be considered a road map to guide 
further action on this issue. They also emphasized that more coordination was needed 
among United Nations bodies and mechanisms in reacting to reprisals, which should also 
be addressed systematically in the framework of the universal periodic review, the treaty 
bodies and the special procedures. 
</p>
<p>10. The Executive Director of the East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders 
Project, Shire Sheikh Ahmed, stressed during the above-mentioned panel discussion that 
since States do not always live up to their responsibility to ensure the safety of those who 
cooperate with the United Nations, practical responses to assist victims had been developed 
by civil society, drawing largely on the work of existing organizations and networks that 
support human rights defenders who face threats as a result of their work. These include the 
temporary evacuation and relocation of persons at risk, trial observation, the provision of 
legal assistance, the implementation of practical security measures, and public and private 
advocacy to raise awareness of violations or to seek solutions through private dialogue. In 
this context, he pointed to the contribution of networks in responding to and preventing 
reprisals.4 Civil society has an equally important role to play in ensuring that cases of 
intimidation and reprisals are brought to the attention of the relevant mechanisms. In this 
context, a new tool has been developed by the International Service for Human Rights to 
provide guidance to civil society organizations on possible responses to alleged reprisals.5  
</p>
<p>11. Given that non-governmental organizations with consultative status with the 
Economic and Social Council have privileged access to the Human Rights Council and 
other United Nations mechanisms, it is critical that the Committee on Non-Governmental 
Organizations apply the criteria for assessing the said organizations in a transparent and fair 
manner, and process applications in a timely fashion. At its 2013 resumed session, held 
from 20 to 29 May and on 7 June 2013, the Committee had before it 426 applications for 
consultative status, including applications deferred from previous sessions. Of the 
organizations submitting applications, the Committee recommended 161 for consultative 
status, deferred 219 for further consideration at its regular session in 2014, closed 
consideration without prejudice of 45 applications that had failed to respond to queries over 
two consecutive sessions, and took note of one organization withdrawing its application.6 
Several stakeholders have raised concerns about the regularly large number of deferrals and 
the widely perceived lack of transparency in making decisions about conferring 
consultative status. 
</p>
<p>12. I have observed a disturbing trend apparently directed at reducing the space for civil 
society. This can be seen in restrictive legislative amendments to laws on freedom of 
association and in constraints in an increasing number of national laws and procedures that 
render the receipt of funds from abroad more complicated or impossible. Over the past two 
years, the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture and the United Nations 
Voluntary Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery have experienced increasing problems 
in disbursing grants to non-governmental organizations through which they channel direct 
assistance to victims, in accordance with the mandate entrusted to them by the General 
Assembly. In at least three countries, regulations apparently in place make it difficult for 
banks to receive money transfers from abroad, and additional measures have had to be 
taken by the funds to ensure that payments reached their grantees. In addition, I note with 
concern that, in several instances, those receiving funds from abroad are subjected to

<p>increased scrutiny, sometimes amounting to harassment, by State authorities. In some cases, 
the fact that civil society organizations cannot receive funds from abroad effectively 
prevents them from participating in sessions of treaty bodies or of the universal periodic 
review.  
</p>
<p>13. In the above connection, Human Rights Council resolution 22/6 on the protection of 
human rights defenders, co-sponsored by more than 70 States, must be highlighted. In that 
resolution, the Council unequivocally reaffirmed the right of everyone, individual or in 
association with others, to unhindered access to, and communication with, international 
bodies, in particular the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field of 
human rights. In resolution 22/6, the Council called upon States to refrain from any act of 
intimidation or reprisal against those who cooperate or seek to cooperate with international 
institutions, including the United Nations, in the field of human rights.  
</p>
<p>14. The United Nations has also received a number of allegations of acts of intimidation 
and reprisal as a result of cooperation with regional organizations. While Human Rights 
Council resolution 12/2 does not explicitly cover cooperation with regional organizations, 
this is of deep concern. I call upon relevant actors to ensure a consistent approach by all 
regional and international human rights mechanisms vis-&#224;-vis these grave violations of 
international human rights norms. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Information received on cases of reprisal for cooperation 
with the United Nations, its representatives and mechanisms 
in the field of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Methodological framework 
</b></p>
<p>15. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 12/2, the present report 
contains information regarding acts of intimidation or reprisal against those who: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Seek to cooperate, or have cooperated with, the United Nations, its representatives 
and mechanisms in the field of human rights, or who have provided testimony or 
information to them 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Avail or have availed themselves of procedures established under the auspices of the 
United Nations for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and all those 
who have provided legal or other<b> </b>assistance to them for this purpose 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Submit or have submitted communications under procedures established by human 
rights instruments, and all those who have provided legal or other assistance to them for 
this purpose<b> 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; Are relatives of victims of human rights violations or of those who have provided 
legal or other assistance to victims 
</p>
<p>16. The present report covers the period from 16 June 2012 to 15 June 2013. The 
information received was cross-checked, whenever possible, with primary sources; 
otherwise, allegations were assessed for reliability and consistency and corroborated 
through multiple sources. In cases where victims of reprisals or their representatives have 
been in contact with the United Nations, including its mechanisms, in the field of human 
rights, reference is made to relevant follow-up action, including relevant correspondence. 
</p>
<p>17. It was not possible to include certain cases in the present report, particularly when 
the risk that public reporting would have entailed for the concerned victims of reprisal was 
assessed as being too high; the acts of intimidation or reprisal against individuals or groups </p>


<p>who seek to cooperate or have cooperated with the United Nations, its representatives and 
mechanisms in the field of human rights that have been included in the present report 
represent therefore only a small sample of the cases that are likely to have occurred.  
</p>
<p>18. During the period under review, information was received about acts of intimidation 
or reprisal following cooperation with OHCHR, the Human Rights Council, special 
procedures, human rights treaty bodies, the universal periodic review mechanism, the 
United Nations Commission on the Status of Women and United Nations peace missions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Summary of cases 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Bahrain 
</b></p>
<p>19. In a communication sent on 18 October 2012,7 the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of expression and opinion and the Special Rapporteur on 
the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association raised allegations that, following 
the twenty-first session of the Human Rights Council, the newspaper <i>Al-Watan</i> published, 
on 25 September 2012, the names and photographs of participants in the universal periodic 
review of Bahrain, including Mohammed Al-Maskati, Maryam Al-Khawaja, Dr. Nada 
Dhaif, Dr. Mondher Alkhoor, Jalila Al-Salman and Said Yousif, who were accused of 
&#8220;discrediting Bahrain in Geneva&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>20.  In addition, on 16 October 2012, Mr. Al-Maskati was reportedly summoned to Al-
Hoora Police Station for interrogation, detained overnight and charged the next day with 
&#8220;rioting and participating in an illegal assembly&#8221;.8 In response, the Government affirmed 
that Mr. Al-Maskati had been summonsed to appear on 16 October 2012 for questioning 
about charges of riotous assembly and participation in an unlicensed march, under article 
178 of the Bahraini Criminal Code. While in the police station, he was not under arrest or in 
detention, but stayed for the time necessary for his statement to be taken and for him to 
complete evidence procedures and the preliminary report for his appearance before the 
public prosecutor.9  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Colombia 
</b></p>
<p>21. The allegations received indicated that Carlos Yamil Paez Diaz, a land restitution 
leader who worked for the organization Tierra y Vida y Forjando Futuros,  on 4 July 2012, 
was threatened by the &#8220;Anti-restitution Army&#8221; in a pamphlet against human rights 
defenders active in his area of work. On 6 July 2012, the OHCHR Colombia office issued a 
press release on that threat;10 one week later, Mr. Paez received a handwritten death threat 
against himself and his family. Since then, he has benefited from a protection scheme 
comprising an armoured car and two bodyguards, with an additional bodyguard being 
added after the threat. While initially these measures were applied only during the day, 
following an intervention by OHCHR Colombia, the National Protection Unit under the 
Ministry of the Interior agreed that one of the escorts would provide night shift coverage.

<p><b> 3. Democratic Republic of the Congo  
</b></p>
<p>22.  On 28 August 2012, Pierre-Sosth&#232;ne Kambidi, Chief Editor at Radio-T&#233;l&#233; 
Chr&#233;tienne in Kananga, Kasa&#239; occidental province, was arrested by agents of the National 
Intelligence Agency, two policemen and four civilians following an order of the 4th 
Military Region Commander. Mr. Kambidi was not informed about the charges against 
him, but was eventually charged for &#8220;troop demoralization&#8221; and &#8220;participation in an 
insurrectional movement&#8221; under article 206 of the Penal Code in relation to a broadcast he 
had made on a &#8220;deserter&#8221;. In the night of 29 August 2012, he was reportedly severely 
beaten up with a truncheon. The following day, Mr. Kambidi was transferred to the 
National Intelligence Agency in Kinshasa. 
</p>
<p>23. During a visit by the Joint Human Rights Office of the  United Nations Organization 
Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on 26 September 2012, Mr. 
Kambidi denounced the acts of ill-treatment to the OHCHR team, and was later reportedly 
subjected again to ill-treatment. Mr. Kambide remained in detention with the National 
Intelligence Agency in Kinshasha until 15 December 2012, when he was released.11  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Iran (Islamic Republic of) 
</b>24. Allegations of reprisals against individuals who contacted the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran were received during the 
period under review. In one such case, Mohammad Nour-Zehi, Abdolwahab Ansari and 
Massoum Ali Zehi, all nationals of Afghanistan, were reportedly subjected to torture and 
threats of execution by hanging for allegedly submitting a list of executed Afghans to the 
Special Rapporteur. The incident allegedly occurred in mid-November 2012 in Ghezal 
Hessar Prison, where officials of the Ministry of ntelligence interrogated the accused for 
hours, using also torture and threats of execution.12  
</p>
<p>25. In addition, Ahmad Tamouee, Yousef Kakeh Meimi, Jahangir Badouzadeh, Ali 
Ahmad Soleiman and Mostafa Ali Ahmad, members of the Kurdish community currently 
held in Orumiyeh Prison, were charged with &#8220;contacting the office of the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran&#8221;, &#8220;reporting 
prison news to human rights organizations&#8221;, &#8220;propaganda against the system inside prison&#8221; 
and &#8220;contacting Nawroz TV&#8221;. On 11 October 2012, the five prisoners were reportedly 
transferred to a Ministry of Intelligence detention centre, where they were interrogated and 
kept in solitary confinement for two months. During their interrogation, they were allegedly 
severely tortured, threatened and denied contact with their families and lawyers. On 11 
December 2012, they were individually transferred to Branch One of the Orumiyeh 
Revolutionary Court, where Mr. Tamouee was tried on charges of &#8220;contacting the office of 
the Special Rapporteur&#8221; and &#8221;reporting prison news to human rights organizations and 
media abroad&#8221;. The other four were questioned and informed that they would face charges 
of &#8220;propaganda against the regime in favour of PJAK Party inside Orumiyeh Prison&#8221; and 
contact with [the Kurdish language television station] Nawroz TV&#8221;.13 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Maldives  
</b></p>
<p>26.  At its one-hundred-and-fifth session, in July 2012, the Human Rights Committee 
was informed of threats made to members of non-governmental organizations who had 
provided reports to the Committee on the situation of human rights in Maldives. In 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11
 The case was raised with the Government several times, including in letters sent to the National 
</p>
<p>Intelligence Agency by the Joint Human Rights Office on 16 November 2012 and 18 January 2013.

<p>response, the Committee stated that some civil society representatives had expressed 
concern about threats, including death threats, made against colleagues who had submitted 
reports to the Committee.14 While the Committee did not impute any such action to the 
current Government, it stated that it would be very grateful if the Government could 
reaffirm its determination to protect civil society. The State party responded that such 
reports were a matter of grave concern and that the law enforcement authorities would 
undertake a full investigation of any threats to representatives of civil society. The 
Government would offer protection to all citizens, regardless of their political beliefs; it 
also pointed out that, in recent months, for example, it had provided close personal 
protection, including bodyguards, to members of the opposition.15 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Morocco 
</b></p>
<p>27. On 20 September 2012, during an official visit to Morocco, the Special Rapporteur 
on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment interviewed Ali 
Aarrass in Sal&#233; I Prison, in Rabat. The forensic doctor accompanying the Special 
Rapporteur examined marks on Mr. Aarrass&#8217;s body and observed that, although he was 
unable to identify them unequivocally as signs of torture, they were clearly compatible with 
the allegations of ill-treatment made by Mr. Aarrass. According to information submitted to 
the Special Rapporteur, following that meeting, Mr. Aarrass was transferred to Sal&#233; II 
Prison, where a prison guard reportedly harassed him to make him relate the details of his 
discussions with the Special Rapporteur. On 21 September 2012, Mr. Aarrass allegedly 
filed a complaint against the said prison guard with the prison authorities. On the following 
day, the prison authorities reportedly threatened and pressured Mr. Aarrass to withdraw his 
complaint, which he eventually did. The harassment and threats, including of rape and 
making his life in prison impossible, however, reportedly continued.16 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Philippines 
</b></p>
<p>28. Secretary-General of Panalidan! Mindanao, a network of environmental and land 
rights defenders and Benedictine nun based in Mati, Davao Oriental, in Mindanao, Stella 
Matutina is involved in grass-roots education and advocacy, and lobbying efforts to defend 
indigenous communities from commercial logging and large-scale mining projects. 
Panalidan! also supports environmental rights defenders who receive death threats and are 
victims of acts of harassment because of their human rights activities. It is alleged that Ms. 
Matutina has been subjected to several incidents of threat and harassment and that, since 
she was a member of the Philippine UPR Watch delegation to discuss the human rights 
situation in Mindanao in the context of a side event during the nineteenth session of the 
Human Rights Council, members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines accuse Ms. 
Matutina of being a member of the New People&#8217;s Army,  the armed wing of the communist 
party.17 
</p>
<p><b> 8. Russian Federation  
</b></p>
<p>29. Several United Nations human rights experts have raised concerns about the law on 
non-governmental organizations adopted in November 2012, under which all foreign-
funded non-commercial organizations may be branded as &#8220;foreign agents&#8221; if they are 
considered to have engaged in &#8220;political activities&#8221;. They also referred to the use of the 
term &#8220;foreign agents&#8221;, which can lead to increased stigmatization and vulnerability to acts

<p>of violence against those targeted.18 No government response had been received as at the 
end of the period under review. Similar concerns were raised by a number of States during 
the recent universal periodic review of the Russian Federation.19  
</p>
<p>30. Similarly, in November 2012, the Committee against Torture expressed its concern 
about individuals, groups, human rights defenders and journalists subjected to intimidation, 
harassment and all types of violence related to their activities, including for communicating 
with or giving information to the Committee or other United Nations human rights bodies. 
The Committee recommended that the State party should amend the law in question, that no 
individual or group should be subjected to prosecution for communicating with or for 
providing information to United Nations human rights mechanisms, and that all allegations 
of intimidation, threat, attack and killing of human rights defenders be investigated 
promptly, thoroughly and impartially.20 
</p>
<p>31. The Committee against Torture addressed two allegations letters and made a public 
statement, referring to allegations that two non-governmental organizations &#8211; the Anti-
Discrimination Centre Memorial in Saint Petersburg and the Public Verdict Foundation in 
Moscow &#8211; that provided information to the Committee in December 2012 during 
consideration of the fifth periodic report of the Russian Federation to the Committee had 
since faced reprisals. The organizations were charged by the public prosecutor with 
violating legislation under which non-profit organizations involved in political activity 
must register as &#8220;foreign agents&#8221; if they receive money from abroad. The Committee 
recalled that reprisals contravene article 13 of the Convention.21

<p><b> 9. Saudi Arabia 
</b></p>
<p>32. According to information received, on 9 March 2013, the Riyadh Specialized 
Criminal Court sentenced Abdullah Al Hamid, co-founder of the Saudi Association for 
Civil and Political Rights, which campaigns against arbitrary detention, to six years of 
imprisonment for, inter alia, having provided false information to external sources, 
including human rights mechanisms of the United Nations. Mr. Al Hamid is now serving a 
term of 11 years in prison, following the partial reinstatement by the court of a seven-year 
sentence handed down in 2005 for an offence for which Mr Al Hamid had later been 
pardoned by the King, with a subsequent travel ban. At the same time, the court ordered the 
dissolution of the Association, the confiscation of its property and the closure of its social 
media accounts on the grounds that it had failed to obtain an official licence to operate.22

<p>33.  According to information received, Mazen Darwish, Director of the Syrian Centre 
for Media and Freedom of Expression, based in Damascus, and Hussayn Gharir, Hani 
Zitani, Abdelrahman Alhamade and Mansour Al-Omari, all arrested on 16 February 2012 
during a raid on the Centre, reportedly spent more than nine months in incommunicado 
detention at the Air Force Intelligence detention centre at Al Mazza military airport, from

 A/HRC/24/21, communication of 27 March 2013  </p>


<p>Prison in Adra. While held, all five were allegedly subjected to inhuman treatment and 
were forced to endure extremely poor conditions of detention.  
</p>
<p>34. On 27 February 2013, the above-mentioned five individuals were reportedly charged 
with &#8220;promoting terrorist acts&#8221; by the investigative judge of the Anti-Terrorism Court in 
Damascus under article 8 of the Anti-Terrorism Law of 2012. It is alleged that the list of 
offences published by the investigative judge of the Court included &#8220;documenting the 
names of those detained, disappeared, wanted or killed&#8221; in the context of the Syrian 
conflict, &#8220;communicating with international organizations with the aim of having the 
international community condemn Syria&#8221; and &#8220;publishing studies on the human rights and 
media situation in Syria&#8221;. It appears that &#8220;communicating with international organizations 
with the aim of having the international community condemn Syria&#8221; may relate to, inter 
alia, the granting of consultative status to the Syrian Centre for Media and Freedom of 
Expression by the Economic and Social Council in 2010 and the organization&#8217;s subsequent 
cooperation with various United Nations human rights mechanisms. It is reported that Mr. 
Alhamade and Mr. Al-Omari were released pending trial.23 
</p>
<p>35. As I pointed out in a report submitted to the Security Council,24 the monitoring and 
reporting work of the United Nations Supervision Mission in the Syrian Arab Republic 
(UNSMIS), established by the Council by its resolution 2043 (2012), was hampered by the 
stated perception of some Syrian civilians that they risked retaliation by government forces 
following interaction with UNSMIS. In this context, particularly during the latter stages of 
its deployment, the Mission documented at least one occasion on which local civilians were 
explicitly threatened by government security forces and ordered not to speak to United 
Nations observers, while on other occasions, civilians, including some seeking treatment in 
hospitals, specifically indicated they would not speak to observers out to fear of 
government retaliation. In addition, some individuals claimed to have been detained days 
after having interacted with UNSMIS. UNSMIS also reported a number of incidents where 
its personnel were requested not to visit specific towns or villages because of perceived 
security risks and the implications for the civilian population. Another issue of concern 
with regard to visits conducted by UNSMIS was the reported fear of some communities 
located in opposition-controlled areas that they would be shelled after UNSMIS observers 
concluded patrols in a nearby area. 
</p>
<p><b> 11. Tajikistan  
</b>36. Attention has also been drawn to the closing of the Association of Young Lawyers 
of Tajikistan (Amparo), a leading organization that provides free legal aid, human rights 
education and training, following a decision of the Khujand City Court of 24 October 2012.  
37. Amparo had been actively engaged with United Nations human rights mechanisms, 
particularly on issues relating to torture and ill-treatment. This engagement included the 
recent participation by some of its members in the preparation by the Coalition against 
Torture of a non-governmental report submitted to the Committee against Torture before 
the consideration of the second periodic report of Tajikistan by the Committee on 7 and 8 
November 2012. Members of Amparo also met with the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment during his official visit to the 
country in May 2012, to provide him with information on the prevalence of abuse of 
recruits and the practice of hazing in the military.

 S/2012/523, para. 55. </p>


<p>38.  With regard to the closing of Amparo, a number of special procedures mandate 
holders raised concerns about the lack of procedural safeguards, including the fact that 
Amparo had reportedly never received a copy of the audit initiated by the Ministry of 
Justice in July 2012 on the basis of which it was closed, and had not been able to comment 
thereon. It was also reported that the Ministry of Justice had issued internal instructions that 
were allegedly not published, and did not provide procedural guidelines for audits to the 
judge concerned.25 No government response had been received as at the end of the period 
under review.  
</p>
<p><b> 12. United Arab Emirates 
</b></p>
<p>39.  Allegations relating to the fairness of the trial and the treatment in detention of 94 
civil society actors calling for change in a peaceful way in March 2013 and the 
developments leading up to their trial were raised in a series of communications by several 
special procedures mandate holders, the latest of which is dated 16 April 2013. In its 
response, the Government called these allegations &#8220;far removed from the truth and 
unfounded in virtually every detail&#8221;. 26 In particular, the allegations pertaining to torture, 
physical abuse and beatings were categorically denied.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Follow-up information on cases included in previous reports 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Colombia  
</b></p>
<p>40. Further to the information included in my previous report regarding John Fredy 
Ortiz Jimenez,27 who in 2008 had given testimony on the modus operandi of the &#8220;false 
positives&#8221; and who had been forced to leave the protection programme of the Attorney 
General&#8217;s Office because the latter refused to include members of his family in the 
programme, despite requests by OHCHR Colombia, new information received indicates 
that, in December 2012, several people stopped Mr. Ortiz Jimenez in the centre of the city 
of Barranquilla and attempted to abduct him. Further, on 13 May 2013, while Mr. Ortiz 
Jimenez was driving to a store in Barranquilla, he was reportedly approached by two people 
who threatened his daughter and nephew. The National Protection Unit undertook a risk 
study on his situation at the end of 2012, concluding that the risk was &#8220;extraordinary&#8221;. 
Since mid-January 2013, the Unit has provided him with a bulletproof vest, a 
communications device and a transportation allowance. The police also carry out patrols 
around his home. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Iran (Islamic Republic of) 
</b>41.  Further to the information included in my previous report,28 Maryam Bahrman, a 
women&#8217;s rights activist and member of the One Million Signatures campaign, was tried by 
the Revolutionary Court of Shiraz on 15 September 2012. In December, Ms. Bahrman was 
sentenced to a suspended prison term of eight months on charges of propaganda against the 
State, but was acquitted of the charges of &#8220;insulting the leader&#8221; and &#8220;the founder of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran&#8221;. On 20 May 2013, she was fined for having defamed the 
President and other State officials and for having spread misinformation about the system 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Her arrest and prosecution appear to have been linked to

in New York in March 2011.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Saudi Arabia 
</b></p>
<p>42. Further to the information contained in my previous report on Mohammad Fahad 
Al-Qahtani,29 lawyer and co-founder and President of the Saudi Association for Civil and 
Political Rights, which campaigns against arbitrary detention, it was reported that, on 9 
March 2013, the Riyadh Criminal Court sentenced him to 10 years of imprisonment and a 
10-year travel ban for, inter alia, having provided false information to outside sources, 
including the human rights mechanisms of the United Nations.30  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Sri Lanka  
</b></p>
<p>43. In previous reports I made reference to the climate of fear that human rights 
defenders experience in Sri Lanka.31 During the twenty-second session of the Human 
Rights Council, the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka circulated a letter, in which it described 
the screening of a film about Sri Lanka by non-governmental organizations as:  
</p>
<p>efforts on the part of entities based overseas with links to rump elements of the LTTE 
[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam], as well as certain non-governmental organizations with 
accreditation by the Economic and Social Council, in facilitating programmes containing 
unsubstantiated material that is morphed and diabolical. This approach [&#8230;] serves to 
strengthen the rump elements of the LTTE seeking refuge in the West, who use the 
propaganda value derived from the screening of this film as a tool to intensify their 
fundraising and recruitment activities, thereby undermining the process of reconciliation in 
Sri Lanka. 32  
</p>
<p>Such statements could have the effect of undermining the work of human rights defenders 
monitoring the situation of human rights in Sri Lanka.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>44. The case of Bushra Gamar Hussein, chairperson of the Human Rights and 
Development Organisation, was included in my previous report, where it was alleged that 
he had been arrested and tortured in connection with his work in defence of human rights.33 
In a letter dated 3 July 2012, the Government of the Sudan declared that the Attorney 
General had decided to close the case of Mr. Hussein owing to &#8220;insufficiency of the 
evidence&#8221;.34  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Uzbekistan  
</b></p>
<p>45.  Further to information included in my previous reports with regard to Erkin 
Musaev,35 the Government of Uzbekistan stated that the allegations of poor conditions of 
detention in Uzbekistan, and of Mr. Musaev's situation in particular, were not justified. It 
added that, throughout his imprisonment, Mr. Musaev had never been subjected to torture, 
ill-treatment, degrading treatment or any other violent acts by penitentiary staff, and that the 
conditions under which sentences were served in the correctional facilities of the Ministry

established by the Ministry.36 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) 
</b>46. According to updated information on Judge Mar&#237;a Lourdes Afiuni, whose case was 
mentioned in my three most recent relevant reports,37 she was subjected to assault, acts of 
intimidation and rape by a government agent, which resulted in pregnancy and a 
miscarriage while in detention.38 Her trial began in November 2012 after former President 
Hugo Ch&#225;vez amended the Penal Code by means of an enabling law (<i>ley habilitante</i>) so 
that trials could be held in the absence of the accused. Judge Afiuni, in consultation with 
her legal counsel, had indicated that she would not enter the trial chamber to challenge 
violations of her right to due process. On 14 June 2013, a court in Caracas revoked her 
house arrest on health grounds after a request was received from the Attorney General. The 
terms of Judge Afiuni&#8217;s release require her to report to the court every 15 days, and forbid 
her to leave the country and speak to the media. The trial continues. 
</p>
<p>47.  Judge Afiuni was arrested on 10 December 2009 after she ordered the conditional 
release of an individual whose detention the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
considered arbitrary. President Chavez reportedly publicly demanded that she be sentenced 
to 30 years of imprisonment. In September 2010, the Working Group, in its opinion No. 
20/2010, concluded that the detention of Judge Afiuni was arbitrary.39 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>48. On 14 February 2013, five United Nations special procedures mandate holders 
issued a public statement in which they urged the Government of the Bolivarian Republic 
of Venezuela to free Judge Afiuni, and called for investigations into her most recent 
allegations.40 They noted that Judge Afiuni had been in detention for more than three years, 
despite the fact that article 230 of the Penal Code established that detention could not 
exceed the limit of the minimum sentence of the most serious crime of which the person 
was accused, which would be three years. No response from the Government had been 
received as at the end of the period under review.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>49.<b> The present report clearly illustrates that, regrettably, reprisals against persons 
cooperating with the United Nations, its mechanisms and representatives in the field 
of human rights continue. They take many forms, ranging from smear campaigns, 
threats, travel bans, harassment, fines, the closing of organizations, sexual violence, 
arbitrary arrests, prosecutions and lengthy prison sentences through to torture, ill-
treatment and even death. Many of the cases remain unresolved for lengthy periods.  
</b></p>
<p>50.<b> In my statement of 13 September 2012, on the occasion of the opening of the 
twenty-first session of the Human Rights Council, during which a panel discussion on 
reprisals was held, I referred to reprisals as one of the main challenges faced by the 
Council and the United Nations. I reiterate that reprisals and intimidation against 
individuals cooperating with the United Nations in the field of human rights are

<p><b>unacceptable not only because they target individuals who help us do our work as 
mandated under the Charter of the United Nations, but also because they ultimately 
aim to discourage others from advocating for respect for human rights, and put them 
at risk.  
</b></p>
<p>51.<b>  I have also highlighted the need to ensure that persecution and intimidation are 
systematically condemned, and that legal action is taken by those responsible. Several 
recommendations addressed to various stakeholders, including States, the United 
Nations, human rights mechanisms, civil society and national human rights 
institutions were made at the end of the above-mentioned panel discussion. I hope that 
these recommendations, among others, will serve as a road map for action against 
reprisals.  
</b></p>
<p>52.<b>  It is primarily the obligation of States to protect those who cooperate with the 
United Nations in the field of human rights and to ensure that they may do so safely 
and without hindrance. In this context, I reiterate my previous recommendations for 
action at the national level, including through the adoption of appropriate legislation, 
by publicly condemning acts of reprisal and intimidation, ensuring accountability in 
relation to the majority of reported cases of reprisal, conducting effective and 
impartial investigations and bringing perpetrators to justice, and providing victims 
with remedies. I also encourage States to respond to allegations of intimidation and 
reprisal, and to cooperate with the United Nations regarding such acts. 
</b></p>
<p>53.<b>  The international community should act to address cases of reprisal in a 
coherent and systematic manner and use the various tools it has at its disposal. 
International and regional human rights mechanisms are crucial in this context, and I 
welcome their enhanced coordination. The panel discussion addressed some 
recommendations specifically for the United Nations Secretariat, such as:  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>To make information on how to submit allegations of reprisals more accessible  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The creation of a central database on cases of reprisals  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The appointment of a mediator or ombudsman to act as a focal point of the 
United Nations system for cases of intimidation and reprisal  
</b></p>
<p><b>These should be thoroughly examined and considered.  
</b></p>
<p>54.<b>  I commend the Human Rights Council for adopting resolution 22/6, in which it 
took a strong stance in support of a safe and enabling environment for human rights 
defenders. The resolution is instrumental in the response of the United Nations to 
reprisals. The idea that the Council hold a discussion dedicated to reprisals on an 
annual basis has received considerable support. I strongly encourage the Council to 
discuss the present report under its agenda item 5. This would allow for the 
continuation of dialogue that began during the panel discussion held at the twenty-
first session, and a further exchange of good practices, and give all stakeholders, in 
particular States, the opportunity to comment on the allegations contained in the 
report, including on actions taken to investigate and resolve the cases in question. I 
also call upon the Council to follow up on cases of reprisal, as proposed at the 
International Expert Conference on Advancing the Protection of Human Rights: 
Achievements, Challenges and Perspectives, held in Vienna on 27 and 28 June 2013.</b>41<b>

<p>55.<b> As reiterated at the above-mentioned Conference, the need to protect human 
rights defenders against undue interference and reprisals, including ensuring their 
rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly and their access to funding, 
persists. Many of us, in particular those seeking to advance human rights within the 
United Nations, rely on their work. I thank civil society organizations for their tireless 
and dedicated work. I also thank them for contributing to the present report, and 
encourage them to continue to do so.
