</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation reported that considerable progress had been made in the 
implementation of obligations undertaken by Turkmenistan in the framework of the 
universal periodic review. Changes had been made in legislation to bring it in line with 
international standards and reforms had been carried out in various areas under the 
leadership of the President of Turkmenistan. The national economy had been developing 
and investments in science, education, health, culture and social infrastructure had been 
increased. The delegation expressed confidence that constructive dialogue in the working 
group would enable the Government to enhance further the progress in promoting the 
progressive realization of human rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation noted the efforts of Turkmenistan at the international level and its 
active participation and enhanced role in the work of a number of international 
organizations, including the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the United 
Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). During the reporting period 
Turkmenistan acceded to a number of international human rights instruments, including the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and its Optional Protocol 
(OP-CRPD), and the 1954 and 1961 Conventions on statelessness. </p>


<p>7. The delegation stated that the National Commission on the improvement of 
legislation had developed recommendations to improve existing legislation and draft new 
laws and regulations by taking into account provisions of the international human rights 
treaties ratified by Turkmenistan. The Parliament had also taken measures to ensure the 
conformity of the newly adopted and amended laws with international law. The delegation 
pointed to several new laws that were adopted in the framework of reforms, including the 
Criminal Procedural Code and the Family Code, which incorporated the provisions of the 
relevant international human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation pointed out that the Government had paid heightened attention to the 
penitentiary system. Renovation work had been carried out in the penitentiary institutions 
and the construction of a new women&#8217;s prison would finish in 2013. Medical infrastructure 
had been improved in prisons and production units had been created to provide new job 
opportunities for prisoners. Substantial State budget allocations had been made for these 
efforts. The Government, in cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross 
(ICRC) in Central Asia, had been implementing a plan of action within the framework of 
multilateral cooperation in the penitentiary system. According to the Plan, humanitarian 
visits by ICRC representatives to penitentiary institutions had been carried out since 2011.  
Monitoring by ICRC found that conditions in juvenile correctional facilities met the 
international standards. The Government had been studying the possibility of accession to 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OP-CAT). 
</p>
<p>9. Long-term strategic development objectives were defined in a number of policy 
documents, including the National Programme on Social and Economic Development for 
2011-2030 and the National Programme of the President of Turkmenistan on changes to 
social conditions in villages, cities and regional centres for the period until 2020. The main 
objective of the latter was to provide people living in rural areas with high quality social 
and employment conditions similar to urban standards. During the period 2008-2012, 
US$4.8 billion were allocated from the State budget to carry out large projects in rural 
areas. New housing units, schools, medical institutions, cultural and sport centres had been 
constructed as part of those projects. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation stated that various measures, including the construction of new 
medical and sport centres, and the modernization of medical equipment had been carried 
out to provide quality health care and ensure the well-being of the population, as those 
remained priority areas under State policy. The Government cooperated with international 
organizations, including the World Health Organization and United Nations Children&#8217;s 
Fund (UNICEF). The reform in the education system had been carried out in accordance 
with the Presidential Decree of 2013, which transformed the school education system from 
a 10-year to a 12-year system. 
</p>
<p>11. The delegation stated that the Government had taken measures to create an 
information-telecommunication infrastructure as well as legal, organizational and financial 
conditions for the development of an information society. Science and education 
institutions had been fully equipped with computers. Multimedia centres and school and 
university students had studied information technology subjects. An e-Governance system 
had been introduced in the public administration system. Internet services had been made 
accessible to citizens and educational institutions had been connected to the internet 
network. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation highlighted the fact that Turkmenistan had experienced 11 per cent 
economic growth in the past five years, which had led to a steady increase in gross 
domestic product (GDP) per capita. In 2012, GDP per capita had exceeded the standard 
threshold for countries with an average high level of income. Furthermore, the 2012 
population census documented positive changes in the living standards and housing 
conditions of the population. During the economic crisis Turkmenistan had not renounced </p>


<p>any of its social obligations. The salaries of public workers, pensions and social benefits 
had increased and the Government continued to provide privileges to cover housing, 
utilities, transportation and communication costs, and free-of-charge electricity, natural gas, 
water and salt, as well as fuel subsidies to private car owners. Additional budget allocations 
for salaries and academic payments had been introduced to boost scientific innovation and 
strengthen the scientific capacity of the country. 
</p>
<p>13. The delegation stated that the Government had taken measures to strengthen its 
reporting to the treaty bodies of the United Nations. The Interdepartmental Commission on 
the implementation of international human rights obligations had organized various events 
with the objective of studying international best practices and experiences in the protection 
of human rights and freedoms. The Interdepartmental Commission maintained an active 
dialogue with the Regional Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), 
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), UNICEF, the United Nations 
Population Fund (UNFPA), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) and other agencies of the United Nations, concerning the preparation 
of national reports, implementation of recommendations of treaty bodies and carrying out 
of joint activities. Due to the work of the Interdepartmental Commission the preparation 
and submission of periodic reports to the treaty bodies and reports to the Human Rights 
Council mechanisms had been carried out in a timely manner in recent years. 
</p>
<p>14. Turkmenistan had participated in international cooperation on the protection of the 
rights and best interests of the child. Furthermore, the National Programme for 2011-2015 
on early development and preparation of the child for school had been adopted by 
presidential decree in 2011. The General Programme on development of the juvenile justice 
system was also adopted in 2012. 
</p>
<p>15. The joint project of the European Commission, OHCHR and UNDP entitled 
&#8220;Strengthening the national capacity of Turkmenistan to promote and protect human 
rights&#8221;, which was initiated by the Government with the objective of further strengthening 
meaningful dialogue on the protection of human rights, had been implemented in 
cooperation with the National Institute of Democracy and Human Rights under the 
President of Turkmenistan. As part of this project, the Information Centre on human rights 
had been established at the National Institute of Democracy and Human Rights under the 
President of Turkmenistan. Similar centres had been opened at higher educational 
institutions in all regions to increase the awareness of public employees, scientists, students, 
civil society members and other interested parties in the area of human rights. Also as part 
of the Project a national plan of action on human rights was being drafted. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation stated that the above measures demonstrated the commitment and 
readiness of Turkmenistan to implement its human rights obligations. It stressed that 
Turkmenistan had been steadily implementing the objectives set by the President to further 
strengthen the independence, neutrality, sociopolitical stability and national unity of the 
country as well as protect human rights and freedoms, ensure social justice and the well-
being of the people, and the further democratization of the society.

than 40 per cent of those working in the economic sphere were women, and in several 
sectors, such as health, culture, science and education, women constituted more than 60 per 
cent of those employed. While the delegation considered that the equality of women did not 
constitute an acute problem in the country, it noted, however, that the Government had been 
constantly trying to involve women in public work. For example, some deputy heads of 
local authorities were women, who were responsible for education and culture issues as 
these were often related to women&#8217;s issues. 
</p>
<p>100. The delegation stated that the Government continued to focus on the provision of 
affordable social benefits and the creation of new job opportunities. Even during the

attacks against individuals who provided information, including information of a critical 
nature, had been received. Turkmenistan had established close cooperation with OHCHR in 
order to provide timely responses to individual complaints and communications in this 
regard. It also worked with other organizations, including the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in order to provide answers to all 
questions mentioned in the individual complaints within a short period, of three to five 
months. Bilateral cooperation with countries in Europe and North America had also been

border with the use of an illegal passport. While serving his sentence in prison, he had been 
given access to his relatives and had been enjoying appropriate medical services. The 
delegation noted that his detention conditions remained satisfactory. 
</p>
<p>103. In response to questions regarding the attack against the first President of 
Turkmenistan, the delegation reported that a number of citizens who were connected with

various public processes and dozens of NGOs had been involved in the national 
consultations on the development agenda of the country. 
</p>
<p>105. With respect to the questions regarding the freedom of movement, the delegation 
briefed the Working Group that since 2010 there had not been a single case of restrictions 
imposed on citizens who wanted to leave the country. However the Government had had to 
prohibit the right to exit the country of a number of citizens who had been deported from 
other countries in the past. The new legislation on migration incorporated the relevant 
provisions of ICCPR. 
</p>
<p>106. Turkmenistan had ratified eight fundamental ILO conventions, including 
Conventions no. 138 (1973) concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment and 
No. 182 (1999) concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the 
Worst Forms of Child Labour, and legislation concerning youth labour had been brought in </p>


<p>line with international standards. All labour guarantees for people under 18 years old were 
explicitly set out in the 2009 Labour Code. 
</p>
<p>107. The delegation pointed out that the revised Constitution guaranteed equal rights and 
freedoms to all citizens without discrimination on any ground, that all citizens were 
guaranteed the use of their mother tongue and that recognition of the Turkmen language as 
a State language did not limit the constitutional rights of citizens to use their ethnic 
language. Legal, judicial and practical measures existed to ensure strong guarantees for 
prohibiting and preventing any discriminatory or criminal acts on ethnic grounds. The 
Government also provided legal guarantees to ensure participation of all its citizens in their 
cultural life. 
</p>
<p>108. With respect to gender equality, the delegation stated that the Government planned 
to organize a number of events with the participation of international experts and 
representatives of CEDAW members for the implementation of the recommendations of 
CEDAW. In this respect, the Government was closely cooperating with the international 
organizations, including UNFPA and had been working on a draft plan of action on the 
rights of women. 
</p>
<p>109. The delegation reported that recommendations made by the Organization for 
Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) regarding electoral issues had been studied by 
the Parliament and that they would be taken into account and incorporated to the extent 
possible and necessary in the new Electoral Code that was in the process of being drafted 
by the Parliament. Furthermore, according to the Law on Political Parties, which was 
adopted in 2012, the purpose of the political party was to: shape public opinion and 
improve political awareness and education of citizens, bring up citizens&#8217; views on various 
issues of public life before the local government bodies and participate in elections by 
nominating their candidates for the elections. The political parties took part in the work of 
the central and local government bodies through their elected members. 
</p>
<p>110. In response to the questions on the international observers&#8217; participation in the 
upcoming elections, the delegation reported that the international observers should be 
accredited by the Central Electoral Commission to monitor the elections in accordance with 
the procedures set by the legislation and based on the official invitation. The delegation 
believed that an invitation to the international observers was anticipated for the upcoming 
elections. 
</p>
<p>111. In conclusion, the delegation thanked all for the useful and interesting questions
