<p>GE.10-13056 <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 10/2 the Human Rights Council reaffirmed the importance of the 
full and effective implementation of all United Nations standards on human rights in the 
administration of justice. In doing so, it called on Member States to spare no effort in 
providing for effective legislative, judicial, social, educative and other relevant mechanisms 
and procedures, as well as adequate resources, to ensure the full implementation of those 
standards. In the resolution the Council also identified specific aspects of the administration 
of justice, including juvenile justice in relation to which Member States are urged to ensure 
the protection of human rights. The present report is submitted to the Council pursuant to 
paragraph 19 of the resolution, in which the Council requested the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the Council on the implementation of the 
resolution. It is based on replies to a note verbale sent by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to all Member and observer States.1  
</p><p>2. In resolution 10/2 the Council also requested the Secretary-General to submit a 
report to the Council on the latest developments, challenges and good practices in human 
rights in the administration of justice, including juvenile justice and conditions for women 
and children in detention, as well as in the activities undertaken by the United Nations 
system as a whole. The present report should be read in conjunction with the report of the 
Secretary-General (A/HRC/14/34) submitted pursuant to the resolution.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Summary of country replies to the note verbale 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The development of comprehensive juvenile justice policies, including 
the use of alternative measures in respect of children, and rehabilitation 
and reintegration strategies for former child offenders 
</b></p>
<p>3. In resolution 10/2 the Council encouraged States that have not yet integrated 
children&#8217;s issues in their overall rule of law efforts to do so, and to develop and implement 
a comprehensive juvenile justice policy to prevent and address juvenile delinquency as well 
as with a view to promoting, inter alia, the use of alternative measures, such as diversion 
and restorative justice, and ensuring compliance with the principle that deprivation of 
liberty of children should only be used as a measure of last resort and for the shortest 
appropriate period of time, as well as to avoid, wherever possible, the use of pretrial 
detention for children (para. 9). The development of a comprehensive juvenile justice 
policy at the national level in line with relevant international standards is encouraged by the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child, and guidance is provided in the Committee&#8217;s general 
comment No. 10 (2007) on children&#8217;s rights in juvenile justice. 
</p><p>4. Bosnia and Herzegovina reported that the best interests of the child is the 
fundamental principle guiding the administration of juvenile justice in the country. Special 
provisions based on relevant international standards govern the way in which juvenile 
offenders are dealt with in criminal matters. These provisions include a separate set of 
procedural rules which are aimed at, among other things, assisting tribunals in finding the 
</p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 Replies were received from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, Paraguay, the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Moldova, Slovakia and Uruguay. Replies received after the deadline for processing of the 
report will be issued in an addendum to the present report. </p>

</p>
<p>most appropriate sanction for ensuring the positive social reintegration of the offender. 
Diversion from ordinary criminal proceedings is possible, one of the conditions being that 
the offender is no older than 21 years at the time of the trial. In addition, trials of children 
are conducted by judges with juvenile justice experience, the juvenile must be represented 
by defence counsel, and the prosecutor must consider whether seeking a custodial sentence 
is justified before instituting criminal proceedings against a child. Exceptionally, juveniles 
may be placed in pretrial detention. 
</p>
<p>5. In order to avoid the detention of juveniles, children between the age of 14 (the age 
of criminal responsibility) and 16 may receive only correctional measures rather than 
sentences. The purpose of these correctional measures is to provide offenders with 
assistance and protection while exercising control over their lives with a view to ensuring 
education, training and development. Examples of correction measures include committal 
to a disciplinary centre and intensified supervision by parents, foster parents or a social 
welfare body. Such measures may be accompanied by additional measures such as an 
apology to the victim, payment of compensation to the victim to the best of the juvenile&#8217;s 
abilities, prohibitions on the use of alcohol and drugs, and compulsory counselling. A 
custodial sentence for juveniles remains a possibility as a last resort, including short periods 
of solitary confinement. 
</p>
<p>6. Slovakia referred to new legislation that more fully respects both the constitutional 
rights and the international human rights obligations binding on the State. The age of 
criminal responsibility is 14 years and special provisions apply to offenders aged 14 to 18 
years. These include a range of penalties to avoid the detention of juveniles, such as 
community service, payment of a fine, forfeiture of a piece of property, and the prohibition 
of certain activities.  
</p>
<p>7. Canada referred to its national Youth Criminal Justice Act (2002), which as federal 
legislation applies in all provinces and territories of Canada, and provides the legal basis for 
all the policies and practices on the treatment of juveniles in the administration of justice. 
The Act refers to the Convention on the Rights of the Child in its preamble, and includes a 
Declaration of Principle that sets out the comprehensive juvenile justice policy of Canada. 
The Act provides for the use of alternative measures in juvenile cases (which can include 
diversion and restorative justice), as well as rehabilitation and reintegration strategies. Part 
4 of the Act provides for a range of community sentences for youth, and states that youth 
custody sentences should be used only as a last resort, and that rehabilitation and 
reintegration components must form part of each sentence. 
</p>
<p>8. The Netherlands reported that the use of alternative sanctions in the country&#8217;s 
juvenile justice system is being promoted, with non-custodial sanctions being preferred 
over detention. Alternative sanctions include measures of redress, such as the extension of 
an apology to the victim and the payment of compensation. The national organization Halt 
is responsible for the enforcement of alternative punishment for juveniles, and 
approximately half of the juveniles arrested by Netherlands police are referred to a Halt 
office for enrolment in one of its programmes. With respect to rehabilitation and 
reintegration, the Netherlands reported that in recent years investment has been made in a 
system of post-release care for individuals following time in a juvenile detention facility. A 
post-release programme and trajectory for juveniles is discussed at the time the juvenile 
enters detention. A trajectory plan and guidance is established for juveniles and their 
parents, following input from relevant actors, including the Child Protection Board, youth 
probation services, juvenile detention centres and city councils. 
</p><p>9. The Republic of Moldova highlighted the country&#8217;s development of a 
comprehensive approach to juvenile justice, including the possibility of the exemption of 
juveniles from criminal responsibility and the use of non-custodial sanctions such as strict 
parental supervision, payment of damages, treatment and counselling, and internment in a </p>


<p>GE.10-13056 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>correctional institution. Juveniles aged 16 to 18 years are regularly sentenced to unpaid 
community work. A new law on mediation also forms a component of the restorative 
justice approach. Statistics from 2009 indicate that a high percentage of suspended 
sentences are being handed to juvenile offenders &#8211; double the number of custodial 
sentences. While specific rules govern the pretrial detention of children (including, for 
example, their separation from adult detainees), statistics indicate that pretrial detention of 
juveniles has been reduced by almost 60 per cent since 2007. While the Republic of 
Moldova does not have a separate court or prosecution service for juvenile cases, 
investigations and prosecutions of children are carried out exclusively by the prosecutor, 
with a specialist appointed in each regional prosecutor&#8217;s office for this task. 
</p>
<p>10. Paraguay referred to the work of the Directorate of Human Rights of the Supreme 
Court, which designs and promotes programmes and targeted interventions to provide 
judicial officers with technical assistance and training on human rights and in the 
administration of justice. Two programmes in particular were mentioned. The first is the 
Programa de Inserci&#243;n Familiar, which focuses on comprehensive care for children 
removed from their family environment by a court order, providing for a multidisciplinary 
team (medical professionals, educators, psychologists, sociologists and social workers) to 
advise the judiciary authority making the order. The second is the Programa de Atenci&#243;n a 
Adolescentes Infractores, under which an assessment is made of the situation and condition 
of each adolescent in conflict with the law, proposals are made for appropriate measures for 
their social reintegration, and the juvenile&#8217;s progress is monitored. The programme is being 
rolled out throughout the country. Alternatives to detention for juveniles are available under 
the Criminal Code, which stipulates that custodial measures are to be used only if 
corrections measures are deemed insufficient. Strategies for the rehabilitation and 
reintegration of young offenders include compulsory schooling in the detention centre, with 
a focus on skills that enable personal development and maximize opportunities for post-
release employment.  
</p>
<p>11. Uruguay referred to the Code of Childhood and Adolescence and its insistence on 
respect for the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Uruguay is a party. Cases 
involving juveniles are heard by specialized magistrates, with appeals to the Family Court. 
Only crimes with a penalty exceeding one year may go to trial. The Code sets out various 
principles which guarantee rights to due process (including the presumption of innocence, 
the right to defence, freedom of communication with family, and a trial within a reasonable 
time) as well as minimum conditions of detention. It also addresses sanctions in juvenile 
cases, including the possibility of social and educational measures rather than custodial 
sentences (which are given only in respect of the most serious offences). Non-custodial 
sentences include warnings, reprimands, attendance at social or educational programmes, 
community service, probation, payment of damages and internment in medical facilities or 
in open detention centres. 
</p>
<p>12. Mexico referred to a decision of the Supreme Court that only in cases of serious 
antisocial behaviour can juveniles be deprived of their liberty. Following this decision a 
specialized regime was established in 2006 to allow for the reform within specialized 
institutions of juveniles charged with serious antisocial behaviour. This form of detention, 
which is not administrative but rather controlled by a judicial order, provides a 
comprehensive programme of social rehabilitation, including educational activities, sport 
and recreation. The Government notes that the civil society contribution in the 
rehabilitation of juvenile offenders has been invaluable.  </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-13056 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Law, policies and practices relating to the detention of children 
</b></p>
<p>13. The protection of the human rights of children in detention, both in law and in 
practice, is a focus of resolution 10/2, in which the Human Rights Council reaffirms that the 
best interests of the child must be a primary consideration in all decisions concerning 
deprivation of liberty. Depriving children of their liberty should be used only as a measure 
of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time, in particular before trial. If 
detention is unavoidable, child detainees should be separated from adults, to the greatest 
extent feasible, unless it is considered in the child&#8217;s best interest not to do so. In addition to 
special protection, child detainees are also entitled to all human rights guarantees afforded 
to adult detainees. In the resolution, the Council urges States to be aware of the need for 
special vigilance with regard to the specific situation of children and juveniles in detention, 
and their vulnerability to various forms of violence, abuse, injustice and humiliation. 
</p><p>14. The Republic of Moldova reported that under legislation in force, the arrest and 
detention of juveniles is to be exceptional and only in relation to allegations of a serious 
crime. There are strict time limits on pretrial detention of juveniles, and any detention must 
include a focus on ensuring access to education and preparation for reintegration on release. 
This includes the possibility of following the high school curriculum (through affiliation 
with a local high school), as well as programmes focused on the rehabilitation of drug 
users, on reducing violence, and on sport and art, and a programme to prepare detainees for 
release entitled PROSOCIAL.  
</p>
<p>15. The Netherlands reported that following a national review in 2007, a programme to 
significantly improve the handling of juveniles in detention has been undertaken with the 
aim of improving detention in the majority of detention facilities by 2011. The programme 
includes a system of certification for juvenile detention facilities, and the introduction of a 
basic methodology for all facilities which ensures uniformity and continuity in the 
treatment of juvenile offenders.  
</p><p>16. Paraguay indicated that juveniles over the age of criminal responsibility (14 years) 
who are detained on suspicion of a criminal offence must be brought before a court within 
six hours. The judge may then order continued detention if correctional measures are 
deemed insufficient. As noted in paragraph 7 above, national legislation in Canada provides 
for a range of community sentences for youth, and sets down the position that youth 
custody sentences should be used only as a last resort, and that rehabilitation and 
reintegration must be part of each sentence. Slovakia reported that, in accordance with 
international norms, minors are detained separately from adults, and those convicted and 
sentenced to imprisonment serve sentences in institutions separate from adults.  
</p>
<p>17. In its contribution, Mexico referred to national legislation and programmes aimed at 
ensuring compliance with international standards relating to detention, including the United 
Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice.2 In particular, 
the Law for the Protection of the Rights of Children and Adolescents guarantees juveniles 
rights under the Constitution as well as rights recognized in human rights treaties ratified by 
Mexico. Specific guarantees apply to juveniles coming from indigenous communities, such 
as taking into account the customs and language of their community, as well as the 
provision of a defence counsel with knowledge of their language and culture and access to 
an interpreter if needed.  
</p>
<p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 General Assembly resolution 40/33, annex.  </p>


<p>GE.10-13056 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. The use of capital punishment and of life imprisonment without the 
possibility of release for offences committed by persons under 18 years 
of age 
</b></p>
<p>18. Both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (art. 6, para. 5) and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child (art. 37 (a)) include an obligation that capital 
punishment may not be imposed for offences committed by persons below 18 years of age. 
The Convention on the Rights of the Child also specifies that States parties may not allow a 
sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of release to be imposed for offences 
committed by persons below 18 years of age (art. 37 (a)). In resolution 10/2, the Human 
Rights Council urges States to respect these norms under both legislation and practice.  
</p>
<p>19. All States contributing to the present report noted that they have abolished the death 
penalty, and many reported the abolition of life imprisonment for juveniles. Capital 
punishment was abolished in the Netherlands in 1870 and in 2008 life sentences for 
juveniles were abolished. In the Republic of Moldova, capital punishment has been 
abolished, and life imprisonment cannot be applied to juveniles or to women. In Paraguay 
the death penalty has been abolished, and the maximum custodial sentence for juveniles is 
eight years, life imprisonment for juveniles thus being prohibited.  
</p><p>20. Uruguay indicated that the Constitution prohibits both the death penalty and life 
imprisonment, the most severe penalty being 30 years in prison. Mexico indicated that the 
death penalty has been abolished and life imprisonment is prohibited for individuals under 
18 years of age. Slovakia noted that the death penalty was abolished in 1990 and that the 
relevant regional and international conventions on abolition have been ratified. According 
to the Slovak law, it is not possible for children to be sentenced to life imprisonment. Under 
the Criminal Code, the penalties for juveniles are lowered to half the amount stipulated for 
adults, and the maximum prison sentence length for juveniles is 15 years. Canada reported 
that its national law prohibits capital punishment and life imprisonment without the 
possibility of release for adults as well as youth. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. The situation of women and girls in prison, including issues relating to 
the children of women in prison 
</b></p>
<p>21. The situation of women and girls in detention, including their children, raises 
specific human rights concerns, including those linked to their vulnerability to various 
forms of violence, abuse, injustice and humiliation. In its resolution 10/2, the Human 
Rights Council invited governments, relevant international and regional bodies, national 
human rights institutions and non-governmental organizations to devote greater attention to 
the issue of women and girls in prison, including issues relating to the children of women in 
prison, with a view to identifying and addressing the gender-specific aspects and challenges 
related to this problem. 
</p>
<p>22. The Netherlands reported that women and men are detained in separate facilities in 
its system. In one of the women&#8217;s facilities a special programme is run to support detained 
mothers in raising their children. This project, entitled &#8220;Better start&#8221;, is being evaluated. In 
exceptional cases, a mother can be allowed to keep her child with her in the detention 
facility until a certain age.  
</p>
<p>23. The Republic of Moldova noted the working and education opportunities offered to 
women in detention, including paid work and access to sports and artistic activities. In the 
six months before release, reintegration programmes are offered. Women with children can 
be housed in separate blocks with gardens. Children are held with mothers until they are 
three years old. Pregnant women in prison receive the requisite health care, and childbirth </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-13056 
</p>
<p>takes place in hospital. Since January 2008, women with children in detention are entitled 
to receive the child allowances paid by the State. Following recommendations of the 
European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the Republic of Moldova is adjusting its temporary detention isolators with a 
view to bringing them into line with international standards. 
</p>
<p>24. Paraguay referred to detention facilities that are exclusively for women and another 
for girls. Paraguay does not have a system of mixed incarceration. Canada noted that its 
national legislation requires that all measures taken against young people who commit 
offences must respect gender. 
</p>
<p>25. Uruguay referred to women&#8217;s prisons and halfway houses (preparing women 
detainees for release) in the country. The children of women prisoners are allowed to 
remain with their mothers until they reach the age of five, and in 2005, home detention was 
introduced for pregnant inmates for the last trimester of pregnancy and the first quarter of 
breastfeeding. 
</p>
<p>26. Mexico referred to the formation in 2008 of a group, including federal agencies, 
civil society and academia, to consider the care of women in prison. The group held three 
training courses on the human rights of women in prison for government officials. The 
National Institute for Women (<i>Inmujeres</i>) has undertaken a number of activities in relation 
to women in prison, including a study of court records of cases involving women 
prosecuted for crimes and detained in rehabilitation centres. The Institute has proposed 
amendments to the minimum standards for the social rehabilitation of women in prison.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Law, policy and practice in respect of sentencing or deciding on pretrial 
measures for a pregnant woman or a child&#8217;s sole or primary carer 
</b></p>
<p>27. In resolution 10/2, within a broader invitation to States and other actors to devote 
greater attention to the issue of women and girls in prison (para. 12), the Human Rights 
Council highlighted the situation of pregnant women and those who are a child&#8217;s sole or 
primary carer. In doing so, it emphasized the need to ensure that when sentencing or 
deciding on pretrial measures for a pregnant woman or a child&#8217;s sole or primary carer, 
priority should be given to non-custodial measures, bearing in mind the gravity of the 
offence and after taking into account the best interest of the child (para. 13).  
</p><p>28. The Netherlands reported that it is customary in the country that pregnant women 
who are in pretrial detention are released from custody to give birth. In principle, the non-
detained partner is expected to raise the child. If that is not an option, there are possibilities 
for the mother to keep her child with her in pretrial detention, and possibilities for sanctions 
alternative to detention are considered. Solutions are tailored to individual cases.  
</p>
<p>29. The Republic of Moldova reported that the Criminal Code allows for the possibility 
of deferral of punishments for pregnant women and women with children under 8 years old. 
Paraguay referred to the existence of houses of refuge for juvenile detainees during 
pregnancy and breastfeeding. Home detention is available for women with newborn 
children and in the final months of pregnancy. Uruguay noted that a woman&#8217;s responsibility 
for a child becomes one of the factors for judges to consider in deciding whether or not to 
order release from custody.  
</p>
<p>30. Slovakia noted that if an indicted woman is pregnant, this fact is brought to the 
attention of the court and the prosecutor, with a supporting report on the woman&#8217;s state of 
health. If a detention order has already been made, then specific conditions will be attached, 
for example that the woman will be allowed to buy food, and that she will not be subject to </p>


<p>GE.10-13056 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>solitary confinement. A custodial sentence on a pregnant woman or mother of a newborn 
child is usually postponed for a period of one year after the delivery of the child.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. The allocation of resources for the provision of legal aid services with a 
view to the promotion and protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>31. Adequate representation in legal proceedings is central to an effective system of 
administration of justice which respects human rights. The right to legal assistance (if 
necessary without cost to the accused in criminal matters) is set out in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (art. 14, para. 3 (d)). In resolution 10/2, the Council 
invited governments to allocate adequate resources for the provision of legal aid services 
with a view to the promotion and protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>32. Paraguay reported that the right to counsel from the time of arrest is guaranteed by 
law. The legal aid system has 192 public defenders, who handled over 26,000 cases in 2008 
and over 27,500 cases in 2009. A bill currently before Congress seeks to clarify the nature 
and mission of the Ministry of Public Defence, including its autonomy. Paraguay also 
reported an increasing annual allocation of funds for the provision of legal aid services. 
Mexico reported that the Federal Institute of Public Defence ensures the right to a public 
defence in criminal matters, with a view to assisting disadvantaged populations in accessing 
justice, overcoming social inequalities, safeguarding human rights and strengthening the 
rule of law.  
</p>
<p>33. Canada noted that constitutional responsibility for criminal justice, which includes 
matters under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, is divided between the federal and provincial 
governments, which work in partnership to ensure coordination. The absolute right to 
counsel is established under the Act for juveniles when they are charged with a criminal 
offence. If no legal aid coverage is available, the court may direct that the young person be 
represented by counsel. The federal Government contributes to the costs of criminal legal 
aid. Overall, legal aid plans in Canada spend some $43 million on legal aid services to 
youth, representing 14 per cent of the total direct service spending on criminal legal aid. 
This is in proportion to the requests for legal aid service to youth, which represent 14 per 
cent of applications for legal aid. About 10 per cent of all duty counsel services in criminal 
matters are provided to youth. 
</p>
<p>34. Slovakia reported that the Centre for Legal Aid is a State-funded organization, 
established by statute, which provides legal aid services in the areas of civil, family, labour 
and asylum law, as well as under certain conditions, in matters of commercial law. The 
Centre does not provide legal aid services for proceedings in the areas of criminal, 
administrative or social security law. Juveniles who will be tried on a criminal charge must 
be represented by counsel after indictment, the cost being borne by the Ministry of Justice 
if required.  
</p>
<p>35. Uruguay referred to the adoption of the Code of Childhood and Adolescence and its 
incorporation of a child&#8217;s right to be heard in the judicial system. The State provides free 
advocacy for children in court proceedings.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Training by governments in human rights and the administration of 
justice to various actors as outlined in paragraph 6 of the resolution 
</b>36. In paragraph 6 of resolution 10/2, the Human Rights Council invites governments to 
provide for training, including anti-racist, multicultural and gender-sensitive and child 
rights training, in human rights in the administration of justice, including juvenile justice, 
for all judges, lawyers, prosecutors, social workers, immigration and police officers and </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-13056 
</p>
<p>other professionals working in the field of administration of justice, including personnel 
deployed in international field presences. 
</p>
<p>37. The Republic of Moldova reported on training programmes held jointly with 
international organizations and bilateral donors on juvenile justice for prosecutors. Human 
rights training of prison officials is organized both during job induction and on an ongoing 
basis. In 2007, together with the United Nations Development Programme country office, 
the Government published a human rights trainers&#8217; guide for prison officials, which 
includes a focus on women and children in detention. In 2009, in cooperation with the 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the Government held training and prepared a 
guide on the treatment of minors in detention. The National Justice Institute carries out 
ongoing on-site training in prisons with prison staff, judges and prosecutors. Continuous 
occupational training is a component of the 2009&#8211;2012 action plan of the Ministry of

<p>38. Paraguay referred to a monitoring and training programme on improving access to 
justice for female victims of domestic violence, carried out with support from the United 
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations Development Fund for Women 
(UNIFEM) and UNDP. The programme targeted judicial officers of the criminal courts, 
justices of the peace and police officers. Other programmes focus on issues such as labour 
rights, with the publication of a guide entitled &#8220;Women workers: protecting your rights in 
court&#8221;. In respect of indigenous peoples, the Directorate of Human Rights runs training 
activities for the judiciary in partnership with the Coordinating Committee for the Self-
Determination of Indigenous Peoples. The main objective of the training is to promote the 
implementation of a human rights perspective in judicial proceedings concerning 
indigenous peoples in both civil and criminal cases, and to promote a better appreciation of 
cultural diversity.

<p>39. Uruguay referred to training activities undertaken in 2009 by the National Institute 
for Children and Adolescents for more than 300 actors in juvenile justice in the country, as 
well as to the graduate course on juvenile justice offered by the Faculty of Law at the 
University of the Republic. The Netherlands reported that due attention is paid to human 
rights and children&#8217;s rights in the standard training of public prosecutors and members of 
the judiciary. Within government organizations focused on children (such as the Child 
Protection Board), training on diversity is provided.  
</p><p>40. Mexico reported that training activities are organized by the Directorate-General for 
the Promotion of Human Rights of the Procuradur&#237;a General de la Rep&#250;blica. A basic 
course on human rights is held for all staff of the Procuradur&#237;a General as well as for the 
Federal Police. Specialized training courses are offered on human rights and detention, on 
torture or ill-treatment, on assistance to victims of crime, on gender equity and on the 
human rights of persons with disabilities. A course on human rights in the context of 
federal law enforcement addresses specific issues concerning juvenile offenders. For its 
part, the National Human Rights Commission has undertaken a study aimed at promoting 
the improvement of the situation of women in detention. The Commission conducted 
workshops on law enforcement with a gender perspective for public prosecutors, and a 
simulated court case involving women&#8217;s human rights was conducted jointly with OHCHR.  
41. Slovakia reported on recent trainings involving the Ministry of Justice, the Office of 
the Prosecutor General, the Constitutional Court and the Presidium of the Police Corps. 
Further trainings on human rights and administration of justice were provided by the 
Judicial Academy, an independent training institution with nationwide coverage established 
by legislation. The task of the Academy is to ensure, organize and carry out the training of 
judges and prosecutors as well as of those training to become judges and prosecutors. In 
addition, the Academy is responsible for the examinations of judges and prosecutors, and 
collaborates with international institutions working on the administration of justice.  </p>

<p><b> 8. The integration of administration of justice in national development 
plans and the provision of financial and technical assistance by States 
for the enhancement and strengthening of human rights in the 
administration of justice 
</b>42. The links between development processes and the protection of human rights in the 
administration of justice was recognized by the Human Rights Council in resolution 10/2, 
where it invited governments to include in their national development plans the 
administration of justice as an integral part of the development process.  
43. The Republic of Moldova reported that its National Development Strategy for 2008&#8211;
2011 calls for the strengthening of human rights guarantees in juvenile justice, including 
improving the legislative framework, streamlining proceedings while increasing procedural 
guarantees and improving infrastructure. Furthermore, a strategy for improving the judicial 
system of the country was adopted by Parliament in 2007. Juvenile justice features among 
the nine components of the strategy, and includes addressing children both as victims of 
crime, and as the perpetrators. Moldova also reported a number of administrative reforms, 
including a 2004 decision that each trial court appoint at least one judge to handle juvenile 
cases, and each prosecutor&#8217;s office to similarly appoint a prosecutor to deal with juvenile 
cases, a development that has shown positive results. More recently however, the global 
financial crisis has resulted in reduced allocations to all government agencies, including 
those involved in the administration of justice. Examples of consequences include an 
inability to reimburse expenses of probation officers. However, the Government reports that 
improvements in the administration of justice continue to be made, albeit at a slower pace. 
44. Uruguay reported a significant increase in the allocation of State funds for the justice 
system, with an almost fivefold increase from 2006 to 2009. Mexico drew attention to the 
budgetary allocations flowing from the implementation of constitutional reforms on 
security and justice, including stronger fair-trial guarantees, the streamlining of criminal 
proceedings, mechanisms for alternative dispute resolution, and reparation for victims of a 
crime. The reforms are expected to be implemented over a period of eight years.  
</p>
<p>45. Slovakia noted that, while the country has not adopted a national development plan, 
the enhancement and strengthening of human rights in the administration of justice are the 
responsibility of the Ministry of Justice of the Slovak Republic and the Corps of Prison and 
Court Guard, acting under the Constitution, in particular the chapter on human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions 
</b>46. <b>A number of developments at the national level that illustrate States&#8217; efforts to 
ensure the full and effective implementation of all human rights in the administration 
of justice are described in the present report. The developments reported place a 
particular emphasis on juvenile justice and the detention of women, children and 
mothers. Although representing only a small sample of activities across Member 
States on the issues raised in resolution 10/2, several common approaches arise. One is 
the grounding of national administration of justice regimes in international and 
regional human rights standards. This is reflected, for example, in the national legal 
requirement reported by all countries that men be separated from women in 
detention, and children from adults. The responding countries also share a concern 
that the detention of children be an approach of last resort (in accordance with the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child) and stress the importance of providing a 
means of dealing with juvenile crime outside of the formal criminal justice system. </b></p>

</p>
<p><b>The practices set out in this report provide a number of promising examples of 
sanctions for juvenile offenders that do not involve detention. Responses also 
highlighted the importance of the adoption of a comprehensive approach to juvenile 
justice at the national level, an approach urged by the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child in its general comment No. 10 on children&#8217;s rights in juvenile justice (2007). 
Finally, the report underlines the importance of a well-funded and functioning legal 
aid system (including for children) and of ongoing training on human rights 
protection for those actively involved in the administration of justice.
