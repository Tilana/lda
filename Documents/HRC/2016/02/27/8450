<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone 
to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health (&#8220;right to 
the highest attainable standard of health&#8221; or &#8220;right to health&#8221;) visited the Syrian Arab 
Republic from 7 to 14 November 2010. 
</p>
<p>2. While the mission considered broadly a number of issues related to the enjoyment of 
the right to health, the focus was on access to health care, services, goods and facilities for 
marginalized group as well as on health systems in the realization of the right to health.   
</p>
<p>3. The agenda for the visit of the Special Rapporteur was prepared in close cooperation 
with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Office of the United Nations Resident 
Coordinator. The mission included visits to the governorates of Aleppo and Al-Hasakah. 
The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the valuable cooperation and assistance received 
before, during and after the mission. 
</p>
<p>4. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur met with the Minister of Health, Dr. 
Rida Said; Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Faysal Mekdad; Deputy Minister for Higher 
Education, Nizar Al Daher; the Minister for Social Affairs and Labour, Diala Al Haj Aref, a 
number of senior Government officials, representatives of health professionals&#8217; 
organizations as well as with representatives of international and civil society 
organizations.   
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur expresses his sincere thanks to all those whom he met for 
their excellent cooperation.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>6. The independent Arab Kingdom of Syria was established in 1920 following the 
partition of the Ottoman Empire at the end of the First World War. Syria gained 
independence from France in April 1946 and was established as a parliamentary republic 
shortly thereafter. In March 1963, the Arab Socialist Ba&#8217;ath Party re-established Syria as 
the Syrian Arab Republic, ruled by President Hafez al-Assad until his death in 2000, when 
his son, Bashar al-Assad, succeeded him as President. Today, Syria is a lower-middle-
income country, with an economy based primarily on agriculture, oil, industry and tourism. 
Syria was ranked 111 out of 169 countries in the Human Development Index (HDI) in 
20101 and has risen by 0.8 per cent annually between 1980 and 2010.2 However, this still 
places Syria below the regional average of Arab States. 
</p>
<p>7. The 1973 Syrian Constitution obliges the State to provide welfare services. In the 
last decades, notable progress has been made in the provision of basic amenities, including 
health care, amongst nearly all key health indicators. Syria provides medical care virtually 
free of charge to its citizens at Government clinics and health centres, and imposes a ceiling 
on charges at private hospitals. This applies to all levels of care from emergency medicine 
to hospital admissions, surgeries, clinical follow-up, dialysis and surgery. Syria&#8217;s public 
health programme is based on primary health care and is delivered at the village, district 
and provincial level. However, infrastructure and health services in rural areas remain 
inadequate. Expenditure on health care continues to be relatively low with only 3.2 per cent

<p>of the country&#8217;s GDP being spent on health care in 2008.3 Syria does not have a health 
insurance system, and people usually opt for private health care, if they can afford it. A 
social health plan for some 750,000 public servants was introduced in April 2010, which in 
future should be further extended to cover pensioners and the families of public servants.   
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur commends the Syrian Government for developing a long-
term, five-year coordinated strategy to ensure that all Syrians receive access to high-quality 
health care. This plan aims to modernize the country&#8217;s health sector, improve the provision 
and quality of health services, develop management and technologically update the health 
sector, and ensure greater planning and supervision.  
</p>
<p><b> III. International and national legal framework  
</b></p>
<p>9. Syria has ratified several international human rights treaties recognizing the 
enjoyment of the right to health: the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights (ICESCR); the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR); the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
(CERD); the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC); the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW); and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). It has acceded to, but not 
yet ratified, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families; and the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT).  
</p>
<p>10. Syria&#8217;s legal system is based on a combination of Ottoman and French civil law. As 
Syria is a dualist nation, international treaties need to be incorporated into domestic law 
through enactment of legislation, in order for them to be made enforceable. 
</p>
<p>11.  Although it is encouraging that Syria has ratified the instruments listed above, many 
of these treaties were adopted with reservations which, in some instances, arguably 
undermined the spirit of those instruments under which the international obligations were 
undertaken.  For example, the Syrian Government initially made various reservations to 
CEDAW, deeming particular provisions to be incompatible with domestic and Sharia law. 
It is encouraging to note that these have since been removed, particularly those reservations 
pertaining to article 2 of CEDAW, which relates to the State party&#8217;s commitment to pursue 
the elimination of discrimination against women in all its forms.4 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to note that the Constitution of Syria, adopted 
on 13 March 1973, includes a provision relating to the enjoyment of the right to health. 
Article 46 guarantees health care for every citizen and his family in cases of emergency, 
illness, disability, orphanhood, and old age.  The Government has an obligation to protect 
citizens' health and provides them with the means of protection, treatment, and medication.5 
The State also guarantees cultural, social, and health services, and especially undertakes to 
provide these services at the village level.6 Moreover, it stipulates that the State must ensure 
the principle of equal opportunities for citizens,7 which is imperative for the enjoyment of

<p>all human rights. However, it must be noted that an Emergency Law has been in effect 
since 1963, effectively suspending many constitutional safeguards for Syrians including 
those critical to the formation of community and other civil society groups, both of which 
are crucial in the development of effective, rights-based health policies.  
</p>
<p>13. The analysis in this report is based on article 12 of ICESCR, which recognizes &#8220;the 
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health&#8221;. This implies ensuring that health facilities, goods and services are available, 
accessible, acceptable and of good quality for everyone.  
</p>
<p>14. General comment 14 details the obligations of States parties under the right to 
health. States are required to respect, protect, and fulfil the right to health.  The requirement 
to respect obliges States not to interfere with the right to health, while the requirement to 
protect calls upon States to prevent third-party interference with the right to health. The 
requirement to fulfil the right to health encompasses the concept of &#8220;progressive 
realization&#8221;, requiring State Parties to undertake appropriate measures to advance the right 
to health moving forward, and includes the critical principle of non-retrogression, that 
prohibits States from engaging in activities that would result in reversal of gains already 
achieved in relation to the right. 
</p>
<p>15. Non-discrimination and equal treatment are fundamental elements of international 
human rights law, including the right to the highest attainable standard of health. States 
must ensure that the health system is accessible to all, without discrimination. At the same 
time, it must be responsive to the particular needs of women, children, older people, 
persons living in poverty, etc. By applying these two basic human rights principles, of 
equality and non-discrimination, States ensure equal access to health care for both the 
advantaged and the disadvantaged.  
</p>
<p>16. In order to address groups that are deemed vulnerable and those which may be 
discriminated against, there must be adequate information identifying these groups and 
their health-related vulnerabilities. This requires the collection of data disaggregated in an 
appropriate manner along the lines of ethnicity, gender, age, etc., in order to allow for 
identification of possible discrimination. The Syrian Government&#8217;s commitment to 
providing health care to all citizens on a non-discriminatory basis is commendable. 
However, whilst the available health indicators may be positive, a lack of disaggregated 
data has prevented a complete assessment of the Syrian health sector. Without access to 
such data it is virtually impossible to identify whether particular problems exist.  
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur strongly believes that data collection should be more 
comprehensive and should include a broader range of demographic indicators to ensure the 
provision of health services in a non-discriminatory manner. The collection of such data, in 
and of itself, does not appear to contravene the provisions of the Syrian Constitution, which 
prohibits discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity. Such data collection would rather 
allow the Government to obtain a clearer picture of whether such discrimination is 
occurring, and take steps to address it. 
</p>
<p>18. Community participation and consultation is an essential component of the right to 
health.  While national health strategies and plans of action should respect, inter alia, the 
principles of non-discrimination and people's participation,8 in order for communities to 
have genuine, measurable input into policymaking, it is necessary that such communities 
are able to voice their opinion on issues that they deem important and provide feedback to 
the Government.  It is in the long-term interest of any State to include these voices, in order 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>to improve delivery of health services, and ultimately realize its obligation to fulfil the right 
to health.  
</p>
<p>19. Due to the continuation of the state of emergency declared by the Government in the 
1960s, the freedoms of assembly, association and expression are restricted within Syria, 
which inevitably has a significant impact on the enjoyment of the right to health. Members 
of civil society or community-based organizations that are wholly independent from the 
Government are rarely invited to participate in the development of health policies and 
programmes. The problem of insufficient community participation is particularly acute in 
relation to vulnerable groups such as women and ethnic minorities. This is also a particular 
concern in relation to HIV/AIDS, an illness for which patient empowerment and 
participation are particularly necessary, notwithstanding the fact that the prevalence of the 
disease fortunately remains low in Syria.   
</p>
<p>20. Syria&#8217;s legal guarantees for the provision of the highest attainable standard of health, 
in terms of constitutional protections outlined above, are commendable. It is one of only 
four countries in the world that ensures access to medicines in its Constitution.  In general, 
advances have been made across nearly all key health indicators, including substantial 
reductions in infant and maternal mortality rates which are on target to meet the respective 
Millennium Development Goals.9 However, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government 
to take further, practical steps to ensure that the principles of non-discrimination and 
participation &#8211; central to realization of the right to health &#8211; are effectively promoted and 
adhered to.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Health system 
</b></p>
<p>21. Enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is not only a human rights 
issue &#8211; health is also a fundamental element of sustainable development, poverty reduction 
and economic prosperity. By building and strengthening effective and integrated health 
systems, which are instrumental for the enjoyment of the right to health, States would 
secure sustainable development, poverty reduction, and improved health for individuals, 
including the right to the highest attainable standard of health.  While health systems give 
rise to a number of technical issues, the right-to-health approach places the well-being of 
individuals, communities and populations at its heart, and is interested not only in 
processes, i.e. providing access to medicines, or water and sanitation, but also in its 
processes and outcomes &#8211; how to ensure non-discrimination, participation, transparency, 
respect for cultural difference, etc.  
</p>
<p>22. In the last three decades, the Syrian Government has undertaken considerable work 
to improve the health system as a whole. The Government operates a network of clinics and 
health centres that provide health care free of charge to all citizens. As a result, the rate of 
access to health-care services among the population is very high. It is reported that close to 
100 per cent of the population has access to health-care services, both urban and rural, and 
there is one primary health-care unit per 10,000 people.  Moreover, physical accessibility of 
health services is impressive; the Special Rapporteur was informed that no more than an 
hour&#8217;s drive is required to access any of the 19 hospitals in Syria, even throughout remote 
and rural areas.

</b></p>
<p>23. Nevertheless, expenditure on health care is still relatively low and has been 
decreasing in recent years, falling from 4.6 per cent of GDP in 2005 to 3.2 in 2008.10 This is 
clearly becoming insufficient, particularly in light of the population growth rate, which 
remains at approximately 2.45 per cent annually; additionally, around 550,000 refugees 
seek health care in Syria, which creates a further burden on resources. Although it is 
commendable that the Syrian Government has been so willing to receive and accommodate 
refugees, and social issues are clearly considered a high priority by the Government, 
continuing improvement in health outcomes for both citizens and non-citizens is unlikely to 
occur without sufficient funding. The Special Rapporteur hopes that funding for this sector 
will be revised in the upcoming five-year plan, as he was informed during his mission. 
</p>
<p>24. One of the concerns noted about Syria&#8217;s health-care system is maintaining health-
care services of sufficient and consistent quality to its citizens. Although health-care 
services are very accessible because they are free of charge, this constitutes a challenge to 
maintenance of an acceptable quality of health-care delivery.  Currently, neither hospital 
accreditation nor continuous medical education is required in Syria, and the growth of the 
largely unregulated private sector continues to outstrip that of the public sector.11 
</p>
<p>25. The proposed introduction of health insurance, initially only for public service 
officials, may serve to increase access to health-care goods and services, although some 
concerns have been voiced in respect of its introduction. These include the fact that out-of-
pocket private expenditure is already capped at certain rates, which renders private health 
care relatively affordable for those that prefer to utilize it and have the means to do so, and 
reduces the pressure on the public system.12 This effectively obviates the need for insurance 
in most cases, other than in respect of unforeseeable and costly medical events, for which 
insurance could be used effectively as a supplement. It remains to be seen how introduction 
of comprehensive insurance would effectively increase access to services, as well as 
improve the quality of services available.  
</p>
<p>26. Irrespective of whatever model of health insurance is proposed, the Special 
Rapporteur urges that the most poor and marginalized members of the community are 
proactively provided for. For instance, he was informed that primary health care will 
continue to be provided free of charge, which is a welcome decision. Ultimately, the 
introduction of insurance or otherwise will not obviate the need to introduce consistent 
quality-control mechanisms to both the public and private sector. 
</p>
<p>27. The pharmaceutical industry is one of the success stories in Syria.  In 1970, only 6 
per cent of drugs were manufactured locally and 94 per cent were imported.  In 2005, 
however, 90 per cent of drugs were manufactured locally and 10 per cent were imported.13 
Syria is now a major exporter of essential medicines to the Middle Eastern and North 
African region. However, Syria has just begun initial negotiations to join the World Trade 
Organization (WTO).  Accession to the WTO will require Syria to change its intellectual 
property law to be compliant with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
Property Rights (TRIPS). The Syrian Government must ensure that during this process it 
avails itself of all the appropriate flexibilities in its new intellectual property law in order to

<p>assure that its current generics sector is not weakened and continues to provide high-
quality, low-cost medicines within Syria, and the wider region. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s health 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Women&#8217;s health 
</b></p>
<p>28. The right to health, as it pertains to women, is provided for in various international 
instruments, including CEDAW. Article 12 obliges States Parties to take all appropriate 
measures to eliminate discrimination against women in order to ensure access to health-care 
services, including those related to family planning, and further urges States to ensure 
women are provided with appropriate services in connection with pregnancy, as well as 
adequate nutrition during pregnancy and lactation. 
</p>
<p>29. General comment 14 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
also notes the need to implement a comprehensive national strategy for promoting women's 
right to health, and to eliminate discrimination against them. This strategy should include 
interventions concerning prevention and treatment of diseases affecting women, as well as 
policies concerning access to high-quality and affordable health care, including sexual and 
reproductive health services. Furthermore, the general comment notes that the State should 
protect against particular female health risks, especially maternal mortality and domestic 
violence, and should remove barriers relating to education and information, including in the 
area of sexual and reproductive health.  
</p>
<p>30. Sexual and reproductive health rights are considered to be integral elements of the 
right to health.14 Following the 1994 International Conference on Population and 
Development in Cairo, and the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing, 
the right to reproductive health is considered to include the ability to have a satisfying and 
safe sexual life, alongside the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when 
and how often to do so.  
</p>
<p>31. Syria&#8217;s Constitution provides that &#8220;citizens are equal before the law in their rights 
and duties&#8221; (article 25), and explicitly guarantees women &#8220;all opportunities enabling them 
to fully and effectively participate in the political, social, cultural, and economic life&#8221; 
(article 45). Despite this constitutional guarantee, and the fact that men and women are 
equally paid for equivalent work in Syria, the Special Rapporteur remains concerned that 
problems concerning the investment in, and empowerment of, women in Syria persist and 
ultimately have health-related implications. 
</p>
<p>32. The right to health also depends upon the realization of other human rights, such as 
the right to education, and its attainment is strongly correlated to poverty risk in Syria. 
Nearly 20 per cent of the poor population is illiterate, and in turn, poverty is most severe in 
the illiterate population, with more pronounced rates in rural areas.15 There is a vicious 
cycle in Syria, and worldwide, wherein poverty leads to lower educational attainment, and 
vice versa, which is particularly pronounced amongst women. The interaction between 
poverty and gender results in low school enrolment rates amongst poor girls, and high rates 
of illiteracy.16

</b></p>
<p>33. Young women in Syria are also less than half as likely to participate in the labour 
force compared to young men, and are nearly twice as likely to be unemployed.17 By age 
29, some 73 per cent of women are economically inactive. However, activity rates amongst 
women who have completed primary and post-secondary education are significantly higher 
(36 per cent and 80 per cent, respectively).18 These figures indicate just one area in which 
the importance of educational attainment for women is paramount. 
</p>
<p>34. These circumstances ultimately have a harmful impact on the health of women in a 
myriad of ways including, inter alia: reducing the ability to obtain and comprehend health-
related information; limiting the financial resources available to access health-care goods 
and services; curtailing the ability of the State to broadly deliver appropriate sexual and 
reproductive education, and so forth. A relative lack of sexual and reproductive education 
has also been linked to high rates of maternal mortality, early marriages and sexually 
transmitted infections. Concern has been expressed that young people in Syria are less 
informed regarding these matters than their counterparts in other countries of the region.19  
</p>
<p>35. The low rates of school enrolment amongst women are particularly concerning in 
light of the fact that sexual and reproductive education is more likely to occur in the context 
of the school system. The reluctance of young people in the region to seek information 
about sexuality and reproduction from their parents, and a lack of preparedness on the part 
of parents to discuss sexuality makes school-based sexual education even more important.20 
This is also relevant in respect of other health-related information, particularly that 
concerning food and nutrition, which will be discussed in the context of children&#8217;s health 
(see para. 45).   
</p>
<p><b> B. Maternal health 
</b></p>
<p>36. It is encouraging to note that Syria&#8217;s maternal mortality rate was estimated at 58 
deaths per 100,000 births in 2008, a significant decrease from the rate of 130 estimated by 
interagency groups in 2005.21 Although Syria is on target to achieve Millennium 
Development Goal 5, the greatest room for improvement is in regard to Syria&#8217;s high 
fertility rate. This remained at 3.8 births per woman in 2008, although the general trend is 
towards further reduction. A high fertility rate represents an independent risk for increased 
maternal mortality rates,22  and failure to contain the total fertility rate in Syria jeopardizes 
progress in further reducing the maternal mortality rate. Moreover, the adolescent fertility 
rate remains at 59.5 births per 1,000 women between the ages of 15-19, which is higher 
than the regional average.23  
</p>
<p>37. Additionally, a divide between urban and rural centres persists in respect of all 
health-related outcomes, but is particularly evident in the area of maternal health. By way 
of example, in Al-Raqqa, the highest maternal mortality rate for the country is recorded, at 
78.25 deaths per 100,000 live births, whereas the lowest rate is recorded in the governorate

<p>of Damascus, at 33.08 deaths.24 Some of the reasons noted for this difference in outcomes 
include economic and educational levels, as discussed in the former section, and a higher 
ratio of home births, and births attended by traditional midwives. Similarly, in Tartus 100 
per cent of births are attended by skilled health personnel, in comparison to around 80 per 
cent of births in Hasakeh.25 These figures are encouraging, but indicate that more work 
remains to be done, including the promotion of birth spacing and other methods of family 
planning. 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to note the increase in the uptake of prenatal 
care amongst pregnant women. Currently, around 84 per cent of women attend at least one 
prenatal visit before delivery, whereas surveys conducted in Syria in 2001 and 1993 
showed that 70.9 per cent and 50 per cent of women respectively had attended such visits.26 
However, only 42 per cent of women were recorded as attending at least four prenatal visits 
over the 2000-2009 period.27 This indicates a need for more comprehensive coverage, and 
may require a re-examination of the systems employed in ensuring all pregnant women are 
appropriately followed up throughout the period of pregnancy.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned that, despite the intention to ensure 
increased access to prenatal care, and promotion of adequate health care during pregnancy, 
the postpartum period does not receive as much attention, and more needs to be done to 
ensure the continuing health of mother and child after birth. There is currently a paucity of 
data around the birth weight of children; although 70.4 per cent of children are now 
delivered in institutional facilities, only 47.9 per cent of children are weighed at birth.28 
There is a need to develop and use more indicators related to post-partum health care, as 
well as to collect disaggregated data in this regard (for instance, relating to the nutritional 
status of the mother). The Special Rapporteur would particularly welcome the development 
of programmes within communities for new mothers, which would result in empowerment 
of these women, and ensure that their health is not neglected due to the increased focus on 
their children in the post-partum period. 
</p>
<p>40. Some particularly promising initiatives have been undertaken by the Syrian 
Women&#8217;s Union, including establishment of 26 health centres specifically for women, a 
number of which are located in rural areas.  The Syrian Government should consider taking 
additional steps to improve maternal health such as fortification of flour with folic acid, 
along with the current iron fortification programme, and promotion of other methods to 
combat anaemia, which remains a significant problem in the region. Despite efforts to 
tackle it, the prevalence of iron-deficiency anaemia amongst women of child-bearing age 
remains at around 40 per cent,29 which poses a risk in relation to post-partum haemorrhage 
(one of the major causes of maternal mortality) alongside its general health implications. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about a great number of early marriages in 
Syria. As of 2006, around 18 per cent of married women were married before the age of 18. 
However, this rate has decreased, and the proportion of women between the ages 15-19

<p>who are currently married is now around 10 per cent,30 which is a commendable 
development. Nevertheless, the health implications of child and early marriages include 
early pregnancy (which, in turn, may result in social isolation and compromised 
development) and curtailed educational and vocational opportunities which both directly 
and indirectly hinder the full enjoyment of the right to health.  
</p>
<p>42. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur was informed of some consideration of 
lowering the marriage age limit for females to 15 years. At present, Syria&#8217;s Law of Personal 
Status sets the minimum age of marriage as 18 years for males and 17 for females. 
However, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that marriages may be entered into under 
these ages upon application to a judge (at 15 or 13 respectively).31 Article 16 of CEDAW, 
related to the right to protection from child marriage, stipulates that &#8220;The betrothal and the 
marriage of a child shall have no legal effect, and all necessary action, including legislation, 
shall be taken to specify a minimum age for marriage.&#8221; However, Syria&#8217;s reservations 
concerning this Article still remain, and the Special Rapporteur strongly encourages the 
Government to urgently withdraw this reservation. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Family planning 
</b></p>
<p>43. Contraceptive prevalence amongst married women stands at 58.3 per cent, which is 
higher than the regional average. Uptake varies significantly between governorates &#8211;highest 
in Sweida (74.9 per cent) and lowest in Al-Raqqa (33.7 per cent) &#8211; and is also strongly 
correlated with educational attainment level. Some 70 per cent of women who have 
completed higher education use contraceptives, in contrast to 65.3 per cent of women 
having completed secondary education, 57.5 per cent primary education, and 45.2 per cent 
with no education.32 These figures demonstrate the importance of education and confirms 
that more needs to be done in respect of promoting family planning and methods of birth 
control.  
</p>
<p>44. The current unmet need for contraceptives stands at approximately 11 per cent.33 To 
successfully increase utilization of family planning services throughout the country, the 
State must note women&#8217;s preferences, and promote culturally appropriate interventions. For 
instance, the most popular method of contraception amongst married women in Syria is the 
intra-uterine device, used by 25.7 per cent of women, with the combined oral contraceptive 
pill accounting for 12.9 per cent of contraceptive usage amongst married women.34 The 
Government should facilitate active participation of women in developing appropriate 
family planning services.   
</p>
<p><b> D. Gender-based and family violence 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur is very concerned by the lack of awareness regarding 
gender-based violence within the Government and wider community. Although it may

<p>involve persons of any gender, gender-based violence directed towards women is defined 
by the United Nations as &#8220;any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to 
result in physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of 
such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in 
private life&#8221;.35 Family violence is more broadly defined, and can involve older persons and 
child abuse as well as violence caused by intimate partners.  
</p>
<p>46. Although the prevalence of &#8220;honour killings&#8221; and other extreme violence directed 
towards women is lower in Syria than throughout the region, it is estimated that 40 to 200 
honour killings are still committed annually in Syria.36 Due to the lack of official data, it is 
difficult to estimate the extent of these problems, even though their presence is widely 
acknowledged. A study conducted by UNDP in 2006 revealed that nearly one in four 
married women in Syria has been physically abused.37 It is disturbing that little to no 
attention has been paid to these issues. The Special Rapporteur notes with regret that, 
throughout the mission, when the topic of gender-based violence was raised, the responses 
of various actors were often misguided or ill-informed.  
</p>
<p>47. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur was advised that establishment of a 
Family Protection Unit has been considered, alongside governorate-based observatories for 
domestic violence, but that little progress has been achieved in this area. It remains unclear 
which Governmental department should take responsibility for its creation and 
administration, as well as prepare a plan devised to raise awareness of its operation. A 
mechanism to report violence and take action needs to be established as a matter of 
urgency. Alongside this, legislative reform is clearly called for, given the number of 
lacunae and inconsistencies within the present legislation.  
</p>
<p>48. Although the Penal code of 1949 currently provides for the protection of women 
from verbal and physical harassment and violence, there are few provisions which protect 
women from violence in the domestic sphere, or other intimate or familial relationships. 
The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that Article 548, regarding the waiver of 
punishment where alleged misconduct on the part of the woman in question led to the 
perpetrator&#8217;s actions, has recently been abolished, and a provision enacted relating to 
&#8220;honour crimes&#8221;, allowing for a prison sentence of 7 years. However, the replacement 
article still allows for mitigation of punishment, which is troubling, and other articles still 
remain concerning violence occuring in a situation where a contract for marriage is 
concluded with the perpetrator, wherein there is room for no charges to be laid, or a 
sentence commuted or reduced. 
</p>
<p>49. In order to comprehensively address the issue of gender-based violence, much more 
than legislative change is required to ensure the protection of women. Long-term changes 
in attitude can only be brought about when the problem is recognized as such. Adequate 
attention must be given to prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of both victims and 
perpetrators of gender-based violence. Access to justice for victims must be ensured 
through establishment of processes to address this issue directly, and promotion of 
educational initiatives designed to raise awareness of gender and family-based violence and 
its broader implications. The Special Rapporteur strongly believes that issues related to 
gender-based and family violence should be urgently addressed and urges the Government 
to do so.

<p><b> E. Children&#8217;s health 
</b></p>
<p>50. Children&#8217;s health in Syria has seen some important advances over the recent 
decades. The under-five mortality rate was most recently estimated at 16 deaths for every 
1,000 live births,38 falling from a previous rate of 41.7 in 1993.39 The infant mortality rate 
currently stands at 14 deaths per 1,000 live births, which has fallen from 30 in 1990,40 and 
is estimated to have decreased by 75 per cent since 1980. These achievements are all in line 
with the Millennium Development Goals concerning children&#8217;s health, adopted in 
September 2000, and the Plan of Action of A World Fit for Children, adopted by 189 
Member States of the United Nations in May 2002. The most pressing concerns regarding 
children&#8217;s health in Syria are again related to the underlying determinants of health, most 
particularly, access to food and food security.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Nutrition  
</b></p>
<p>51. One of the major problems concerning children&#8217;s health is that of malnutrition and 
stunting. The prevalence of these issues has risen largely as a result of the recent drought, 
Syria&#8217;s worst drought in over four decades, which is now heading into its fourth 
consecutive year. Although the problem is largely concentrated in rural areas of Syria &#8211; 
over 95 per cent of those affected are from the governorates of Al-Hassake, Dayr az Zawr 
and Al-Raqqa41 &#8211; it is nevertheless an issue that needs to be addressed nationwide. Rising 
food and fuel prices, alongside the continuing effects of the global financial crisis, place the 
most vulnerable people outside these governorates at risk as well.  
</p>
<p>52. In areas directly affected by the drought, food shortages have led to insufficient food 
intake and poor diet. The food intake of 80 per cent of families assessed by the United 
Nations was comprised solely of bread and sweetened tea, and meals for children reduced 
to two per day.42 Some 42 per cent of children in Al-Raqqa between the ages of six to 12 
months were recorded as anaemic.43 Moreover, in drought-affected areas, there has been an 
increase in the number of children attending medical centres for treatment of waterborne 
diseases, as well as nutrition-related illnesses.44 According to medical professionals 
consulted during the mission, the incidence of marasmus and kwashiorkor (diseases 
resulting from inadequate nutrition and protein intake, respectively) has also risen markedly 
since the beginning of the drought. The longer-term health-related sequelae of malnutrition 
and these associated illnesses are profound, and include, inter alia, immune compromise, 
growth retardation, and delayed mental development.   
</p>
<p>53. Throughout Syria, around 10 per cent of children under the age of five are currently 
recorded as being underweight.45 In 2006, the prevalence of moderate stunting was 22 per 
cent, and 10 per cent of children were considered as severely stunted for their age.46 These

</p>
<p>problems concerning nutrition illustrate that the right to health is closely related to, and 
dependent upon many rights, but in particular to the realization of the right to food. An 
adequate supply of safe food and nutrition is vital to achieve this right. However, this is not 
simply a matter of ensuring that an adequate quantity of food is supplied to persons in need. 
More efforts need to be taken to ensure the education of families, particularly mothers, 
around infants&#8217; and children&#8217;s nutritional requirements. Data indicates that children of 
mothers who have attended secondary or higher education are the least likely to be 
underweight and stunted, in comparison to children whose mothers received no education.47  
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur also notes that more needs to be done to promote infant 
nutrition, particularly breastfeeding for infants up to the age of six months. It is of particular 
concern that a number of common misconceptions result in repeated patterns of 
malnutrition amongst children: for instance, the practice of drinking tea from infancy 
onwards.48 The percentage of children who are adequately fed from birth up to 11 months is 
only around 25 per cent, and only 29 per cent of infants aged less than six months are 
exclusively breastfed in Syria.49 Again, marked differences in outcomes are noted between 
governorates, with Lattakia recording the best outcomes for adequate feeding between 0 
and 11 months (37 per cent), and Hassake the worst (16 per cent).50 It is encouraging that a 
nutrition surveillance programme has been recently established, but efforts need to be made 
to expand its reach to allow for comprehensive recording of the problem, particularly in the 
north-eastern governorates.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Right to health and stateless persons, and refugees 
</b></p>
<p>55. Syria is home to dozens of ethnic, linguistic, and cultural groups. While ethnic 
Arabs constitute about 80 per cent of the population, many other groups, such as Syrian 
Kurds, Turks, and Druze, make up substantial minority populations. Along with these 
minority groups who are considered to be Syrian nationals, Syria is currently home to 
millions of refugees from the occupied Palestinian territories, Iraq, Somalia, and elsewhere.  
</p>
<p>56. The principle of non-discrimination requires that all health services, goods and 
facilities must be accessible to all, including  refugees, internally displaced persons, 
minority populations, and stateless persons. However, the Special Rapporteur received 
personal testimonies that alleged discrimination based on ethnic origin or status.51  
</p>
<p>57. This section will discuss two such groups: approximately 300,000 Syrian of stateless 
approximately and millions of Iraqi refugees who fled to Syria in the aftermath of the 2003 
United States-led invasion of Iraq. The Constitution of Syria guarantees equal status to all 
people, regardless of their background, and does not allow for discrimination on any 
grounds when it comes to the provision of health goods and services. The Special 
Rapporteur notes with regret that in some instances due to their status a number of non-
citizens persons do not have equal access to health care, goods and services as Syrian 
nationals.

</b></p>
<p><b> A. Syrian Kurds 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur was informed that there are somewhere between 25-30 
million Kurds around the world, and they constitute one of the largest ethnic groups in the 
Middle East and North African region. The 1923 Treaty of Lausanne partitioned the former 
Ottoman Empire, and left the Kurdish population without a self-governed State. As a result, 
sizeable Kurdish minorities exist in modern-day Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Syria.52 In Syria, 
disaggregated date based on ethnicity is not officially collected by or available from the 
Government, and as a result it is difficult to obtain accurate numbers concerning the 
number of Syrian Kurds or any other minority group. However, estimates indicate that the 
Kurds in Syria account for approximately 8 to 15 per cent of the population.53 
</p>
<p>59. Over the course of the mission, the Special Rapporteur was told on numerous 
occasions by Government officials that, generally, Kurds in Syria are treated no differently 
than other Syrians. However, at the same time, many of these sources acknowledge that a 
sizeable group of stateless Kurds often face great difficulties in accessing health care, goods 
and services due to their statelessness, primarily because they lack proper forms of 
identification or have identification that makes clear their status as stateless.  
</p>
<p>60. In the 1960s, the Government began a process known as &#8220;arabization&#8221;, which sought 
to expand the influence and assert the primacy of Arab linguistic cultural traditions 
throughout the whole of Syria. As a complement to this process, in 1962, the Government 
mandated an impromptu census, unofficially known as the &#8220;Hasakah Census&#8221;.54 As a result 
of this census, somewhere between 120,000 and 150,000 Kurds were divested of their 
Syrian citizenship and effectively rendered stateless.55 The Syrian Government&#8217;s 
justification for doing so was to claim that this particular population of Kurds illegally 
entered Syria from Turkey and were therefore not Syrian nationals. However, there are 
numerous examples from immediately after the Hasakah Census where, even within 
nuclear families, people were given differing citizenship status. Today, this group&#8217;s 
numbers have grown to approximately 300,000; this is only an estimate.56   
</p>
<p>61. Within Syria, there are two groups of stateless Kurds, known as <i>ajaneb and 
maktumeen</i>.57  The <i>ajanib</i>, consisting of approximately 200,000 people, have been given 
red identity cards, which allows them a degree of access to medical facilities, goods, and 
services generally similar to that of other Syrian citizens. Of greater concern is the 
remaining group of approximately 100,000 people, <i>maktumeen</i>, who have no form of 
identification at all, and therefore their access to health care, goods and services is limited. 
As previously stated, due to the lack of disaggregated data, assessing the real size of the 
affected population is very difficult.   
</p>
<p>62. Reports regarding whether identification is necessary to access health goods and 
services are often contradictory. While it does not seem that identification must be 
presented to receive emergency care in public health centres, beyond this initial acceptance, 
specialized treatments (i.e. treatment for chronic diseases, cancer etc.) and care are often 
reported to be inaccessible.  In visits to primary care facilities in Aleppo and Al-Hassake, 
the Special Rapporteur repeatedly asked staff whether any identification was necessary for

</p>
<p>the purposes of treatment, and on all occasions the staff said it was not. While identification 
may not be required for the purposes of accessing treatment in Syrian public health-care 
centers per se, at various points the lack of such identification may pose a significant 
obstacle to access health care.  For example, in the case of a traffic accident an 
identification document will be required in order to access health care and file a report. 
People without identification are therefore easily identified as Kurds and &#8220;non-Syrians&#8221; and 
to that extent are vulnerable to discrimination, as would be the case for many minority 
populations.  
</p>
<p>63. Lack of identification documents often negatively affects enjoyment of other rights 
that are closely related to the enjoyment of the right to health. In reporting to the Committee 
on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights the Syrian Government indicated that in order for 
children to enroll in primary school proof of the parents&#8217; citizenship or legality of stay in 
Syria is needed.58 Moreover, stateless persons are not allowed to work in Syria.  
Restrictions and limitations on education, work, and other relevant factors obviously have a 
detrimental impact on the enjoyment of the right to health. Moreover, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that, under international customary law, everyone has a right to 
nationality and a right not to be arbitrarily deprived of his or her nationality59. 
</p>
<p>64. The Syrian Government, in particular its President, has repeatedly acknowledged the 
situation regarding persons without any form of identification and has also signalled his 
intention to resolve the situation.60 The Special Rapporteur commends these commitments, 
and hopes that concrete action is immediately taken to improve the situation of many 
persons whose enjoyment of fundamental rights has been impeded. In the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s opinion, this situation would take little time to correct, but would have a 
tremendous positive impact on the full enjoyment of human rights, including the right to 
health, of hundreds of thousands of people.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Refugees 
</b></p>
<p>65. Historically, Syria has been very welcoming to refugees such as Palestinian and 
Somali refugees.  Since the middle of the 20th century, the country has been home to over a 
million Palestinian refugees and many other groups. Since the United States-led invasion of 
Iraq in 2003, it is estimated that over a million Iraqis have fled Iraq for Syria.61  In each of 
these instances, and in particular after the 2003 Iraq War and ensuing sectarian conflict, 
Syria has done a commendable job ensuring the enjoyment of the right to health of these 
groups considering the limited resources at its disposal.  
</p>
<p>66. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has 
currently registered approximately 126,000 Iraqi refugees.62 This number is, of course, 
down from peak numbers, which were much higher five to six years ago. However by most 
accounts, the current registration number greatly underreports the actual number of Iraqis 
that remain in Syria.  Borders between the two countries are still rather porous, leading to

<p>ongoing movement of peoples between the two nations, although almost entirely from Iraq 
to Syria.   
</p>
<p>67. The size of the refugee population in Syria poses problems for the Government. 
These problems are, in part, alleviated by an extensive network of international support. 
The Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) and UNHCR have been providing Iraqi refugees 
with health services at local centres established, in part, just for this purpose. Care at these 
facilities is largely subsidized by UNHCR and Iraqis, so long as they are registered with 
UNHCR, pay only 25 Syrian pounds (approximately 50 US cents) per consultation. The 
Special Rapporteur was told by staff at these centres that Iraqis could also seek out care at 
Syrian public health-care facilities in the same manner as Syrian nationals would.  
</p>
<p>68. Moreover, although the primary health-care system provides a temporary solution to 
many primary health problems, longer-term solutions to the situation are still very much 
lacking.  For example, work permits are not given to refugees and asylum seekers in Syria, 
making them completely dependent on international assistance for their basic needs.63 The 
Iraqi refugee population in Syria is now mostly urbanized and no longer live in camps.  
Their inability to work creates a serious obstacle to access and community integration.  
</p>
<p>69. While delivery of primary health-care services may be handled adequately, many 
expensive, but necessary medical procedures, goods and medical devices are often not 
covered by the UNHCR and SARC centers. There are many examples of refugees needing 
prosthesis and other costly medical devices or procedures that must rely on charity and 
donation because such services and goods are too expensive to be covered by international 
assistance programmes.64    
</p>
<p>70. In general, the support of the Syrian Government in providing health care, goods and 
services for the very large Iraqi population living in Syria has been commendable. Not only 
has the State provided logistical support for these persons through assistance and 
facilitation of the SARC/UNHCR centers, but it also claims to allow Iraqis to be treated in 
Syrian public health-care facilities in the same way that Syrians are largely free of charge.   
</p>
<p>71. Due to continuing instability and violence in Iraq, the number of Iraqis returning 
home remains at a very low rate.  Regardless of the cause, if Iraqis continue to remain in 
Syria, long-term solutions need to be found to ensure their access to health care. Coupled 
with Syria&#8217;s extremely high fertility rates, the permanent addition of Iraqis to the national 
population will place an additional burden on an already strained public health system.   
</p>
<p><b> VII. Right to health and persons in detention 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Syrian Government for facilitating 
the visit to Adara prison in Damascus, and its medical facilities. It is of great importance 
that the Syrian prison system is becoming gradually open to international scrutiny. 
Remaining in the scope of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur will confine his comments 
and analysis only to the enjoyment of the right to health of persons in detention.  That said, 
the Special Rapporteur would like to encourage the Syrian Government to extend 
invitations and allow other special procedure mandate holders similar opportunities in the 
future.

<p>73. The enjoyment of the right to health implies that incarcerated persons are not to be 
discriminated against, and should receive special care in light of their vulnerability.  
General comment 14 indicates that the State has a specific legal obligation to respect the 
rights of prisoners, detainees, and other incarcerated persons, which includes abstaining 
from enforcing or promoting discriminatory practices. As prisoners are under complete 
control of the State, this applies to them during the entire period of incarceration.   
</p>
<p>74. The Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, an internationally 
agreed-upon set of guidelines regarding persons held in prisons and other forms of custody, 
also indicate the standard of health care which those incarcerated should receive.65 Rules 22 
through 26 make clear that prisons should follow certain procedures and provide certain 
services. The rules provide for the attendance of qualified medical and dental professionals 
servicing the institution; examination of prisoners upon admission, and whenever necessary 
thereafter; reporting of prison conditions by doctors to the director; and other similar 
matters.   
</p>
<p>75. Multiple Government ministries are responsible for the provision of health-care 
goods and services for the prison system. The Ministries of Interior and Health provide 
medical personnel and the Ministry of Social Affairs provides services of social workers. 
All information regarding the prison&#8217;s health-care workers was provided to the Special 
Rapporteur directly by the staff.  
</p>
<p>76. The prison that the Special Rapporteur was allowed to visit &#8211; the Adara prison, in 
Damascus &#8211; generally accommodates between 7000 and 8000 persons at any given time. 
There are 25 medical professionals on site.  The breakdown of these health-care workers is 
as follows: two general physicians, three dentists, and 16 nurses are provided for by the 
Ministry of Interior; two doctors are allotted by the Ministry of Health; and a rotating group 
of specialists all work in the facility.  The specialists include a cardiologist, 
ophthalmologist, psychologist, and others, all of whom visit the hospital separately on 
different days of the week.  
</p>
<p>77. Additionally, the prison has three lab technicians and a radiology unit for in-house 
diagnosis. In case of emergencies, the prison has four ambulances that take prisoners to the 
nearby health center for treatment. There is also an emergency doctor on prison grounds at 
all times. It is reported that there were generally between 15 &#8211; 25 emergencies daily. The 
Ministry of Social Affairs provides five social workers on-site to cover needs of the prison 
population on a daily basis. 
</p>
<p>78. Certain conditions and situations as described by the prison medical staff were cause 
for concern, especially in light of the Standard Minimum Rules.  For example, there is no 
routine examination provided to the prisoners upon admission.  In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
opinion, such a routine check is necessary, in order to accurately and adequate determine 
the incarcerated persons&#8217; health needs. Furthermore, people who use drugs were kept in 
unnecessary isolation from the rest of the prison population. Moreover, in cases of 
homosexual detainees, prison staff follow an isolation procedure, during which time these 
prisoners receive psychological &#8220;treatment&#8221; and are kept apart from the rest of the prison 
population for no reason besides their sexual orientation or gender identity. In each of these 
cases stigma is reinforced, vulnerable detainees are discriminated against, and there is a 
resulting deprivation of the enjoyment of the right to health without meaningful public 
health benefit. 
</p>
<p>79. Very little information is available concerning the health conditions in Syrian 
prisons. The facilities that the Special Rapporteur was allowed to see, however limited,

</b></p>
<p>were in generally good condition. Patients were being given appropriate treatment in 
general alignment with the right to health. It should be noted that no discussion with 
prisoners was conducted in conditions guaranteeing confidentiality. In general, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to encourage the Syrian Government to conduct a more thorough 
assessment of the realization of the right to health in Syrian prisons. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The Special Rapporteur was impressed with the advances that have been made 
in maternal and child health, particularly given the resource constraints faced by the 
Government, alongside challenges such as the continuing drought. The gains in 
respect of child mortality are particularly notable, and  exceed the targets set for the 
Millennium Development Goals. However, it remains clear that there is more to be 
done, particularly in key areas such as nutrition, family planning and women&#8217;s 
empowerment.  
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> Community participation in decision-making, an essential element of the right 
to health framework, is of great importance in achieving long-term gains in core 
areas, and in particular to further lower the maternal and child mortality rates. 
Community guided and led initiatives to raise awareness of these problems, and 
combat them through culturally appropriate methods, are vital. This is particularly 
true in to address the continuing discrepancy in outcomes between rural and urban 
centres. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to consider the following 
recommendations pertaining to the health-care system in its entirety: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Collect comprehensive, disaggregated data, to ensure that no specific 
ethnic or minority groups are disadvantaged or discriminated against in respect of 
access to health-care services; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Enable community participation in health-care service delivery through 
active engagement of civil society organizations in health-related policy-making at all 
levels of government; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Reconsider the need to maintain a state of emergency, which has 
remained in place since the 1960s, in view of its negative effects on the organization 
and participation of civil society in health-related policy-making; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d)  Ensure that access to medicines is protected by developing a plan to 
integrate and make use of all the appropriate TRIPS-flexibilities in light of possible 
accession to the WTO; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Conduct impact assessments of the proposed private insurance scheme 
with the assistance of international partners. 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to consider the following 
recommendations in the area of women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s health: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Develop and implement a consistent, nation-wide sexual and 
reproductive health education curricula, to be delivered through late primary and 
early secondary schools; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Increase efforts to close the gap between male and female enrolment 
rates throughout the entire education system; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Engage in legislative reform concerning early marriage, and initiate 
programmes designed to raise public awareness of this issue; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/17/25/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>(d) Increase efforts to contain the national fertility rate, particularly 
through implementation of comprehensive family planning services which include 
women in their design; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Seek to increase the number of ante-natal visits attended by woman 
during pregnancy, and consider establishment of a mechanism to ensure patients are 
given appropriate follow-up;   
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Invest increased resources in provision of health care during the post-
natal period, and develop mechanisms allowing for community involvement in 
establishing programmes that engage and empower women; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Seek immediate amendment of the Penal code provisions which 
discriminate against women, particularly those relating to instances of gender-based 
or family violence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Conduct research into the prevalence and nature of gender and family-
based violence nationwide, with a view to discovering the extent of the problem and 
taking steps to redress it;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Take urgent steps to address the issues relating to malnutrition 
throughout the country, particularly in children, through provision of food to the 
most marginalized and vulnerable groups affected by the drought, and through 
establishment of nation-wide education programmes concerning infant and child 
nutrition. 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to consider the following 
recommendations in the area of vulnerable and marginalized groups: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Grant all stateless Syrian Kurds citizenship to guarantee, inter alia, 
unhindered access to health-care services, and in the interim period ensure that all 
stateless persons are given forms of ID sufficient for them to access all health-care 
services they require; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Change requirements to allow Iraqis to work, at least temporarily in 
Syria, to reduce the burden on the State and international organizations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Seek assistance in obtaining increased external funding to ensure that 
the needs of the refugee population can be met, particularly in respect of expensive, 
non-elective medical procedures for refugees;  
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the Syrian Arabic Republic to consider the 
following recommendations in respect of incarcerated persons and prison health: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To urgently ratify the Convention Against Torture and its Optional 
Protocol; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To collect and publicly release comprehensive data relating to prisoners&#8217; 
health, and the health-care services with which they are provided; and 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To allow a more thorough assessment of the situation in prisons and 
other detention centres in Syria by inviting relevant special srocedures mandate 
holders.
