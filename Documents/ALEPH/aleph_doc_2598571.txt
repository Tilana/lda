Factors contributing to the above variances and the result for the financial year are as follows:
Revenue for ordinary activities
The Company’s Nickel Division generated $91,641,000 of revenue which was 54% down on the prior year. Sales 
revenue was lower from the 47% decrease in nickel contained in concentrate/ore sold (10,367 tonnes) over the 
previous  reporting  period  (19,547  tonnes)  following  the  cessation  of  mining  at  the  Lanfranchi  Nickel  Project  in 
August 2015 and the significantly lower nickel, copper and cobalt prices received on the sales of contained metal in 
concentrate/ore over the course of the period. The LME spot nickel price averaged A$5.82 per pound during the 
financial year, down 30% on the previous year’s equivalent LME average spot nickel price of A$8.34 per pound. 
The progressively weaker nickel price on a US$ basis until the June 2016 quarter, resulted in significant negative 
final invoice pricing (QP) adjustments being recognised during the financial year. Other revenue comprised interest 
income of $495,000.
(Loss) after tax from ordinary activities and (Loss) after tax attributable to members
Factors contributing to the result for the financial year are detailed and discussed in the “Operating and Financial 
Review”  section  of  the  Directors’  Report  for  the  financial  year  ended  30  June  2016,  which  accompany  this 
Preliminary Final Report.

Panoramic Resources Limited 
Directors' report 
30 June 2016 
(continued)
Operating and Financial Review (continued)
Revenue and Other Income
The Company’s Nickel Division generated $91,641,000 of revenue which was 54% down on the prior year. Sales 
revenue was lower from the 47% decrease in nickel contained in concentrate/ore sold (10,367 tonnes) over the 
previous reporting period (19,547 tonnes) following the cessation of production at the Lanfranchi Nickel Project in 
August 2015 and the significantly lower nickel, copper and cobalt prices received on the sales of contained metal in 
concentrate/ore over the course of the period. The LME spot nickel price averaged A$5.82 per pound during the 
financial year, down 30% on the previous year’s equivalent LME average spot nickel price of A$8.34 per pound. 
The progressively weaker nickel price on a US$ basis until the June 2016 quarter, resulted in significant negative 
final invoice pricing (QP) adjustments being recognised during the financial year. Other revenue comprised interest 
income of $495,000 and other income of $1,305,000 was made up of a gain on the disposal of the Mt Henry Gold 
Mine ($651,000), a gain on the re-estimation of the Copernicus site decommissioning and rehabilitation provision 
($433,000) and the sale of consumables and spare parts ($221,000). 
 
Cost of Production
Total aggregate direct costs of the Nickel Division were 37% lower than the previous financial year, due primarily to 
the  cessation  of  production  at  the  Lanfranchi  Nickel  Project  in  August  2015.  Included  in  direct  costs  was 
$16,496,000  in  one-off  redundancy  and  leave  entitlement  payments  to  employees  who  had  their  employment 
contracts  terminated  during  the  reporting  period  and  $6,652,000  for  a  non-cash  increase  in  the  provision  for 
inventory obsolescence against the carrying value of the Nickel Division’s warehouse spares.   
 
Other Expenses
The  majority  of  costs  in  “Other  expenses”  are  for  corporate  and  marketing  costs  ($8,565,000),  which  were  8% 
higher than the previous reporting period as a result of the $755,000 in one-off redundancy and leave entitlement 
payments to employees who had their employment contracts terminated during the period. 
 
Exploration and Evaluation Expenditure
Expenditure  on  greenfield  exploration  and  evaluation  ($2,358,000)  was  significantly  lower  than  the  previous 
financial year ($12,912,000), primarily as a result of the curtailment of exploration activities at the Lanfranchi Nickel 
Project and overseas. Exploration costs are expensed to the consolidated income statement until such time as a 
Resource under 2012 JORC (or oversea equivalent) has been determined on the area of interest. 
 
Impairment of Assets
In  response  to  the  sharp  fall  in  the  US$  nickel  price  and  the  uncertainty  around  the  timing  of  a  price  recovery, 
pre-tax  impairment  charges  of  $30,269,000  and  $12,020,000  were  made  over  the  reporting  period  against  the 
carrying  values  of  the  Savannah  Nickel  Project  and  Lanfranchi  Nickel  Project,  respectively.  Of  the  total  pre-tax 
impairment charge of $42,289,000, $37,616,000 was recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
 
As a result of a review of the carrying value of the Gum Creek Gold at 31 December 2015, a pre-tax impairment 
charge of $41,837,000 was made against the carrying values of the Project’s assets. 
 
Previously capitalised exploration expenditure of $1,924,000 was written-off during the financial year. 
 
Income Tax Benefit
Tax  benefit  of  $10,462,000  represented  an  effective  tax  benefit  rate  of  7%,  down  from  the  rate  of  29%  in  the 
previous  reporting  period.  There  was  no  tax  benefit  booked  on  the  impairment  loss  of  $79,453,000  as  the 
corresponding equivalent deferred tax asset was not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position 
at 30 June 2016.

Panoramic Resources Limited 
Directors' report 
30 June 2016 
(continued)
Review of Financial Condition 
Balance Sheet
Net Working Capital - current assets less current liabilities
The net working capital position of $21,408,000 was 58% lower than at the previous period end. The consolidated 
entity’s  operating  cash  flows  were  materially  impacted  by  (1)  the  costs  incurred  to  place  the  Lanfranchi  Nickel 
Project onto care and maintenance in the first half of the financial year, and (2) the reduction in concentrate sales 
revenue from the Savannah Nickel Project as a result of the significant falls in the A$ prices of nickel, copper and 
cobalt over the course of the fiscal year. Trade and other payables decreased by 87% over the reporting period as 
a direct result of the reduction in operational activity across the Nickel Division. 
 
The operating activities of the consolidated group (including royalty payments, greenfield exploration and net of the 
costs  of  running  the  Perth  and  Thunder  Bay  offices)  generated  a  net  cash  outflow  after  tax  of  $42,822,000. 
Cashflow from operating activities included a prior year income tax refund of $613,000. 
 
Net cash inflow from investing activities of $1,737,000, included the $17,811,000 in net proceeds from the sale of 
the Mt Henry Gold Project. From 1 April 2016, $1,803,000 has been used to cash back the drawn amount on the 
Company’s performance bond facility and is shown as a cash outflow in the consolidated statement of cash flows at 
30 June 2016. 
 
Net cash inflow from financing activities included $10,103,000 in net proceeds from the fully underwritten, pro-rata 
renounceable one for three rights issue at $0.10 per share undertaken by the Company in April 2016. 
 
Net Tax Balances
At  balance  date,  the consolidated  entity  had  a  net  deferred  tax  asset  value  of  $35,846,000.  Due  to  the current 
weakness  and  uncertain  outlook  in  the  US$  nickel  price,  this  asset  was  not  recognised  in  the  consolidated 
statement of financial position at 30 June 2016. 
 
Provision for Inventory Obsolescence
The consolidated entity’s provision for inventory obsolescence against the carrying value of warehouse spares was 
increased by $6,652,000 over the reporting period. 
 
Net Assets/Equity
The net asset position of the consolidated entity decreased 57% to $102,156,000 as a result of the reduction in net 
working capital and the decrease in total non-current assets following the booking of significant impairment losses 
against the assets of the Nickel Division and the Gum Creek Gold Project. 
 
Contributed  equity  increased  by  $10,103,000  after  the  Company  successfully  undertook  a  fully  underwritten, 
pro-rata renounceable one for three rights issue at $0.10 per share in April 2016. As a result of the capital raising, 
total ordinary shares on issue increased by 107,143,256 shares to 428,567,271 ordinary shares. 
 
Capital Structure
The debt to equity ratio (borrowings on contributed equity) at 30 June 2016 was 0.9% (2015: 1.8%).
Business and Financial Risks
Exposure to movements in nickel, copper and cobalt prices and the Australian dollar exchange rate to the United 
States dollar are significant business and financial risks in the Nickel Division. As a price-taker, the consolidated 
entity has no ability to control the global spot prices it receives for the sales of nickel concentrate and nickel ore. 
Any  negative  commodity  price  movement  directly  impacts  the  business  by  reducing  the  sales  revenue  the 
consolidated entity receives in United States dollars. Similarly, the conversion of sales revenue received in United 
States dollars into Australian dollars exposes the consolidated entity to movements in the foreign exchange rate 
between the Australian dollar and the United States dollar. If the Australian dollar is strong relative to the United 
States dollar at the time of conversion, the consolidated entity will receive less Australian dollar revenue.

30 June 2016 
(continued)
Review of Financial Condition (continued)
Hedging Policy
The consolidated entity has an active policy of limiting the exposure to nickel price risk and currency risk through 
limited hedging, namely:
•  For  nickel price  risk  of  both  the  Savannah  Project  and  the  Lanfranchi  Project,  the  policy  is  to  hedge,  when 
appropriate, no more than 80% (2015: 80%) of the payable nickel forecast to be produced in any month, over a 
rolling two year horizon. Any hedging is undertaken using a combination of nickel forward sales contracts and 
nickel put options, with nickel call options written and sold in order to offset the cost of bought nickel put options. 
Of the 80% maximum limit, the percentage of the combined nickel forward sales contracts and written nickel 
call options (but excluding purchased nickel put options) is to be no more than 40% (2015: 40%) of the payable 
nickel forecast to be produced in any month over the same rolling two year horizon; and
•  For currency risk, although not mandatory in the policy, when appropriate, sufficient foreign currency hedging 
on a month to month basis, via a combination of currency forward contracts and currency put and call options, 
to match the net United States dollar proceeds from nickel hedging using nickel forward sales contracts.
As at 30 June 2016, the consolidated entity had no nickel forward sales contracts and no nickel put options in place. 
 
As at 30 June 2016, the consolidated entity had no United States dollar denominated foreign exchange derivatives 
in place. 
 
Other  business  risks  can  have  an  impact  on  the  profitability  of  the  consolidated  entity.  The  recognition, 
management and control of these risks are key elements of the enterprise-wide risk management framework which 
has  been  progressively  developed  and  rolled-out  across  the  Group,  as  detailed  in  the  Corporate  Governance 
Statement on page 35.
Dividends
No final dividend has been declared for the financial year ended 30 June 2016.

During the financial year, Copernicus ore was mined and transported to the Savannah Nickel Project concentrator 
for  blending  and  processing  with  Savannah  ore.  Mining  of  ore  at  the  Copernicus  open-pit  was  completed  in 
February 2016 and rehabilitation of the Copernicus site was carried out between March and July 2016. 
Exploration and Development Projects
During  the  financial  year,  the  Group  continued  exploring  for  extensions  to  existing  Mineral  Resources  and  Ore 
Reserves  at  each  of  its  nickel  projects  together  with  exploration  on  the  Company’s  advanced  and  greenfield 
exploration projects within and outside Australia. 
 
Nickel Division
At the Savannah Nickel Project, the Company continued exploration activities on the Savannah North  Resource 
and  on  other  exploration  targets  within  the  mineral  tenements.  On  1  October  2015,  the  Company  released  an 
upgraded Savannah North Mineral Resource estimate of 6.88 million tonnes at a nickel grade of 1.59% for 109,600 
tonnes of contained nickel. The Resource estimate was based on less than 30% of the potential 2km mineralised 
footprint  of  Savannah  North.  Additional  drill  programs  in  2016  were  undertaken  to  test  for  extensions  to  the 
Resource. 
 
In January 2016, the Company released the Savannah North Scoping Study based on the October 2015 Mineral 
Resource estimate. This study demonstrates there is potential to add significant mine life at the Savannah Project 
through the development of Savannah North.   
 
On 28 April 2016, the Company released a maiden Mineral Resource estimate for the Lower Schmitz Project at 
Lanfranchi of 131,000 tonnes at a nickel grade of 5.1% for 6,700 tonnes of contained nickel. 
 
On 24 August 2016, the Company announced a material upgrade in the Savannah North Resource to 10.27 million 
tonnes at a nickel grade of 1.70% for 175,100 tonnes of contained nickel. 
 
Gold Division
Mt Henry Gold Project, Norseman, WA
On 31 July 2015, the Company sold its 70% interest in the Mt Henry Gold Project to Metals X Limited (“Metals X”) 
for 15,225,000 ordinary shares (after brokerage) in Metals X. The Company realised net proceeds of $17,811,000 
on the sale of the 15,225,000 shares in Metals X during the financial year.
Gum Creek Gold Project, Murchison region, WA (previously known as the Gidgee Gold Project)
In the first half of the financial year, geophysical data from a detailed ground gravity and airborne electromagnetic 
(VTEM)  survey  was  integrated  with  existing  magnetic  surveys,  geological  mapping  and  the  drill  hole  database 
identifying 14 new exploration targets. Four of these targets are associated with the Wilsons Shear Zone, and this 
mineral area was the subject of Induced Polarisation (“IP”) surveying in early 2016. Two  discrete IP chargeable 
anomalies have been subsequently identified for further exploration.

Panoramic Resources Limited 
Directors' report 
30 June 2016 
(continued)
Exploration and Development Projects (continued)
In  March 2016,  an updated  Scoping  Study on  the  project  was  released based on  the  processing of  free  milling 
open-pit  Resources  only.  The  results  of  the  Study  were  positive  and  demonstrate  a  project  with  potentially 
attractive economic outcomes. 
 
In  June  2016,  metallurgical  test  work  on  the  Wilsons  refractory  mineralisation  identified  a  potential  low  cost 
processing  route  utilising  mild  conditions  to  oxidise  floatation  concentrate,  achieving  high  gold  recoveries.  A 
number of areas for optimisation have been identified for future test work. 
 
In June 2016, following the release of the updated March 2016 Scoping Study, exploration results, encouraging 
metallurgical test work and the buoyant gold sector, the directors approved a process to partially divest the Gum 
Creek Gold Project by way of an initial public offering (“IPO”) on the Australian Stock Exchange (“ASX”) in order to 
fast track additional exploration and development studies.
Platinum Group Metals (PGM) Division
Thunder Bay North PGM ("TBN") Project, North-West Ontario, Canada
On  30  July  2014,  the  Company  signed  an  Agreement  with  Rio  Tinto  Exploration  Canada  Inc.  (“RTEC”)  which 
allowed RTEC to review all existing data on the TBN Project on an exclusive basis until December 2014. On 16 
January  2015,  the  Company  announced  that  RTEC had  exercised  its  right  under  the  Agreement  by  electing  to 
spend up to C$20 million (minimum spend of C$5 million before RTEC can withdraw) over the next five years to 
earn a 70% interest in the Project. During this period, RTEC is responsible for managing the Project and ensuring 
the TBN tenements are kept in good standing. 
 
During  the  financial  year,  RTEC  conducted  various  exploration  activities  on  the  TBN  Project  under  the  earn-in 
arrangement of the Agreement, which is continuing. 
 
Panton PGM Project, East Kimberley, WA
Early in the financial year, a trial was undertaken on Panton mineral samples to determine whether mined material 
could be economically upgraded using ore sorting prior to processing. The results of the ore sorting test work were 
encouraging and demonstrate that the ore can be upgraded, subject to further test work. In addition, the Company 
continued  its  $45,000  annual  sponsorship  of  research  by  a  post-graduate  student  of  Curtin  University  into 
alternative direct leaching technologies for smaller chromite rich PGM deposits. This research is due for completion 
in late 2018.
Corporate
The Company is limited by shares and is domiciled and incorporated in Australia. 
 
Significant events of the consolidated entity during the financial period of a corporate nature were as follows:
On-Market Share Buyback
On  15  December  2014,  the  Company  announced  its intention  to  conduct  an  on-market  share buyback of up to 
15.96 million shares. The buyback period ended on 14 December 2015. Over the twelve month period, a total of 
851,809  shares  in  the  Company  were  brought  back  at  an  average  share  price  of  $0.3909,  with  all  the  shares 
subsequently cancelled. 
 
Capital Raising
On 31 March 2016, the Company announced a fully underwritten, pro-rata renounceable one for three rights issue 
at  $0.10  per  share  to  raise  $10.7  million  before  costs.  The  Entitlement  Offer  closed  on  26  April  2016  with 
applications from the Company’s existing shareholders totaling approximately 78% of the 107.1 million new shares 
offered. The shortfall was fully underwritten. 
 
The  capital  raised  is  to  be  used  primarily  to  fund  further  exploration,  evaluation  and  development  at  Savannah 
North, evaluation studies on other projects and for working capital.

Corporate (continued)
Gum Creek Initial Public Offer (IPO)
To fast track exploration and development studies at the Gum Creek Gold Project, the directors resolved in June 
2016 to commence a process to partially divest the project by way of an IPO on the ASX. As at the date of this 
report, the indicative structure is to vend the Gum Creek Gold Project into a new listed entity for a consideration of 
$15,612,000 before costs in shares and to concurrently raise $15,000,000 of new equity via a priority entitlement to 
the Company’s existing shareholders as part of the compliance listing of the new entity. 
 
While  it  is  the  Company’s  intention  to  proceed  with  the  IPO,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  this  will  occur  and  the 
success of the IPO is dependent on prevailing market conditions. 
 
Employees
At the end of the financial year, the Group had 52 permanent, full time employees (2015: 413). 
 
Key Developments (Incorporating Significant Changes in the State of Affairs)
Significant changes in the state of affairs of the Consolidated Entity during the financial period were as follows: 
•  On 6 July 2015, the Company released an Exploration Target for the Lower Schmitz zones of mineralisation, 
being in the range of 275,000 to 746,000 tonnes at a nickel grade range of 5.0 to 6.0%. The announcement 
included  a  “Cautionary  Statement”  that  the  Lower  Schmitz  Exploration  Target  was  not  a  Mineral  Resource 
classified under 2012 JORC.
•  On 31 July 2015, the Company announced that it had sold its 70% interest in the Mt Henry Gold Project to 
Metals X Limited (“Metals X”) for 15,400,000 ordinary shares in Metals X (before a 1.5% commission which was 
payable in Metals X ordinary shares by the Company).
•  On 3 August 2015, the Company announced that as a result of a seismic event on 29 July 2015 in the vicinity of 
the Deacon orebody and the weakness in the nickel price, a curtailment in mining operations at the Lanfranchi 
Nickel Project, scheduled for later in 2015, had been brought forward. The Project was placed onto care and 
maintenance in November 2015 at the conclusion of Resource definition drilling on the Lower Schmitz orebody.
•  At  Savannah,  a  maiden  30  June  2015  Mineral  Resource  estimate  of  55,200  tonnes  of  contained  nickel  for 
Savannah  North  was  reported  on  11  August  2015.  The  Savannah  North  Mineral  Resource  estimate  was 
subsequently upgraded to 6.88 million tonnes at a nickel grade of 1.59% for 109,400 tonnes of contained nickel 
and reported on 1 October 2015.
•  On 14 December 2015, the Company’s On-Market Share Buyback scheme ended.
•  On  27  January  2016,  the  Company  announced  and  released  the  Savannah  North  Scoping  Study  which 
demonstrated  the  potential  to  add  significant  mine  life  at  Savannah  through  the  development  of  Savannah 
North.  The  announcement  included  a  “Cautionary  Statement”  that  the  Savannah  North  Scoping  Study  was 
based on low-level technical and economic assessments and was insufficient to support the estimation of Ore 
Reserves  or  to  provide  assurance  of  an  economic  development  case,  or  to  provide  certainty  that  the 
conclusions of the Scoping Study will be realised.
•  On 27 January 2016, the Company announced that due to the weak US$ nickel price and uncertainty around 
the timing of a price recovery, the Savannah Nickel Project was to be placed onto care and maintenance by the 
end of the financial year.
•
In  March  2016,  an  updated  Scoping  Study  on  the  Gum  Creek  Gold  Project  was  released  based  on  the 
processing of free milling open-pit Resources only. The announcement included a “Cautionary Statement” that 
the updated Gum Creek Scoping Study was based on low-level technical and economic assessments and was 
insufficient to support the estimation of Ore Reserves or to provide assurance of an economic development 
case, or to provide certainty that the conclusions of the Scoping Study will be realised.
•  On 29 March 2016, the full Federal Court handed down its decision on the appeal to the 21 November 2014 
Determination of native title in relation to the existence, enjoyment or exercise of native title rights held by the 
Ngadju  People  over  certain  tenements,  including  the  Lanfranchi  Nickel  Project  tenements.  The  Court 
overturned  the  initial  decision  and  confirmed  the  validity  of  the  relevant  tenements.  The  Ngadju  People 
subsequently filed applications for special leave to appeal to the High Court.
•  On 31 March 2016, the Company announced a fully underwritten, pro-rata renounceable one for three rights
issue at $0.10 per share to raise $10,714,000 before costs.
•  A maiden Mineral Resource estimate for Lower Schmitz of 131,000 tonnes at a nickel grade of 5.1% for 6,700
tonnes of contained nickel was released in the March 2016 Quarterly Report on 28 April 2016.

Key Developments (Incorporating Significant Changes in the State of Affairs) (continued)
•  On 28 June 2016, the directors resolved to commence a process to vend the Gum Creek Gold Project into a 
new listed entity for an indicative consideration of $15,612,000 before costs in shares and to concurrently raise 
$15,000,000  of  new  equity  via  a  priority  entitlement  to  the  Company’s  existing  shareholders  as  part  of  the 
compliance listing of the new listed entity on the ASX.
Matters subsequent to the end of the financial year
Savannah North Resource Upgrade 
 
On 24 August 2016, the Company announced a material upgrade in the Savannah North Resource to 10.27 million 
tonnes at a nickel grade of 1.70% for 175,100 tonnes of contained nickel.
In the interval between the end of the financial year and the date of this report,  apart from the matter mentioned 
above, there has not arisen any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature likely, in the opinion of 
the directors of the Company, to affect significantly the operations of the consolidated entity, the results of those 
operations, or the state of affairs of the consolidated entity, in future financial years. 
 
Business Strategies and Prospects (Incorporating Likely developments and expected results)
The Company’s primary goal is to mine its Resources profitably and return value to shareholders through capital 
growth and dividends.  The Company’s vision is to broaden its exploration and production base, with the aim of 
becoming a major, diversified mining house in the S&P/ASX 100 Index.
The  likely  developments  in  each  of  the  consolidated  entity’s  commodity  divisions  over  the  next  12  months  are 
highlighted below. 
 
Nickel Division
Subject  to  funding,  exploration  activities  will  continue  to  find  new  areas  of  mineralisation,  principally  at  and 
surrounding  the  Savannah  Nickel  Project  where  additional  Resource  definition  and  extensional  drilling  will  be 
undertaken on the Savannah North Mineral Resource. 
 
The  consolidated  entity  is  targeting  to  complete  a  Feasibility  Study  on  the  combined  Savannah  and  Savannah 
North  ore  bodies  during  the  next  financial  year  so  that  when  nickel  prices  have  sufficiently  recovered  on  a 
sustainable basis, the Savannah Nickel Project can re-start with a longer mine life and lower cost base. 
 
The  Company  will  continue  to  review  existing  Resources  and  Reserves  at  the  Lanfranchi  Nickel  Project  and 
consider options to unlock further value. 
 
Gold Division
The process to partially divest the Gum Creek Gold Project via an IPO and compliance listing of a new entity on the 
ASX will continue. 
 
Platinum Group Metals (PGM) Division
The consolidated entity will continue evaluation activities on the Panton PGM Project in the East Kimberley region 
of  Western  Australia  and  will  monitor  RTEC’s  activities  at  the  Thunder  Bay  North  PGM  Project    in  north-west 
Ontario, Canada. 
 
Further information about likely developments in the operations of the consolidated entity and the expected results 
of those operations in the future financial years has not been included in this report because disclosure would be 
likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the consolidated entity.
Shares Options
At the date of signing, there are no unissued ordinary shares of the Company under Option (2015: nil).
Indemnification of Auditors
To the extent permitted by law, the Company has agreed to indemnify the auditors, Ernst & Young (EY), as part of 
the  terms  of  its  audit  engagement  agreement  against  claims  by  third  parties  arising  from  the  audit  (for  an 
unspecified amount). No payments have been made to indemnify Ernst & Young (EY) during or since the financial 
year.

Indemnification and Insurance of Directors and Officers
The Company has agreed to indemnify the directors and senior executives against all liabilities to another person 
(other than the Company or a related body corporate) that may arise from their position as directors and officers of 
the Company, except where the liability arises out of certain wrongful acts for which the Company has not agreed to 
provide  indemnity.  The  agreement  stipulates  that  the  Company  will  meet  the  full  amount  of  any  such  liabilities 
including costs and expenses. 
 
During  the  financial  year,  the  Company  has  paid  premiums  of  $53,151  (2015:  $75,300)  in  respect  of  contracts 
insuring  all  the  directors  and  officers  against  legal  costs  incurred  in  defending  proceedings.  The  insurance 
premiums relate to:
(1)  Costs  and  expenses  incurred  by  the  relevant  officers  in  defending  legal  proceedings,  both  civil  and
criminal and whatever the outcome; and
(2)  Other liabilities that may arise from their position, with the exception of conduct involving a wilful breach of
duty or improper use of information or position to gain a personal advantage.

 (b)  Remuneration Philosophy 
The  performance  of  the  Company  depends  upon  the  quality  of  its  directors  and  executives.  To  prosper,  the 
Company must attract, motivate and retain highly skilled directors and executives.
To this end, the Company embodies the following principles in its remuneration framework:
•  Provide competitive rewards to attract high calibre executives; 
•  Link executive rewards to shareholder value and company profits; 
•  Significant portion of executive remuneration 'at risk', dependent upon meeting pre-determined
performance benchmarks; and
•  Establish appropriate and demanding performance hurdles in relation to variable executive remuneration.

2016 Remuneration Report (Audited) (continued) 
 (c)  Remuneration Committee 
The  Remuneration  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  is  responsible  for  determining  and 
reviewing compensation arrangements for the Managing Director and the senior executive team. 
 
The Remuneration Committee assess the appropriateness of the nature and amount of remuneration of executives 
on a periodic basis by reference to relevant employment market conditions, with the overall objective of ensuring 
maximum stakeholder benefit from the retention of a high quality, high performing and committed senior executive 
team. 
 (d)  Remuneration Structure 
In accordance with best practice corporate governance, the remuneration structure of the non-executive directors, 
and senior management, is separate and distinct. 
 (e)  Use of remuneration consultants 
Where  appropriate,  the  Remuneration  Committee  and  the  Board  seek  advice  from  independent  remuneration 
consultants to ensure the remuneration paid to the non-executive directors and senior management is appropriate 
and in line with the market. The Company did not receive independent remuneration advice during the financial 
year  as  defined  under  the  Corporations  Amendment  (Improving  Accountability  on  Director  and  Executive 
Remuneration). 
 (f)  Non-executive director remuneration policy 
(i) Fixed Remuneration
Objective
The Board seeks to set aggregate remuneration at a level which provides the Company with the ability to attract 
and retain directors of the highest calibre, whilst incurring a cost which is acceptable to shareholders.
Structure
The Company's Constitution and the ASX Listing Rules specify that the aggregate remuneration of non-executive 
directors shall be determined from time to time by a general meeting of shareholders. An amount not exceeding the 
amount determined is then divided between the directors as agreed. 
 
The  amount  of  aggregate  remuneration  sought  to  be  approved  by  shareholders  and  the  manner  in  which  it  is 
apportioned amongst directors is reviewed annually. The Board considers fees paid to non-executive directors of 
comparable  companies  when  undertaking  the  annual  review  process.  Each  director  receives  a  fee  for  being  a 
director of the Company. This fee is inclusive for each Board committee on which a director sits. 
 
In  recognition  of  the  significant  operational  changes  made  across  the  consolidated  entity  during  the 
financial  year, the Board reviewed and the non-executive directors agreed to accept a reduction in fees 
paid to non-executive directors on two separate occasions, in August 2015 and February 2016. As a result 
of  the  two  changes,  the  Non-Executive  Chairman’s  annual  remuneration  has  been  reduced  from 
approximately  $162,000  to  $90,000  per annum  (a  44%  net  reduction)  and  other  non-executive  director’s 
annual  remuneration  has  been  reduced  from  approximately  $113,000  to  $65,000  per  annum  (a  42%  net 
reduction). 
 
The fees paid to non-executive directors for the period ending 30 June 2016 are detailed in Table 1 on pages 22 
and 23 of this report. Fees for the non-executive directors are determined within an aggregate directors’ fee pool 
limit of $600,000, which was last approved by shareholders on 20 November 2007. 
 
(ii) Variable Remuneration
The Company does not reward non-executive directors with variable remuneration. Any shares in the Company 
that  are  held  by  non-executive  directors  at  the  date  of  this  report  are  separately  purchased  and  held  by  each 
director and have not been issued by the Company as part of each director’s remuneration package.

2016 Remuneration Report (Audited) (continued) 
 (g)  Executive Remuneration 
Objective
The Company aims to reward executives with a level and mix of remuneration commensurate with their position 
and responsibilities within the Company so as to:
•
reward executives for Company, operating segment and individual performance against targets set by 
reference to appropriate benchmarks;
•  align the interests of executives with those of shareholders; 
• 
•  ensure total remuneration is competitive by market standards.
link reward with the strategic goals and the performance of the Company; and
Structure
In determining the level and make-up of executive remuneration, the Remuneration Committee takes consideration 
of the current market levels of remuneration for comparable executive roles. 
 
It is the Remuneration Committee’s policy that employment contracts are entered into with the Managing Director 
and other key management personnel. Details of these KMP contracts are provided on pages 19 to 21. 
 
Remuneration consists of the following key elements:
•  Fixed Remuneration (base salary, superannuation and non-monetary benefits); 
•  Variable Remuneration:
- Short Term Incentive Bonus (‘STIB’); and 
- Long Term Incentive (‘LTI’).
The proportion of fixed remuneration and variable remuneration (potential short term and long term incentives) is 
established  for  each  senior  executive  by  the  Remuneration  Committee.  Table  1  on  page  22  and  23  details  the 
variable  component  (%)  of  the  Group’s  KMP.  Where  necessary,  when  the  payment  of  superannuation  on  an 
individual’s STI Bonus would cause the amount of superannuation in any financial year to exceed the applicable 
statutory  concessional  maximum  superannuation  contribution  limit,  at  the  individual’s  discretion,  an  equivalent 
amount of employer superannuation is added to the executive’s base cash salary. 
(i) Fixed Remuneration
Objective
The level of fixed remuneration is set so as to provide a base level of remuneration which is both appropriate to the 
position and is competitive in the market. Fixed remuneration is reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee 
and  the  process  consists  of  a  review  of  Company-wide,  business  unit  and  individual  performance,  relevant 
comparative  remuneration  in  the  market  and  internal  and,  when  appropriate,  external  advice  on  policies  and 
practices.  As  noted  above,  the  Remuneration  Committee  has  access  to  external  advice,  independent  of 
management.
Structure
Executives are given the opportunity  to receive their fixed (primary) remuneration in a variety of forms including 
cash and fringe benefits. It is intended that the manner of payment chosen will be optimal for the recipient without 
creating undue cost for the Company. 
 
In  recognition  of  the  significant  operational  changes  made  across  the  consolidated  entity  during  the 
financial  year,  the  Remuneration  Committee  reviewed  and  senior  executives,  with  a  base  salary  over 
$200,000 per annum, have agreed to accept a 10% reduction in base salary, effective 1 July 2016. 
 
The fixed remuneration component of the Group’s key management personnel is detailed in Table 1  on page 22 
and 23.

(ii) Variable Remuneration - Short-term Incentive Bonus (STIB)
Objective
The objective and intention of the executive STIB scheme is to encourage and provide a further incentive to 
executives to:
(a)  maximise the financial performance of the Company on a regular and consistent basis that is also
consistent with the Company’s Core Values; and
(b)  create and maintain a culture within all levels of the Company and Group such that the Company’s Core 
Values are accepted, supported and actively promoted by all the employees of the Company and Group.
The STIB scheme has been designed so as to provide sufficient incentive to the executives such that the cost to the 
Company is reasonable in the circumstances. 
 
Structure 
The current structure of the executive STIB scheme commenced from 1 January 2010.
Calculation of the STIB
The STIB is calculated annually at the end of the relevant financial year (“Relevant  Financial  Year”). The STIB 
comprises  two  parts  -  the  first  part  is  based  on  the  Company’s  financial  performance;  the  second  part  is 
discretionary and based on the extent to which the Company and the Group, Managing Director, executives, and all 
employees have acted and performed in a manner consistent with the Company and the Group Core Values during 
the Relevant Financial Year. The STIB is paid in the next Financial Year. 
 
STIB First Part - Cash Bonus based on Financial Performance
A  maximum  Cash  bonus  (excluding  statutory  superannuation)  will  be  paid  to  the  executives  if  certain  financial 
thresholds  are  met  by  the  Company  and  the  Group  during  the  Relevant  Financial  Year  (“Cash  bonus”).  The 
maximum Cash bonus will be calculated at the end of the Relevant Financial Year and paid in the next Financial 
Year  using  figures  obtained  from  the  audited  financial  statements  of  the  consolidated  entity  for  the  Relevant 
Financial Year, in accordance with the following formula:
CEXEC = [P - (E x 15%)] x 20%, where
CEXEC = the maximum Cash bonus to be paid to executives for the Relevant Financial Year; 
 
P = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (“EBIT”) of the Company (on a consolidated basis) for the Relevant Financial 
Year; 
 
E = the average of (1) the “Total Assets” line item of the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company (on a 
consolidated basis) for the Relevant Financial Year and (2) the “Total Assets” line item of the audited consolidated 
balance  sheet  of  the  Company  for  the  year  immediately  preceding  the  Relevant  Financial  Year.  “Total  Assets” 
includes current and non-current assets.

STIB Second Part - Discretionary Cash Bonus based on Core Values
In addition to the first part maximum STIB Cash bonus, the Company (in the sole and absolute discretion of the 
Remuneration  Committee)  may  pay  each  executive  on  a  case  by  case  basis,  a  Discretionary  Cash  bonus 
(“Discretionary  Cash  bonus”).  The  Discretionary  Cash  bonus  will  be  determined  at  the  end  of  the  Relevant 
Financial Year and paid in the next Financial Year taking into account the extent to which the Company, Managing 
Director,  executives,  and  all  employees  have  acted and  performed  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  Company’s 
Core Values during the Relevant Financial Year.
The Company’s Core Values are the core values of the Company as announced to the Australian Stock Exchange 
(“ASX”) from time to time by the Company, which as listed in the Managing Director’s employment contract, are:
•  Core Value One - to maintain and improve the Company’s safety culture so every employee believes that
safety is the Company’s most important value in line with the Company’s safety mantra: Vision, Commitment, 
Results:
•  Core Value Two - to optimise the Company’s metal production by focus on operations and the performance of
•  Core Value Three - to maintain a programme to grow the Company’s existing Resource and Reserve base; 
•  Core Value Four - seek to acquire additional assets so the Company pursues its aim to become a diversified
the management team;
mining house; and
the Company’s shares.
•  Core Value Five - maintain a steady return to Shareholders through dividends and/or increase in the value of
Maximum STIB
In addition to the executive STIB scheme, and subject to the financial and operational performance of the Company 
and  Group  in  the  Relevant  Financial  year,  the  Company  may  make  discretionary  STIB  cash  payments  to  the 
remaining employees of the Company and Group.
To take account of the aggregation of the two annual STIB cash payments, the Remuneration Committee has set a 
maximum  aggregate  STIB  Cash  pool  (including  statutory  superannuation)  for  the  Company  and  Group  to  be 
calculated at the end of the Relevant Financial Year using figures obtained from the audited consolidated financial 
statements of the Company for the Relevant Financial Year, in accordance with the following formula:
Cmax = P x 5%, where
Cmax = the maximum aggregate Cash bonus to be paid to all Company and Group employees for the Relevant 
Financial Year; 
 
P = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (“EBIT”) of the Company (on a consolidated basis) for the Relevant Financial 
Year.
Accrued and actual executive STIB payments
Actual STIB payments granted to each executive are made in the next Financial Year (usually in October (60%) 
and the following April (40%)), when the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the Relevant 
Financial Year are known and the maximum executive STIB Cash pool (CEXEC) has been determined.
2016 Financial Year
Based on the CEXEC calculation formula and forecast consolidated financial results, no aggregate executive STIB 
Cash bonus (First Part) was accrued in the 2016 consolidated financial statements. In addition, no Discretionary 
Cash bonus (Second Part) has been approved for payment in relation to the 2016 financial year.
2015 Financial Year
Based on the CEXEC calculation formula and forecast consolidated financial results, no aggregate executive STIB 
Cash bonus (First Part) was accrued in the 2015 consolidated financial statements. In addition, no Discretionary 
Cash bonus (Second Part) has been approved for payment in relation to the 2015 financial year.
The short term incentive variable remuneration component of the Group’s KMP is detailed in Table 1 on pages 22 
and 23.

Under  the  structure,  executives  and  senior  employees  will  be  invited  each  year  to  receive  a  new  grant  of 
performance  rights  to  shares  every  year  under  the  2010  ES  Plan,  such  that  the  LTI  grant  will  now  form  a  key 
component of their remuneration package. The LTI dollar value that senior executives and other senior employees 
will be entitled to receive is set at a fixed percentage of their annual Fixed Remuneration (base salary plus statutory 
superannuation) and will range from 17% to 100% of Fixed Remuneration depending on level and seniority and 
market conditions. The number of performance rights  to shares to be granted is determined by dividing the LTI 
dollar value by the fair value (“FV”) of one performance right (as determined by an independent valuer). For the 
FY2016 grant of performance rights, the FV at 1 July 2015 was externally determined at $0.208. 
 
Performance Conditions
Performance rights will vest subject to meeting service and performance conditions as defined below:
•  75%  of  the  performance  rights  will  be  performance  tested  against  the  relative  total  shareholder  return
(“TSR”) measure over a 3 year period; and
• 25% of the performance rights will be performance tested against the reserve/resource growth over a 3 year
period.
The performance conditions above that were endorsed by the Board and subsequently approved by shareholders 
on 30 July 2014, were chosen as they matched similar split performance conditions used in LTI Plans of other ASX 
listed resource companies.

companies: 
 
- Altona Mining Limited 
- Aurelia Metals Limited 
- CuDeco Limited 
- Heron Resources Limited 
- Hillgrove Resources Limited 
- Hot Chili Ltd

There will be no retesting of performance hurdles. It is only if one or both of these performance hurdles are passed 
and the 3 year service condition is met that the performance rights can be exercised into Shares.
No Hedging Contracts on LTI Grants
The Company does not permit executives to enter into contracts to hedge their exposure to options or performance 
rights  to  shares  granted as part  of  their  remuneration  package.  This  policy  is strictly  enforced  by  the  Managing 
Director under the Company’s Share Trading Policy detailed in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 33.
Table 3 on page 24 provides details of performance rights to shares granted as compensation to the Managing 
Director and the named executives.

Employment Contracts 
 
The common key features of the above named executives’ employment contracts are:

Corporate governance statement 
30 June 2016
Corporate Governance Statement 
 
The Board of Directors of Panoramic Resources Limited (“the Board”) is responsible for the corporate governance 
of the Company. The Board guides and monitors the business and affairs of Panoramic Resources Limited on 
behalf of the shareholders by whom they are elected and to whom they are accountable. The Company’s Corporate 
Governance Statement (“Statement”) outlines the main corporate governance practices in place throughout the 
financial year, which comply with the Australian Stock Exchange (“ASX”) Corporate Governance Council’s (“CGC”) 
Third Edition (March 2014) of the “Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (“the 
Recommendations”), unless otherwise stated.
As  required  under  ASX  Listing  Rule  4.10.3,  the  Company  makes  the  following  Board  approved  disclosures  in 
relation to each of the Recommendations as at 30 June 2016.
Principle 1: Lay Foundations for Management and Oversight
Primary Role of the Board 
 
The Board’s primary role is the protection and enhancement of long-term shareholder value.
Board Operation 
 
To  ensure  the  Board  is  well  equipped  to  discharge  its  responsibilities,  as  substitute  for  a  Board  Charter  it  has 
established  written  guidelines  for  the  operation  of  the  Board.  A  written  guide  on  the  roles  of  the  Board  and 
committees sets out the overriding functions and responsibility of the Board, while a second guide sets out  more 
specific guidelines on the statutory roles and on the separate duties of the Managing Director to the rest of the 
Board. In addition, Article 11 of the Company’s Constitution (November 2008) (“Constitution”) details the specific 
powers and duties of directors as empowered on them by the Company’s shareholders. All these documents can 
be  accessed  on  the  Company’s  website  at  www.panoramicresources.com  under  the  Corporate  Governance 
section.
Board Processes 
 
The Board is responsible for the overall Corporate Governance of the Company including the strategic direction, 
establishing  goals  for  executive  management  and  monitoring  the  achievement  of  these  goals.  The  Board  has 
established a framework for the management of the Company and its controlled entities, a framework which divides 
the functions of running the Company between the Board, the Managing Director and the senior executives. The 
Board has put in place a system of internal control, a pro-active business risk management process, and has the 
task of monitoring financial performance and the establishment of appropriate ethical standards. The agenda for 
meetings of the Board is prepared by the Managing Director. Standard items include the project reports, financial 
reports, strategic matters, governance and compliance. Submissions are circulated in advance. Senior executives 
are regularly involved in Board discussions. 
 
The Company Secretary of the Company is directly accountable to the Board, through the Chairman, on all matters 
to do with the proper functioning of the Board. 
 
Roles of Management and the Evaluation of Management Performance 
 
The Managing Director and the senior executives are ultimately responsible and accountable for the day to day 
running of the Company and for implementing the strategic objectives and operating within the risk appetite set by 
the Board. The Board regularly reviews the division of functions between the Board and the senior executives. The 
Board  has  in  place  a  performance  appraisal  and  remuneration  system  for  the  Managing  Director  and  senior 
executives designed to enhance performance and Management performance is reviewed on an annual basis at the 
end of each calendar year and as appropriate. The last performance appraisal of the Managing Director and senior 
executives was undertaken by the Remuneration Committee in June 2016. The criterion for the evaluation of the 
Managing Director and of each executive is their performance against key performance indicators, behavior and 
effectiveness in role. In addition, the Board monitors and evaluates the performance of the Managing Director and 
senior executives as appropriate.

Principle 1: Lay Foundations for Management and Oversight (continued)
Appointment of Directors and Management
The  Company  has  in  place  an  appropriate  organisational  and  management  structure  to  ensure  the  day  to  day 
running of the Company is undertaken in an effective and efficient manner and to ensure the Company has the right 
mix of skills and resources to implement and achieve the Board’s corporate and strategic objectives. The Board 
and the Managing Director regularly reviews this structure to determine that it is appropriate and “fit for purpose” 
and if necessary make changes in the number of roles and personnel. 
 
The directors and senior executives have a clear understanding of their duties, roles and responsibilities and of the 
expectations  of  them,  as  contained  within  a  written  agreement  agreed  and  signed  by  the  Company  and  each 
director and senior executive. 
 
The Board reviews its composition as required to ensure that the Board has the appropriate mix of commercial, 
financial  and  mining  skills,  technical  expertise,  industry  experience,  and  diversity  (including,  but  not  limited  to 
gender and age) for which the Board is looking to achieve in its membership. When a vacancy exists, for whatever 
reason, or where it is considered that the Board would benefit from the services of a new director with particular 
skills, candidates with the appropriate experience, expertise and diversity are considered. Under the direction and 
supervision  of  the  Chair,  appropriate  background  checks  are  undertaken  of  each  candidate  as  to  the  person’s 
character, experience, education, criminal record and bankruptcy history. Each incumbent director is encouraged, 
and given the opportunity to meet with each candidate on a one to one basis. The full Board then appoints the most 
suitable  candidate  who  must  stand  for  election  at  the  next  general  meeting  of  shareholders.  For  the  meeting, 
shareholders are given sufficient information of the new director, including but not limited to biographical details, 
other listed directorships currently held and in the case of a director standing for election for the first time, advice 
that appropriate background checks have been undertaken.
Diversity Policy
The Company has in place a Diversity Policy which provides the written framework and objectives for achieving a 
work environment that values and utilises the contributions of employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences, 
and  perspectives,  irrespective  of  gender,  age,  ethnicity  and  cultural  background.  The  Board  is  responsible  for 
developing, where possible, measurable objectives and strategies to support the framework and objectives of the 
Diversity  Policy.  The  Remuneration  Committee  is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  progress  of  the  measurable 
objectives through various monitoring, evaluation and reporting mechanisms. 
 
Apart from participation rates established for indigenous employment at the Savannah nickel project prescribed 
under  the  2007  Savannah  Co-Existence  Agreement  (and  as  reported  below),  the  Board  has  not  determined 
measurable objectives on gender diversity across the workplace and at the Board level. In  the coming financial 
year, the Board is to continue to oversee the development of new programs to achieve a broader pool of skilled and 
experienced senior management and Board candidates, and if deemed appropriate, identify future and targeted 
measurable objectives and strategies on gender diversity.

Pursuant to Recommendation 1.5 of the Recommendations, the Company discloses the following information as at 
the date of this report: 
 
• Percentage of women and men employed within the Group - women: 10%; men: 90%; 
• Percentage of women and men employed as a senior executive - women: nil; men: 100%; 
• Percentage of women and men employed at the Board level - women: nil; men: 100%; and

The  Company  has  defined  an  employee  who  is  a  senior  executive  as  a  person  who  is  a  “senior  manager”  as 
defined in Section 9 (Definitions) of the Corporations Act 2001, namely a person who is at the highest management 
level of the Company who “makes, or participates in making decisions that affect the whole, or a substantial part, of 
the business of the corporation; or has the capacity to affect significantly the corporation’s financial standing”. The 
performance  appraisal  of  a  senior  executive  is  performed  by  the  Managing  Director  and  the  Remuneration 
Committee. 
 
The  Diversity  Policy  can  be  accessed  on  the  Company’s  website  at  www.panoramicresources.com  under  the

Performance Assessment of the Board, its Committees and Individual Directors
Currently, there is no formal annual performance appraisal system in place for Board performance on a director by 
director basis. The last performance appraisal was conducted at a meeting of directors in May 2015, where time 
was set aside in which each director gave a performance appraisal on the Board as a whole and on themselves. 
The Board has agreed to conduct these performance appraisals on a regular basis while the search for a suitable 
formal  performance  appraisal  system  is  undertaken.  Membership  of  the  Audit  Committee  by  non-executive 
directors is initially for a three year period, with an annual renewal review thereafter with performance being one 
criteria in order to retain office.
Principle 2: Structure the Board to Add Value
Board Composition
The composition of the Board is determined using the following principles:
•  The Board currently comprises four directors. Under Article 10 of the Company’s Constitution, this number 
may be increased to a maximum of ten directors where it is required due to a commercial alliance, or felt 
that additional expertise is required in specific areas, or when an outstanding candidate is identified;
•  The Board should comprise directors with a broad range of expertise with an emphasis on commercial,
exploration, mining and project development related experience; and
•  Directors appointed by the Board are subject to election by shareholders at the following annual general 
meeting and thereafter directors (other than the Managing Director) are subject to re-election at least every 
three years. The tenure of executive directors is linked to their holding of executive office.
The name, position, independence classification, qualification, skills and length of service of each director of the 
Company in office at the date of the Statement is:

# Peter R Sullivan is a non-executive director of a substantial shareholder holding more than 5% of the  ordinary shares in the 
Company  and  as  a  consequence  has  been  assessed  as  not  being  independent  under  the  independence  criteria  detailed  in 
Recommendation 2.3 of the Recommendations.

Principle 2: Structure the Board to Add Value (continued)
Nomination committee
Due to the size of the Board and the small senior executive team, the Board has determined there is no benefit, at 
this time, of establishing a nomination committee. The functions of the nomination committee are performed by the 
Board as a whole, when required, using the principles for setting the composition of the Board.
Directors' Independence
The composition of the Board is considered to be appropriate for a Company that had and subject to a recovery in 
base metal prices, will, in all likelihood, again have a sustainable producing business. In addition, the Company 
remains active in reviewing, acquiring and developing new projects. As at the date of this Statement, the majority of 
non-executive directors, including the Chairman, are considered independent of management, have no interest, 
position,  association  or  relationship  that  would  compromise  their  independence  and  directly  or  indirectly, 
individually hold less than 5% of the issued ordinary shares of the Company. A review of the independence criteria 
detailed in Recommendation 2.3 of the Recommendations in relation to each non-executive director is made on a 
regular basis and when appropriate.
Director Education
The  non-executive  directors  are  given  every  opportunity  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the  business,  the 
industry, and the environment within which the Company operates, and are given access to continuing education 
opportunities to update and enhance their skills and knowledge. Directors visit each mining operation at least once 
a year, and meet with executives on a regular basis to enable directors to maintain an understanding of the roles 
and responsibilities of executives and of the culture and values within the Company.
Conflict of Interest
In  accordance  with  Section  191  of  the  Corporations  Act  2001  and  Article  10.13  of  the  Company’s  Constitution, 
directors must keep the Board advised, on an ongoing basis, of any interest that could potentially conflict with those 
of the Company. Where the Board believes that a significant conflict exists, the director concerned does not receive 
the relevant board papers and is not present at the meeting whilst the item is considered.
Independent professional advice
Each director has the right of access to all relevant Company information and to the Company’s executives and, 
subject  to  prior  consultation  with  the  Chairman,  may  seek  independent  professional  advice  at  the  Company’s 
expense. A copy of the advice received by the director is made available to all other members of the Board.
Board Committees
To  facilitate  the  execution  of  its  responsibilities,  the  Board’s  Committees  provide  a  forum  for  a  more  detailed 
analysis of key issues. Each Committee is entitled to the resources and information it requires to carry out its duties, 
including direct access to advisors and employees. Membership of the current Committees of the Panoramic Board 
and the number of times each Committee met during the financial year are set out in the Directors’ Report. The 
names and functions of each Committee is set out below:
•  Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee consists of all non-executive directors and is chaired by an independent director who is not 
the  Chairman  of  the  Board.  The  Audit  Committee  is  to  oversee  the  financial  reporting  process  to  ensure  the 
balance, transparency and integrity of published financial information. The Audit Committee is also to review: the 
effectiveness  of  internal  controls,  recommendation  and  the  appointment  and  assessing  the  performance  of  the 
external auditor; the Company’s process for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations affecting financial 
reporting and, if applicable, its code of business conduct. The Audit Committee operates under an Audit Committee 
Charter that is reviewed by the Committee and is re-approved or changed by the full Board on a bi-annual basis.

•  Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee consists of all non-executive directors and is chaired by an independent director. 
The  role  of  the  Remuneration  Committee  is  to  review  remuneration  packages  and  policies  applicable  to  the 
Managing Director, other executive directors (if applicable) and senior executives and to monitor the scope and 
currency of the Company’s Diversity Policy. The remuneration of executive directors is determined by reference to 
relevant  employment  market  conditions  and  of  the  attainment  of  defined  Company  goals.  The  remuneration  of 
senior  executives  is  determined  by  the  Remuneration  Committee  based  on  recommendations  provided  by  the 
Managing  Director.  Remuneration  levels  are  competitively  set  to  attract  the  most  qualified  and  experienced 
directors and senior executives. The Remuneration Committee obtains independent advice on the appropriateness 
of remuneration packages.
There  is  increased  transparency  and  accountability  in  remuneration  matters  as  required  in  the  Improving 
Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration Bill 2011. There are now rules for engaging remuneration 
consultants  and  on  reporting  specific  information  about  remuneration  consultants  in  the  audited  Remuneration 
Report  in  the  Directors’  Report.  The  Company’s  audited  2016  Remuneration  Report  includes  these  reporting 
obligations.
Further details on the Committee and of remuneration arrangements in place for the directors and executives are 
set out in the Directors’ Report.
•  Environment, Safety and Risk Committee 
The Environment, Safety and Risk Committee consist of all directors and is chaired by an independent director. The 
role of the Environment, Safety and Risk Committee is to oversee and monitor the effectiveness of the Group’s 
strategies and systems to ensure that the Company complies with external and internally accepted standards for 
the impact of business activities on the environment, the safety and well being of employees, and on the control and 
management of the key risks facing the business. Where possible, the Committee meets during Board visits to the 
mining operations whereby the members of the Committee are able to directly inter face with the senior managers 
responsible for environmental issues, occupational health and safety and the control and mitigation of non-financial 
risks. The Committee also nominates a non-executive director to attend and be actively involved in the Group’s 
safety conferences. The Committee operates under an Environment, Safety and Risk Committee  Charter that is 
reviewed by the committee and is re-approved or changed by the full Board on a bi-annual basis.
The Committee Charter can be accessed on the Company’s website at www.panoramicresources.com under the 
Corporate Governance section.
Principle 3: Act Ethically and Responsibly
All  directors,  executives,  managers  and  employees  are  expected  to  act  with  the  utmost  integrity,  honesty  and 
objectivity,  striving  at  all  times  to  enhance  the  performance  and  reputation  of  the  Company  and  its  controlled 
entities.
Code of Conduct
The Company has established a written Code of Conduct which outlines the culture, practices, expected conduct,

Principle 4: Safeguard Integrity in Corporate Reporting
The Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer are required to state in writing to the Audit Committee and the 
Board that the Company’s and Group’s financial reports present a true and fair view, in all material aspects, of the 
Company’s and Group’s financial condition and that operational results are in accordance with relevant accounting 
standards. Pursuant to Section 295A of the Corporations Act 2001, the Managing Director and the Chief Financial 
Officer are required to provide written certification to the Board, at both the end of the Half-Year and the Full-Year 
reporting  periods,  that  the  Company’s  financial  reports  are  based  on  a  sound  system  of  risk  management  and 
internal control and that the system is operating effectively.
The  Audit  Committee  reviews  all  final  draft  external  financial  reports  with  the  external  auditor  and  makes 
recommendations on their adequacy to the Board prior to their release to shareholders, investors and other public 
forums.  There  is  regular  communication  between  the  Audit  Committee,  management  and  external  auditor.  In

adequacy  of  the  Company’s  internal  control  and  financial  risk  management  systems,  accounting  and  business 
policies.
Principles 5 : Make Timely and Balanced Disclosure
Continuous Disclosure and Shareholder Communication
The  Company  is  committed  to  providing  relevant  up  to  date  information  to  its  shareholders  and  the  broader 
investment community in accordance with the continuous disclosure requirements under the ASX Listing Rules and 
the Corporations Law.
The Company has a Continuous Disclosure Policy that all shareholders and investors have equal access to the 
Company's information. This policy has been updated and approved by the full Board to comply with the May 2013 
amendments to ASX Listing Rule 3.1 and updated Guidance Note 8 (August 2015) of the Recommendations. This 
document and all material announcements provided to  the ASX can be accessed on the Company’s website at 
www.panoramicresources.com.
The  Company  has  appointed  the  Company  Secretary  to  oversee  the  continuous  disclosure  practices  of  the 
Company and its controlled entities. His responsibilities include:
•  Reviewing all statutory regulatory or tender reports submitted to or made by the Company and its controlled
entities, and to report or recommend to the Board as appropriate;
•  Ensuring compliance with continuous disclosure requirements; 
•  Overseeing and coordinating the disclosure of information to the ASX, analysts, brokers, shareholders, the
media and public; and
•  Educating directors and staff of the Company’s and Group’s disclosure policies and procedures and raising
awareness of the principles of the underlying continuous disclosure.
Principles 6: Respect the Rights of Security Holders
Continuous Disclosure and Shareholder Communication
The  Board  in  adopting  a  Continuous  Disclosure  Policy  ensures  that  shareholders  are  provided  with  up  to  date 
Company  information.  Communication  to  shareholders  is  facilitated  by  the  production  of  the  annual  report, 
quarterly  reports,  public  announcements,  and  the  posting  of  policies,  and  ASX  releases  immediately  after  their 
disclosure to the ASX, on the Company’s website. All shareholders are given the option to receive communications 
from, and send communications to, the Company and Share Registry electronically. In addition, all shareholders 
are encouraged to attend the Annual General Meeting and use the opportunity to  ask questions to management 
following  the  Managing  Director’s  presentation.  The  Company  makes  every  endeavour  to  respond  to  the  most 
commonly  asked  questions.  The  external  auditor  attends  the  meeting  and  is  available  to  answer  questions  in 
relation to the conduct of the audit.

Principle 7: Recognise and Manage Risk
The  Board  believes  that  risk  management  and  compliance  are  fundamental  to  sound  management  and  that 
oversight of such matters is an important responsibility of the Board. The Company has significantly changed the 
risk management framework through the progressive development of an enterprise-wide software database on the 
inherent risks and risk mitigation strategies identified across all functions of the business, including occupational, 
health, safety and environment (OHS&E). This Board sanctioned approach is in accordance with Australian/New 
Zealand Standard for Risk Management (AS/NZS 4360 2004) and is aligned to the control framework for enterprise 
risk management prepared by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) 
in 2001. The framework involved the Company undertaking a comprehensive review  in  2011/12 of the  different 
elements across the various financial, administrative and operational functions at the Company’s mine sites and 
Perth  office  and  in  identifying  the  risks  inherent  in  each  element  and  the  appropriate  risk  management  internal 
controls,  systems  and  response  procedures  to  mitigate  their  impact  on  strategic,  operational  and  financial 
performance. For example, there are a number of risks the Company’s sites are exposed to that are both common 
to the mining industry and unique due to location such as, but not limited to:
customer declaration of force majeure;
future delivery against committed financial derivatives; and 
regulatory constraints, compliance, the impact of climate change and natural disasters.
•  exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and the United States currency foreign exchange rate; 
• 
•  health, safety, industrial and environment matters; 
•  production capacity; 
• 
• 
 
The 2011/12 review also examined the effectiveness of internal controls, systems and response procedures that 
were  in  place  in  previous  years.  This  comprehensive  review  on  each  element  and  function  across  the  Group, 
including  the  setting  of  various  risk  appetite  tolerance  thresholds  by  senior  management  was  completed  in 
mid-2012, followed by approval by the full Board of the Risk Management Guideline (August 2012) which detailed 
on the enterprise wide risk management framework and the process, roles and responsibilities for conducting each 
new comprehensive review.
In  2014/15,  the  Company  conducted  a  new  comprehensive  review  using  the  procedures  set  down  in  the  Risk 
Management  Guideline,  including  the  re-setting  of  various  risk  appetite  tolerance  thresholds  by  senior 
management, which resulted in the production of new Risk Appetite Statements (May 2015), Risk Management 
Policy (May 2015) and an updated Risk Management Guideline (“Guideline”) that was approved by the full Board in 
June  2015.  A  condensed  version  of  the  updated  Guideline  is  available  on  the  Company’s  website  at 
www.panoramicresources.com.
The  Board  has  established  a  committee  of  the  Board,  the  Environment,  Safety  and  Risk  Committee,  which  is 
chaired by an independent director. All directors of the Board are also members of the Committee. The number of 
times the Committee met during the financial year is contained in the Directors’ Report. The Committee’s Charter 
(November  2015)  states  that  the  Committee  will  oversee  the  Company’s  management  of  financial  and 
non-financial risks at the operations in accordance with the established risk management framework while always 
taking into account the Company’s legal obligations set by the Federal and State statutory law makers on, but not 
limited to, environment, employment and occupational health and safety.
There  are  strict  Company-wide  compliance  reporting  requirements  under  the  Guideline  that  require  each 
department  head/function  manager  on  an  annual  basis  to  review  their  risk  registers  to  determine  the  level  of 
compliance (from zero to 100%) using a risk matrix score for impact, tolerance and opportunity, thereby ensuring 
that  either  a  risk(s)  has  not  developed  a  higher  risk  profile,  or  outlining  monitoring  and  corrective  measures  to 
reduce the risk(s) to an acceptable level. Using this information, each operations manager is required to complete 
and provide a Project Risk Summary and Compliance Report during the Full-Year audit process.
In 2015/16, the compliance reporting requirements detailed above were undertaken on a more limited basis at each 
mine site as a consequence of the nickel operations being currently on care and maintenance.

Principle 7: Recognise and Manage Risk (continued)
The  reporting  and  control  mechanisms,  together  with  the  assurances  of  the  Environment,  Safety  and  Risk  and 
Audit Committees, in the absence of an internal audit function, support the written certification at the end of the 
Half-Year and Full-Year reporting periods, in accordance with Section 295A of the Corporations Act 2001 given by 
the Managing Director and the Chief Financial Officer to the Board certifying that the Company’s financial reports 
are based on a sound system of risk management and internal control and that the system is operating effectively.
Principle 8: Remunerate Fairly and Responsibly
Board Remuneration
The total annual remuneration paid to non-executive directors may not exceed the limit set by the shareholders at 
an annual general meeting (currently $600,000). The remuneration of the non-executive directors is fixed rather 
than variable.
Executive Remuneration
The Board has established a committee of the Board, the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee 
provides recommendations and direction for the Company’s remuneration practices. The Committee ensures that a 
significant  proportion  of  each  executive’s  remuneration  is  linked  to  his  or  her  performance  and  the  Company’s 
performance. Performance reviews are conducted regularly to determine the proportion of remuneration that will be 
at ‘risk’ for the upcoming year. The Company’s executives can participate in a performance share rights plan that is 
linked to the Company’s performance (on both a relative share price and resources and reserves growth basis) 
against  its  peers  in  the  resources  industry.  The  Committee  also  ensures  that  there  is  no  discrimination  on 
remuneration in respect to gender. 
 
Further details in relation to director and executive remuneration are set out in the 2016 Remuneration Report on 
pages 12 to 26.

Report on the financial report
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Panoramic Resources Limited, which comprises the 
consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the consolidated income statement, the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and 
the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes comprising a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration of the 
consolidated entity comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the year's end or from time to 
time during the financial year.
Directors' responsibility for the financial report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true 
and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for 
such internal controls as the directors determine are necessary to enable the preparation of the financial 
report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In Note 1, the directors also 
state, in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, that the 
financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor's responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with 
relevant ethical requirements relating to audit engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error. In making 
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal controls relevant to the entity's preparation and fair 
presentation of the financial report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's 
internal controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and 
the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations Act 
2001.  We have given to the directors of the company a written Auditor’s Independence Declaration, a 
copy of which is included in the directors’ report.

Opinion
In our opinion:
2
a.  the financial report of Panoramic Resources Limited is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001,
including:
i  giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity's financial position as at 30 June 2016 and of
its performance for the year ended on that date; and
ii  complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001; and
b.  the financial report also complies with International Financial Reporting Standards as disclosed in Note
1.
Emphasis of matter
Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to Note 1 (b) in the financial report which describes the 
principal conditions that raise doubt about the consolidated entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the 
consolidated entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and therefore, the consolidated entity may be 
unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.
Report on the remuneration report
We have audited the Remuneration Report included contained in the directors' report for the year ended 
30 June 2016. The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the 
Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001. Our responsibility is 
to express an opinion on the Remuneration Report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with 
Australian Auditing Standards.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Remuneration Report of Panoramic Resources Limited for the year ended 30 June 
2016, complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.

Panoramic Resources Limited
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
30 June 2016
1 Summary of significant accounting policies
The financial report of Panoramic Resources Limited (the Parent or the Company) and its subsidiaries (the
Group) for the year ended 30 June 2016 was authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors
on 30 August 2016.
Panoramic Resources Limited (the Parent) is a for profit Company limited by shares incorporated and domiciled
in Australia whose shares are publicly traded on the Australian Stock Exchange. The Group's principal place of
business is Level 9, 553 Hay Street, Perth WA 6000.
The principal activities of the Group during the course of the financial year consisted of exploration, evaluation,
development, and production of mineral deposits.
(a) Basis of preparation
The financial report is a general purpose financial report, which has been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and Australian Accounting Standards. The financial report has also
been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, trade receivables and
available-for-sale investments, which have been measured at fair value. The financial report complies with
Australian Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by
International Accounting Standards Board.
(b) Going concern basis
These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the Group will be
able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
As a result of the weakening nickel price and both the Savannah and Lanfranchi nickel mine being placed onto
care and maintenance during the year, the Group experienced net cash outflows from operating activities of
$42.8 million for the year ended 30 June 2016. In addition, the Group incurred a net loss of $144.4 million for the
year ended 30 June 2016, including impairment charges of $79.4 million. At 30 June 2016, the Group had cash
and cash equivalents of $19.4 million and held approximately $8.4 million in unsold nickel concentrate ready for
shipment in July 2016.
On the basis of the high probability that global nickel prices remain weak for a sustained period, the directors are
cognisant that there may need to be additional staffing changes and cuts to operational and corporate costs,
notwithstanding there may be a need to raise additional funds via equity raisings from existing or new
shareholders or to put in place borrowing facilities in order to fund exploration and evaluation expenditure
programs on its growth assets and for general working capital requirements during the period the Group’s income
producing assets remain on care and maintenance. The Board is satisfied that the Company will be able to raise
additional capital (via equity, debt or a combination) as and when required and as a result it is appropriate to
prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Should the Group not achieve the funding outcomes set out above, there is significant uncertainty whether the
Group will continue as a going concern and therefore whether it will realise its assets and extinguish its liabilities
in the normal course of business and at the amounts stated in the financial report. No adjustments have been
made relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that
might be necessary should the company not continue as a going concern

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
30 June 2016
(continued)
1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(c) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at
30 June 2016. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its
involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has:
• Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the
investee)
• Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and
• The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns
When the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all
relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:
• The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee
• Rights arising from other contractual arrangements
• The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are
changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group
obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities,
income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the statement of
comprehensive income from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the
subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of
the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the noncontrolling interests
having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to
bring their accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities,
equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated
in full on consolidation.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity
transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:
• De-recognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary
• De-recognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests
• De-recognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity
• Recognises the fair value of the consideration received
• Recognises the fair value of any investment retained
• Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss
• Reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously recognised in OCI to profit or loss or retained
earnings, as appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or
liabilities
(d) New accounting standards and interpretations
Refer to Appendix A on page 111.
(e) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
In the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, and
estimations which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
47
Panoramic Resources Limited
Notes to the consolidated financial statements
30 June 2016
(continued)
1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(e) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)
(i) Determination of mineral resources and ore reserves
The Group estimates its mineral resources and ore reserves in accordance with the Australian Code for
Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (the ‘JORC code’) as a minimum
standard. The information on mineral resources and ore reserves were prepared by or under the supervision of
Competent Persons as defined in the JORC code. The amounts presented are based on the mineral resources
and ore reserves determined either under the 2012 or 2004 editions of the JORC code.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral resources and ore reserves and assumptions
that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available.
Significant judgement is required in assessing the available reserves. Factors that must be considered in
determining reserves and resources are the Company's history of converting resources to reserves and the
relevant time frame, market and future developments.
Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, foreign currency exchange rates, production costs or recovery
rates may change the economic status of reserves and may ultimately result in the reserves being restated. Such
changes in reserves could impact on depreciation and amortisation rates, asset carrying values and provisions
for decommissioning and restoration.
(ii)
Impairment of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure
The Group assesses impairment of all assets at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific to the
Group and to the particular asset that may lead to impairment. If an impairment trigger exists, the recoverable
amount of the asset is determined. The future recoverability of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure
is dependent on a number of factors, including whether the Group decides to exploit the related lease itself or, if
not, whether it successfully recovers the related exploration and evaluation asset through sale.
Factors which could impact the future recoverability include the level of proved and probable reserves and
mineral resources, future technological changes which could impact the cost of mining, future legal changes
(including changes to environmental restoration obligations) and changes to commodity prices.
To the extent that capitalised exploration and evaluation is determined not to be recoverable in the future, this will
reduce profits and net assets in the period in which this determination is made.
In addition, exploration and evaluation expenditure is capitalised if activities in the area of interest have not yet
reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically
recoverable reserves. To the extent that it is determined in the future that this capitalised expenditure should be
written off, this will reduce profits and net assets in the period in which this determination is made.
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure that suffered an impairment are tested for possible reversal of
the impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed.
(iii) Impairment of capitalised mine development expenditure and mine properties
The Group assesses impairment of all assets at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific to the
Group and to the particular asset that may lead to impairment. If an impairment trigger exists, the recoverable
amount of the asset is determined. The future recoverability of capitalised mine development expenditure and
mine properties is dependent on a number of factors, including the level of proved, probable and inferred mineral
resources, future technological changes which could impact the cost of mining, future legal changes (including
changes to environmental restoration obligations) and changes to commodity prices.
To the extent that capitalised mine development expenditure and mine properties is determined not to be
recoverable in the future, this will reduce profits and net assets in the period in which this determination is made.

1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(e) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)
(iv) Impairment of property, plant and equipment
The Group assesses impairment of all assets at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific to the
Group and to the particular asset that may lead to impairment. If an impairment trigger exists, the recoverable
amount of the asset is determined. Where a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is
assessed by reference to the higher of ‘value in use’ (being the net present value of expected future cash flows of
the relevant cash-generating unit) and ‘fair value less costs to sell’.
In determining value in use, future cash flows are based on:
• Estimates of the quantities of ore reserves and mineral resources for which there is a high degree of confidence
of economic extraction;
• Future production levels;
• Future commodity prices; and
• Future cash costs of production and capital expenditure.
Variations to the expected future cash flows, and the timing thereof, could result in significant changes to any
impairment losses recognised, if any, which could in turn impact future financial results.
Property, plant and equipment that suffered an impairment are tested for possible reversal of the impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed. Refer to Note14 :
Non-current assets - Property, plant and equipment for further information.
(v) Provision for decommissioning and rehabilitation
Decommissioning and restoration costs are a normal consequence of mining, and the majority of this expenditure
is incurred at the end of a mine’s life. In determining an appropriate level of provision consideration is given to the
expected future costs to be incurred, the timing of these expected future costs (largely dependent on the life of
the mine), and the estimated future level of inflation.
The ultimate cost of decommissioning and restoration is uncertain and costs can vary in response to many
factors including changes to the relevant legal requirements, the emergence of new restoration techniques,
discount rates or experience at other mine sites. The expected timing of expenditure can also change, for
example in response to changes in reserves or to production rates.
The carrying amount of the provision as at 30 June 2016 was $29.883 million (2015: $30.184 million). The Group
estimates that the costs would be realised towards the end of the respective mine lives and calculates the
provision using the DCF method based on expected costs to be incurred to rehabilitate the disturbed area. These
costs are discounted at 3.5%.
Changes to any of the estimates could result in significant changes to the level of provisioning required, which
would in turn impact future financial results.
(vi) Share-based payment transactions
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the
equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by a Monte Carlo model
and a Binomial model, using the assumptions detailed in note 36.
(f) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at consideration received or receivable. The following
specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:
(i) Sale of concentrates/ore
A sale is recorded when risk and reward of ownership of the concentrates/ore has passed to the buyer.

(f) Revenue recognition (continued)
(ii)
Interest income
Revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the
amortised cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest income over the relevant period using the effective
interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of
the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
(iii) Dividends
Dividends are recognised as revenue when the right to receive payment is established.
(g) Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs include interest, amortisation of discounts or premiums relating to borrowings, amortisation of
ancillary costs incurred in connection with arrangement of borrowings, finance charges in respect of finance
leases and foreign currency exchange differences net of the effect of hedges of borrowings.
Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred unless they relate to qualifying assets. Qualifying assets are assets
that take more than twelve months to get ready for their intended use or sale. In these circumstances, borrowing
costs are capitalised to the costs of the assets. Where funds are borrowed specifically for the acquisition,
construction or production of a qualifying asset, the amount of borrowing costs capitalised is those incurred in
relation to that borrowing, net of any interest earned on those borrowings. Where funds are borrowed generally,
borrowing costs are capitalised using a weighted average capitalisation rate to the extent that they relate to the
qualifying asset.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure carried forward relating to areas of interest which have not reached a
stage permitting reliable assessment of economic benefits are not qualifying assets.
(h) Leases
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the
leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the
present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly
against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease
term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.
(i) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash on hand and in banks and short-term deposits are stated at nominal value.
For the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash includes cash on hand and in the banks short-term
deposits with an original maturity not exceeding three months and if greater than three months, principal amounts
can be redeemed in full with interest payable at the same cash rate from inception as per the agreement with
each bank, net of bank overdrafts.
(j) Term deposits
Term deposits are stated at nominal value. These deposits have original maturity of three months or more.

(k) Trade receivables
(i) Nickel concentrate
Mining revenue from nickel concentrate sales exported from the Savannah Nickel Project is recognised at its
provisional price on the day the product has been shipped from port. 100% of the provisional value is payable in
approximately 7 working days from the issue of a provisional invoice. At each reporting date, provisional priced
nickel is marked to market based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the contract
until the quotational period expires and change in fair value is recognised as revenue. Increments and
decrements in the final measured contained nickel in nickel concentrate delivered to the customer are brought to
account upon presentation of the final invoice. Receivables are carried at fair value.
(ii) Nickel ore
Mining revenue from Lanfranchi nickel ore delivered to the Kambalda concentrator is recognised at its provisional
price net of the amount goods and services tax (GST) payable to the taxation authority. 70% of the provisional
invoice is payable one month after issue. Revenue is recognised based on the estimated fair value of the
consideration receivable. At each reporting date, provisional priced nickel is marked to market based on the
forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the contract until the quotational period expires and
change in fair value is recognised as revenue. Receivables are carried at fair value.
(iii) Other receivables
Receivables from related parties are recognised and carried at the nominal amount due. Interest is taken up as
income on an accrual basis.
Inventories
(l)
(i) Raw materials and stores, work in progress and finished goods
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined based on weighted average cost) and net realisable
value.
Costs incurred in bringing inventory to its present location and condition are accounted for as follows:
• ore stocks - cost of direct mining and a proportion of site overheads; and
• concentrates and work in progress - cost of direct mining, processing, transport and labour and a proportion of
site overheads.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of
completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost of parts and consumables is accounted for
using average cost.
(ii) Spares for production
Inventories of consumable supplies and spare parts expected to be used in production are valued at weighted
average cost. Obsolete or damaged inventories of such items are valued at net realisable value.
(m) Derivative financial instruments and hedging
The Group uses derivatives such as United States dollar nickel and copper forward sales contracts, United
States dollar nickel options, United States denominated currency options and United States denominated forward
currency sales contracts to manage its risks associated with foreign currencies and commodity prices
fluctuations. These derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
Derivatives are not held for speculative purposes.

1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(m) Derivative financial instruments and hedging (continued)
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in
profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a cash flow hedging instrument, in
which event, the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
A hedge of the foreign currency risk and commodity price risk of a firm commitment is accounted for as a cash
flow hedge.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to
which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for
undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or
transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument’s
effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the
hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value or
cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective
throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.
The hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:
(i) Cash flow hedges
Cash flow hedges are hedges of the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a
particular risk associated with a highly probable forecast transaction and that could affect profit and loss. The
effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges
are deferred in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income
statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is
recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no
longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time
remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income
statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was
deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group tests each of the designated cash flow hedges for effectiveness at the inception of the hedge and
then at each reporting date both prospectively and retrospectively using the dollar offset method. This is done by
comparing the changes in the present value of the cash flow arising from hedged forecast sale at the forward
rate, compared to changes in the fair value of the forward contract. Measurement of the cash flow changes is
based on the respective forward curve over the hedge horizon.
At each balance sheet date, the Group measures ineffectiveness using ratio offset method. For cash flow hedges
if the risk is over-hedged, the ineffective portion is taken immediately to the income/expense in the income
statement.
(ii) Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative
instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
(n) Foreign currency translation
Both the functional and presentation currency of Panoramic Resources Limited and its Australian subsidiaries is
Australian dollars (A$).

(continued)
1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(n) Foreign currency translation (continued)
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by the Group’s entities at their respective functional
currency spot rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot
rates of exchange at the reporting date.
Differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss with the
exception of monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the Group’s net investment of a foreign
operation. These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the net investment is disposed of, at which
time, the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss. Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange
differences on those monetary items are also recorded in other comprehensive income.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the
exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign
currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is determined. The gain or loss
arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of gain
or loss on change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is
recognised in other comprehensive income or profit or loss are also recognised in other comprehensive income
or profit or loss, respectively).
Group companies
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into dollars at the rate of exchange
prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of profit or loss are translated at exchange rates prevailing at
the dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in
other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive income
relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss.
(o) Investments and other financial assets
(i) Available-for-sale financial assets
After initial recognition available-for-sale investments are measured at fair value with gains or losses being
recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or until the investment is
determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is recognised in
profit or loss.
The fair value of investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets is determined by reference to
quoted market bid prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
Investments which are not classified as held for trading or held to maturity are treated as available-for-sale
financial assets.
(p) Income tax
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be
recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are
those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences:

(p) Income tax (continued)
• except where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a
transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting
profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
• in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and
interests in joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled
and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax
assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which
the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be
utilised:
• except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the
transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
• in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and
interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the
temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred
income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities are reassessed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in profit or loss.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current
tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to the same taxable entity
and the same taxation authority.
Tax consolidation legislation
Panoramic Resources Limited and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax
consolidation legislation.
The head entity, Panoramic Resources Limited, and the controlled entities in the tax consolidated group account
for their own current and deferred tax amounts. These tax amounts are measured as if each entity in the tax
consolidated group continues to be a stand alone taxpayer in its own right.
In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, Panoramic Resources Limited also recognises the
current tax liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax
credits assumed from controlled entities in the tax consolidated group.
Assets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as
amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the Company.
Any difference between the amounts assumed and amounts receivable or payable under the tax funding
agreement are recognised as a contribution to (or distribution from) wholly-owned tax consolidated entities.

(q) Other taxes
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except:
• where the GST incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in
which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item
as applicable; and
• receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included.
The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables
or payables in the balance sheet.
Cash flows are included in the Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis and the GST component of cash flows
arising from investing and financing activities, which is recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority, are
classified as operating cash flows.
Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the
taxation authority.
(r) Property, plant and equipment
Items of plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. The
cost of plant and equipment constructed for and by the consolidated entity, where applicable, includes the cost of
materials and direct labour. The proportion of overheads and other incidental costs directly attributable to its
construction are also capitalised to the cost of plant and equipment.
Costs incurred on plant and equipment subsequent to initial acquisition are capitalised when it is probable that
future economic benefits, in excess of the originally assessed performance of the asset will flow to the
consolidated entity in future years. Where these costs represent separate components of a complex asset, they
are accounted for as separate assets and are separately depreciated over their useful lives. Costs incurred on
plant and equipment that do not meet the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.
Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation and amortisation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the asset.
The estimated useful lives used for each class of asset are as follows:
Office equipment
Office furniture and fittings
Plant and equipment under hire purchase
Plant and equipment under finance lease
Process plant and buildings
3 - 4 years
5 years
over the lease term
over the lease term
lesser of life of mine and life of asset
Impairment
The carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets
or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for
the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(r) Property, plant and equipment (continued)
The recoverable amount of plant and equipment is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset.
Property, plant and equipment that suffered an impairment are tested for possible reversal of the impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed.
Derecognition and disposal
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic
benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between net disposal
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.
(s) Exploration, evaluation, development, mine properties and rehabilitation expenditure
(i) Exploration and evaluation expenditure
Expenditure on exploration and evaluation is accounted for in accordance with the ‘area of interest’ method.
Exploration and evaluation in the area of interest that have not at the reporting date reached a stage which
permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active
and significant operations in, or relating to, the area of interest are expensed as incurred.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure is capitalised provided the rights to tenure of the area of interest is current
and the exploration and evaluation activities are expected to be recouped through successful development and
exploitation of the area or, alternatively, by its sale.
When the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource have been demonstrated
then any capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is reclassified as capitalised mine development. Prior
to reclassification, capitalised exploration and evaluation is assessed for impairment.
Impairment
The carrying value of capitalised exploration expenditure is assessed for impairment at the cash-generating unit
level whenever facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may exceed its
recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is the higher of fair value less
costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, recoverable amount is determined for the
cash-generating unit in which the asset belongs, unless the asset’s value in use can be estimated to be close to
its fair value.
An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated
recoverable amount. The asset or cash-generating unit is then written down to its recoverable amount. Any
impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure that suffered an impairment are tested for possible reversal of
the impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed.

(s) Exploration, evaluation, development, mine properties and rehabilitation expenditure (continued)
(ii) Mine development expenditure
Mine development expenditure represents the costs incurred in preparing mines for production, and includes
stripping and waste removal costs incurred before production commences. These costs are capitalised to the
extent they are expected to be recouped through successful exploitation of the related mining leases. Once
production commences, these costs are amortised using the units of production method based on the estimated
economically recoverable reserves to which they relate or are written off if the mine property is abandoned.
Impairment
The carrying value of capitalised mine development is assessed for impairment whenever facts and
circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of capitalised mine development expenditure is the higher of fair value less costs to sell
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, recoverable amount is determined for the
cash-generating unit in which the asset belongs, unless the asset’s value in use can be estimated to be close to
its fair value.
An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated
recoverable amount. The asset or cash-generating unit is then written down to its recoverable amount. Any
impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Capitalised mine development expenditure that suffered an impairment are tested for possible reversal of the
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed.
(iii) Mine properties
Mine properties expenditure represents the cost incurred in the acquisition of a mining lease, and represents the
excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired mining lease at
the date of acquisition. These costs are capitalised to the extent they are expected to be recouped through
successful exploitation of the related mining leases Once production commences, these costs are amortised
using the units of production method based on the estimated economically recoverable reserves to which they
relate or are written off if the mine property is abandoned.
Impairment
The carrying value of capitalised mine properties is assessed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances
suggest that the carrying amount of the asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of capitalised mine properties expenditure is the higher of fair value less costs to sell
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, recoverable amount is determined for the
cash-generating unit in which the asset belongs, unless the asset’s value in use can be estimated to be close to
its fair value.
An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated
recoverable amount. The asset or cash-generating unit is then written down to its recoverable amount. Any
impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.

(iv) Provision for decommissioning and rehabilitation
The Group is required to decommission and rehabilitate mines and processing sites at the end of their producing
lives to a condition acceptable to the relevant authorities.
The expected cost of any approved decommissioning or rehabilitation program, discounted to its net present
value, is provided in the period in which obligation arise. The cost is capitalised when it gives rise to future
benefits, whether the rehabilitation activity is expected to occur over the life of the operation or at the time of
closure. Over time, the liability is increased for the change in net present value based on a risk adjusted pre-tax
discount rate appropriate to the risk inherent in the liability. The unwinding of the discount is included in financing
cost. Expected decommissioning and rehabilitation costs are based on the discounted value of the estimated
future cost of detailed plans prepared for each site. Where there is a change in the expected decommissioning
and rehabilitation costs, the value of the provision and any related asset are adjusted and the effect is recognised
in the income statement on a prospective basis over the remaining life of the operation.
(t)
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any
such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate
of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell
and its value in use and determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that
are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and the asset’s value in use cannot be
estimated to be close to its fair value. In such cases the asset is tested for impairment as part of the
cash-generating unit to which it belongs. When the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds
its recoverable amount, the asset or cash-generating unit is considered impaired and is written down to its
recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset. Impairment losses relating to continuing operations are recognised in those expense categories consistent
with the function of the impaired asset unless the asset is carried at revalued amount (in which case the
impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease).
An assessment is also made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously
recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the
recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a
change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was
recognised. If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That
increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would be determined, net of depreciation, had no
impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in profit and loss unless
the asset is carried at revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. After such
a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount,
less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
Non-financial assets that suffered an impairment are tested for possible reversal of the impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment may have reversed.
(u) Trade and other payables
Trade payables and other payables are carried at amortised costs and represent liabilities for goods and services
provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Group becomes
obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services.
(v)
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of
issue costs associated with the borrowing.

1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(v)
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings (continued)
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any
discount or premium on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised and as well as
through the amortisation process.
(w) Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the economic entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) to make a
future sacrifice of economic benefits to other entities as a result of past transactions or other past events, it is
probable that a future sacrifice of economic benefits will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the
amount of the obligation.
When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract,
the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The
expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement.
The effect of the time value of money is material and provisions are determined by discounting the expected
future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and,
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing
cost.
(x) Employee benefits
(i) Short term benefits
Liabilities for short term benefits expected to be wholly settled within 12 months of the reporting date are
recognised in other payables in respect of employees services up to the reporting date. They are measured at
the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. Liabilities for non-accumulating sick leave are
recognised when the leave is taken and are measured at the rates paid or payable.
(ii) Long service leave
The liability for long service leave is recognised in the provision for employee benefits and measured as the
present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the
reporting date using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary
levels, experience of employee departures, and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted
using market yields at the reporting date of corporate bond rate with terms of maturity and currencies that match,
as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.
(iii) Share-based payments
Equity-settled transactions
The Group provides benefits to employees (including executive directors) of the Group in the form of share based
payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for rights over shares (‘equity-settled
transactions’).
The cost of these equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the
date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation model or binomial
model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions
linked to the price of shares of Panoramic Resources Limited if applicable.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(x) Employee benefits (continued)
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with the corresponding increase in reserve, over
the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees
become fully entitled to the award (‘vesting date’).
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting date
reflects (i) the extent to which the vesting period has expired and (ii) the number of awards that, in the opinion of
the directors of the Group, will ultimately vest. This opinion is formed based on the best available information at
balance date. No adjustment is made for the likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the effect
of these conditions is included in the determination of fair value at grant date. The income statement charge or
credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of
that period. There is a corresponding entry to equity.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional
upon a market condition.
If the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had
not been modified. In addition, an expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of
the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee, as measured at the date of
modification.
If an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any
expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for
the cancelled award and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new
award are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of
earnings per share.
(iv) Bonus plans
The Company recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses based on a formula that takes into consideration
the profit attributable to the Company's shareholders after certain adjustments. The Company recognises a
provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
(y) Contributed equity
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares for the acquisition of a business are deducted
from equity and not expensed as an acquisition related cost.
(z) Dividends
Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the
discretion of the entity, on or before the end of the financial year but not distributed at balance date.
(aa) Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated as net profit attributable to members of the Parent, adjusted to exclude
any costs of servicing equity (other than dividends) and preference share dividends, divided by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as net profit attributable to members of the Parent, adjusted for:
• costs of servicing equity (other than dividends) and preference share dividends;
• other non-discretionary changes in revenues or expenses during the period that would result from the dilution of
potential ordinary shares;
divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares, adjusted for
any bonus element.

1 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
(ab)Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a
business combination shall be measured at fair value, which shall be calculated as the sum of the acquisition
date fair values of the assets transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners
of the acquiree and the equity issued by the acquirer, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the
acquiree. For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree
either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs
are expensed as incurred.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate
classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic conditions, the Group’s
operating or accounting policies and other pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the
separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer's previously held
equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured at fair value as at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition
date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or
liability will be recognised in accordance with AASB 139 either in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it shall not be remeasured.
Business combinations prior to 1 July 2009 were accounted for using the purchase method.
(ac) Government grants
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all
attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income
on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are
expensed. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income in equal amounts over the expected
useful life of the related asset.
(ad)Joint Operations
The Group’s recognises its interest in joint operations:
- Assets, including its share of any assets held jointly
- Liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly
- Revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the joint operation
- Share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation
- Expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly

2 Segment information
(a) Business segments
The Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the
executive management team (the chief operating decision makers) in assessing performance and in determining
the allocation of resources.
The reportable segments are based on aggregated operating segments determined by the similarity of the
products produced and sold, as these are the sources of the Group's major risks and have the most effect on the
rates of return.
The Group has identified five operating segments being: (1) Nickel, the aggregation of the Savannah Nickel
Project, Lanfranchi Nickel Project and Copernicus Nickel Project; (2) Gold, the Gum Creek Gold Project; (3)
Platinum Group Metals, the Thunder Bay North PGM Project and Panton PGM Project; (4) Australian
Exploration; and (5) Overseas Exploration.
Nickel
The Savannah Nickel Project, the Copernicus Nickel Project and the Lanfranchi Nickel Project all mine nickel ore.
At the Savannah Nickel Project and the Copernicus Nickel Project, nickel concentrate is produced and sold to the
one customer Sino Nickel Pty Ltd (a company owned by the Jinchuan Group Limited (60%) and Sino Mining
International Limited (40%)). At the Lanfranchi Nickel Project, nickel ore is delivered and sold to the one customer
BHP Billiton Nickel West Pty Ltd. As mentioned in Note 1(b), the Lanfranchi Nickel Project was placed onto care
and maintenance in November 2015 and the Savannah Nickel Project was placed onto care and maintenance in
May 2016..
Gold
The 100% owned and operated Gum Creek Gold Project (formerly Gidgee Gold) is located 640kms northeast of
Perth in Western Australia, and was purchased by the Company in January 2011. The Company refurbished the
site’s village and administration areas and commenced exploration and evaluation activities from July 2011.
In May 2012, the Company acquired the Wilsons Gold Project from Apex Minerals Limited. The Wilsons Gold
Project is within trucking distance of the existing Gum Creek processing facility which is under care and
maintenance. The Wilsons Gold Project acquisition forms part of the Gum Creek Gold Project. The combined
mineral Resource of Gum Creek, following the acquisition of Wilsons and upgrade of the Howards and Heron
South Resources in October 2012, has increased to over one million ounces.
In August 2012, the Company finalised an agreement with Matsa Resources Limited to acquire a 70% equity
interest in the Mt Henry Gold Project. The Mt Henry Gold Project comprises of three deposits being Mt Henry,
North Scotia and Selene. The Project is located on the southern end of the Norseman - Wiluna Greenstone belt.
As detailed in note 10, Mt Henry Gold Project was sold during the period and accordingly the Mt Henry Gold
Project has not been included in the segment results for 2016.
Platinum Group Metals (PGM)
In July 2012, the Company finalised the acquisition of Magma Metals Limited by way of an off market takeover
bid. Magma’s principal project, the Thunder Bay North PGM Project, is located in northwest Ontario, Canada.
Since acquisition, the Company has commenced evaluation studies to re-optimise the mining method and
mineral processing route contained in the previous 2011 Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA). In January
2015, Rio Exploration Canada Inc. (RTEC), having completed its review of all existing data on TBN, exercised a
right under the "Earn In with Option to Joint Venture Agreement (July 2014)" by electing to proceed into the
Earn-In option phase.
In May 2012, the Company executed an agreement with Platinum Australia Limited to purchase the Panton PGM
Project. The Panton Project is located 60km north of Halls Creek, in the East Kimberley Region of Western
Australia. The Company will continue to develop the asset through the optimisation of the project’s mining and
processing options.

(a) Business segments (continued)
Australian and Overseas Exploration
The Group's primary exploration and evaluation activities cover the regional areas of Western Australia. The
Group is also party to joint agreements to conduct overseas exploration and evaluation activities in Scandanavia.
The Group's Exploration Manager is responsible for budgets and expenditure by the Group's exploration team.
The exploration division does not normally derive any income. Should a project generated by the exploration
division commence generating income or lead to the construction or acquisition of a mining operation, that
operation would then be disaggregated from the exploration and become a separate reportable segment.
Accounting policies
Segment information is prepared in conformity with the accounting policies of the entity as disclosed in note 1
and Accounting Standard AASB 8 Operating Segments.
Segment revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are those that are directly attributable to a segment and the
relevant portion that can be allocated to the segment on a reasonable basis. Segment assets include all assets
used by a segment and consist primarily of operating cash, receivables, inventories, derivative financial
instruments, property, plant and equipment and development and mine properties. Segment liabilities consist
primarily of trade and other creditors, employee benefits, derivative financial instruments, finance leases and
borrowings and provision for rehabilitation.

The amount of its revenue from external customers in Australia is $86.799 million (2015: $77.452 million), and
the total revenue from external customers in China is $4.842 million (2015: $120.445 million).
Segment revenues are allocated based on the country in which the customer is located. Sales to external
customers exclude hedging gains and losses, transport, port and shipping charges, and therefore the amounts
will not agree to the revenue from continuing operations as shown in the consolidated income statement.
The Group has two major customers, one to which it delivers nickel concentrate and the other, nickel ore. The
Group's most significant client accounts for $86.799 million (2015: $120.445 million) of external revenue. The
next most significant client accounts for $4.842 million (2015: $77.452 million) of revenue.

Trade receivables
Other receivables
(a) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are non interest bearing and are generally on 30-90 day terms.
Trade receivables are marked to market based on the forward selling price from the date a provisional invoice is
prepared until the presentation of a final invoice to the customer, known as the quotational period (QP).
Accordingly, trade receivables are carried at fair value.
The amount of derivative embedded within provisionally priced sales at 30 June 2016 was nil (2015: $2.744
million) and the amount of fair value changes recognised in the income statement during the year ended 30 June
2016 was $11.220 million (2015: $10.021 million)
All receivables are current and not past due.
(b) Other receivables
These amounts relate to receivables for goods and services tax, diesel fuel rebates and sundry items. Interest
may be charged at commercial rates where the terms of repayments exceed six months. Collateral is not
normally obtained.
(c) Foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk
The balance of trade receivables is exposed to movements in USD:AUD exchange rates and spot commodity
prices.
All trade receivables are non interest bearing in 2015 and 2016.
Information on foreign currency exchange and interest rate risk is provided in note 38.
(d) Fair value and credit risk
Trade receivables are marked to market based on the forward selling price from the date a provisional invoice is
prepared until the presentation of a final invoice to the customer, known as the quotational period (QP).
Accordingly, trade receivables are carried at fair value.
Information on credit risk is provided in note 38.

On 3 August 2015, the Company announced the decision by the directors to divest the Company’s Gum Creek
Gold Project. Accordingly, the project was classified as an asset held for sale under AASB 5.
In accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, immediately before the classification of Gum Creek Gold
Project as assets held for sale, the carrying value of the Gum Creek Gold Project was assessed to ensure that it
was being carried at the lower of its carrying value and fair value less cost to dispose (FVLCD). Accordingly, an
impairment loss of $41.837 million has been recognised in the consolidated income statement to reduce the
carrying values of the Gum Creek Gold Project to its fair value less cost to dispose.
On 30 May 2016, the Company announced that the directors were considering a partial divestment of the Gum
Creek Gold Project by way of an initial public offering (IPO) on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).
Therefore, at 30 June 2016, the Gum Creek Gold Project (which was previously classified as asset held for sale)
has been re-classified into the respective asset category.
Prior to reclassification out of the held for sale category, the carrying value of the Gum Creek Gold Project was
assessed to ensure that it was being carried at the lower of its carrying value (adjusted for depreciation and
amortisation) and fair value. It was determined that the fair value of the project approximate its carrying value.
The fair value of the Gum Creek Gold Project at 30 June 2016 has been determined based on comparable
market transactions. The fair value methodology adopted at 30 June 2016 is categorised as Level 3 in the fair
value hierarchy. In determining the FVLCD, estimates are made in relation to the underlying resources/reserves
and the valuation multiple. Any change in these estimates could impact the FVLCD of the underlying CGU.

(b) Mt Henry Gold Project
On 14 May 2015, the Company announced the decision by the directors to divest the Company’s 70% interest in
the Mt Henry Gold Project. The Mt Henry Gold Project was classified as held for sale at 30 June 2015 and
consisted of exploration and evaluation properties amounting to $18 million. The fair value at 30 June 2015 was

categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
On 31 July 2015, the Company sold its 70% interest in the Mt Henry Gold Project to Metals X Limited. The
project was settled for 15.225 million of Metals X Limited shares (after brokerage) valued at $18.650 million at the
date of settlement. A gain on the sale of the Mt Henry Gold Project of $0.651 million has been recognised in the
consolidated income statement for the period ended 30 June 2016. In determining the FVLCD, estimates are
made in relation to the underlying resources/reserves and the valuation multiple. Any change in these estimates

Instruments used by the group
The Group used derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business in order to hedge exposure to
fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates in accordance with the Group financial risk
management policies (refer to note 38).
The Group used a number of methodologies to determine the fair value of derivatives. These techniques included
comparing contracted rates to market rates with the same length of maturity to determine the value of forward
contracts and used of option pricing models to value put options. The principal inputs to valuation techniques are
listed below:
- Commodity prices
- Interest rates
- Foreign currency exchange rates
- Price volatilities
- Discount rates
Commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates were determined by reference to published
/ observable prices.
(b) Risk exposures
Information about the Company's exposure to credit risk, foreign currency exchange and interest rate risk is
provided in note 38. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying amount of each
class of derivative financial assets mentioned above.
(c) Offsetting of financial instruments
The Group presents assets and liabilities on a gross basis. Derivative financial instruments entered into by the
Group are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements such as International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (ISDA) master netting agreement. In certain circumstances, for example, when a credit event such as
a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under an ISDA agreement are terminated. The termination value is
assessed and only single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions.
The amounts set out in the table above represent the derivative financial assets and liabilities of the Group that
are subject to the above arrangements and are presented on a gross basis.

Impairment of assets
Nickel Division
The weakening of commodity prices during the first half and the deficiency in market capitalisation compared to
net assets led to the Group to make an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of its assets at 31
December 2015 under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets. A further review was undertaken at 30 June 2016. In
each review, an external party was engaged to determine the fair value less costs to dispose (FVLCD) of the
Nickel Division assets. The FVLCD were then compared against the carrying value and as a result of the
impairment test, an impairment loss of $42.290 million was recognised to reduce the carrying amount of the
exploration and evaluation properties, plant and equipment, mine development and the mine properties to their
recoverable amount. Of this amount, $37.616 million has been recognised in the income statement and $4.674
million has been recognised in the mineral properties revaluation reserve ($3.272 million net of tax). The mineral
property revaluation reserve account was created when the Group increased its holding in Lanfranchi from 75%
to 100% in 2009 which required a revaluation of the original asset in accordance with the purchase method of
accounting to business combination applied at the time.
The fair value less cost to dispose of the Savannah Nickel Project and Lanfranchi Nickel Project determined by
the external party was based on comparable market transactions. The fair value methodology adopted is
categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the FVLCD, estimates are made in relation to
the underlying resources/reserves and the valuation multiple. Any change in these estimates could impact the
FVLCD of the underlying CGU.
Gum Creek Gold Project
On 3 August 2015, the Company announced the decision by the directors to divest the Company’s Gum Creek
Gold Project. Accordingly, the project was classified as an asset held for sale under AASB 5.
In accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, immediately before the classification of Gum Creek Gold
Project as assets held for sale, the carrying value of the Gum Creek Gold Project was assessed to ensure that it
was being carried at the lower of its carrying value and fair value less cost to dispose (FVLCD). Accordingly, an
impairment loss of $41.837 million has been recognised in the consolidated income statement to reduce the
carrying values of the Gum Creek Gold Project to its fair value less cost to dispose.
On 30 May 2016, the Company announced that the directors were considering a partial divestment of the Gum
Creek Gold Project by way of an inital public offering (IPO) on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).
Therefore, at 30 June 2016, the Gum Creek Gold Project (which was previously classified as asset held for sale)
has been re-classified into the respective asset category. Prior to reclassification out of the held for sale category,
the carrying value of the Gum Creek Gold Project was assessed to ensure that it was being carried at the lower
of its carrying value (adjusted for depreciation & amortisation) and fair value. It was determined that the fair value
of the project approximate its carrying value. The fair value of the Gum Creek Gold Project at 30 June 2016 has
been determined based on comparable market transactions. The fair value methodology adopted at 30 June
2016 is categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the FVLCD, estimates are made in
relation to the underlying resources/reserves and the valuation multiple. Any change in these estimates could
impact the FVLCD of the underlying CGU.
As at 30 June 2016, a total Group impairment loss of $32.705 million was recognised to decrease the carrying
amount of plant and equipment to their recoverable amount. This has been recognised in the income statement.

A provision for rehabilitation is recognised in relation to the mining activities for costs such as reclamation, waste
site closure, plant closure and other costs associated with the rehabilitation of a mining site. Estimates of the
rehabilitation are based on the anticipated technology and legal requirements and future costs, which have been
discounted to their present value. In determining the restoration provision, the entity has assumed no significant
changes will occur in the relevant Federal and State legislations in relation to rehabilitation of such mines in the
future. Refer to note1(e)(v) for inputs used in determining the provision for rehabilitation.

(c) Ordinary shares
Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the Company in
proportion to the number of and amounts paid on the shares held.
Ordinary shares entitle their holder to one vote, either in person or by proxy, at a meeting of the Company.
(d) Capital management
When managing capital, management's objective is to ensure the entity continues as a going concern as well as
to maintain optimal returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. Management also aims to
maintain a capital structure that ensures the lowest cost of capital available to the entity.
Management are constantly adjusting the capital structure to take advantage of favourable costs of capital or high
returns on assets. As the market is constantly changing, management may change the amount of dividends to be
paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Management monitor capital through the gearing ratio (total borrowings / contributed equity). The debt to equity
ratio (borrowings on equity interest in shareholders’ equity) at 30 June 2016 was 0.95% (2015: 1.84%).
The Group has put in place a Group Cash Management Policy to ensure that up to 180 days (2015: 180 days)
excess cash holdings are invested with a range of institutions that have sufficient financial strength to ensure the
security of the investment. (Refer to note 38 Financial risk management)
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Management consider that the total equity of the Group (contributed equity, reserves and retained earnings) plus
borrowings (current and non-current) is what it manages as capital. At 30 June 2016 this was $103,760,000
(2015: $242,802,000).

Under the terms of Deeds of Cross Guarantee with several finance institutions, the Company has agreed to

above, there has not arisen any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature likely, in the opinion
of the directors of the Company, to affect significantly the operations of the consolidated entity, the results of
those operations, or the state of affairs of the consolidated entity, in future financial years.

(a) Performance Shares
Employee Share Plan (ESP)
On 30 July 2014, the Company’s shareholders approved a three year exemption to ASX Listing Rule 7.1 [Issues
exceeding 15% of Capital] on the annual grant of performance rights and the issue of shares on the exercise of
those performance rights under the 2010 Panoramic Resources Limited Employee Share Plan (“2010 ES Plan”).
Under a new structure from 1 July 2014, executives and senior employees will be invited each year to receive a
new grant of performance rights under the 2010 ES Plan. The long term incentive (LTI) dollar value that
executives and senior employees will be entitled to receive each year is set at a fixed percentage of their annual
Fixed Remuneration (base salary plus statutory superannuation) and will range from 35% to 100% of Fixed
Remuneration depending on level and seniority. The number of performance rights to be granted each year is
determined by dividing the LTI dollar by the fair value (FV) of one performance right on 1 July (as determined by
an independent valuer).
Each annual grant of performance rights will vest subject to meeting service and performance conditions as
defined below:
- 75% of the performance rights will be performance tested against the relative total shareholder return (TSR) of a
customised peer group over a 3 year period; and
- 25% of the performance rights will be performance tested against the reserve/resource growth over a 3 year
period, net of depletion.
For FY2016, a total of 4,624,513 performance rights were calculated to be granted to executives and senior
employees. To determine the number of FY2016 performance grants at 27 November 2015, a weighted average
FV of $0.2080 was externally determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation pricing model for the first TSR
performance condition and a binomial pricing model was used for the second reserve/resource growth test. The
FY2016 performance rights were subsequently granted on two different dates and a new FV was externally
determined using the same pricing methodology described above on each date to calculate the fair value to be
expensed over a 3 year performance period from 27 November 2015:

The weighted average remaining contractual life of performance shares outstanding at the end of the period was
1.63 years (2015: 2 years).
Fair value of Performance Shares
The fair value of each performance share was estimated on the grant date utilising the assumptions underlying
the Black Scholes methodology to produce a Monte Carlo simulation model which allowed for the incorporation of
the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) hurdles that was to be met before the Share Based Payment vest in the
holder.

(b) Expenses arising from share-based payment transactions (continued)
The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting date
reflects:
(i) the extent to which the vesting period has expired; and
(ii) the number of options that, in opinion of the directors of the consolidated entity, will ultimately vest. This
opinion is formed based on the best available information at balance date. No adjustment is made for the
likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included in the
determination of fair value at grant date.
No expense is recognised for options that do not ultimately vest, except for options where vesting is conditional
upon a market condition.
The dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of
earnings per share.
Total expenses arising from share based payment transactions recognised during the period as part of employee
benefit expense were as follows:
(i) Performance shares under employee share plan amount to $0.624 million (2015: $0.689 million).

38 Financial risk management
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise receivables, payables, finance leases, hire purchase
contracts, cash and derivatives.
The Group manages its exposure to key financial risks, including interest rate and currency risk in accordance
with the Group’s financial risk management policy. The objective of the policy is to support the delivery of the
Group’s financial targets whilst protecting future financial security.
To manage exposure to commodity prices and exchange rates the Group uses derivative instruments, principally
forward sales contracts and put and call options. The purpose is to manage the commodity price and currency
rate risks arising from the Group’s operations. These derivatives provide economic hedges and qualify for hedge
accounting and are based on limits set by the Board. The main risks arising from the Group's financial
instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The
Group uses different methods to measure and manage different types of risks to which it is exposed. These
include monitoring levels of exposure to commodity prices, interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk and
assessments of market forecasts for commodity prices and foreign exchange. Ageing analyses and monitoring of
specific credit allowances are undertaken to manage credit risk. Liquidity risk is monitored through the
development of future rolling cash flow forecasts.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks as summarised below.
Primary responsibility for the identification and control of financial risks rests with the Audit Committee under the
authority of the Board. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of the risks identified below,
including the setting of limits for hedging cover of commodity prices, foreign currency and interest rate risk, credit
allowances and future cash flow forecast projections.
(a) Foreign currency exchange rate risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases in a currency
other than the entity’s functional currency. Approximately 100% of the Group’s sales are denominated in United
States Dollars, whilst most of the costs are denominated in Australian Dollars. The Group’s functional currency is
Australian Dollars.
The Group’s profit and loss and balance sheet can be affected significantly by movements in the USD/AUD
exchange rate. The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of its net foreign currency exposure by using derivative
instruments, principally forward foreign currency exchange rate contracts and put and call options.
It is the Group’s policy to enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exposure once the likelihood
of such exposure is highly probable and to negotiate the terms of the hedge derivatives to exactly match the
terms of the hedged item to maximise hedge effectiveness. The Group will follow its current policy of matching
and hedging up to 80% of sales revenues in USD.
Information about the Group's foreign currency exchange rate contracts is provided in note 12.
As 30 June 2016, the Group had the following exposure to USD foreign currency that is not designated in
cashflow hedges.

The following sensitivity is based on the foreign currency risk exposures in existence at the balance sheet date.
The +/- 5% (2015: +/- 10%) sensitivity is based on reasonably possible changes, over a financial year, using an
observed range of actual historical rates, for the Australian dollar to the US dollar, for the preceding 5 years and
management's expectation of future movements.
At 30 June 2016, had the US dollar moved, as illustrated in the table below, with all other variables held constant,
post tax profit and equity would have been affected as follows:

Management believes the balance sheet date risk exposures are representative of the risk inherent in the
financial instruments.
(b) Interest rate risk
The Group has put in place a Cash Management Policy to ensure that up to 180 days (2015: 180 days) excess
cash holdings are invested with a range of institutions that have sufficient financial strength to ensure the security
of the investments. The Group policy is to reduce and manage cash flow interest rate risk by ensuing a timely
reduction in debt obligations through scheduled debt repayments and non-scheduled debt repayments when
excess cash is available.

(c) Fair value measurements
The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities must be estimated for recognition and measurement or
for disclosure purposes.
Disclosure of fair value measurements is by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
(a) quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1)
(b) valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is
(c)
directly or indirectly observable, and
valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is
unobservable.
At 30 June 2016 the Group does not have any level 3 instruments.

The available-for-sale financial assets are traded in active markets. Their fair value is based on quoted market
prices at the end of the reporting period. These instruments are included in level 1.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example,
over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques. The Company uses a variety of methods
and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period. These
techniques include comparing contracted rates to market rates with the same length of maturity to determine the
value of forward contracts and use of option pricing models to value put options. These instruments are included
in level 2. In the circumstances where a valuation technique for these instruments is based on significant
unobservable inputs, such instruments are included in level 3.
The fair value of finance lease is estimated by discounting future cashflows using rates currently available to debt
on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

(d) Commodity Price Risk
The Group's exposure to nickel prices is very high as approximately 80-85% of total revenue comes from sale of
nickel. Nickel is sold on the basis of nickel prices quoted on the London Metal Exchange (LME).
The Group's profit and loss account and balance sheet can be affected significantly by movements in nickel
prices on the LME. The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of its nickel prices exposure by using derivative
instruments, principally forward sales contracts and put and call options. The limits of hedging are set by the
Board.
The following table summarises the sensitivity of the Group's financial assets and financial liabilities to commodity
price risk.
In 2016, the Group has no financial assets and financial liabilities that have exposure to commodity risk.
In 2015, the +/- 30% sensitivity is based on reasonably possible changes, over a financial year, using the
observed range of actual historical prices for the preceeding 5 year period and management's expectation of
future movements.

Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and
other receivables and derivative instruments.
The Group’s maximum exposures to credit risk at reporting date in relation to each class of recognised financial
assets, other than derivatives, is the carrying amount of these assets as indicated in the balance sheet.
In relation to derivative financial instruments, credit risk arises from the potential failure of counterparties to meet
their obligations under the contract or arrangement. The Group‘s maximum credit risk exposure in relation to net
settled derivatives is the total mark to market gain, should counterparts not honour their obligations. In case of
gross-settled derivatives, the maximum exposure is the notional value. Gross-settled derivatives are held with
financial institutions with sound credit rating.
The Group does not hold any credit derivatives to offset its credit exposure. The Group trades only with
recognised, creditworthy third parties, and as such collateral is not requested nor is it the Group's policy to
securitise its trade and other receivables.
The Group has a concentration of credit risk in that it depends on two major customers for a significant volume of
revenue.
Under the Group's risk management framework, each customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness on
an ongoing basis in order to minimise the risk of default. The Group believes that both its customers are of sound
creditworthiness as evidenced by the compliance with the off-take agreement's payment terms over the life of
each project.

(f) Equity price risk
The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk. This arises from investments held by the Group and
classified on the balance sheet as available-for-sale. The fair value of these investments are based on quoted
market prices.
The Group holds investments of shares in several listed entities who are joint venture partners or potential joint
venture partners. The Board has not reacted to short-term price fluctuations as it has a medium to long term view
on these investments. These investments represent less than 1% (2015: 1%) of total assets and have yet to
generate any revenue.
The following sensitivity is based on the equity price risk exposures in existence at the balance sheet date. The
sensitivity used is +/- 30% which is based on reasonably, possible changes, over a financial year, based on the
share price fluctuations of the last 12 months and management's expectation of future movements.

38 Financial risk management (continued)
(g) Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of
funding when necessary and the ability to close-out market positions.
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of
bank loans (when required), finance leases and committed available credit lines.
The Group monitors on a regular basis rolling forecasts of liquidity on the basis of expected cash flow.
The Group has put in place a Group Cash Management Policy to ensure that up to 180 days (2015: 180 days)
excess cash holdings are invested with a range of institutions that have sufficient financial strength to ensure the
security of the investment. This policy is reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis. When bank
loans are used the Group’s policy is to reduce and manage cash flow interest rate risk by ensuing a timely
reduction in debt obligations through scheduled debt repayments and non scheduled debt repayments when
excess cash is available.
Maturities of financial liabilities
The tables below analyse the Group’s financial liabilities, net and gross settled derivative financial instruments
into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the reporting date to the contractual maturity
date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

Appendix A
New accounting standards and interpretations
(i) Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except as follows:
The Company has adopted the following new and amended Australian Accounting Standards and AASB
interpretations as of 1 July 2015:
• AASB 2013-9 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Conceptual Framework, Materiality and
Financial Instruments
The Standard contains three main parts and makes amendments to a number of Standards and Interpretations.
Part A of AASB 2013-9 makes consequential amendments arising from the issuance of AASB CF 2013-1.
Part B makes amendments to particular Australian Accounting Standards to delete references to AASB 1031
and also makes minor editorial amendments to various other standards.
Part C makes amendments to a number of Australian Accounting Standards, including incorporating Chapter 6
Hedge Accounting into AASB 9 Financial Instruments.
The adoption of AASB 2013-9 had no effect on the financial position or performance of the Group.
• AASB 2015-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from the Withdrawal of AASB 1031
Materiality
The Standard completes the AASB’s project to remove Australian guidance on materiality from Australian
Accounting Standards.
The adoption of AASB 2015-3 had no effect on the financial position or performance of the Group.
• AASB 2015-4 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Financial Reporting Requirements for
Australian Groups with a Foreign Parent
The amendment aligns the relief available in AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and AASB 128
Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures in respect of the financial reporting requirements for Australian
groups with a foreign parent.
The adoption of AASB 2015-4 had no effect on the financial position or performance of the Group.
(ii) Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective
• AASB 9 Financial Instruments, effective 1 July 2018

Appendix A (continued)
New accounting standards and interpretations (continued)
(ii) Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective (continued)
AASB 9 (December 2014) is a new standard which replaces AASB 139. This new version supersedes AASB 9
issued in December 2009 (as amended) and AASB 9 (issued in December 2010) and includes a model for
classification and measurement, a single, forward-looking ‘expected loss’ impairment model and a
substantially-reformed approach to hedge accounting.
AASB 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. However, the Standard is available
for early adoption. The own credit changes can be early adopted in isolation without otherwise changing the
accounting for financial instruments.
Classification and measurement
AASB 9 includes requirements for a simpler approach for classification and measurement of financial assets
compared with the requirements of AASB 139. There are also some changes made in relation to financial
liabilities.
The main changes are described below.
Financial assets
a. Financial assets that are debt instruments will be classified based on (1) the objective of the entity's business
model for managing the financial assets; (2) the characteristics of the contractual cash flows.
b. Allows an irrevocable election on initial recognition to present gains and losses on investments in equity
instruments that are not held for trading in other comprehensive income. Dividends in respect of these
investments that are a return on investment can be recognised in profit or loss and there is no impairment or
recycling on disposal of the instrument.
c. Financial assets can be designated and measured at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition if
doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from
measuring assets or liabilities, or recognising the gains and losses on them, on different bases.
Financial liabilities
Changes introduced by AASB 9 in respect of financial liabilities are limited to the measurement of liabilities
designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) using the fair value option.
Where the fair value option is used for financial liabilities, the change in fair value is to be accounted for as
follows:
- The change attributable to changes in credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income (OCI)
- The remaining change is presented in profit or loss
AASB 9 also removes the volatility in profit or loss that was caused by changes in the credit risk of liabilities
elected to be measured at fair value. This change in accounting means that gains or losses attributable to
changes in the entity’s own credit risk would be recognised in OCI. These amounts recognised in OCI are not
recycled to profit or loss if the liability is ever repurchased at a discount.
Impairment
The final version of AASB 9 introduces a new expected-loss impairment model that will require more timely
recognition of expected credit losses. Specifically, the new Standard requires entities to account for expected
credit losses from when financial instruments are first recognised and to recognise full lifetime expected losses
on a more timely basis.

Hedge accounting
Amendments to AASB 9 (December 2009 & 2010 editions and AASB 2013-9) issued in December 2013
included the new hedge accounting requirements, including changes to hedge effectiveness testing, treatment
of hedging costs, risk components that can be hedged and disclosures.
Consequential amendments were also made to other standards as a result of AASB 9, introduced by AASB
2009-11 and superseded by AASB 2010-7, AASB 2010-10 and AASB 2014-1 - Part E.
AASB 2014-7 incorporates the consequential amendments arising from the issuance of AASB 9 in Dec 2014.
AASB 2014-8 limits the application of the existing versions of AASB 9 (AASB 9 (December 2009) and AASB 9
(December 2010)) from 1 February 2015 and applies to annual reporting periods beginning on after 1 January
2015.
• AASB 2014-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in
Joint Operations [AASB 1 & AASB 11], effective 1 July 2016
AASB 2014-3 amends AASB 11 Joint Arrangements to provide guidance on the accounting for acquisitions of
interests in joint operations in which the activity constitutes a business. The amendments require:
(a) the acquirer of an interest in a joint operation in which the activity constitutes a business, as defined in AASB
3 Business Combinations, to apply all of the principles on business combinations accounting in AASB 3 and
other Australian Accounting Standards except for those principles that conflict with the guidance in AASB 11;
and
(b) the acquirer to disclose the information required by AASB 3 and other Australian Accounting Standards for
business combinations.
This Standard also makes an editorial correction to AASB 11
• AASB 2014-4 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (Amendments to AASB 116
and AASB 138), effective 1 July 2016
AASB 116 Property Plant and Equipment and AASB 138 Intangible Assets both establish the principle for the
basis of depreciation and amortisation as being the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic
benefits of an asset.
The IASB has clarified that the use of revenue-based methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not
appropriate because revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset generally reflects
factors other than the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in the asset.
The amendment also clarified that revenue is generally presumed to be an inappropriate basis for measuring
the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in an intangible asset. This presumption, however, can be
rebutted in certain limited circumstances.
• AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, effective 1 July 2018
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers replaces the existing revenue recognition standards AASB
111 Construction Contracts, AASB 118 Revenue and related Interpretations (Interpretation 13 Customer Loyalty
Programmes, Interpretation 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate, Interpretation 18 Transfers of
Assets from Customers, Interpretation 131 Revenue-Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services and
Interpretation 1042 Subscriber Acquisition Costs in the Telecommunications Industry). AASB 15 incorporates
the requirements of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB) and developed jointly with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
AASB 15 specifies the accounting treatment for revenue arising from contracts with customers (except for
contracts within the scope of other accounting standards such as leases or financial instruments).The core
principle of AASB 15 is that an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods or services. An entity recognises revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the
following steps:

AASB 2015-8 amended the AASB 15 effective date so it is now effective for annual reporting periods
commencing on or after 1 January 2018. Early application is permitted.
AASB 2014-5 incorporates the consequential amendments to a number Australian Accounting Standards
(including Interpretations) arising from the issuance of AASB 15.
AASB 2016-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Clarifications to AASB 15 amends AASB 15 to
clarify the requirements on identifying performance obligations, principal versus agent considerations and the
timing of recognising revenue from granting a licence and provides further practical expedients on transition to
AASB 15.
• AASB 2014-9 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Equity Method in Separate Financial
Statements, effective 1 July 2016
AASB 2014-9 amends AASB 127 Separate Financial Statements, and consequentially amends AASB 1
First-time Adoption of Australian Accounting Standards and AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint
Ventures, to allow entities to use the equity method of accounting for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures
and associates in their separate financial statements.
AASB 2014-9 also makes editorial corrections to AASB 127.
AASB 2014-9 applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. Early adoption
permitted.
• AASB 2014-10 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an
Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture, effective 1 July 2018
AASB 2014-10 amends AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and AASB 128 to address an
inconsistency between the requirements in AASB 10 and those in AASB 128 (August 2011), in dealing with the
sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture. The amendments require:
(a) A full gain or loss to be recognised when a transaction involves a business (whether it is housed in a
subsidiary or not)
(b) A partial gain or loss to be recognised when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business,
even if these assets are housed in a subsidiary.
AASB 2014-10 also makes an editorial correction to AASB 10.
AASB 2015-10 defers the mandatory effective date (application date) of AASB 2014-10 so that the amendments
are required to be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 instead of 1
January 2016.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements

(continued)
Appendix A (continued)
New accounting standards and interpretations (continued)
(ii) Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective (continued)
The subjects of the principal amendments to the Standards are set out below:
AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations:
- Changes in methods of disposal - where an entity reclassifies an asset (or disposal group) directly from being
held for distribution to being held for sale (or visa versa), an entity shall not follow the guidance in paragraphs
27-29 to account for this change.
AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures:
- Servicing contracts - clarifies how an entity should apply the guidance in paragraph 42C of AASB 7 to a
servicing contract to decide whether a servicing contract is ‘continuing involvement’ for the purposes of applying
the disclosure requirements in paragraphs 42E-42H of AASB 7.
- Applicability of the amendments to AASB 7 to condensed interim financial statements - clarify that the
additional disclosure required by the amendments to AASB 7 Disclosure-Offsetting Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities is not specifically required for all interim periods. However, the additional disclosure is
required to be given in condensed interim financial statements that are prepared in accordance with AASB 134
Interim Financial Reporting when its inclusion would be required by the requirements of AASB 134.
AASB 119 Employee Benefits:
- Discount rate: regional market issue - clarifies that the high quality corporate bonds used to estimate the
discount rate for post-employment benefit obligations should be denominated in the same currency as the
liability. Further it clarifies that the depth of the market for high quality corporate bonds should be assessed at
the currency level.
AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting:
- Disclosure of information ‘elsewhere in the interim financial report’ - amends AASB 134 to clarify the meaning
of disclosure of information ‘elsewhere in the interim financial report’ and to require the inclusion of a
cross-reference from the interim financial statements to the location of this information.
• AASB 2015-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to AASB
101, effective 1 July 2016
The Standard makes amendments to AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements arising from the IASB’s
Disclosure Initiative project. The amendments are designed to further encourage companies to apply
professional judgment in determining what information to disclose in the financial statements. For example, the
amendments make clear that materiality applies to the whole of financial statements and that the inclusion of
immaterial information can inhibit the usefulness of financial disclosures. The amendments also clarify that
companies should use professional judgment in determining where and in what order information is presented
in the financial disclosures.
• AASB 2015-9 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Scope and Application Paragraphs [AASB 8,
AASB 133 & AASB 1057], effective 1 July 2016
This Standard inserts scope paragraphs into AASB 8 and AASB 133 in place of application paragraph text in
AASB 1057. This is to correct inadvertent removal of these paragraphs during editorial changes made in August
2015. There is no change to the requirements or the applicability of AASB 8 and AASB 133.

(ii) Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective (continued)
The key features of AASB 16 are as follows:
Lessee accounting
- Lessees are required to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months,
unless the underlying asset is of low value.
- A lessee measures right-of-use assets similarly to other non-financial assets and lease liabilities similarly to
other financial liabilities.
- Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The measurement
includes non-cancellable lease payments (including inflation-linked payments), and also includes payments to
be made in optional periods if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease, or not
to exercise an option to terminate the lease.
- AASB 16 contains disclosure requirements for lessees.
Lessor accounting
- AASB 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in AASB 117. Accordingly, a lessor
continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of
leases differently.
- AASB 16 also requires enhanced disclosures to be provided by lessors that will improve information disclosed
about a lessor’s risk exposure, particularly to residual value risk.
AASB 16 supersedes:
(a) AASB 117 Leases
(b) Interpretation 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease
(c) SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives
(d) SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a
Lease
The new standard will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is
permitted, provided the new revenue standard, AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, has been
applied, or is applied at the same date as AASB 16.
• AASB 2016-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for
Unrealised Losses [AASB 112], effective 1 July 2017
This Standard amends AASB 112 Income Taxes (July 2004) and AASB 112 Income Taxes (August 2015) to
clarify the requirements on recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses on debt instruments
measured at fair value.
• 2016-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to AASB 107,
effective 1 July 2017
This Standard amends AASB 107 Statement of Cash Flows (August 2015) to require entities preparing financial
statements in accordance with Tier 1 reporting requirements to provide disclosures that enable users of
financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes
arising from cash flows and non-cash changes.
• IFRS 2 (Amendments) Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions [Amendments to
IFRS 2], effective 1 July 2018

New accounting standards and interpretations (continued)
(ii) Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective (continued)
This standard amends to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, clarifying how to account for certain types of
share-based payment transactions. The amendments provide requirements on the accounting for:
- The effects of vesting and non-vesting conditions on the measurement of cash-settled share-based payments
- Share-based payment transactions with a net settlement feature for withholding tax obligations
- A modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment that changes the classification of the
transaction from cash-settled to equity-settled
The Company has decided not to early adopt any of the new and amended pronouncements. The Company is in
the process of evaluating the impact of the above standards.
