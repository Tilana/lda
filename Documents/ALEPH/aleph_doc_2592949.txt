Natural Gas Services Group, Inc.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(unaudited)
(1) Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
These notes apply to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Natural Gas
Services Group, Inc. a Colorado corporation (the "Company", “NGSG”, "Natural Gas Services
Group", "we" or "our").
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all
adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary to make our
financial position at June 30, 2016 and the results of our operations for the three months and six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 not misleading.  As permitted by the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the accompanying consolidated
financial statements do not include all disclosures normally required by generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP).  These financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 on file with the SEC.  In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements are a fair presentation of the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full fiscal year ending December 31,
2016.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from the sales of custom and fabricated compressors, and flare systems is recognized
when title passes to the customer, the customer assumes risks and rewards of ownership,
collectability is reasonably assured and delivery occurs as directed by our customer. From time
to time, we have customers that request units and flares to be built under a bill and hold
arrangement. In order to recognize revenue under a bill and hold arrangement the following
criteria must be met: risk of ownership was passed to the customer, customer made a fixed
commitment to purchase the goods, the buyer requested the bill and hold, there was a fixed
schedule for delivery, we no longer had any specific performance obligations, the purchase was
segregated at our facility and the equipment was complete and ready to ship. As of June 30,
2016, we recognized revenue of $4.0 million under these bill and hold arrangements. Exchange
and rebuilt compressor revenue is recognized when the replacement compressor has been
delivered and the rebuild assessment has been completed.  Revenue from compressor service
and retrofitting services is recognized upon providing services to the customer.  Maintenance
agreement revenue is recognized as services are rendered.  Rental revenue is recognized over
the terms of the respective rental agreements.  Deferred income represents payments received
before a product is shipped.  Revenue from the sale of rental units is included in sales revenue
when equipment is shipped or title is transferred to the customer.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Our financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, deferred compensation plan (cash portion) and our line of credit. Pursuant to
ASC 820 (Accounting Standards Codification), the fair value of our cash equivalents is
determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets. We believe that the recorded values of all of our other financial instruments
approximate their fair values because of their nature and relatively short maturity dates or
durations.
 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting
Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU identifies areas for
simplification involving several areas of accounting for share-based compensation
arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification of awards as equity or liabilities,
classifications on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The provisions of this ASU are
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted provided that presentation is applied to the beginning of the
fiscal year of adoption. The new standard will be effective during our first quarter ending March
31, 2017. We are currently evaluating the potential impact this new standard may have on our
financial statements.
4
On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606), as part of a joint project with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to
clarify revenue-recognizing principles and develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). ASU No. 2014-09 finalizes Proposed
ASU Nos. 1820-100, 2011-230 and 2011-250 and is expected, among other things, to remove
inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements and improve comparability of revenue
recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. In particular,
the amendments in this ASU will be added to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
(FASB ASC) as Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and will supersede the
revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, as well as some
cost guidance in FASB ASC Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and
Production-Type Contracts. The core principle of this ASU is that an entity should recognize
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. To achieve this core principle, the guidance provides that an entity should apply the
following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligation
in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the
performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity
satisfies a performance obligation. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 deferring
the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09, by one year. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-
08 which further clarifies the guidance on the principal versus agent considerations within ASU
2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10 to expand the guidance on identifying
performance obligations and licensing within ASU 2014-09. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-12 to clarify the assessment of the likelihood that revenue will be collected from a contract
,the guidance for recognizing sales taxes and similar taxes and the timing for measuring
customers payments that are not in cash within ASU 2014-09. For public entities, the
amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is permitted only for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within
that year. Additionally, an entity should apply the amendments either retrospectively to each prior
reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this
ASU recognized at the date of initial application. If an entity elects the latter, transition method,
then it must also provide the additional disclosures in reporting periods that include the date of
initial application of (1) the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the
current reporting period, as compared to the guidance that was in effect before the change, and
(2) an explanation of the reasons for significant changes. The new standard will be effective
during our first quarter ending March 31, 2018. We are currently evaluating the new standard to
determine which reporting option allows us to report the most meaningful information and are still
evaluating the potential impact this new standard may have on our financial statements.

Restricted Stock:
In accordance with the Company's employment agreement with Stephen Taylor, the Company's
Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee reviewed his performance in determining
the issuance of restricted common stock. Based on this review which included consideration of
the Company's 2015 performance, Mr. Taylor, was awarded 75,915 restricted shares on January
6, 2016, which vest over two years, in equal installments, beginning January 6, 2017. On April 6,
2016, the Compensation Committee awarded 20,000 shares of restricted common stock to each
of G. Larry Lawrence, our CFO, and James Hazlett, our Vice President of Technical Services.
The restricted shares to Messrs. Hazlett and Lawrence vest over two years, in equal installments,
beginning April 6, 2017. We also awarded and issued 23,536 shares of restricted common stock
to our Board of Directors as partial payment for 2016 directors' fees. The restricted stock issued to
our directors vests over one year, in quarterly installments, beginning March 31, 2017. Total
compensation expense related to restricted stock awards was $908,879 and $1,492,142 for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, there was a total of
$2,518,209 of unrecognized compensation expense related to these shares which is expected to
be recognized over the next two years.
(3) Inventory
June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015
(in thousands)
Our inventory, net of allowance for obsolescence of $44,000 and $12,000 at June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, consisted of the following amounts:
 
 
Raw materials $ 19,736

Work in process3,910
$ 20,726
 1,051

 $ 27,722
$ 24,675
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no write-offs of obsolete
inventory against the allowance for obsolescence.
(4) Retirement of Long-Lived Assets
As a result of a decline in market conditions during the first half of 2015, management reviewed
our rental compressor units that were not of the type, configuration, make or model that our
customers were demanding or that were not cost efficient to refurbish, maintain and operate. As a
result of that review, we determined that 258 units representing total horsepower of 32,259
should be retired from our rental fleet with key components from those units being re-utilized in
future unit builds and/or repairs. We performed an optimization review and recorded a $4.4
million loss on the retirement of rental equipment to reduce the book value of each unit to the
estimated aggregate fair value of approximately $967,000 for the key components being kept.
The retirement was recorded in second quarter of 2015. No retirements have been made in 2016.
(5) Deferred Compensation Plans
Effective January 1, 2016, the Company established a non-qualified deferred compensation plan
for executive officers, directors and certain eligible employees. The assets of the deferred
compensation plan are held in a rabbi trust and are subject to additional risk of loss in the event
of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company. The plan allows for deferral up to 90% of a
participant’s base salary, bonus, commissions, director fees and restricted stock awards. A
Company owned life insurance policy held in a rabbi trust is utilized as a source of funding for the
plan. The cash surrender value of the life insurance policy is $109,000 as of June 30, 2016, with
a gain related to the policy of $4,000 reported in other income in our condensed consolidated
income statement for the six months ending June 30, 2016.
For deferrals of base salary, bonus, commissions and director fees, settlement payments are
made to participants in cash, either in a lump sum or in periodic installments. The deferred
obligation to pay the deferred compensation and the deferred director fees is adjusted to reflect
the positive or negative performance of investment measurement options selected by each
participant and was $109,000 as of June 30, 2016. The deferred obligation is included in other
long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.
7
For deferrals of restricted stock, the plan does not allow for diversification, therefore, distributions
are paid in shares and the obligation is carried at grant value. As of June 30, 2016, no shares
had been deferred.
(6) Credit Facility
We have a senior secured revolving credit agreement the "Amended Credit Agreement" with JP
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A (the "Lender") with an aggregate commitment of $30 million, subject to
collateral availability. We also have a right to request from the Lender, on an uncommitted basis,
an increase of up to $20 million on the aggregate commitment (which could potentially increase
the commitment amount to $50 million).
Borrowing Base. At any time before the maturity of the Amended Credit Agreement, we may
draw, repay and re-borrow amounts available under the borrowing base up to the maximum
aggregate availability discussed above. Generally, the borrowing base equals the sum of (a)
80% of our eligible accounts receivable plus (b) 50% of the book value of our eligible general
inventory (not to exceed 50% of the commitment amount at the time) plus (c) 75% of the book
value of our eligible equipment inventory.  The Lender may adjust the borrowing base
components if material deviations in the collateral are discovered in future audits of the collateral.
We had $29.5 million borrowing base availability at June 30, 2016 under the terms of our
Amended Credit Agreement.
 
Interest and Fees.  Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, we have the option of
selecting the applicable variable rate for each revolving loan, or portion thereof, of either
(a) LIBOR multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit
Agreement), with respect to this rate, for Eurocurrency funding, plus the Applicable Margin
(“LIBOR-based”), or (b) CB Floating Rate, which is the Lender's Prime Rate less the Applicable
Margin; provided, however, that no more than three LIBOR-based borrowings under the
agreement may be outstanding at any one time. For purposes of the LIBOR-based interest rate,
the Applicable Margin is 1.50%. For purposes of the CB Floating Rate, the Applicable Margin is
1.50%. For the six month period ended June 30, 2016, our weighted average interest rate was
1.75%.
Accrued interest is payable monthly on outstanding principal amounts, provided that accrued
interest on LIBOR-based loans is payable at the end of each interest period, but in no event less
frequently than quarterly. In addition, fees and expenses are payable in connection with our
requests for letters of credit (generally equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR-related
borrowings multiplied by the face amount of the requested letter of credit) and administrative and
legal costs.
 
Maturity . The maturity date of the Amended Credit Agreement is December 31, 2017, at which
time all amounts borrowed under the agreement will be due and outstanding letters of credit must
be cash collateralized. The agreement may be terminated early upon our request or the
occurrence of an event of default.
 
Security. The obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien
on all of our inventory and accounts and leases receivables, along with a first priority lien on a
variable number of our leased compressor equipment the book value of which must be
maintained at a minimum of 2.00 to 1.00 commitment coverage ratio (such ratio being equal to (i)
the amount of the borrowing base as of such date to (ii) the amount of the commitment as of such
date.)
 
Covenants. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties,
as well as covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness
and liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; make acquisitions in excess of certain amounts;
pay dividends; redeem or repurchase capital stock or senior notes; make investments or loans;
make negative pledges; consolidate, merge or effect asset sales; or change the nature of our
business. In addition, we also have certain financial covenants that require us to maintain on a
consolidated basis a leverage ratio less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each
fiscal quarter.
Events of Default and Acceleration. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events
of default for credit facilities of this size and type, and includes, without limitation, payment
defaults; defaults in performance of covenants or other agreements contained in the loan
documents; inaccuracies in representations and warranties; certain defaults, termination events
or similar events; certain defaults with respect to any other Company indebtedness in excess of
$50,000; certain bankruptcy or insolvency events; the rendering of certain judgments in excess of
$150,000; certain ERISA events; certain change in control events and the defectiveness of any
liens under the secured revolving credit facility. Obligations under the Amended Credit
Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default.
 
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants in our Amended Credit
Agreement.  A default under our Credit Agreement could trigger the acceleration of our bank debt
so that it is immediately due and payable.  Such default would likely limit our ability to access
other credit. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 our outstanding balance on the line of
credit was $417,000.

(8) Segment Information
 
ASC 280-10-50, “Operating Segments", defines the characteristics of an operating segment as a)
being engaged in business activity from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses, b) being
reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker (CODM) for decisions about
resources to be allocated and assess its performance and c) having discrete financial
information.  Although we look at our products to analyze the nature of our revenue, other
financial information, such as certain costs and expenses, net income and EBITDA are not
captured or analyzed by these categories.  Our CODM does not make resource allocation
decisions or access the performance of the business based on these categories, but rather in the
aggregate. Based on this, management believes that it operates in one business segment.
 
In their analysis of product lines as potential operating segments, management also considered
ASC 280-10-50-11, “Aggregation Criteria”, which allows for the aggregation of operating
segments if the segments have similar economic characteristics and if the segments are similar
in each of the following areas:
 
•The nature of the products and services;
•The nature of the production processes;
•The type or class of customer for their products and services;
•The methods used to distribute their products or provide their services; and
•The nature of the regulatory environment, if applicable.
 
We are engaged in the business of designing and manufacturing compressors and flares. Our
compressors and flares are sold and rented to our customers. In addition, we provide service and
maintenance on compressors in our fleet and to third parties. These business activities are
similar in all geographic areas.  Our manufacturing process is essentially the same for the entire
Company and is performed in-house at our facilities in Midland, Texas and Tulsa,
Oklahoma.  Our customers primarily consist of entities in the business of producing natural gas
and crude oil.  The maintenance and service of our products is consistent across the entire
Company and is performed via an internal fleet of vehicles.  The regulatory environment is similar
in every jurisdiction in that the most impacting regulations and practices are the result of federal
energy policy.  In addition, the economic characteristics of each customer arrangement are
similar in that we maintain policies at the corporate level.

(9)  Commitments and Contingencies
From time to time, we are a party to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our
business.  While management is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, it
believes that any ultimate liability arising from these actions will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.  We are not currently a party to
any material legal proceedings, and we are not aware of any threatened material litigation.
11
Item 2.   Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on,
and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed, consolidated financial statements and
the related notes included elsewhere in this report and  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC.
Overview
We fabricate, manufacture, rent and sell natural gas compressors and related equipment. Our
primary focus is on the rental of natural gas compressors. Our rental contracts generally provide
for initial terms of six to 24 months. After the initial term of our rental contracts, most of our
customers have continued to rent our compressors on a month-to-month basis. Rental amounts
are billed monthly in advance and include maintenance of the rented compressors. As of
June 30, 2016, we had 1,463 natural gas compressors totaling 209,596 horsepower rented to 82
customers compared to 2,006 natural gas compressors totaling 278,827 horsepower rented to 90
customers at June 30, 2015.
We also fabricate natural gas compressors for sale to our customers, designing compressors to
meet unique specifications dictated by well pressures, production characteristics and particular
applications for which compression is sought. Fabrication of compressors involves our purchase
of engines, compressors, coolers and other components, and our assembling of these
components on skids for delivery to customer locations. The major components of our
compressors are acquired through periodic purchase orders placed with third-party suppliers on
an “as needed” basis, which presently requires a two to three month lead time with delivery dates
scheduled to coincide with our estimated production schedules. Although we do not have formal
continuing supply contracts with any major supplier, we believe we have adequate alternative
sources available. In the past, we have not experienced any sudden and dramatic increases in
the prices of the major components for our compressors. However, the occurrence of such an
event could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and financial
condition, particularly if we were unable to increase our rental rates and sales prices
proportionate to any such component price increases.
We also manufacture a proprietary line of compressor frames, cylinders and parts, known as our
CiP (Cylinder-in-Plane) product line. We use finished CiP component products in the fabrication
of compressor units for sale or rental by us or sell the finished component products to other
compressor fabricators. We also design, fabricate, sell, install and service flare stacks and
related ignition and control devices for onshore and offshore incineration of gas compounds such
as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gases. To provide
customer support for our compressor and flare sales businesses, we stock varying levels of
replacement parts at our Midland, Texas facility and at field service locations. We also provide an
exchange and rebuild program for screw compressors and maintain an inventory of new and
used compressors to facilitate this business.
We provide service and maintenance to our customers under written maintenance contracts or on
an as-required basis in the absence of a service contract. Maintenance agreements typically
have terms of nine months to one year and require payment of a monthly fee.
The oil and natural gas equipment rental and services industry is cyclical in nature. The most
critical factor in assessing the outlook for the industry is the worldwide supply and demand for
natural gas and crude oil and the corresponding changes in commodity prices. As demand and
prices increase, oil and natural gas producers increase their capital expenditures for drilling,
development and production activities. Generally, the increased capital expenditures ultimately
result in greater revenues and profits for services and equipment companies.
In general, we expect our overall business activity and revenues to track the level of activity in the
natural gas industry, with changes in domestic natural gas production and consumption levels
and prices more significantly affecting our business than changes in crude oil and condensate
production and consumption levels and prices. However, we have increased our rental and sales
in the non-conventional shale plays which are more dependent on crude oil prices. We also
believe that demand for compression services and products is driven by declining reservoir
pressure in maturing natural gas producing fields and, more recently, by increased focus by
producers on non-conventional natural gas production, such as coalbed methane, gas shales
and tight gas, which typically requires more compression than production from conventional
natural gas reservoirs.
 
Demand for our products and services have been historically strong. However, a decline in
demand is experienced during periods of low crude oil and natural gas prices. Low crude oil and
natural gas prices experienced throughout 2015 have continued in the first six months of 2016,
with some price strengthening. Through much of this period, producers maintained their focus on
non-conventional opportunities. The continued low price environment has caused reduced
project spending on both conventional and non-conventional plays. While the timing of a return of
aggressive investment in the projects in uncertain, we believe the
12
long-term trend in our market is favorable.  We believe this outlook is supported by our ability to
withstand temporary disruptions and position the Company for the long term.

Results of Operations
Three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.

Total revenue decreased to $17.2 million from $24.2 million, or 29%, for the three months ended
June 30, 2016, compared to the same period ended June 30, 2015. The $7.0 million drop in
revenue is due to rental units being returned in connection with the low oil and gas price
environment and timing of unit sales.
Rental revenue decreased to $14.7 million from $19.7 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016, compared to the same period ended June 30, 2015.  This decrease is due to the
reduced demand from the drop in oil prices resulting in units being returned.  We ended the
quarter with 2,626 compressor packages, down from 2,662 units at June 30, 2015.  The rental
fleet had a utilization of 55.7% as of June 30, 2016 compared to 75.4% utilization as of June 30,
2015. This drop in utilization is mainly the result of compressor rental units being returned. In the
event that oil and natural gas prices increase, we should see an increase in the utilization of our
fleet.
Sales revenue decreased to $2.3 million from $4.3 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016, compared to the same period ended June 30, 2015, respectively.  This decrease is the
result of the inconsistent timing of industry activity related to the completion of capital projects.
We believe this timing is reflective of the typical sales cycle, resulting in inconsistent compressor
units sales to third parties from our Tulsa and Midland operations. There was also a decrease in
demand for flares during this comparative period.
Our overall operating income increased $981,000 to $1.9 million from $919,000 for the three
months ended June 30,2016 compared to the same period ended June 30, 2015, due to the
retirement of rental equipment in the prior year mentioned in Note 4 to the Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating margin percentage decreased to 11% from 22%,
excluding the rental fleet retirement, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30,
2015, respectively. The operating margin decreased due the reduction in total revenue with a
slight relative increase in costs.
Selling, general, and administrative expense decreased to $2.2 million from $2.9 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2016, and June 30, 2015, primarily due to changing the vesting
periods of newly issued restricted stock grants, from one to two years.  
 
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $5.4 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016, compared to $5.9 million for the period ended June 30, 2015.  This decrease is
the result of fewer units being added to the fleet, older units becoming fully depreciated and the
retirement of 258 rental units during the second quarter of 2015. We added only 18 units over the
past 12 months to our fleet.
 
Provision for income tax was $605,000 and $307,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2016
and June 30, 2015, respectively. The increase in the provision is a result of a decrease in taxable
income due to the retirement of rental equipment, in the prior year, mentioned in Note 4 to the
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.

Total revenue decreased to $38.8 million from $49.0 million, or 20.8%, for the six months ended
June 30, 2016, compared to the same period ended June 30, 2015. Comparing the six months
ended June 30, 2016 to the same period in 2015, rental revenue decreased 23% and sales
revenue decreased 12%.
Rental revenue decreased, to $31.1 million from $40.3 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016, compared to the same period ended June 30, 2015.  This decrease is the result of the
decline in demand from the oil and natural gas industry, due to the continued depressed oil and
gas prices.  We ended the quarter with 2,626 compressor packages in our rental fleet, down from
2,662 units at June 30, 2015.  The rental fleet had a utilization of 55.7%, as of June 30, 2016
compared to 75.4% utilization as of June 30, 2015. This utilization decrease mainly results from
compressor returns reflecting the impact of the low price environment. In the event that oil and
natural gas prices increase, we should see incremental utilization of our fleet.
Sales revenue decreased, to $7.2 million from $8.2 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016, compared to the same period ended June 30, 2015.  This decrease is the result of the
inconsistent timing of industry activity related to capital projects. We believe this timing is
reflective of the typical sales cycle, resulting in inconsistent compressor units sales to third
parties from our Tulsa and Midland operations. There was also a decrease in demand for flares
during this comparative period.
Our overall operating income decreased $1.1 million to $5.6 million from $6.7 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period ended June 30,2015, primarily due
to a decrease in revenue. Operating margin percentage decreased, to 15% from 23%, excluding
the rental fleet retirement, for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period
ended June 30, 2015. The operating margin decreased due to the reduction in total revenue with
a slight increase in costs.
As a result of a decline in market conditions, in June 2015, management reviewed our rental
compressor units and determined that 258 units should be retired (with certain key components
being re-utilized), representing total horsepower of 32,259. Based on this optimization review, at
June 30, 2015, we recorded a $4.4 million non-cash loss on the retirement of rental equipment for
the six months ended June 30, 2015, to reduce the book value to approximately $967,000, the
estimated fair value of the key components being kept.
Selling, general, and administrative expense decreased to $4.7 million from $5.5 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the same period ended June 30, 2015,
primarily due to changing the vesting periods of newly issued restricted stock grants, from one to
two years. 
 
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $10.9 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016, compared to $11.6 million for the period ended June 30, 2015.  This decrease is
the result of fewer units being added to the fleet, older units becoming fully depreciated and the
retirement of 258 rental units during 2nd quarter of 2015. We added only 18 units over the past 12
months to our fleet.
Provision for income tax decreased to $1.8 million from $2.4 million, or 25.0%, and is the result of
the decrease in taxable income and a change in effective tax rate between the two periods. The
decrease in the provision is due to a decease in taxable income which is largely driven by a
decrease in revenues, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to six months ended
June 30, 2015.

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we invested $2.6 million in equipment for our rental
fleet and service vehicles. Even though we have idle rental equipment, at times we do not have
the specific type of equipment that our customers require, therefore we have to build new
equipment to satisfy their needs.  We financed this activity with cash flow from operations and
cash on hand.
Cash flows
At June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $52.2 million compared to $35.5 million
at December 31, 2015.  Our cash flow from operations of $19.8 million was offset by capital
expenditures of $2.6 million, during the six months ended June 30, 2016.  We had working
capital of $80.8 million at June 30, 2016 compared to $68.6 million at December 31, 2015. On
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had outstanding debt of $417,000, which is all
related to our line of credit and is classified as non-current. We had positive net cash flow from
operating activities of $19.8 million during the first six months of 2016 compared to $25.0 million
for the first six months of 2015.  The cash flow from operations of $19.8 million was primarily the
result of the net income of $3.8 million and the non-cash items of depreciation of $10.9 million,
$1.2 million related to the expenses associated with stock options and restricted shares, a
decrease in deferred income taxes of $770,000 and an increase in working capital.
Strategy
For the remainder of the fiscal year 2016 and into 2017, our overall plan is to continue monitoring
and holding expenses in line with the anticipated level of activity, fabricate rental fleet equipment
only in direct response to market requirements, emphasize marketing of our idle gas compressor
units and limit bank borrowing in line with market conditions.  For the remainder of 2016, our
forecasted capital expenditures will be directly dependent upon our customers’ compression
requirements and are not anticipated to exceed our internally generated cash flows and cash on
hand.  Any required capital will be for additions to our compressor rental fleet and/or addition or
replacement of service vehicles.  We believe that cash flows from operations, our current cash
position and our line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our capital and liquidity requirements for
the foreseeable future.  We may require additional capital to fund any unanticipated
expenditures, including any acquisitions of other businesses, although that capital, beyond our
line of credit, as discussed below may not be available to us when we need it or on acceptable
terms.
16
Bank Borrowings
We have a senior secured revolving credit agreement the "Amended Credit Agreement" with JP
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "Lender") with an aggregate commitment of $30 million, subject to
collateral availability. We also have a right to request from the lender, on an uncommitted basis,
an increase of up to $20 million on the aggregate commitment (which could potentially increase
the commitment amount to $50 million).
Borrowing Base. At any time before the maturity of the Amended Credit Agreement, we may
draw, repay and re-borrow amounts available under the borrowing base up to the maximum
aggregate availability discussed above. Generally, the borrowing base equals the sum of (a)
80% of our eligible accounts receivable plus (b) 50% of the book value of our eligible general
inventory (not to exceed 50% of the commitment amount at the time) plus (c) 75% of the book
value of our eligible equipment inventory. The Lender may adjust the borrowing base
components if material deviations in the collateral are discovered in future audits of the collateral.
We had $29.5 million borrowing base availability at June 30, 2016, under the terms of our
Amended Credit Agreement.
 
Interest and Fees.  Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, we have the option of
selecting the applicable variable rate for each revolving loan, or portion thereof, of either
(a) LIBOR multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit
Agreement), with respect to this rate, for Eurocurrency funding, plus the Applicable Margin
(“LIBOR-based”), or (b) CB Floating Rate, which is the Lender's Prime Rate less the Applicable
Margin; provided, however, that no more than three LIBOR-based borrowings under the
agreement may be outstanding at any one time. For purposes of the LIBOR-based interest rate,
the Applicable Margin is 1.50%. For purposes of the CB Floating Rate, the Applicable Margin is
1.50%. For the six month period ended June 30, 2016, our weighted average interest rate was
1.75%.
Accrued interest is payable monthly on outstanding principal amounts, provided that accrued
interest on LIBOR-based loans is payable at the end of each interest period, but in no event less
frequently than quarterly. In addition, fees and expenses are payable in connection with our
requests for letters of credit (generally equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR-related
borrowings multiplied by the face amount of the requested letter of credit) and administrative and
legal costs.
Maturity. The maturity date of the Amended Credit Agreement is December 31, 2017, at which
time all amounts borrowed under the agreement will be due and outstanding letters of credit must
be cash collateralized. The agreement may be terminated early upon our request or the
occurrence of an event of default.
 
Security. The obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien
on all of our inventory and accounts and leases receivables, along with a first priority lien on a
variable number of our leased compressor equipment the book value of must be maintained at a
minimum of 2.00 to 1.00 commitment coverage ratio (such ratio being equal to (i) the amount of
the borrowing base as of such date to (ii) the amount of the commitment as of such date.)
 
Covenants. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties,
as well as covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness
and liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; make acquisitions in excess of certain amounts;
pay dividends; redeem or repurchase capital stock or senior notes; make investments or loans;
make negative pledges; consolidate, merge or effect asset sales; or change the nature of our
business. In addition, we also have certain financial covenants that require us to maintain on a
consolidated basis a leverage ratio less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each
fiscal quarter.
Events of Default and Acceleration. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events
of default for credit facilities of this size and type, and includes, without limitation, payment
defaults; defaults in performance of covenants or other agreements contained in the loan
documents; inaccuracies in representations and warranties; certain defaults, termination events
or similar events; certain defaults with respect to any other Company indebtedness in excess of
$50,000; certain bankruptcy or insolvency events; the rendering of certain judgments in excess of
$150,000; certain ERISA events; certain change in control events and the defectiveness of any
liens under the secured revolving credit facility. Obligations under the Amended Credit
Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default.
 
As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants in our Amended Credit
Agreement.  A default under our Credit Agreement could trigger the acceleration of our bank debt
so that it is immediately due and payable.  Such default would likely limit our ability to access
other credit. At June 30, 2016, our balance on the line of credit was $417,000.

Critical Accounting Policies and Practices
There have been no changes in the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Company's Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting
Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU is identifies areas for
simplification involving several areas of accounting for share-based compensation
arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification of awards as equity or liabilities,
classifications on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The provisions of this ASU are
effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted provided that presentation is applied to the beginning of the
fiscal year of adoption. The new standard will be effective during our first quarter ending March
31, 2017. We are currently evaluating the potential impact this new standard may have on our
financial statements.
On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606), as part of a joint project with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to
clarify revenue-recognizing principles and develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). ASU No. 2014-09 finalizes Proposed
ASU Nos. 1820-100, 2011-230 and 2011-250 and is expected, among other things, to remove
inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements and improve comparability of revenue
recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. In particular,
the amendments in this ASU will be added to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
(FASB ASC) as Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and will supersede the
revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, as well as some
cost guidance in FASB ASC Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and
Production-Type Contracts. The core principle of this ASU is that an entity should recognize
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. To achieve this core principle, the guidance provides that an entity should apply the
following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligation
in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the
performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity
satisfies a performance obligation. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14 deferring
the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09, by one year. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-
08 which further clarifies the guidance on the principal versus agent considerations within ASU
2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10 to expand the guidance on identifying
performance obligations and licensing within ASU 2014-09. For public entities, the amendments
are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
periods within that reporting period, and early adoption is permitted only for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year.
Additionally, an entity should apply the amendments either retrospectively to each prior
18
reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this
ASU recognized at the date of initial application. If an entity elects the latter, transition method,
then it must also provide the additional disclosures in reporting periods that include the date of
initial application of (1) the amount by which each financial statement line item is affected in the
current reporting period, as compared to the guidance that was in effect before the change, and
(2) an explanation of the reasons for significant changes. The new standard will be effective
during our first quarter ending March 31, 2018. We are currently evaluating the new standard to
determine which reporting option allows us to report the most meaningful information and are still
evaluating the potential impact this new standard may have on our financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
From time-to-time, we enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give
rise to off-balance sheet obligations.  As of June 30, 2016, the off-balance sheet arrangements
and transactions that we have entered into include operating lease agreements and purchase
agreements.  We do not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect
our liquidity, availability of, or requirements for, capital resources.
                          
Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Except for historical information contained herein, the statements in this report are forward-
looking and made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and
uncertainties, which may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from
forecasted results.  Those risks include, among other things, the loss of market share through
competition or otherwise; the introduction of competing technologies by other companies; a
prolonged, substantial reduction in oil and natural gas prices which could cause a decline in the
demand for our products and services; and new governmental safety, health and environmental
regulations which could require us to make significant capital expenditures. The forward-looking
statements included in this Form 10-Q are only made as of the date of this report, and we
undertake no obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent
events or circumstances. A discussion of these and other risk factors is included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC.

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
There have been no changes in the market risks disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015.
Item 4.  Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President and
Principal Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and of our “disclosure controls and
procedures” (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or, the “Exchange Act”) as of the end of the period covered
by this report pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.  Based upon that evaluation, the President
and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President and Principal Accounting Officer have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed
or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.  These include controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and
financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  Due to
the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements or omissions may be
detected.  Those inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can
be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.  Additionally,
controls could be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or
more people.  Our controls and procedures can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the above objectives have been met.
Changes in Internal Controls.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection
with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that
occurred during our last quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we are a party to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our
business.  While management is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, it
believes that any ultimate liability arising from these actions will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.  We are not currently a party to
any material legal proceedings and we are not aware of any threatened litigation.
Item 1A.  Risk Factors
Please refer to and read “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2015 for a discussion of the risks associated with our Company and
industry.
