<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on the rights on the human rights of 
internally displaced persons provides an account of his activities since his previous report to 
the Human Rights Council.1 He also examines the African Union Convention for the 
Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (Kampala Convention), 
giving an outline of the context of its adoption, its key provisions and their concrete impact 
on enhancing the protection of and assistance to internally displaced persons, taking stock 
of the progress made in its implementation and, in particular, the importance of its 
domestication. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Mandate and activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Mandate  
</b></p>
<p>2. In accordance with his mandate, as described by the Human Rights Council in its 
resolution 23/8, the Special Rapporteur has endeavoured to promote a rights-based 
approach to internal displacement through dialogue with Governments and mainstreaming 
and advocacy activities within the United Nations and regional organizations. He expresses 
his appreciation to the Governments that have issued invitations or otherwise engaged with 
the mandate holder and to the various United Nations and other international organizations 
that have provided support for his activities. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Engagement with countries 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Georgia 
</b></p>
<p>3. Following up on the last visit conducted by the previous mandate holder in 2009, the 
Special Rapporteur undertook a visit to Georgia from 10 to 14 June 2013 at the invitation of 
the Government. He visited collective centres and settlements for internally displaced 
persons in Western Georgia, including Shida, Kartli and Poti, and held meetings with 
displaced persons themselves. He was, however, unable to visit Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali 
region/South Ossetia. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government&#8217;s commitment to provide 
durable solutions for all internally displaced persons in Georgia and to address the issue of 
those displaced by natural or human-induced disasters. He noted, however, that there was an 
urgent need to continue to improve the living conditions and livelihoods of internally 
displaced persons in the collective centres he visited, and called for the adoption of an 
integrated approach to address the situation of all displaced persons. He welcomes new 
opportunities in this regard and urges the Government to consult the said persons and to 
enable their participation in decisions affecting them in order to achieve durable solutions in 
safety and dignity, while guaranteeing that their choices are informed and voluntary. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur notes that the search for durable solutions is still hampered 
by political deadlock, and calls upon all parties concerned urgently to address the issue of 
internally displaced persons as a humanitarian one to allow displaced persons wishing to 
return to their areas of origin to do so voluntarily in safety and dignity. He expresses his

<p>concerns at the establishment of a coiled razor wire fence along the administrative boundary 
line of the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, which deprives displaced persons and 
displacement-affected communities of their freedom of movement and livelihoods on their 
lands. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Serbia and the authorities in Kosovo  
</b></p>
<p>6. Following up on the visit conducted by the previous mandate holder in 2009, the 
Special Rapporteur undertook a visit to Serbia and the authorities in Kosovo, at the 
invitation of the Government, from 9 to 12 October 2013. The Special Rapporteur visited 
Belgrade and Pristina, as well as various sites of displacement. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that both the Government of Serbia 
and the authorities in Kosovo, in the context of the European Union accession framework, 
cooperate to work towards the implementation of durable solutions for internally displaced 
persons. He commends the Government of Serbia and the authorities in Kosovo for 
considering local integration as a durable solution option, together with other durable 
solutions, where possible. He stresses that the key to attaining durable solutions in Serbia 
and Kosovo lies in providing durable housing for all displaced persons on the model of the 
regional housing project for refugees, although such a project should be linked to 
livelihoods, particularly income-generating activities, employment, health, education, water 
and energy. While welcoming the greater openness to consider local integration as a durable 
solution, the Special Rapporteur noted that the most immediate need is to improve the 
livelihoods of displaced persons in their current locations and to provide them, particularly 
displaced Roma, with adequate services.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur stressed the need to address other key issues, including the 
effective resolution of property disputes, including recovery, where possible, of property in 
places of origin, and effective compensation where property cannot be recovered.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. South Sudan  
</b></p>
<p>9. From 6 to 15 November 2013, the Special Rapporteur undertook a visit to South 
Sudan at the invitation of the Government. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur 
visited Juba, Bor and Pibor in Jonglei.  
</p>
<p>10. Recalling the Government&#8217;s primary responsibility to assist and protect all internally 
displaced persons in an equal manner, the Special Rapporteur further emphasized that 
humanitarian action, constitutional inclusion, development and peacebuilding measures 
were the cornerstones of durable solutions for displaced persons and returnees. He stressed 
that civilians, including internally displaced persons, should be spared from violence and 
abuse by all parties. He called for capacities to be further strengthened and the response to 
displaced persons should be demilitarized.  
</p>
<p>11. Following his visit, a new cycle of violence broke out on 15 December 2013 in Juba 
and quickly spread to other locations in South Sudan. In two press statements issued on 20 
December 2013 and 31 January 2014, the Special Rapporteur expressed concern at what had 
emerged primarily as a political crisis and then evolved into an increasingly ethnically 
charged conflict across South Sudan, leading to large-scale internal displacement in the 
compounds of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). The congested 
conditions inside UNMISS compounds where internally displaced persons have taken 
shelter<b> </b>has started to create risks for them. The Special Rapporteur, while recommending the 
decongestion of the said sites, stresses that this should not be a quick, stand-alone measure 
in the ongoing crisis, but must be embedded in a long-term comprehensive strategy on 
internal displacement. The dimensions and complexities of internal displacement require a </p>


<p>strategic response to overcome the divide between humanitarian and development action 
and to create a common peace dividend.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Sri Lanka  
</b></p>
<p>12. From 2 to 6 December 2013, the Special Rapporteur undertook, at the invitation of 
the Government, a visit to Sri Lanka. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur travelled to 
Colombo, Jaffna, Mullaitivu and Killinochchi, and met with internally displaced persons.  
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the efforts made by the Government of Sri Lanka 
to rebuild the infrastructure destroyed during the conflict and the demining in return areas, 
and stressed that the post-conflict reconstruction process should also focus on addressing 
durable solutions for all internally displaced persons, both those who had been relocated by 
the Government and those who had returned to their areas of origin on a comprehensive 
basis. In the national context of transition from relief to development in the aftermath of 
conflict, it is essential that the Government and development actors engage in resolving the 
issue of displaced persons and address their durable solutions needs and livelihoods in 
development plans, the rule of law, human rights and good governance programmes. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the agreement to conduct a joint needs 
assessment, which will be vital for establishing agreed sets of statistical data on the number 
of internally displaced persons who have returned or been resettled. There is a need to 
complete this exercise expediently in order to establish how many people are still displaced, 
and also how many still do not have access to their original lands. The Special Rapporteur 
called for data, disaggregated by gender and age, on internal displacement, for adequate 
planning, as well as a survey of the intention of displaced persons with regard to durable 
solutions.  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur expressed concern at the significant number of people still 
living in protracted displacement, as well as at those who have returned or settled elsewhere 
in the North but still live in very precarious conditions and need more durable housing, 
access to social services, and livelihood opportunities. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Cooperation with regional and international organizations 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to report on his ongoing collaboration with 
regional and international organizations. He has engaged closely with, inter alia, regional 
organizations in Africa on the promotion, ratification and implementation at the national 
level of the Kampala Convention. To this end, the mandate holder continues to support the 
Government of Somalia on policy issues concerning internally displaced persons and the 
production of a revised draft of a national policy framework. Capacity-building activities 
were conducted with members of the Government. Benchmarks on security and land tenure 
were developed to support efforts to promote durable solutions for displaced persons, and 
&#8220;red lines&#8221; were identified in relation to proposed relocation processes, which must respect 
international standards. The Special Rapporteur provided support to the Government of 
Liberia in the ratification process of the Convention, which is being discussed in the national 
Parliament. Furthermore, in 2013, a series of training courses and workshops on the 
Kampala Convention were convened by the mandate holder with the African Union and 
other partners. An important development is also the recent adoption of the new national 
policy in Afghanistan on the rights of internally displaced persons, which followed the 
involvement of the Special Rapporteur at the request of the Government of Afghanistan in 
April 2012. 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur participated actively in a joint initiative of the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Office of the United Nations High </p>


<p>Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to elaborate a protection checklist to allow a more 
collaborative approach to addressing displacement and ensuring the protection of displaced 
populations and affected communities at all stages of conflict. This checklist was launched 
on 20 February 2014 in Vienna. The Special Rapporteur also collaborated with UNHCR on 
a Handbook for Parliamentarians on internal displacement2 published in October 2013. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur has maintained a strong partnership with civil society 
organizations (in Geneva, New York and in the field. In particular, he appreciates the 
support provided by the Brookings-LSE Project on Internal Displacement and the 
cooperation with the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre on various issues of mutual 
interest, as well as with the Joint IDP Profiling Service. In the field, civil society 
organizations have played a vital role in supporting the mandate holder by sharing 
information, articulating the human rights impact of internal displacement in different 
contexts and acting as a liaison with displaced communities, in particular during country 
visits.  
</p>
<p>19. From 12 to 14 March 2013, the Special Rapporteur addressed and participated in a 
workshop on climate change and planned relocation organized by UNHCR in San Remo, 
Italy. From 2 to 6 September 2013, he led the ninth annual course on the Law of Internal 
Displacement, held in Kampala and co-organized by the Brookings-LSE Project, the 
International Institute of Humanitarian Law, UNHCR and the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). A total of 24 government officials and 
parliamentarians working on internal displacement from 14 African countries took part in 
the course. The course provided an opportunity to share a valuable new tool on internal 
displacement, prepared with the support of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur to inform 
the development of laws and policies on internal displacement by government officials, 
parliamentarians and other stakeholders.3  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur also participated in numerous other events relating to the 
issue of internal displacement organized by civil society organizations and other actors, 
including a discussion organized by the Brookings Institution on &#8220;The Kampala Convention 
on Internal Displacement in Africa: A Human Rights Milestone&#8221;, held on 26 March 2013; a 
public event on the intersection of displacement and broader migration flows, hosted by the 
Brookings Institution on 7 May 2013; a discussion held at Ditchley Park on the protection of 
civilians, from 16 to 18 May 2013; the heads of agency meeting of the Policy Action Group 
on Emergency Response Heads of Agencies, held in Ottawa from 19 to 22 November 2013; 
and a Wilton Park conference on the theme &#8220;Addressing implementation gaps: improving 
cooperation between global and regional human rights mechanisms&#8221;, from 23 to 25 January 
</p><p>2014. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Mainstreaming the human rights of internally displaced persons in the 
United Nations system 
</b></p>
<p>21. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur continued to support the 
mainstreaming of the human rights of internally displaced persons within the United Nations 
system and the wider humanitarian community by participating actively in the work of the 
Inter-Agency Standing Committee. He participated in two principals meetings, held in

highlighted the relevance of the issue of internally displaced persons outside of camps with 
regard to the priorities of the Committee, and during which Committee members were 
requested to share relevant experiences with the Special Rapporteur in that regard. He also 
maintained close collaboration with key United Nations organizations, including OHCHR, 
UNHCR and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. He engaged in a 
constructive dialogue with the agencies on, inter alia, current challenges and responses to 
internal displacement and potential areas of cooperation, at both headquarters and field 
levels. He also held periodic briefings on thematic and country activities.  
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur participated in several activities organized by United 
Nations agencies, including the regular meetings and annual retreat of the Global Protection 
Cluster and activities for the promotion of the Kampala Convention. On 18 and 19 April 
2013, he participated in a round table on transitions and solutions organized by the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), UNHCR and the Government of the 
Netherlands, in Amsterdam, where international development and humanitarian actors met 
to review progress and identify ways forward in the response to internal displacement. On 6 
June 2013, he attended a thematic seminar of the Global Protection Cluster on 
&#8220;Transitioning from crisis to recovery: the role of protection clusters&#8221;. He participated in the 
annual meeting of Special Procedures in Vienna, held from 24 to 28 June 2013, where he 
was elected Chairperson of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures for one year. 
In this context, he participated in the international expert conference on the occasion of the 
twentieth anniversary of the World Conference on Human Rights, Vienna +20: Advancing 
the Protection of Human Rights: Achievements, Challenges and Perspectives 20 Years after 
the World Conference, held on 27 and 28 June 2013 and organized by the Federal Ministry 
for European and International Affairs of Austria, in cooperation with OHCHR, the Ludwig 
Boltzmann Institute for Human Rights and the European Training and Research Centre for 
Democracy and Human Rights of the University of Graz. He also participated in the high-
level event for the twentieth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
Action in New York, on 25 September 2013, where he advocated for the inclusion of 
internally displaced persons in the context of the post-2015 development agenda.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur organized various events in collaboration with partners and 
sponsors, including a panel discussion on the margins of the sixty-eighth session of the 
General Assembly on the theme &#8220;Durable solutions to displacement: development and 
peacebuilding dimensions&#8221;, held on 25 October 2013. The Special Rapporteur also 
convened a workshop on the theme, &#8220;Durable solutions for internally displaced persons: 
advancing the agenda&#8221;, in cooperation with OHCHR, UNHCR, UNDP and the Brookings-
LSE Project, on 7 June 2013. 
</p><p>24. At the invitation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the 
Special Rapporteur participated in a plenary session panel at the UNHCR 2013 protection 
dialogue on &#8220;Protecting the internally displaced: persisting challenges and fresh thinking&#8221;, 
held on 11 and 12 December 2013. He also co-chaired a working group in a dialogue on 
&#8220;Enacting legal instruments and policies to protect internally displaced persons: experiences 
and lessons&#8221;. During the dialogue, participants highlighted the need to fill implementation 
gaps in the protection of displaced persons, to put internal displacement higher on 
international, regional and national agendas, and to ensure the involvement of internally 
displaced persons and host communities in decisions affecting them. Calls were also made 
for better cooperation between humanitarian and development actors from the early stages 
of emergency situations, and for inclusion of the needs of internally displaced persons in the 
post-2015 development agenda.  </p>


<p><b> III. The Kampala Convention: a road map for action  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Introduction and overview 
</b></p>
<p>25. Africa is home to nearly one third of the more than 28.8 million persons internally 
displaced by conflict, generalized violence and human rights violations around the world.4 
Displacement in Africa and globally is also caused by natural disasters and the effects of 
climate change, as well as by development projects. Data on displacement caused by 
development projects have not been collected systematically.5 
</p>
<p>26. Although over the past five years, 81 per cent of global displacement by natural 
disasters has been in Asia, n 2012, the Africa region witnessed a record 8.2 million people 
newly displaced in 27 countries, more than four times in the figure of the previous four 
years.6 In some countries, displacement due to natural disasters further exacerbated the dire 
situation of people already displaced due to conflict. 
</p>
<p>27. On 6 December 2012, the African Union Convention for the Protection and 
Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (or Kampala Convention) came into 
force. Its adoption on 23 October 2009, in Kampala, was a milestone for internally displaced 
persons in Africa and throughout the world. As the world&#8217;s first legally binding regional 
instrument on internal displacement, the Convention represented the will and determination 
of African States to address the problem of internal displacement in a holistic fashion.  
</p>
<p>28. At the time of writing, 39 of 54 States Members of the African Union had signed the 
Kampala Convention, while 22 had ratified it.7 The Convention is an innovative agreement 
in that it provides guarantees against forced displacement and standards for the protection of 
and assistance for persons during displacement, as well as with regard to durable solutions. 
It also addresses the causes of displacement, which are not limited to situations of armed 
conflicts and human rights violations but also encompass situations of natural or human-
made disasters. Moreover, the Convention is unique in that, in its article 2(d), it provides for 
the obligations and responsibilities of States parties, while also specifying the roles and 
responsibilities of non-State armed groups, private companies, humanitarian agencies and 
civil society organizations, the international community, internally displaced persons and 
communities affected by displacement. 
</p>
<p>29. Since the adoption of the Kampala Convention, the African Union Commission has 
spearheaded the promotion, signing and ratification process for the Convention. Its plan of 
action for the implementation of the Convention has been adopted by the States Members of 
the African Union, which have thus demonstrated their commitment to the instrument by 
signing and ratifying it. While the Convention is a momentous step towards enhancing the 
human rights of internally displaced persons and provides for a solid framework for the 
effective protection and assistance of those affected by displacement, challenges remain.  
</p>
<p>30. At the sixteenth session of the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur 
presented the priority areas for his mandate, and shared his intention to promote actively the 
ratification by States of the Kampala Convention and to continue to assist in putting in place

<p>policies and legislative frameworks to ensure its implementation at the national level.8 The 
scope of the present report is therefore not limited to an analysis of the unique character of 
the Kampala Convention, but also sets out a proposed course of action to ensure that this 
innovative and comprehensive framework translates into concrete gains for internally 
displaced persons.  
</p>
<p><b> B. The Convention in context  
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>31. The adoption of the Kampala Convention in 2009 followed five years of 
consultations, drafting and negotiations by legal experts from States Members of the 
African Union. This African-led process emerged from the recognition and decision of the 
Executive Council of the African Union, in July 2004, that a separate and appropriate 
regional framework should be developed to protect and assist adequately internally 
displaced persons and to support durable solutions.9 
</p>
<p><b>  </b>32. The development of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement was an 
essential first step in establishing a normative framework on internal displacement, 
clarifying international minimum standards for protecting and assisting internally displaced 
persons. Regional and subregional intergovernmental organizations have increasingly 
acknowledged, relied on and adopted the Guiding Principles,10 while States have 
increasingly committed to adhering to the Guiding Principles and to incorporating them 
into their domestic legal frameworks.11 
</p>
<p>  33. In 2006, during the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, 11 States 
of the Great Lakes Region adopted a binding Pact on Security, Stability and Development 
in the Great Lakes Region,12 comprising 10 separate protocols, including the Protocol on 
the Protection and Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons and the Protocol on the 
Property Rights of Returning Persons. The Protocol on the Protection and Assistance to 
Internally Displaced Persons, which entered into force in June 2008, legally binds Member 
States to enact national legislation to domesticate the Guiding Principles fully and to 
provide a legal framework for their implementation within national legal systems, and to 
ensure the effective participation of internally displaced persons in developing such 
legislation.  
</p>
<p>  34. The above-mentioned Protocol on Protection and Assistance to Internally Displaced 
Persons served as impetus for the initiative by the African Union to draft the Kampala 
Convention, which further crystallized and advanced a regional approach to protecting the 
rights of displaced persons in efforts to achieve peace, security and development.13 
</p>
<p>35. The development and adoption of the Kampala Convention should also be seen 
against the backdrop of national efforts to develop laws and policies on internal 
displacement, in Africa and throughout the world. To date, 25 Governments, including six 
in Africa, have adopted a variety of national policies or legislation specifically addressing

<p>internal displacement. African States were among the first in the world to adopt national 
laws and policies based on the Guiding Principles. The six African States to have developed 
laws and policies on internally displaced persons are Angola (2000), Burundi (2001), Sierra 
Leone (2002), Uganda (2004), the Sudan (2009) and Kenya (2012), while Somalia and the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo are in currently developing relevant laws.  
</p>
<p>36. Even before Nigeria ratified the Kampala Convention in April 2012, the Nigerian 
authorities were taking steps to better coordinate their response to internal displacement. In 
2003, a committee was established to draft a national policy on internally displaced persons 
to define the role and responsibilities of State agencies and of civil society organizations. 
The draft policy was presented to the Government in 2011, and was subsequently revised 
and reviewed by multiple stakeholders. A policy on migration was also drafted in 2013, 
including provisions on internal displacement. Both policies are due to be presented to the 
Federal Executive Council for adoption in 2014.14 
</p>
<p><b> C. Scope of the Convention  
</b></p>
<p>37. The Kampala Convention directly incorporates the United Nations Guiding 
Principles on Internal Displacement,15 and proceeds from the premise of the primary 
responsibility of the State in addressing internal displacement. The Convention, however, 
goes beyond the Guiding Principles by articulating the need for a holistic response to 
internal displacement based on a combined framework of international human rights law 
and international humanitarian law. Such a framework provides a platform for all 
stakeholders &#8211; States but also all other groups and entities involved in or affected by internal 
displacement &#8211; to analyse the multiple causes of internal displacement and to identify 
appropriate responses to these phenomena, including durable solutions. In this regard, the 
Convention stresses that humanitarian and development actors both have an important role 
to play in a comprehensive response to problems related to internal displacement. Equally, 
the Convention stresses the need for the active participation of those affected by 
displacement, including vulnerable groups of displaced persons and host communities.

</b></p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(a)  Protection from involuntary or forced displacement 
</b></p>
<p> (i)<i> Arbitrary displacement 
</i>38. Article 3 of the Kampala Convention recognizes the general obligation of States to 
refrain from, prohibit and prevent arbitrary displacement of populations, as well as the 
obligation to prevent some of the underlying causes of internal displacement, such as 
political, social, cultural and economic exclusion and marginalization, as well as to respect 
and protect the human rights of internally displaced persons and to respect international 
humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>39. The Convention has made important advances in articulating the right to be 
protected from arbitrary displacement by elaborating a number of acts that may cause it. 
While international human rights law does not clearly spell out the right not to be arbitrarily 
displaced, some components of this right are to be found in the right to freedom of

<p>movement and residence, the right to privacy, the right to choose one&#8217;s own residence and 
the right to adequate housing.16 The prohibition of arbitrary displacement has also been 
addressed to an extent in international humanitarian law.17 Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention, relative to the protection of civilians in time of international armed conflict, 
prohibits &#8220;individual or mass forcible transfers&#8221; as a grave breach of international 
humanitarian law. This prohibition was later extended to non-international armed conflicts 
when the second additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions. State practice establishes 
these rules as norms of customary international humanitarian law applicable in both 
international and non-international armed conflicts.18 
</p>
<p>40. The Kampala Convention innovates by listing, non-exhaustively, a wide range of 
causes of arbitrary displacement, demonstrating that it is not only caused by conflicts. 
Indeed, in addition to armed conflict and situations of generalized violence or human rights 
violations, the Convention obliges States parties to protect all persons against policies of 
racial or other discrimination aimed at or resulting in altering the ethnic, religious or racial 
composition of the population; displacement due to harmful practices;19 and forced 
evacuations in situations of natural or man-made disasters or other scenarios where 
evacuation is not required by safety or health considerations of those affected. The warning 
against the use of &#8220;safety and health&#8221; reasons to justify displacement that is fundamentally 
arbitrarily is an important safeguard established by the Convention. Similarly, the 
Convention devotes the whole entire of article 10 to internal displacement caused by 
development projects carried out by public and private actors.  
</p><p>41. The clear objective here is to prohibit all forms of arbitrary displacement, in all 
circumstances, including forced evictions. In this regard, the article 4 of the Kampala 
Convention provides a &#8220;catchall&#8221; by articulating the obligation of States parties to prevent 
arbitrary displacement caused by an &#8220;act, event, factor or phenomenon of comparable 
gravity to all of the above&#8221; that is not justified under international law, including human 
rights and international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>42. While the Convention does not define arbitrary displacement as a criminal offence, 
article 4 (6) it requires States parties to declare as offences punishable by law the worst 
forms of arbitrary displacement, such as those amounting to genocide, war crimes or crimes 
against humanity.  
</p>
<p>(ii)<i>  Disasters and climate change 
</i>43. In 2012 alone, an estimated 7.7 million people were displaced in the wake of natural 
disasters in countries that have signed or ratified the Kampala Convention,20 which explains 
the special attention drawn to natural and man-made disasters in it. The Convention 
requires States parties to take measures specifically to prevent and mitigate the effects of 
disasters, including by establishing early warning systems and implementing disaster risk

<p>reduction strategies, emergency and disaster preparedness and management measures in 
areas at risk.  
</p>
<p>44. In this regard, the States Members of the African Union are implementing a regional 
disaster risk reduction strategy by means of an extended programme of action (2006-2015), 
which aims to contribute to the attainment of sustainable development and poverty 
eradication through a substantial reduction in the social, economic and environmental 
impact of disasters, including risks associated with climate change.21  
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(b) Protection and assistance, including during displacement</b> 45. Article 5 of the Kampala Convention clearly stipulates that States parties bear the 
primary duty to provide protection and assistance to internally displaced persons within their 
territory or jurisdiction.  
</p>
<p>(i)<i> Accountability 
</i>46. According to article 9 of the Convention, during displacement, States are required to 
protect the rights of internally displaced persons, regardless of the cause of their 
displacement, and to refrain from and prevent discrimination, including on the basis of 
displacement; genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other violations of 
international law committed against displaced persons; forms of cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment, including arbitrary killing, summary execution, 
arbitrary detention, abduction and enforced disappearance or torture; and sexual and gender-
based violence, including rape, harmful practices, the recruitment of children and their use 
in hostilities, forced labour, human trafficking, smuggling and starvation. States moreover 
have the obligation to guarantee the safety, security and dignity of internally displaced 
persons, to respect and ensure their freedom of movement and choice of residence, and to 
protect them against forcible return or resettlement to areas where their life, safety, liberty 
and/or health would be at risk. 
</p>
<p>47. In its article 4 (6), the Convention calls upon States to ensure the individual 
responsibility for acts of arbitrary displacement perpetrated by State officials,22 as well as by 
non-State entities, including multinational companies or private security organizations.23 In 
particular, article 7 (4) of the Convention provides that States must hold members of armed 
groups criminally responsible for human rights abuses and violations of international 
humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>(ii)<i> Vulnerable groups</i> 
48. Article 9 (2) of the Convention requires States to provide special protection and 
assistance to internally displaced persons with special needs, including separated and 
unaccompanied children, female heads of household, expectant mothers, mothers with 
young children, persons with disabilities and older persons, and to take measures for family 
tracing and reunification. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>(iii)<i> State obligations with regard to providing assistance  
</i>49. According to article 9 (2) of the Convention, States are required to provide internally 
displaced persons, to the fullest extent possible and with the least possible delay, with food, 
water, shelter, health services, sanitation, education and any other necessary social services. 
Given the important ways in which displacement can affect the resources and coping 
capacities of communities affected by displacement, including host and return

<p>communities, States are also required, where appropriate, to extend their assistance to local 
and host communities. Furthermore, States are to take measures to monitor and evaluate the 
effectiveness and impact of humanitarian assistance provided to internally displaced 
persons, in accordance with relevant standards of practice, including those of the Sphere 
Project. 
</p>
<p>(iv)<i> Registration and documentation 
</i>50. Other measures relevant to protection and assistance during displacement that the 
Convention requires States to take include, but are not limited to, support for registration 
and the provision or replacement of personal documentation (art. 13). The Convention 
stresses, however, that the failure to issue internally displaced persons with such documents 
should not in any way impair the exercise or enjoyment of their human rights. 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(c) Obligations relating to durable solutions and compensation  
</b>51. Article 11 of the Kampala Convention commits States to promoting and creating 
satisfactory conditions for durable solutions to displacement, including voluntary and 
sustainable return, local integration or relocation in safety and in dignity. The Convention, 
in its article 12, also addresses the right of those affected by displacement to effective 
remedies, including just and fair compensation and other forms of reparations.  
52. States are responsible for consulting internally displaced persons on their options for 
securing durable solutions to displacement to enable them to make a free and informed 
choice on return, local integration or relocation, and for ensuring their participation in 
sustainable solutions.  
</p>
<p>53. Article 11 (4) of the Convention also requires States to take measures for the 
resolution of property disputes and the recovery of property, including by establishing 
simplified property dispute resolution mechanisms for internally displaced persons; and 
restoring the lands of communities with a special dependency and attachment to such lands 
upon the return of communities and their reintegration (art. 11 (5)). States are further 
obliged by article 12 (2) to establish an effective legal framework to provide displaced 
persons, in accordance with international standards, with just and fair compensation and 
other forms of reparations for damage incurred as a result of displacement, in accordance 
with international standards. 
</p>
<p><i>The specific case of internally displaced pastoralists  
</i>54. Pastoralism in Africa is characterized by a high reliance on livestock as a source of 
economic and social well-being, and various types of strategic mobility to secure access to 
water and grazing resources in areas with a high degree of rainfall variability. Pastoralism is 
found in all regions of Africa, where, in some regions, it is the dominant livelihood. In 2010, 
pastoral areas were known to occupy some 40 per cent of African land mass.24 Contrary to 
assumptions and despite their tradition as nomads, pastoralists do suffer from arbitrary 
displacement. Displacement of pastoralists is closely linked to the loss of livestock and of 
access to markets.25 All causes of internal displacement identified in the Convention can be 
causes of forcible internal displacement for pastoralists.26

<p>55. Like the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement<b> </b>and the Protocol on the 
Protection and Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons, the Kampala Convention pays 
particular attention &#8211; in its article 4 (5) &#8211; to this widespread phenomenon, obliging States 
parties to endeavour to protect communities with special attachment to and dependency on 
land owing to their particular culture and spiritual values. Any projects with an impact on 
the right of pastoralists to use land have to be justified by compelling and overriding public 
interest. The threshold that public interest must reach is therefore higher owing to the 
ancestral and spiritual attachment that pastoralists have with the land.27  
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Obligations relating to humanitarian and other actors 
</b></p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(a)  Role of international and humanitarian organizations 
</b>56. The Kampala Convention makes clear that States have the primary responsibility for 
fulfilling the human rights of internally displaced persons. When available resources are 
inadequate, however, article 5 (6) of the Convention requires States parties to cooperate in 
seeking the assistance of international organizations and humanitarian agencies, civil society 
organizations and other relevant actors. In this regard, States parties should take the steps 
necessary to ensure effective and unimpeded access by humanitarian organizations and other 
entities that are in a better position to provide internally displaced persons with protection 
and assistance. This also applies to efforts to support durable solutions.  
</p>
<p>57. The Convention further elaborates on this issue in its article 6, which addresses the 
legal obligations for international organizations and humanitarian agencies. Article 6 
requires such entities to discharge their mission in conformity with international law and the 
laws of the countries in which they operate; to respect the rights of such persons in 
accordance with the law; and to perform their mission in full respect of the principles of 
humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. The Convention insists on several 
occasions on the principle of non-discrimination as a requirement for equal protection of and 
assistance for internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(b)  Obligations relating to the African Union 
</b>58. The Kampala Convention also calls for collaboration between States parties and the 
African Union. It specifically refers to the obligations of the African Union, which has the 
mandate, as enshrined in article 4 (h) of the African Union Constitutive Act, to intervene in 
respect of grave circumstances, namely, war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. 
In article 8, the Convention also identifies an important role for the African Union in 
supporting States parties to fulfil their obligations under the Convention.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3.  Non-State actors and members of armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>59. Another innovative element of the Kampala Convention is its recognition that non-
State actors and members of armed groups must be held accountable for their role in 
involuntary or forced internal displacement.28 Seeking to combat impunity, the Convention 
notably holds members of armed groups accountable for human rights violations against 
internally displaced persons, stipulating that members of armed groups are to be held 
criminally responsible for acts that violate the rights of displaced persons under 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>27
 IDMC, &#8220;The Kampala Convention, One year on&#8221; (see footnote 14), p. 27. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>28
 Non-State actors are defined as private actors who are not public officials of the State or whose acts  
</p>
<p>cannot be officially attributed to it. Armed groups are defined as dissident armed forces or   other 
organized armed groups that are distinct from the armed forces of the State. </p>


<p>international law and national law. Article 7 of the Convention lists a series of actions that 
armed groups are prohibited from carrying out, in accordance with international law. 
</p>
<p>60. According to article 5 (11), such emphasis on the obligations of non-State actors and 
members of armed groups does not take away the primary responsibility of States parties, 
which are required to take measures aimed at ensuring that armed groups act in conformity 
with their obligations under article 7.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Participation and consultation of internally displaced persons and host communities 
</b></p>
<p>61. Throughout the Convention, States parties are reminded of their obligation to 
consult internally displaced persons and allow them to participate in decisions relating to 
their protection and assistance (for example, art. 9 (2)), including in decisions relating to 
durable solutions. States must also take measures to ensure that displaced persons who are 
citizens of their country of habitual residence may enjoy their civil and political rights, 
particularly in relation to public participation, such as the right to vote and the right to run 
for public office. With regard to development projects, article 10 (2) requires States parties 
to ensure that the stakeholders concerned will explore feasible alternatives, with full 
information and consultation of persons likely to be displaced by projects. 
</p><p>62. Such protection also concerns, to a large extent, host communities. Indeed, host 
communities are significantly affected by internal displacement, given that a great majority 
of internally displaced persons tend not to live in camps but rather with the said 
communities and families.29 The Kampala Convention reflects this reality by requiring 
States to take appropriate measures to take into account the needs of host communities. This 
also implies their involvement and participation in assessments to ensure that their needs are 
taken into consideration for appropriate humanitarian and development responses. 
</p>
<p><b> 5.  Monitoring and compliance with objectives  
</b>63. To monitor the implementation of the Kampala Convention, States parties are 
required to establish a Conference of States Parties (art. 14). States parties are also required 
to cooperate upon the request of a concerned State party or the Conference of States Parties, 
which is to convene regularly under the facilitation of the African Union (art. 14.2),to 
protect and assist internally displaced persons (art. 5.2). To date, the Conference of States 
Parties has never convened despite the provision in article 14 (2). The Special Rapporteur 
has repeatedly expressed his wish for the Conference of States Parties to be established in 
the near future. 
</p>
<p>64. Two other mechanisms for reporting on compliance are outlined in the Kampala 
Convention. States must report on the measures they have taken to give effect to the 
Convention whenever they present their reports under article 62 of the African Charter on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (art. 14.4). States Members of the African Union that have 
joined the African Peer Review Mechanism (must also report on such measures when they 
present their reports under the Mechanism (art. 14.4).

<p><b> D.  Domestication and implementation  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Requirements for domestication and the scope of national instruments on internal 
displacement 
</b></p>
<p>65. An effective response to internal displacement almost always requires a solid 
enabling policy and legislative framework. Existing laws can hinder the ability of internally 
displaced persons to realize their rights or might not ensure that the specific assistance and 
protection needs of displaced persons are met.30 The Convention therefore provides, in its 
article 3 (2), for the incorporation of States&#8217; obligations under the Convention into domestic 
law by enacting or amending relevant legislation on the protection of and assistance to 
displaced persons in conformity with their obligations under international law. The same 
article requires States parties to take other measures, such as national and local policies and 
strategies on internally displaced persons, accounting also for the needs of host 
communities.  
</p>
<p>66. A comprehensive national instrument on internal displacement should mention 
relevant standards with regard to internal displacement, such as the Kampala Convention, 
the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and the Protocol on the Protection and 
Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons (for relevant States); adopt a holistic approach to 
displacement, from prevention to the achievement of durable solutions; and respond to all 
forms of displacement, irrespective of the causes. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Developing a national instrument on internal displacement  
</b></p>
<p>67. At present, six African countries have adopted or issued policies, laws or decrees 
relating specifically to internal displacement: Angola, Burundi, Kenya, Sierra Leone, the 
Sudan and Uganda. Other countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
Nigeria and Somalia, are currently in the process of developing, or have already announced, 
draft national policies or legislation, a process that the mandate holder has continuously 
followed and supported. It is interesting to note that those countries are not systematically 
the ones who are legally bound by the Convention. Indeed, of the above-mentioned States, 
only Angola, Sierra Leone and Uganda are concerned, and the laws and policies developed 
by those States were adopted before their ratification of the Convention.  
</p>
<p>68. While the said laws and policies are a positive development, the domestic 
frameworks that have been adopted to date vary in scope, the guarantees of protection and 
assistance to internally displaced persons, and the coverage of relevant issues. Not all the 
laws and policies include an appropriate definition of an internally displaced person31 or 
clearly identify institutional responsibilities, and some address only a particular cause or 
stage of displacement, such as conflict or return, while others focus only on particular rights.  
</p>
<p>69. Significant activities in support of the development of national internal displacement 
frameworks to which the mandate holder has contributed include the <i>Manual for Law and 
Policymakers</i>, which provides guidance to national authorities seeking to develop domestic 
legislation and policies addressing internal displacement.32 Other documents providing 
guidance for developing a national instrument on internal displacement include a manual on

<p> 
</p>
<p>30  Brookings-Bern Project on Internal Displacement, Protecting Internally Displaced Persons: A Manual 
for Law and Policymakers, October 2008, p. 27. 
</p>
<p> 31  According to the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and the Kampala Convention, the fact 
of being an internally displaced person does not imply any legal status. An appropriate definition of 
an internally displaced person should encompass all causes of displacement. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>32
  See footnote 30.  </p>


<p>the law or policy development process,33 which complements the substantive approach of 
the manual for law and policymakers, and the Handbook for Parliamentarians on internal 
displacement.34 These manuals distil years of lessons learned and good practices to assist 
law and policymakers in drafting laws and policies that address internal displacement or in 
amending existing laws and policies to encompass the rights of internally displaced persons. 
They are also useful tools for civil society and international organizations to consult.  
</p>
<p>70. A consultative national instrument development process encompasses several stages, 
including the initiation, preparation, organization, validation, adoption and implementation 
of the instrument.35 While each State party will have its own processes for developing 
national laws and policies on different issues, the consultative process described in the 
paragraphs below is recommended for the development of effective national instruments on 
internally displaced persons. Although Kenya is not a party to the Kampala Convention, its 
efforts to develop a national policy on internal displacement stands out as an example of a 
good practice and should be built upon to guide other countries in the African Union.  
</p>
<p><b>(a) Initiation 
</b>71. During the initiation process, relevant authorities commit to developing a national 
instrument on internal displacement, and then communicate the decision to relevant 
national, regional and international stakeholders, which have an important role to play in 
assisting in its development. In Kenya, the need for a comprehensive legislative response to 
internal displacement was identified in 2010, when the Parliament established the 
Parliamentary Select Committee on the Resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons in 
Kenya to examine Government action on displacement and the relevant laws governing the 
issue.36 
</p>
<p><b>(b)  Preparation 
</b>72. The preparation phase aims at, inter alia, defining key notions, gathering data on 
internal displacement, and deciding on the appropriate legal framework to address internal 
displacement and the support needed from relevant stakeholders. In the case of Kenya, in 
February 2011, a strategic planning workshop was convened by the Parliamentary Select 
Committee, where perspectives on the key concerns with regard to internal displacement 
were addressed by government ministries and the National Protection Working Group on 
Internal Displacement.37 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Organization 
</b>73. During the organization phase, a government body should be designated to lead the 
process. Experience shows that it is important that the Government lead have political clout, 
financial and human resources and knowledge of internal displacement issues. The Special

organizations. </p>


<p>Rapporteur reiterates the need to consult a wide range of national actors, including internally 
displaced persons and displacement-affected communities themselves. All the relevant tools 
for the development and drafting of the instrument should be identified &#8211; such as the above-
mentioned manuals, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Framework on Durable 
Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons38 and the Operational Guidelines on the 
Protection of Persons in Situations of Natural Disasters39 so that the lead Government entity 
can then organize the drafting and consultation process.  
</p>
<p><b>(d) Consultation and drafting 
</b>74. During the consultation and drafting stage, a bottom-up approach should be taken to 
ensure that the views and concerns of internally displaced persons are adequately reflected 
and addressed, as they are the ones who will be primarily affected by the national 
instrument. In Kenya, a number of workshops and bilateral meetings were held and attended 
by the Parliamentary Select Committee, representatives of government ministries, the 
Special Rapporteur and the staff supporting his mandate. The Truth, Justice and 
Reconciliation Commission was also consulted. The Parliamentary Select Committee 
carried out 26 public hearings and field visits around the country from March to October 
2011 to gain further insights into the plight of internally displaced persons in Kenya.40 
</p>
<p>75. The fifth stage in the process of developing a national instrument allows for 
amendments or changes to be made, and is useful for ensuring buy-in from relevant 
stakeholders and the effective implementation of the instrument. In Kenya, the initial draft 
legislation was reviewed in October 2011 during a workshop convened jointly by the 
National Protection Working Group on Internal Displacement and the Parliamentary Select 
Committee. The Working Group and the Committee established a taskforce with the aim of 
reviewing the draft legislation and ensuring consistency with the draft policy on internally 
displaced persons, the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and the Kampala 
Convention. A validation workshop was then held in December 2011 by the Working Group 
and the Committee to consider and approve the reviewed draft legislation.41 
</p>
<p>76. With regard to the adoption of the national instrument, in Kenya, the Parliamentary 
Select Committee tabled its final report before Parliament in February 2012, and the bill on 
internally displaced persons was tabled in April 2012. The bill underwent three readings 
before being passed by Parliament on 4 October 2012. The President assented to the bill on 
31 December 2012.42 
</p>
<p><b>(e) Implementation and monitoring  
</b>77. Finally, the implementation and monitoring phase is an essential and often ongoing 
one. As implementation will be achieved gradually, it can be helpful to prioritize 
implementation activities, ensuring that emergency needs are addressed while longer-term 
needs and concerns are not overlooked. Implementation may also require capacity-building 
at various levels of government. Dissemination and awareness-raising among government 
officials at all levels, as well as among internally displaced persons and other displacement-
affected communities, in relevant languages and through appropriate channels in order to 
ensure the most vulnerable populations are reached, are also critical steps to ensure effective

<p>implementation. It is also important that obstacles and gaps in implementation are promptly 
identified and addressed. Monitoring and evaluation should be carried out regularly by an 
entity with monitoring expertise and experience, and the national institutional focal point 
should convene to take stock of the implementation process. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Conclusions 
 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> The adoption of the Kampala Convention represents a significant advance in 
standard setting for the increased protection and assistance of internally displaced 
persons. While the Convention is related to internal displacement in Africa, the 
standards and guarantees it sets are international in character and can serve as good 
practices for other regions of the world. The commemoration in 2014 of the thirtieth 
anniversary of the Cartagena Declaration on Refugees could be a fruitful opportunity 
to consider how regional cooperation may be further expanded to enhance protection 
and assistance for internally displaced persons in regions such as the Americas, 
building on the experience acquired in the development and implementation of the 
Kampala Convention.  
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> Much work, however, remains to be done to translate this important 
instrument into practice and to secure concrete improvements in the protection of and 
assistance to internally displaced persons. The Kampala Convention is a practical and 
important tool that addresses internal displacement at the international, regional and 
national levels. Political will is essential to the effective implementation of the 
Convention, which requires that the necessary budgetary and structural supports be 
mobilized. Timely support from the international community, including donors, 
United Nations agencies and other stakeholders, is critical to ensure that this objective 
is met. Indeed, the Convention itself was framed on the basis of a partnership between 
the African Union, international organizations and civil society. 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> The Special Rapporteur considers that the bridge promoted in the Kampala 
Convention between humanitarian responses to displacement and the involvement of 
development actors is of fundamental importance. Indeed, it is increasingly 
recognized that displacement is not simply a humanitarian issue but one that also 
requires the sustained engagement of development actors. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> In addition to awareness-raising and advocacy for the ratification of the 
Kampala Convention, the Special Rapporteur calls for a common platform to ensure 
sharing the wealth of documents, guiding tools and best practices relating to the issue 
of internally displaced persons. The domestication process of the Kampala 
Convention is a crucial stage that needs additional focus and resources.  
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> The Special Rapporteur highlights the importance of adopting a human rights-
based approach to internal displacement, which would enable all stakeholders 
involved in internal displacement to work hand-in-hand through its different phases.  
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> The Special Rapporteur reiterates the importance of establishing accountability 
mechanisms and strengthening reconciliation processes to ensure that those alleged to 
have perpetrated human rights violations against internally displaced persons are 
brought to justice, and that the communities affected by conflict and internal 
displacement can move towards peace. Only if internally displaced persons are 
effectively protected and assisted, in accordance with the provisions set out in the </b></p>


<p><b>Kampala Convention, can durable solutions be achieved, for the benefit of both 
displaced persons and host communities.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. States 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that States effectively address internal 
displacement on their respective territories and ensure that the Kampala Convention 
is implemented at the national, regional and international levels. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. States Members of the African Union 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>States Members of the African Union should, in accordance with article 3 (2) of 
the Kampala Convention, ratify and implement the Convention. States of the 
International Conference on the Great lakes Region should also implement the Pact 
on Security, Stability and Development in the Great Lakes Region.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Given that the Kampala Convention was drafted and negotiated with a view to 
its implementation, States should continue to cooperate in joint efforts to, on the one 
hand, ratify the Convention, and domesticate it, on the other. In this regard, and with 
the support of the African Union, a working group should be established to support 
the domestication of the Convention at the national level and to formulate a plan of 
action for the region.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that States Members of the African 
Union: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Adopt comprehensive and detailed national instruments, institutional and 
legal frameworks to address internal displacement, in accordance with the 
Kampala Convention and informed as relevant by the AU Model Law; and 
establish a coordination mechanism under the relevant ministry, involving all 
stakeholders, including civil society organizations, for the development of 
national policy; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Develop strategies and take measures that contribute to the prevention of 
internal displacement and the promotion of durable solutions in a timely 
manner, including by building resilience and mitigating the negative impact 
of displacement on the human rights of internally displaced persons, 
recognizing that the measures shown to have a positive effect include 
contingency strategies, early warning systems and community intervention 
mechanisms, as well as mechanisms that strengthen the meaningful 
participation of displaced persons in decisions that have an impact on their 
lives; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Integrate displacement and durable solutions into national development 
plans; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Adopt disaster preparedness and disaster management laws, and ensure that 
existing laws on disaster preparedness are comprehensive in nature, so as 
they encompass disaster risk reduction and management; proactive strategies 
to prevent or minimize displacement; planned relocations, when appropriate; 
pre-emptive internal migration, when this is based on sound national policies 
and used as a coping mechanism in the case of slow-onset disasters; and 
durable solutions; </b></p>


<p><b>(e) Launch an advocacy campaign to raise awareness of the Kampala 
Convention and the need to implement it, and to build capacity, financial and 
political support and interest from all stakeholders, including donors, to 
ensure its implementation;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f)  Establish or strengthen the mechanisms promoting the engagement and 
participation of local authorities, communities, civil society organizations and 
the private sector in issues relating to internal displacement; community 
participation should involve those who are most vulnerable; in particular, 
potentially vulnerable groups, such as women, children, older persons and 
persons with disabilities, should be fully included in disaster prevention, 
response planning and implementation to ensure that their specific needs are 
addressed; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Increase the role of parliamentarians in strengthening efforts to ratify and 
implement the Convention in their oversight and representative role; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Strengthen the pivotal role of national human rights institutions to improve 
national responses to internal displacement, including in awareness-raising, 
monitoring of displacement situations and returns, investigating individual 
complaints, advocating for and advising Governments on the drafting of 
national policies to address internal displacement, and monitoring and 
reporting on the implementation of national policies and legislation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i)   Take the measures necessary to ensure accountability for violations of 
applicable international law, including by armed groups and non-State 
actors, as a cause of or during displacement;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(j)  Promote and facilitate the participation of internally displaced persons in 
political, reconciliation and peace processes that affect them, and establish the 
conditions necessary to enable them to have access to the durable solution of 
their choice and to rebuild their lives at the earliest opportunity, including the 
establishment of adequate conflict resolution mechanisms, including in 
relation to land disputes and civil status, for example birth registration, and 
property title registries, in accordance with the Kampala Convention; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Ensure that the budgetary and structural support necessary is mobilized to 
implement the above recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. The international community, the African Union, United Nations agencies, other 
humanitarian and development actors, and civil society organizations 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> All relevant actors should continue to promote and strengthen the work of 
regional organizations and mechanisms on all aspects of internal displacement, 
including with regard to the development and implementation of regional instruments 
and guidance on internal displacement, in accordance with international standards.  
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> United Nations agencies should continue their efforts to keep the issue of 
internal displacement firmly on the United Nations agenda; in particular, the 
strengthened framework for the protection of and assistance to internally displaced 
persons laid out by the Kampala Convention should inform international and regional 
responses to relevant crises in Africa, including through the Security Council. 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> The international community, including United Nations agencies, should ensure 
that the issue of internal displacement is addressed in the post-2015 development 
agenda. </b></p>


<p>91. <b>In order to ensure satisfactory monitoring of State compliance with the 
Kampala Convention, the African Union should consider establishing the Conference 
of States Parties, in accordance with article 14 of the Convention. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Civil society organizations and other relevant actors should continue their work 
of awareness-raising and dissemination of the Kampala Convention, and their work to 
promote the ratification of the instrument across Africa, including through training 
activities. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Relevant actors should increase international support in order to strengthen 
local and national capacities and legal frameworks and policies to address 
displacement by means of specific programmes, including the transfer of know-how, 
secondment of expert staff and provision of technical support. In particular, all 
relevant actors should consider the opportunity of adopting a subregional approach 
(for example, with the Economic Community of West African States, whose approach 
is quite specific), as well as the importance of cooperating with United Nations 
agencies in relation to their respective expertise. At the same time, the capacity of the 
African Union and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region should be 
strengthened to provide technical support to countries seeking to establish 
mechanisms for the protection of internally displaced persons that respond to 
country-specific issues and contexts.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Development actors should be involved in and support the drafting of national 
policies on internal displacement, and build capacity in terms of knowledge, human 
resources and infrastructure. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The international community, humanitarian agencies, donors, development 
actors and civil society organizations should enhance the capacity of internally 
displaced persons to advocate for their rights, and ensure that alleged perpetrators 
are brought to justice.  
</b>96. <b>Development actors should implement projects that specifically protect the 
human rights of internally displaced persons. Such projects should address in 
particular the availability and accessibility of basic services, the restoration of 
livelihoods, and housing and the protection of land and property rights, in full 
consultation with displaced persons, and affected communities where relevant. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>All relevant stakeholders should monitor, support and build capacity to 
address climate change-related internal displacement, including displacement due to 
both sudden and slow-onset natural hazards. In this regard, relevant international 
and national actors should, inter alia, increase awareness and understanding of 
displacement caused by slow-onset natural disasters; develop concrete strategies and 
measures to follow up on relevant provisions of the Cancun Agreement; and promote 
a human rights-based approach in all actions and strategies to address displacement 
related to natural disasters and climate change. Relevant actors should support 
Member States in developing adaptation measures that are comprehensive and 
include disaster risk reduction and prevention, and the minimization of internal 
displacement, as well as durable solutions. Relevant actors should also promote 
mechanisms for the engagement of affected communities, and develop guidance for 
States on how to ensure that displacement is taken into account in the climate change 
debate, on available normative standards and on the human rights implications of 
that type of displacement. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>All relevant stakeholders should continue to identify and address the various 
causes of internal displacement, emerging issues and areas that need to be 
strengthened through improved understanding, methodologies, approaches and 
responses. Such areas include, inter alia, the impact of global megatrends on internal </b></p>


<p><b>displacement; responses to internally displaced persons outside of camps; frameworks 
and approaches to better promote the meaningful participation and empowerment of 
internally displaced women; strategies to revive practical and political action in 
protracted displacement situations; and bridging the humanitarian/development gap 
by analysing and addressing the structural, institutional and operational factors that 
sustain it and impede early recovery and durable solutions. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The international community should, through increased awareness-raising and 
capacity-building, support civil society organizations and national human rights 
institutions in integrating the human rights of internally displaced persons into their 
national work plans.
