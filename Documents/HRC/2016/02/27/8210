<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health, Anand Grover, visited Ghana from 23 to 
30 May 2011. During the mission, he held meetings with Government representatives, civil 
society organizations, health professionals, academics and representatives of local 
communities in Accra, Tamale and Kumasi. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur commends Ghana on its clear commitment to realizing the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health of its citizens. However, a number 
of serious issues exist that need to be addressed in order to fully realize the right to health. 
Furthermore, Ghana&#8217;s recent transition from a low-income to a lower middle-income 
country is likely to present a number of funding issues, potentially threatening the nation&#8217;s 
progress in regard to the right to health. 
</p>
<p>Sections I and II of the report deal with issues regarding Ghana&#8217;s development 
background and legal obligations. In section III, the Special Rapporteur examines the effect 
of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) on the right to health in Ghana. While the 
development of the NHIS is a commendable step toward ensuring access to quality 
healthcare for all, serious concerns exist regarding membership and coverage, the exclusion 
of some important goods and services, and the long-term sustainability of the NHIS.

<p>Section IV focuses on the extreme under-resourcing of the mental health sector in Ghana. 
The country faces several barriers to providing quality mental health care to its citizens, 
including deficiencies in mental health care facilities, shortages in mental health 
practitioners as well as language and physical accessibility barriers. Issues regarding 
women&#8217;s health are examined in section V. Ghana has declared maternal mortality to be a 
&#8220;national emergency&#8221;. While the Government has taken several measures to effect change 
in this area, including free enrolment in the NHIS for pregnant women, more must be done. 
In section VI, the Special Rapporteur commends Ghana on its efforts to reduce the spread 
of malaria, however, further progress can be made in this area by addressing the underlying 
determinants of health that contribute to the spread of this disease. Section VII deals with 
issues relating to environmental and occupational health. There are significant issues 
regarding occupational health and safety in Ghana, particularly in the mining sector, which 
the Government should urgently address.

<p>The final section contains conclusions and recommendations on the right to mental 
and physical health in Ghana.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur visited Ghana at the invitation of the Government from 23 
to 30 May 2011. The purpose of the mission was to ascertain, in a spirit of dialogue and 
cooperation, how the country has endeavoured to implement the right to health, as well as 
the measures taken for its successful realization and the obstacles encountered both at the 
national and international levels. 
</p>
<p>2. The mission focused on the health system in Ghana, including the National Health 
Insurance Scheme; mental health; maternal health, including maternal mortality; 
occupational and environmental health, including malaria. During the mission, the Special 
Rapporteur met with Government representatives, civil society organizations, health 
professionals, academics and representatives of local communities in Accra, Tamale and 
Kumasi. 
</p>
<p>3. Throughout the mission, Government officials and other relevant actors were open 
and constructive. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank all those who gave their time 
and extended cooperation to him. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Ghana and the right to health  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>4. Ghana became the first country in Sub-Saharan Africa to gain independence from 
colonial rule in 1957. Between 1957 and 1981, Ghana experienced a period of political 
uncertainty. However, the country has since become a unitary republic with a multiparty 
democratic system, which vests executive power in the president. Despite this seemingly 
tumultuous recent political history, Ghana&#8217;s independence and transitions between 
</p>
<p>governments were largely peaceful. As a result, the country now enjoys a degree of 
political and economic stability. 
</p>
<p>5. While colonial rule and political uncertainty may have delayed Ghana&#8217;s economic 
development, the country&#8217;s gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at a robust 5.5 per 
</p>
<p>cent per year since 2004. This economic growth has undoubtedly contributed to a 
significant decrease in poverty levels within Ghana, from 52 per cent in 1992 to 29 per cent 
in 2006.1 Moreover, in July 2011, as a result of this sustained economic growth, Ghana 
transitioned from a low-income to a lower middle-income country.2 
</p>
<p>6. While keeping in mind Ghana&#8217;s admirable economic growth and reduction in 
poverty, as at 2010, it ranked 130 out of 169 countries in the Human Development Index.3 
Though many health indicators in the country are still lagging, total expenditure on health 
in Ghana in 2009 was 8.1 per cent of the country&#8217;s GDP.4 This level of expenditure

<p>demonstrates the Government&#8217;s commitment to improving the health and lives of its 
population. The Special Rapporteur also commends Ghana on the great strides it has made 
towards meeting Millennium Development Goal 4 of reducing child mortality. 
Unfortunately, similar gains have not yet been realized with respect to Goal 5 to improve 
maternal health. While maternal deaths are declining, a drastic reduction in deaths over the 
next few years is needed in order for Ghana to meet its target by 2015.5 
</p>
<p>7. The challenge for Ghana, like other countries transitioning into middle-income 
status, is to manage its new resources appropriately, particularly with respect to health 
expenditure. Although an increase in income may immediately translate into better 
population health outcomes, these gains will only be sustained with good strategic planning 
based on the right to health approach. Ghana&#8217;s transition from a least developed country to 
</p>
<p>a lower middle-income country status may limit the funding it is eligible to receive from the 
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), the World Bank, and 
other international donors. The resulting shortfalls in funding will likely result in a lack of 
availability of affordable health goods and services. In order to ensure full realization of the 
right to health, the Government will need to increase health spending to make up for 
anticipated deficits, particularly when these shortfalls will substantially affect the most 
vulnerable populations.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. Ghana has ratified several international treaties recognizing the right to health. 
These include the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Ghana has 
signed but not ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>9. Ghana is also a party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights. The 
right to the best attainable standard of physical and mental health is recognized in Article 
16 of the African Charter, which requires States to take &#8220;necessary measures to protect the 
health of their people and to ensure that they receive medical attention when they are sick&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>10. The Constitution, adopted in 1992, establishes several health-related rights including 
care for mothers after childbirth, care of children and protection of the rights of the disabled 
and sick. However, there is no explicit provision concerning the right to health in the 
Constitution. Articles 24(1) concerning right to work under satisfactory, safe and healthy 
conditions; 27(1) concerning special care accorded to mothers during a reasonable period 
before and after childbirth; 28(2) concerning protecting children from unhealthy work; 
28(4) concerning non-discrimination against children with respect to health care; 29(4) 
concerning the treatment of disabled persons; 36(10) concerning health and system 
standards in employment; 37(2)(b) concerning the ensuring all basic human rights for 
vulnerable groups; 39(2) concerning the abolishment of traditional practices injurious to 
health; and 190(1) concerning the public health services of Ghana all provide for various 
health-related protections.

</p>
<p><b> III. Health system 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government on its clear commitment to 
provide health care to all and its willingness to explore equitable methods to do so. This is 
especially important in Ghana, as in many other developing economies, in light of the fact 
that it remains an economically unequal society.6 From independence to 1985, the 
Government provided free health care through a tax-based health financing system. 
However, economic crises in the 1970s and 1980s led to sizeable revenue shortages and 
resulted in the introduction of a &#8220;cash and carry&#8221; scheme, which imposed user fees in 
1985.7 The introduction of this system of payment significantly reduced health service 
utilization by creating sizeable financial barriers to access, especially for the poor.8 The 
Government recognized this problem and attempted to create user fee exemptions for 
vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, older persons, children, the poor and 
others. However, in practice, the exemption system was not successful in providing access 
to health care for exempted groups, for a variety of reasons.9 
</p>
<p>12. As an alternative to this system of health-care provision, in the 1990s, various 
insurance schemes such as Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI) and Ministry of 
Health insurance schemes were trialled. While there was significant growth in the number 
of CBHI schemes, they were again unable to provide health-care funding for more than a 
small minority of Ghanaians.10 
</p>
<p>13. The right to health obliges States to ensure that health systems are designed to 
ensure sufficient availability, accessibility, and quality of health goods and services in a 
non-discriminatory manner. In that respect, the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) 
was developed in 2004 to expand and improve access to health goods and services across 
the country. It has to been noted that the effectiveness and equity of the scheme has recently 
been questioned and should be critically examined in order to make the necessary 
improvements. 
</p>
<p>14. The NHIS is administered through District Mutual Health Insurance Schemes 
(DMHIS) and provides for both private commercial health insurance and private mutual 
health insurance. Official government figures suggest that scheme membership was as high 
as 59.5 per cent of the population in June 2010,11 while critical reports indicate that 
membership stands at just 18 per cent.12 While there is disagreement over the actual 
percentage of coverage offered by the NHIS, Government officials indicated to the Special 
Rapporteur that the true number was likely somewhere between the two figures presented

<p>above. Coverage within this range falls far below that which is required to ensure the full 
realization of the right to health. The Government should do much more to expand 
coverage, especially to those areas in which physical infrastructure is lacking. Further, it is 
regrettable that reliable data regarding insurance coverage is not accessible. Better data 
collection, including additional disaggregation, is necessary to assess the effectiveness of 
the scheme.  
</p>
<p>15. Aside from concerns about coverage, certain other aspects of the insurance scheme 
may be lacking or in need of refinement to ensure accessibility for the poor and 
marginalized groups. Although, as of 2009, approximately 45 per cent of Ghanaians were 
insurance cardholders13, a number of problems related to cardholding and registration 
remain. The initial NHIS registration process itself can take up to six months, and a fee 
must be paid for the mandatory annual re-registration. Such fees create a barrier to access, 
in particular since the most vulnerable populations will not be able to afford them, 
especially if there is a registration fee at the outset. While provisions have been made for 
temporary cards, it is unclear how many Ghanaians receive or utilize such cards. A valid 
registration card is necessary to access all non-emergency health care; lack of a card or an 
expired card will most likely lead to denial of service. Again, without better data collection, 
it is difficult to further analyse the effectiveness of the registration system.  
</p>
<p>16. There have been reports of discrimination within the system against insured persons, 
which has an obvious impact on accessibility of health-care services. Some of the 
discrimination is due in part to delays in provider reimbursement, which creates an 
incentive for providers to treat uninsured persons who can pay immediately out-of-pocket, 
as opposed to treating insured persons for whom payment will not be immediate. In 
addition to restrictions on the accessibility of health goods and services, the Special 
Rapporteur was also informed that in many cases services provided were of inferior quality. 
Patients with insurance faced discrimination with regard to service, including long waiting 
lists, and were more likely to be seen by a physician&#8217;s assistant, nurse or other health-care 
professional less qualified than a doctor.  
</p>
<p>17. Though many important goods and services are included under the NHIS, it is of 
great concern to the Special Rapporteur that some vital goods and services are excluded 
from the scheme. For example, HIV anti-retroviral treatment (ART), cancer treatment 
(other than for breast and cervical cancers), rehabilitation other than physiotherapy, organ 
transplants, cardiovascular and neurological surgery (except such surgery resulting from 
accidents), echocardiography, angiography, appliances (such as optical and auditory aids) 
and orthopaedics, are among the essential goods and services that do not fall within the 
scheme.14 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the provision of immunoglobulin to 
newborn infants to prevent transmission of hepatitis B from infected mothers was not 
covered under the insurance scheme, even though a one-off payment of around 500 USD 
for treatment would prevent transmission in nearly 100 per cent of cases, and thereby save 
significant costs associated with lifetime management of the illness. The Special 
Rapporteur was also informed that family-planning services (except counselling) and 
contraceptives were not included in the scheme. Given their importance in controlling the 
fertility rate and reducing maternal mortality rates, and equally importantly, enabling 
women to make choices concerning their sexual and reproductive health, a wide range of

</p>
<p>contraceptives and family-planning services should be included in the insurance scheme 
free of cost, as a matter of priority. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
reconsider all of the exclusions and ensure that they are included in the NHIS. 
</p>
<p>19. Broader concerns about the overall sustainability of the scheme relate to its ability to 
generate adequate revenue to make up for outlays.15 Value-added tax (VAT) is currently the 
primary revenue source for NHIS and in 2008, accounted for 69.5 per cent of revenues.16 
The remainder of revenues come from premiums and other payments made by users of the 
system and some international funds. Government reports suggest that at the current level 
of VAT and premium collection, the scheme will not be sustainable. Ghana&#8217;s transition to a 
lower middle-income country will further impact on its eligibility to receive funding from 
some sources, such as the GFATM, that it currently relies on for critical areas, including 
HIV/AIDS treatment. During the mission, Government officials reported that they would be 
experiencing reductions in international assistance, similar to other countries undergoing 
such an economic transition. However, there was no indication by the Government as to 
how it would tackle these sustainability issues in the medium or long term. 
</p>
<p><b>  HIV/AIDS under NHIS 
</b></p>
<p>20. HIV prevalence in Ghana is among the lowest in West Africa at 1.9 per cent of the 
population aged 14 to 49.17 While the epidemic remains generalized, seroprevalence has 
dropped over the past five years. Nonetheless, recent gains cannot be taken for granted, 
especially in light of the potential funding obstacles described above, many of which 
particularly affect HIV. 
</p>
<p>21. Although knowledge of HIV/AIDS in Ghana is high, this broad awareness has not 
translated into knowledge of HIV/AIDS prevention. While 98 per cent of women and 99 
per cent of men have heard of HIV/AIDS, only 25 per cent of women and 33 per cent of 
men possess comprehensive knowledge of prevention strategies.18 This awareness has more 
importantly failed to reduce the still potent stigma directed against people living with HIV 
(PLHIV). This stigmatization is reinforced through criminalization of the conduct of some 
of the most at risk populations, namely female sex workers and men who have sex with 
men. Criminalization of the conduct of these groups is a serious concern in light of 
discrimination experienced by men who have sex with men.19 The impact of 
criminalization, aside from the generation of stigma, includes reduced access to goods and 
services for PLHIV who are afraid to seek out such services for fear of sanction.20 As a 
result, HIV prevalence rates among female sex workers (25.1 per cent) and men who have 
sex with men (25 per cent) remain far and unacceptably higher than in the general 
population.  
</p>
<p>22. The realization of the right to health requires that greater efforts be made to ensure 
adequate access to ART for PLHIV. As mentioned earlier, anti-retroviral drugs are

<p>currently excluded from the NHIS.21 Even with treatment subsidies provided by GFATM, 
users must pay five Ghanaian cedis a month to access ART &#8211; a significant amount of 
money for the poor and most-at-risk. Such fees prevent affected individuals from receiving 
treatment and therefore constitute financial or economic obstacles to accessing goods and 
services. Furthermore, these financial barriers may result in interruptions to otherwise rigid 
treatment cycles, even for people who can afford the fees. Interruptions to ART may in turn 
promote resistance to first-line medicines, which would necessitate the use of more 
expensive second- or third-line drugs in order to continue treatment, thereby further 
burdening the finances of the health system. 
</p>
<p>23. The sustainability of health financing may be further negatively affected by 
reductions in funding and support from international donors such as GFATM, which have 
begun to reduce assistance to Ghana in light of the country&#8217;s recent economic growth. If the 
</p>
<p>cost of treatment programmes such as ART rises, and international funding diminishes, 
severe funding shortfalls and drops in coverage are bound to result. While this raises 
concerns from a right to health standpoint, it is also a matter of great concern for the NHIS; 
the scheme is already operating at a loss and would have to make up for the increases in 
HIV-related expenditure stemming from more expensive treatment regimes and reductions 
in international assistance.   
</p>
<p><b> IV. Mental health 
</b></p>
<p>24. Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
recognizes that enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of mental health, alongside 
physical health, is central to the realization of the right to health. This, in turn, requires the 
creation of conditions assuring equal and timely access to appropriate mental health 
treatment and care.22 Although the provision of mental health care in Ghana is among the 
best in the region, its scale of implementation remains substantially inadequate to address 
the population&#8217;s burden of mental illness. And even where these services are available, the 
quality of service is often poor, due in part to a de-prioritization of mental health concerns 
within the overall health system.  
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur was concerned to learn of the many issues regarding the 
provision of mental health-care services in Ghana. The major issues leading to deficiencies 
in the treatment of those with mental illness include grossly inadequate physical and human 
resources for service provision; lack of institutions that provide training for aspiring 
psychiatrists; high levels of stigma concerning both mental health-care workers and 
patients; and lack of a comprehensive legislative framework to address mental health care. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur was informed that mental health facilities in Ghana are 
understaffed and ill-equipped, both in terms of physical outfitting and financial resources to 
cope with their patient load. This was confirmed by observations in a facility, where a 
number of inmates had to sleep side by side on the floor in a room without toilet facilities &#8211; 
in some instances, up to 70 or 80 people &#8211; because dormitory accommodation had already 
been utilized to capacity. However, it is encouraging that steps have been taken to reduce 
overcrowding in these facilities by relocating eligible patients to the community. The 
Special Rapporteur was informed that over 980 people were re-sited from Accra alone, 
many of whom have been able to return to work. These efforts to provide mental health 
care in the community setting accord with the principles for the protection of persons with

<p>mental illness and the improvement of mental health care, which require that patients be 
treated in the least restrictive environment possible.23 However, there is a lack of support 
within communities for individuals suffering from mental illness, both in terms of 
community-based treatment and integration into society and the labour force. 
</p>
<p>27. In addition to such deficits, there are concerns in respect of recruitment and retention 
of health professionals within the mental health sector. There is currently only one 
psychiatrist for every two million people in Ghana, and it is estimated that 98 per cent of 
people who require psychiatric treatment do not receive mental health care.24 Significant 
stigma exists around psychiatric-related health-care work; professional roles in this area are 
viewed as undesirable and work is not adequately remunerated. These problems are 
compounded by the sizeable migration of key health-care personnel from Ghana. The 
country lacks resources to retain these health-care professionals. However, the Government 
has made efforts to remedy this situation.25 The mental health-care sector is not immune to 
the heavy losses of personnel suffered due to the &#8220;brain drain&#8221;; it is estimated that the 
psychiatrist/population ratio would be between two to eight times higher in Ghana had it 
not been for emigration.26 Considering these ratios, it is especially important that the 
Government create incentive structures and infrastructure that not only de-stigmatize and 
promote mental health work in Ghana, but also retain health-care professionals. Although 
the Special Rapporteur recognizes the obstacles the Government faces in improving mental 
health care, the current situation is unacceptable. While resource constraints may limit 
absolute coverage, existing deficits in coverage fall even below the minimum accessibility 
and availability requirements of the right to health. 
</p>
<p>28. There are also other challenges to providing quality mental health-care services. It is 
estimated that there are over 40 languages spoken throughout the country, and significantly 
more local dialects, presenting significant obstacles to access, especially for the rural poor 
and ethnic minorities. With respect to mental health, such barriers are particularly harmful 
because the patient&#8217;s ability to communicate symptoms is critical to the diagnosis of mental 
</p>
<p>illness. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure the availability of staff 
conversant in local languages and dialects or interpreters at all facilities. 
</p>
<p>29. Stigma surrounding mental illness often leads to the ill-treatment of persons who 
have mental illnesses, particularly in non-urban areas, and thus presents a significant barrier 
to families and communities seeking appropriate care for affected individuals, in addition to 
the physical and linguistic obstacles that those in more remote areas of the country already 
face. Although some outreach services are provided by NGOs in certain districts,27 
additional measures are urgently needed to ensure availability of adequate treatments in 
these regions. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to develop awareness 
building programmes with respect to mental illness and engage in other activities to reduce 
stigma and discrimination surrounding mental health. Moreover, the right to health requires 
that the Government of Ghana create the necessary infrastructure to ensure the availability 
of mental health services in areas outside of Accra and Kumasi, where services are 
currently severely lacking.

<p>30. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the introduction and use of newer medications 
with improved efficacy and side-effect profiles. However, the current supply of medications 
&#8211; both older and newer generation treatments &#8211; remains insufficient throughout the country. 
The Special Rapporteur was also informed that stock-outs occur regularly, and that 
medications are still unaffordable for many people. 
</p>
<p>31. More steps need to be taken by the Government in order to achieve realization of the 
right to health for persons suffering from mental illness. While efforts made to fulfil the 
obligation to respect the right to health, such as decreasing institutionalization, are 
encouraging, these efforts are currently very limited in comparison to the magnitude of the 
problem. At the moment, mental health care in Ghana is clearly inadequate, which is in 
large part due to the lack of resources, both financial and human, devoted to mental health. 
The State&#8217;s obligation to fulfil the right to health requires that a comprehensive legislative 
and policy framework be put in place to address the problem. 
</p>
<p><b>  Mental health bill 
</b></p>
<p>32. In June 2006, a bill on mental health was finalized after a lengthy consultation 
process, with the intention of overhauling the provision of mental health-care services in 
Ghana and providing much-needed resources to the sector. The Mental Health Bill 2006 was designed to decentralize psychiatric care throughout the country &#8211; which currently 
remains concentrated in the south, particularly in Accra &#8211; and introduce comprehensive 
care at the community level. It emphasizes the need for more resources and autonomy in 
the sector, alongside clearly enforceable rules with respect to service provision, particularly 
monitoring of human rights in mental health facilities, with which the Government will be 
required to comply. Inclusion of these accountability measures, alongside the special 
attention given to vulnerable groups in the draft law, is very encouraging and consistent 
with a right to health approach.28  
</p>
<p>33. This progressive draft law, when passed and implemented, could potentially serve as 
a model to other countries in the region that are looking to review their own mental health 
laws. However, although the bill is now over five years old, it has still not been adopted by 
Parliament. The Special Rapporteur was informed of the many reasons for this delay, the 
majority relating to political or logistical issues, and in particular, a reticence to 
unnecessarily establish a &#8220;parallel&#8221; mental health-care system that would operate besides 
the existing health-care system. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the lack 
of political will to reform the mental health-care system and urges the Government to take 
immediate action to rectify this situation in light of the major deficits. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur believes that all of the aforesaid evidences a failure on the 
part of the Government to take adequate steps to respect, protect and fulfil the right to 
health of persons living with mental health illnesses. The Government must urgently 
remedy this dire situation in accordance with the right to health.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Maternal health 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Women: Millennium Development Goal 5 
</b></p>
<p>35. Ghana has made remarkable progress towards achieving Millennium Development 
Goal  4 of reducing child mortality. The Ghana Demographic and Health Survey recorded 
that the infant and under-five mortality rate declined from 64 per 1,000 live births in 1999-
</p>
<p>  
 28 WHO, Mental Health, <i>Ghana Country Summary: A very progressive mental health law </i>(Geneva, 
</p>

</b></p>

</p>
<p>2003 to 50 per 1,000 live births in 2004-2008.29 Furthermore, measles-related deaths have 
been completely eliminated as a result of a comprehensive immunization campaign.  
</p>
<p>36. However, more remains to be done to achieve Millennium Development Goal 5 to 
improve maternal health. The Ghana Maternal Mortality Survey of 2008 showed a decline 
in maternal deaths, from 503 per 100,000 live births in 2005 to 451 per 100,000 in 2008. 
However, even with this decline, unless maternal deaths are drastically reduced, it is 
unlikely that Ghana will meet the target of 185 per 100,000 by 2015.30 In 2008, the Minister 
of Health declared the maternal mortality rate a &#8220;national emergency&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for providing free maternal 
health services for all pregnant women under the NHIS, thereby making antenatal services 
from skilled birth attendants more affordable. From 2000-2010, 90 per cent of pregnant 
women in Ghana visited an antenatal care provider once, and 78 per cent visited an 
antenatal care provider at least four times,31 meeting the World Health Organization&#8217;s 
standard for recommended visits during a pregnancy. While this progress is notable, the use 
of these services remains heavily limited by socio-economic factors such as women&#8217;s 
education levels, wealth and geographic accessibility.32 Approximately 70 per cent of all 
medical professionals are based in Accra and Kumasi, making rural accessibility critical.33 
Women in rural and remote areas, particularly those living in poverty, often cannot access 
these services due to indirect costs such as transport and accommodation. Increases in 
accessibility require support for both indirect costs and greater availability of rural health-
care centres and providers.  
</p>
<p>38. While not strictly related to women&#8217;s obstetric care, additional illnesses or diseases &#8211; 
comorbidities &#8211; may require treatment to ensure the health of pregnant women. However, 
treatment of comorbidities is not currently part of the maternal health benefits package. 
Women are therefore required to make additional payments in order to receive treatment for 
these illnesses. Such additional payments may bar pregnant women from treatment or 
discourage them from seeking otherwise subsidized maternal health services, which may 
result in significant negative health outcomes. For example, gestational diabetes, a common 
comorbidity during pregnancy,34 may result in a number of negative health outcomes for 
the mother, such as problems with delivery associated with foetal overgrowth; increased 
need for Caesarian delivery; hypertensive disorders, including pre-eclampsia; and an 
increased risk of developing type-2 diabetes later.35 Furthermore, the child may be at an 
increased risk of developing type-2 diabetes and obesity.36 Failing to adequately treat 
comorbidities has the potential to complicate both intra-partum and post-partum care. In

</b></p>
<p>some cases, comorbidities, such as hypertension, result directly in maternal mortality.37 The 
exclusion of comorbidities from subsidized maternal care presents a substantial financial 
barrier to critical maternal health care. Access to treatment of comorbidities is vital to 
ensuring the realization of the right to health and the achievement of Millennium 
Development Goal 5.  
</p>
<p>39. Furthermore, the role of traditional birth attendants needs to be clarified and 
emphasis placed on support and referral of mothers to safe facilities. Although traditional 
birth attendants are essential for point-of-care service delivery, in many cases they are not 
best suited to emergency maternal care or situations in which complications arise. In such 
situations, appropriate and timely treatment is necessary to prevent both maternal and foetal 
mortality and morbidity. A network of correctly assigned responsibilities between 
traditional birth attendants, emergency health-care workers and other service providers 
must be developed in order to properly assess and assign responsibility for treating pregnant 
women in need of emergency care or treatment for complications. Proper diagnosis at the 
local level is necessary to enable appropriate and timely referrals to the correct services.  
</p>
<p>40. Unsafe abortions account for 12 per cent of maternal deaths;38 however, both family 
planning and abortion procedures are excluded from the NHIS. Although middle-class and 
wealthy women access abortion services in regulated abortion clinics, poor and 
marginalized women cannot afford the rates charged in such clinics and often undertake 
procedures in unsafe and unregulated environments, which leave them vulnerable to 
avoidable incidences of maternal morbidity and mortality.39 Extending the insurance 
scheme to include free or heavily subsidized family-planning and abortion services will 
assist in eliminating the inequality of access to quality services. The number of qualified 
abortion providers must be increased, particularly in rural areas, and there must be better 
regulation in order to ensure that the procedure is only carried out by qualified service 
providers.  
</p>
<p>41. In many cases, traditional practices violate the right to health, and more often than 
not, these practices are directed against groups that may already be more vulnerable to 
infringements of their rights, such as women and children. One example is <i>trokosi</i> &#8211; the 
practice of surrendering girls as young as 10 to village priests as an act of atonement for 
family sins.40 Practices such as this continue to occur, predominately in the more remote 
regions such as the Volta, where women and girls are often already vulnerable to violations. 
The right to health requires that the Government make concerted efforts to prevent and 
remedy the effects of harmful traditional practices that may generate stigma and 
discrimination against women. Although the Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that this 
practice has been criminalized in Ghana, enforcement is lacking and the practice continues 
to occur in remote regions, particularly in the Volta. More must be done to promote the 
discontinuance of <i>trokosi</i>, including greater community awareness-building and improved 
enforcement efforts. In a promising development, local priests have begun taking steps to 
prevent the surrender of women and young girls in this manner.41

<p>42. Similarly, female genital mutilation has also been criminalized but continues to 
occur,42 despite attempts to enforce the law through prosecutions.43 As for <i>trokosi</i>, 
effectiveness of the law is largely dependent on significant cultural change, which likely 
cannot be made through criminalization alone. Community-led efforts should be 
encouraged, as they present the most effective and sustainable solutions to eradicating 
harmful traditional practices. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Malaria 
</b></p>
<p>43. Malaria remains hyperendemic throughout Ghana, with nearly 3.7 million cases 
reported nationwide in 2009.44 The disease also exacts a substantial economic toll, 
estimated at one to two per cent of Ghana&#8217;s GDP. And while malaria is widespread, the 
</p>
<p>most vulnerable groups of society still bear the overwhelming burden of the disease. 
Disparities remain within the health system at large, and accessibility and availability of 
necessary goods and services for vulnerable populations, such as children, are even lower in 
rural areas and for the poor.45 
</p>
<p>44. Malaria is responsible for 9.4 per cent of maternal deaths,46 and infants born to 
mothers with malaria are more likely to be of low birth weight, the single greatest risk 
factor for death in newborns. The incidence of low birth weight has been rising and 
contributes in part to the 20,000 children dying annually in Ghana due to malaria.47 Malaria 
can also lead to long-term disability in survivors. Repeated bouts of malaria have also been 
known to impair as much as 60 per cent of a child&#8217;s schooling, impacting on opportunities 
and productivity in life.48 
</p>
<p>45. In light of the severity of this issue in Ghana, the Special Rapporteur commends the 
Government on the admirable work done through the successful implementation of the Roll 
Back Malaria strategy, which includes the distribution of insecticide-treated nets and indoor 
residual spraying.49 It is also encouraging that high treatment rates have been achieved 
throughout the country, with steady gains recorded in artemisinin combination therapy 
(ACT) coverage. The provision of free treatment through the NHIS to vulnerable groups, 
such as pregnant women and children, is also a welcome initiative. However, despite the 
scaling-up of GFATM interventions throughout the country and improvements in many 
districts, the target treatment rate of 60 per cent for vulnerable groups by 2010 was not 
achieved.50 Moreover, the Special Rapporteur was informed that many cases of 
uncomplicated malaria were reported and reimbursed as complicated cases, which 
represents a major financial drain on the insurance scheme.

</b></p>
<p>46. Alongside these efforts to ensure accessibility and availability of good-quality 
treatment and preventive services for malaria, full realization of the right to health requires 
focused and targeted interventions related to the underlying determinants of health. 
Sanitation, hygiene, water and other factors that contribute to disease activity must be 
addressed. Sustainable and long-term gains in malaria prevention requires improvement in 
the availability and accessibility of preventative and treatment-related goods and services, 
such as insecticide-treated bed nets and malaria medications, along with government efforts 
to reduce standing water and drain marshy areas that serve as breeding grounds for malarial 
vectors.   
</p>
<p>47. Access to adequate sanitation remains poor. Only 13 per cent of the total population 
and fewer than 10 per cent of the rural population have access to improved sanitation 
facilities,51 which falls far below the targets set in the Millennium Development Goals. The 
Special Rapporteur is concerned that this lack of progress significantly undermines the 
effectiveness of any other malaria-related initiatives by failing to contain mosquito 
breeding. To affect long-term change and effectively prevent mosquito breeding, the 
Government should commit to mobilizing resources to achieve nationwide structural 
change in this area.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Environmental health and mining 
</b></p>
<p>48. Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
explicitly calls on States to take steps to ensure &#8220;the improvement of all aspects of 
environmental and industrial hygiene&#8221; in achieving full realization of the right to health. 
</p>
<p>Occupational and environmental conditions have been recognized as an underlying 
determinant of the right to health. Enabling occupational and environmental conditions, 
which must be achieved through formulation of national policies concerning elimination of 
pollution, are a core aspect of the obligation of States.52 Furthermore, the State has an 
obligation to protect rights holders from violations of the right to health by third parties, in 
this case third parties within the extractive industry.  
</p>
<p>49. In light of these requirements, the Special Rapporteur wishes to express his concern 
regarding the continued impact of the mining industry on environmental health in Ghana. 
While mining and resource extraction are very important to the Ghanaian economy, the 
wealth they generate must not come at the expense of securing the health of the affected 
populations. As recently as 2008, mineral levels in water were found to be above WHO 
limits, and led to instances of water and food contamination. This poses a serious threat to 
the health of persons living in Ghana, which is of great concern to the Special Rapporteur. 
Monitoring of the industry by the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative 
Justice is welcome, but more specific measures must be taken to ensure that affected 
populations are not again put at risk. 
</p>
<p>50. Additionally, the Government is obliged to respect the rights of those protesting the 
health effects of mining, and who have sometimes been met with violence.53 Any failure to 
respect those rights is unacceptable, irrespective of whether violations are committed by

</p>
<p>agents of the State or private entities, as the State must protect right holders against third 
party infringements of their rights.  
</p>
<p>51. Recent efforts to stem illegal mining are an encouraging step towards reducing 
environmental contamination. The education and training of small-scale miners in mercury 
abatement is also promising and should receive further government support.54 Nonetheless, 
more must be done in this area. The Government should continue to formulate and 
implement policies in accordance with the right to health framework, including following 
appropriate consultation procedures to ensure participation of affected populations in 
analysis and policymaking and ensuring accountability with respect to State and third-party 
violations, in order to address environmental and health issues in the mining sector.  
</p>
<p>52. These issues are even more pressing in light of newly-discovered oil deposits in 
Ghana. It is encouraging that the Government has proposed that some of the profits be used 
to fund health and education within the country, or to create a fund similar to the 
Norwegian model to save and invest resources so they can be used when oil reserves are 
depleted.55 The Special Rapporteur supports such suggestions, but reiterates that measures 
need to be put in place to ensure that these profits are used sustainably, and that extraction 
does not occur at the expense of the health of those directly affected by such operations. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Occupational health and safety 
</b></p>
<p>53. Implementation of a national policy to minimize the risk of occupational accidents 
and diseases, in addition to provision of occupational health and safety services, is required 
by State parties in order to fulfil their obligations under the right to health. Elements of such 
a policy include identification, determination, authorization and control of dangerous 
materials, equipment, substances, agents and work processes; provision of health 
information to workers; provision, if needed, of adequate protective clothing and equipment 
to workers; enforcement of laws and regulations through adequate inspection; requirement 
of notification of occupational accidents and diseases; conduct of inquiries into serious 
accidents and diseases, and production of annual statistics; protection of workers and their 
representatives from disciplinary measures for actions properly taken in conformity with 
such a policy; and provision of occupational health services with essentially preventive 
functions.56 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for developing legal protections 
of the health and safety rights of workers. Section 24 of the Constitution provides for the 
right to work under satisfactory safety and health conditions,57 and Labour Act No. 651 of 
2003, which covers nearly all Ghanaian employees in the formal sector, meets the standards 
set by the various International Labour Organization conventions ratified by Ghana.58 The 
Government has put into effect numerous laws pertaining to areas of occupational health 
including the Factories, Offices, and Shops Act 1970; Mining Regulations 1970;

</p>
<p>55. Nonetheless, much more remains to be done. In particular, the occupational health 
and safety regime in Ghana remains highly fragmented in the absence of a national policy 
on the subject. This means that different laws and their implementing ministries 
independently cover various areas or sectors of the economy, which has resulted in sizeable 
lacunae in occupational health coverage, particularly with respect to preventative measures 
and access to remedies. While it is reported that a draft policy was jointly developed by the 
ministries of Labour, Health, and Mines and Energy early in the last decade, it has not yet 
been adopted.62 Trade unions have called on the government to ratify ILO Convention No. 
155 concerning occupational safety and health in order to strengthen the national 
framework protecting workers.63  
</p>
<p>56. It is also of great concern that there is currently no explicit legislation or stated 
policy focusing on how to realize the right to health within the informal economy. Further, 
current statutes do not extend their coverage into this area. Nearly 90 per cent of the work 
force is employed in the informal sector,64 ensuring that realization of the right to health of 
these workers through effective implementation of occupational health policies remains a 
challenge. It is particularly necessary to address this area in light of the fact that the 
majority of the population is employed in industries which present significant health risks, 
including agriculture, manufacturing, construction  and food processing.65 Although it may 
not be possible or even in the interests of these workers to formalize all aspects of the 
informal economy through legislation, it may nevertheless assist in developing a normative 
paradigm for occupational health and promote realization of the right to health.  
</p>
<p>57. Although the Government has taken some steps toward realizing the right to health 
of workers, such as the introduction of the legislation mentioned above, much more will 
need to be done to overcome obstacles in this area. Steps taken by the Government should 
include ratifying ILO Convention No. 155 and developing a comprehensive system of 
occupational health and safety protection at the central level to address the issues arising 
from fragmentation in responsibility for oversight of occupational health and safety. The 
Government should address the informal economy in its occupational health and safety 
policy. Institutional capacity to monitor and prevent occupational injuries must particularly 
be addressed, as injuries generally reduce the expected lifespan of an individual in Ghana

<p><b> IX. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>The Special Rapporteur was impressed with the advances that have been made 
</b>in Ghana&#8217;s overall health system and the Government&#8217;s willingness to explore means 
</p>
<p><b>of further improvement, particularly given the possible future resource constraints. 
</b></p>
<p><b>While Ghana has made notable gains with respect to health, more remains to be done, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly in key areas such as mental health, family planning and empowerment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>women.  
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The Special Rapporteur is concerned with the lack of disaggregated data 
available with respect to key affected populations. The Government must continue to 
</b></p>
<p><b>gather and make use of disaggregated data in policymaking in order to appropriately 
</b></p>
<p><b>identify, monitor and evaluate interventions. Achieving and sustaining long-term 
</b></p>
<p><b>gains in core areas and fully realizing the right to health will require the participation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of affected communities. This is particularly true with respect to addressing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>continuing discrepancy in outcomes between rural and urban centres and reducing 
</b></p>
<p><b>the stigmatization of PLHIV. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
</b></p>
<p><b>consider the following recommendations pertaining to the overall healthcare system: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Gather comprehensive and disaggregated data to assess access to health-
</b></p>
<p><b>care services under the NHIS, and examine how the gaps in coverage can be 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressed; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Remove registration fees for NHIS cards for groups for whom such fees 
</b></p>
<p><b>impede access;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Enable community participation in health-care service delivery through 
</b></p>
<p><b>active engagement of civil society organizations in health-related policymaking at all 
</b></p>
<p><b>levels of the Government; 
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> In respect of HIV/AIDS, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Provide anti-retroviral treatment free of charge; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Decriminalize sex work and men having sex with men;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that access to anti-retroviral treatment is maintained and 
</b></p>
<p><b>expanded by developing a plan to make up for funding shortfalls that may result from 
</b></p>
<p><b>reductions in international assistance. 
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> In respect of mental health, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Adopt and implement the draft Mental Health Bill of 2006 in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>reform the mental health-care system; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Develop strategies and incentives to ensure that mental health facilities,
