1  Executive Summary
Introduction
This technical report was compiled by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. (“SRK”) for Silverstone 
Resources Corp. (“Silverstone) to describe the Minto Mine operation.  This report is based on the 
Technical Report – Minto Mine, Yukon of June 30, 2008 completed by SRK for Sherwood 
Copper Corp. (“Sherwood”).
This report was compiled by the following qualified persons (“QP”): Brad Mercer, P.Geo., 
Sherwood Copper Corp., Susan Lomas, P.Geo. and Ali Shahkar, P.Eng. of Lions Gate Geological 
Consulting Inc. (“LGGC”), David Hendriks, P.Eng. of Techpro-Teched and Gordon Doerksen, 
P.Eng. and Dino Pilotto, P.Eng. of SRK.
The Minto Mine is 100% owned and operated by Minto Explorations Ltd. (MintoEx), a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Capstone Mining Corporation (“Capstone”).  Sherwood owned 100% of the 
Minto Mine until November 24, 2008 when Sherwood and Capstone announced the closing of a 
business combination whereby the two entities combined to form a single company under the 
Capstone name.  The Minto Mine is now held 100% by Capstone.
On November 21, 2008 Silverstone concluded an agreement with Sherwood to acquire gold and 
silver production for the life of the Minto Mine, for a US$37.5M up-front payment plus further 
payments of the lesser of:
a)  US$300/oz Au and US$3.90/oz Ag (subject to a 1% inflation adjustment after 3 years
and each year thereafter); and
b)  The prevailing market price of gold and silver as quoted on the London Bullion Market
Association.
In the Silverstone precious metal purchase agreement (“PMPA”), if the precious metal production 
from the Minto Mine exceeds 50,000 oz payable gold in the first two years of the agreement or 
30,000 oz payable gold per year thereafter Silverstone will be entitled to purchase only 50% of 
the excess amounts.  Gold and silver account for approximately 13% of Minto’s revenue.  
Silverstone also obtained the right of first refusal to purchase gold and/or silver streams from 
Sherwood’s wholly-owned Kutcho Copper Project on terms and conditions to be agreed by 
mutual consent.
The Minto Mine is located 240 km northwest of Whitehorse, in the Yukon Territory, 
approximately a 3-hour drive.  The operation is serviced via the Klondike Highway to Minto 
Landing and then a 29 km all-weather gravel road to the mine.  The Yukon River must be crossed 
at Minto Landing.  In the summer months, a barge is used to ferry men and materials across the 
river.  In the winter, an ice bridge is used.  Road access to the mine is interrupted each spring and

fall for up to 6 to 8 weeks during freeze-up and break-up of the river.  A 1,300 m-long air strip 
located on the mine property is used when road access is not available.  The mine has a modern 
170-person modular trailer camp and catering facility to house and feed contractors and 
employees.
MintoEx holds approximately 2,746 hectares of Quartz Mining Leases and Quartz Mining 
Claims.
Electricity for the Minto facility is obtained from the recently-connected (Q4 2008) Yukon 
Energy Corporation grid system via a mine spur line. Prior to connection to the grid the mine 
used diesel generators.
The Minto mine reached commercial production on October 1, 2007 after a 4-month 
commissioning period.  The Minto ore yields good flotation recoveries at coarse grinds which has 
lead to an increase in plant throughput with minimal capital investment.  Mill throughput of over 
2,400 tonnes per day (“tpd”) , and occasionally in excess of 3,000 tpd, has been achieved, even 
prior to the completion of a the Phase 3 plant expansion project.
A preliminary feasibility study (“PFS”) was completed for the Area 2 deposit in November 2007 
after a very successful exploration program in 2006.  In 2007 and 2008, two other exploration 
targets, Ridgetop and Area 118, were drilled to resource-quality levels and the Area 2 deposit was 
significantly expanded.  Ridgetop and 118 are described in this report, although they are not yet 
included in the LOM plan.
Based on the results of the PFS, MintoEx applied to the Yukon government for an amendment to 
its Quartz Mining Licence in order to increase production from the Main deposit to 3,200 tpd, 
permission for which was granted in July 2008.   A further amendment to its operating permit is 
expected to be filed in order to further increase production and modify operating parameters to 
accommodate other proposed operational improvements, as well as incorporate the mining of the 
Area 2 deposit and possibly Area 118 and Ridgetop.  The application will need to await 
completion of 2008 drilling analysis, updated resource models and other additional technical 
work.
Geology and Exploration 
The Minto Project is found in the eastern margin of the Yukon-Tanana Composite Terrain, which 
is comprised of several metamorphic assemblages and batholiths.  Much of the Minto Property 
and the surrounding area are comprised of the Granite Mountain Batholith, which intruded into 
the Palaeozoic metamorphosed rocks of the Yukon-Tanana Terrain (Mortensen & Tafti, 2002).  
The Yukon-Tanana Composite Terrain is comprised of several metamorphic assemblages and 
batholiths and it is broadly contemporaneous with the Omineca Belt in nearby British Columbia.

In 2007, exploration concentrated on expanding the Area 2 resource and at Area 118, located 
west of and contiguous with Area 2, where Area 118 was identified as a possible extension of 
Area 2, based upon the recent resource model detailed in this report.  Subsequent geological and 
resource block modelling conducted in 2007 – 2008 showed that the Area 2 and Area 118 
deposits are continuous through a zone of transition between the two deposit areas.  Much of 
what was initially considered to be Area 118 during the exploration drilling period was 
subsequently reassigned in the model to Area 2.  This distinction was made on the basis of 
geological continuity and similarity of copper-gold grades.  A joint model was completed in 2008 
and a new NI43-101 resource calculation was released for both deposits on June 17, 2008.   
Mineralization at Area 2 and Area 118 is very similar in nature.
Also in 2007, MintoEx geologists reassessed the Ridgetop area (ASARCO’s original Area 1 
discovery area) and drilled twenty-five new diamond drill holes, following up on sixteen 
historical holes from the 1970’s and early 1990’s.  The subsequent interpretation and drill density 
allowed for the completion of a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate for Ridgetop East.  No 
prior NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate for Ridgetop had been calculated, despite it being 
the original discovery area at Minto.  Mineralization at Ridgetop, where unoxidized, is similar in 
nature to all other deposits on the Minto Project, except that thicknesses are often much higher 
than average.  Mineralization in the upper of the Ridgetop deposit, has undergone partial 
oxidation, resulting in abundant and sometimes complete replacement of the bornite and 
chalcopyrite with chalcocite.
Company geologists proposed in 2006 that the separate prospects and deposits mentioned above 
comprise a single large continuous to contiguous mineralized system that has subsequently been 
deformed; openly folded and cut by late regional faults; some with vertical displacements and 
some with inferred lateral displacements.  The sum of MintoEx’s drilling and geological 
modelling to date since 2005 continues to support the single system thesis and ongoing 
exploration work in 2008 and beyond is intended on creating a unified geological model for the 
property south of the DEF fault.
Mine Production and Mineral Reserve Estimate 
The Minto Mine life-of-mine plan used in this report was completed in June 2008 and 
encompasses two open pits, Minto Main pit (“Main”), which is currently being mined, and Area 2 
pit.  The actual production data from the Main pit through to the end of July 2008 was combined 
with the proposed 2008 LOM plan and forms the basis of this technical review.  Based on a start 
date of January 2008, the Main/Area 2 mine will produce a total of 9.2 million tonnes (Mt) of ore 
and 61.4 Mt of waste over a 8 year mine operating life ending in early 2015, with an additional 
year of processing low grade stockpiles, extending the mill operation until early 2016. The LOM 
plan focuses on accessing and milling high-grade ore first, with lower grade material sent to 
stockpiles for blending and processing later in the mine life.

Mine design for the Main and Area 2 pits was initiated with the development of a Net Smelter 
Return (“NSR”) model.  The model included estimates of metal prices, exchange rate, mining 
dilution, mill recovery, concentrate grade smelting and refining payables and costs, freight and 
marketing costs and royalties.  The model was then used with the MineSight Lerchs-Grossman 
algorithm to determine the optimal mining shell.  Detailed mine planning and scheduling was 
then conducted on the optimal pit shell to produce the current pit designs used for the 2008 LOM 
plan.  The mineral reserves at Minto, including both Main pit and Area 2 are summarized in 
Tables 1.1 through to 1.3 below. The mineral reserve for the Main pit excludes mining that has 
taken place in 2006 and 2007 and includes drilling to the end of 2007. The mineral reserves for 
Area 2 are taken from the PFS.  A 0.62% Cu cut-off was used within the planned pits.

Mining commenced in 2006 with pre-stripping in the Main pit and the first ore was produced in 
mid-2007. The post-2007 mining sequence was divided into six phases. The first three phases see 
the completion of mining in the Main pit followed by three phases in Area 2.  The phases were 
designed, based on providing the required ore per period, to maximize grade and deferring 
stripping as long as possible.  The Main and Area 2 pits are most economical when mined in 
sequence with the stripping of the Area 2 pit beginning near the completion of mining in the Main 
pit.  Area 2 rock waste and tailings will then used to fill the Main pit.  The LOM mine production

In 2007 and 2008 LGGC was contracted by Sherwood Copper to estimate updated mineral 
resource estimations for the Minto Mine Main deposit and Area 2 and new estimates for Area 118 
and Ridgetop on the Minto Project located in Yukon.  The estimates included drill holes 
completed by the end of December 2007, whereas the LOM plan only considers resources

estimated based on drilling to the end of December 2006. A further update to the resources and 
LOM plan is planned once 2008 drilling is complete and results received.
Ali Shahkar, P.Eng., Principal Consultant with LGGC completed the mineral resource estimation 
update for the Minto Mine deposit in December of 2007 and Susan Lomas, P.Geo., Principal 
Consultant with LGGC completed the estimation work for Ridgetop, Area 2 and Area 118 in June 
of 2008.
Table 1.6 summarizes the results of the historical mineral resource estimates completed to date on 
the Minto Mine Deposit and Table 1.7 summarizes the historical estimates completed for the 
Area 2 deposit.  The results for the most recent resource estimates are included in the tables for 
comparative purposes.  All the estimates are reasonably close in the tonnage and grade values 
reported for the Minto Mine.
The tonnages for Area 2 have increased from 7.6 Mt to 11.3 Mt in the measured and indicated 
resource categories and 1.4 Mt to 3.5 Mt in the inferred resource category.  This is largely due to 
2007 drilling confirming the presence of mineralization further to the south than was previously 
modeled (but not to include the results of 2008 drilling).  The most recent resource estimate 
results quoted for the Minto Mine deposit (December 2007) are exclusive of material mined up to 
the 21st of December, 2007.
In December of 2007 LGGC was commissioned by SWC to provide an update to the 2006 
mineral resource estimate for the Minto Mine deposit originally completed by Gary Giroux and 
SWC.  This updated estimate included the new data from the 2007 drilling program and 
accounted for the material removed by mining activity in 2007.   LGGC was provided with the 
new drill hole data in the resource area and a 3-D pit surface representing the limits of the open-
pit at the Minto Mine as of December 21st, 2007.
In March 2008, LGGC was commissioned to provide an update to the 2006 mineral resource 
estimate for Area 2 originally completed by Ali Shahkar, P.Eng. of LGGC.  Andrew Ham, 
MAusIMM, and Marek Nowak, P.Eng. of SRK Consulting both reviewed the estimation and 
found it reasonable for inclusion in this SRK technical report.
In 2007, new drilling to the south west of Area 2 had identified a body of mineralization called 
Area 118 that now contained sufficient drilling data to support an initial mineral resource 
estimation.  Both of these estimates include geology and assay data from the 2007 drilling 
program.
In June 2008, LGGC completed a resource estimate for the Ridgetop deposit at the Minto Project.  
There are no historical resource estimates for this deposit.

The mineral resources of the Minto Mine and Area 2 model were classified using logic consistent 
with the CIM definitions referred to in National Instrument 43-101.  The project mineral 
resources were classified into one of three categories; measured, indicated or inferred mineral 
resources.
All blocks within Area 118 and Ridgetop were classed into the inferred mineral resource category 
due to the current wide drill hole spacing and preliminary nature of the geology/grade model.  
MintoEx is currently infill drilling these areas and early indications are that the model is being 
corroborated by these new holes but a detailed review is required before a higher level of 
classification can be assigned.
Table 1.8 contains the results of the resource estimation for Minto Mine, Area 2, Area 118 and 
Ridgetop copper, gold and silver values as of data available from March 2008.  The resource 
estimate results are being declared using 0.50 % Cu cut-off.  For comparative purposes additional 
cut-offs equal to 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.75, 1.00, 1.50 and 2.00 % Cu are also presented in the table.
Due to uncertainty associated with Inferred Mineral Resources, additional exploration work on 
the property may or may not succeed in upgrading the portions of the deposit currently classified 
as Inferred Mineral Resource to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource.  Because confidence 
in these portions of the estimate is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of technical 
and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic viability worthy of public 
disclosure, the Inferred Mineral Resources must be excluded from estimates forming the basis of 
feasibility or other economic studies.

the Main pit.  Upon completion of mining in the Main pit, slurried tailings and waste rock will be co-
deposited back into the Main pit.  This plan is not yet permitted but offers a potentially viable 
solution to waste disposal that provides backfill material for the Main pit and reduces the amount 
disturbed land that would normally be required by mining Area 2.
Waste rock from the Main pit will be deposited in an expansion of the existing waste dump areas and 
in a new valley floor location that has recently been permitted.
Mineral Processing and Metallurgy
Production commenced in June of 2007 at a rated tonnage of 1,563 tonnes per day.  The plant was 
expanded in December of 2007 to a rated tonnage of 2,400 tonnes per day with the addition of 
flotation cells, two tailings filter presses and one additional ball mill.
Mill throughput and operating availability has been increasing steadily with time.  In May and June 
of 2008, average availabilities approached 90% and in June throughput exceeded design capacity.  
The average tonnes milled per hour have increased to 113 in May and June 2008.
Metallurgical performance has been consistent over the period March-June 2008.  Concentrate 
grades have averaged over 40% copper with recoveries averaging 93.6%.  Silver recoveries have 
averaged 86.9% in the copper concentrate. Gold recovery averaged 80.8% in the first quarter of 2008 
from a head grade of 1.79 g/t Au.  As gold is not assayed on site, these are the most recent figures 
available.
The Phase 3 expansion is in progress to increase throughput to 3,200 tonnes per day.  The current 
bottle neck is the SAG mill.  The expansion plan is to open up the grates and install a one inch 
trommel screen on the SAG discharge, replacing the 5/8” trommel.  Fortunately, the ball mills have 
extra capacity available as they are only drawing 72% of available power.  The ball charge will be 
changed to 50% 3” and 2” balls from 2” balls to deal with the increased transfer size from the SAG 
mill.
The tailings filtration plant is performing well beyond design.  Cycle times for the four currently in 
use are between 8.5 and 9 minutes and each cycle averages 6.5 wet tonnes of tailings, giving each 
filter a capacity in excess of 1,000 wet tonnes per day of tailings.  It is expected that, when the 5th 
filter press is returned to tailings duty (from its current set up as an alternate concentrate filter to the 
Larox), there will be more than adequate capacity for the increased tonnage, after allowing for 
maintenance and availability.
An additional concentrate thickener will be installed to handle the increased concentrate tonnage as 
part of the Phase 3 expansion project.

Minto Mine Economic Results
Page 11
A financial model was compiled by SRK based on the Minto LOM operations plan and the 2008 
budget.  The model includes taxation and excludes financing costs (debt and interest payments).   
Net annual cash flows were calculated by considering net smelter return from the payable Cu, Au 
and Ag metals, and then deducting the operating costs, capital costs and applicable taxes.   The 
model includes updated mine plan results and revised operating (“OPEX”) and capital (“CAPEX”) 
costs.  The new costs were estimated based on the experience of the past year of operation, on 
current and projected consumable costs and on capital project schedule updates.
Metal prices were estimated by applying prices from the existing sales contract as shown in Table 
1.9 and non-contract metal price assumptions shown in Table 1.10.

The other main economic factors used in the cash flow analysis were:
•  CAD:USD exchange rate of:  
•  1:1 (parity) for 2008; 
•  1.05:1 for 2009; and 
•  1.10:1 beyond 2009
•  A discount rate of 10%; 
•  Nominal 2008 dollars; and 
•  No inflation.
Costs, revenues and taxes were calculated for each period in which they occurred rather than at the 
actual date of payment.  For example, taxes were calculated each month in the model even though 
they are actually paid only once per year.
The results of the economic analysis are shown in Table 1.11.  It must be noted that the net present 
value (“NPV”) calculations in the financial model were done using 2008 as the starting year and do 
not take into account approximately $150 M in capital spent in 2006 and 2007 for plant and mine

A sensitivity analysis was conducted for metal grade, metal price, OPEX and CAPEX and compared 
using after-tax NPV10% results.  As shown in Figure 1.1 the mill head grade and metal prices had the 
most impact on NPV10% results.  CAPEX had almost no impact as most of the capital for the project 
has been spent. A 20% change in OPEX gave a 12% NPV10% variation

The Silverstone PMPA model yields a pre-tax NPV10% of $11M and a pre-tax IRR of 19%.  The 
PMPA economics are most sensitive to gold price followed by exchange rate and payable gold. A 
20% increase in gold price yields an increase in pre-tax NPV10% of $17M.  Using the assumptions in 
Table 1.12, gold makes up about 85% of the PMPA contract value.

Conclusions
The conclusions of note are:  
•  The Minto deposit, encompassing both Main pit and Area 2, represents a significant ore reserve. 
The current mining in the Main pit has helped confirm the expected grade and extent of the ore 
reserves and the detailed drilling has provided a good level of confidence in the reserve estimate.
•  There are significant inferred resources in the Area 118 and Ridgetop deposits that are expected 
to be converted to a minimum classification of “indicated mineral resource” with relatively little 
drilling.
•  The potential exists to improve the waste management system of the property in order to
enhance productivity and reduce overall mine costs (i.e. recently permitted valley fill spoils).
•  Minto has significant hedge and precious metal stream sales agreements that will help mitigate
the impact of low metal prices which are seen as the biggest risk to a profitable operation.
The most important opportunities to improve the project are: 
•  Optimization of mine plan; and 
•  Conversion of resources to reserves from Area 118 and Ridgetop to extend mine life.
Recommendations 
•  Continue exploration drilling to delineate and potentially expand resources.  The cost for the
drilling program is extimated to be $2.65 M, including geological mapping.
•  Conduct a preliminary feasibility study taking into account new resources and generate a revised,
optimized LOM plan.  The cost for this work is estimated to be $700,000.

4  Property Description and Location
The following section was paraphrased from Section 6 of the “Technical Report (43-101) for the 
Minto Project” by Hatch (August 2006) found on the sedar.com website and updated as appropriate.
The Minto Project is located 240 km northwest of Whitehorse, Yukon (Figure 4.1). It lies in the 
Whitehorse Mining Division, as shown on the 2005/09/20 Yukon Energy Mines and Resources 
Minerals Resources Branch Mining Claim map sheet 115 I/11 (Figure 4.2). It is centered at 
approximately 62°37’N latitude and 137°15’W longitude (NAD 83, UTM Zone 8 coordinates 
6945000N, 384000E). The Project is located on the west side of the Yukon River on Selkirk First 
Nation (“SFN”) settlement land. Highway 2 is located on the east side of the Yukon River.
The Minto Project consists of 284 claims. There are 120 pending quartz claims, 99 quartz claims and 
65 quartz claims under lease. The claim and lease boundaries are shown on Figure 4.3. The 100% 
registered owner of the claims and leases is Minto Explorations Ltd. (MintoEx), a 100% owned 
subsidiary of Sherwood Copper Corp. The current status of the claims is given in Table 4-1 below. 
The quartz claims are in good standing until 2007/03/01 while the DEF leases are valid until 
2007/10/07 and the Minto leases are valid until 2018/05/13. MintoEx made payment in lieu of 
assessment work of $10,395.00 on February 27, 2006, for 99 quartz claims (Southwick, 2007).

There are 65 quartz claims under lease (summarized in Table 4.2). On April 7, 2006, a review of all 
leases was completed. The DEF leases are valid until 2007/10/07 and the Minto leases are valid until 
2018/05/13. All 65 registered leases (100% owned by MintoEx) have been surveyed and are shown 
on Plans 64926, 59454 and 59648 (Minto Explorations, 2006).

An independent title opinion for the claims or leases was completed by Austring, Fendrick, Fairman 
and Parkkari on April 11, 2006, and the findings are quoted below (Southwick, 2006).
“As requested we have examined title to the Minto quartz mining claims (the “Minto Claims”) and 
the Minto leases (the “Minto Leases”) (collectively referred to as the “Mining Property”) in the 
Whitehorse Mining District of the Yukon Territory, more particularly described in the claim 
ownership sheet dated April 5, 2006, from the Whitehorse Mining District Mining Recorder, Glenna 
Southwick.
We have obtained Abstracts of Record from the office of the Whitehorse Mining Recorder dated 
March 1, 2006. Our opinion is limited to the extent of our review and accordingly it is also subject to 
the following qualifications: 
•  With respect to the Minto Claims we express no opinion as to the validity and accuracy of the
staking, recording and location of the mineral properties. Until a property is surveyed by an 
authorized Canada Lands Surveyor in accordance with instructions from the Surveyor General 
and such survey is duly approved, the boundaries of a mineral claim cannot be considered to be 
settled.

•  This opinion is subject to statutory priorities and preferences and to any liens, encumbrances or 
other charges, which are extant and still within time for registration or which are valid without 
registration in the office of the Mining Recorder for the Whitehorse Mining District.
Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that as of March 1, 2006, the date of the 
Abstracts of Record: 
•  Minto Explorations Ltd. holds a 100% interest in the Minto Claims and Minto Leases; 
•  That the expiry dates listed on the attached Schedule “A” are correct; and 
•  The Mining Property is in good standing and there are no registered liens or encumbrances 
registered against the Mining Property except for an Agreement registered by Selkirk First 
Nations, being a Notice of Royalty and Restriction of Transfer Agreement dated April 28, 1999 
and registered on April 28, 1999 as instrument number RW01459.” (This royalty is 0.5% NSR).
The property lies within the Selkirk First Nation SFN R-6A, First Nation Settlement and Surveyed 
Land, Class A as shown on Figure 4.2. In 1997, Minto Explorations and the Selkirk First Nations 
entered into a co-operation agreement with respect to the development of the Minto deposit and 
subsequently registered the 0.5% net smelter royalty mentioned above.”

5  Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources,
Infrastructure and Physiography
5.1  Accessibility
The Minto Project is accessible from Whitehorse, Yukon via the Klondike Highway (Highway 2) to 
Minto Landing (240 km) located on the east side of the Yukon River. At Minto Landing, a barge in 
the summer months and ice bridge in the winter months provide access across the Yukon River to the 
28.8 km long, 10 m wide gravel mine access road. (see Figure 4.3).  There is a large parking/staging 
area at Minto Crossing adjacent to the barge loading cut.
The highway, river crossing and gravel access road are suitable for heavy transport traffic. The barge 
has the capacity to transport B-train trucks. (See Figure 5.1) Mine personnel are transported to the 
site in 47-passenger commercial buses based out of Whitehorse. During the river freeze and thaw 
periods, personnel, perishables and emergency supplies are flown in.
The road from the Yukon River to the project site is a well maintained class “A” all-weather gravel 
road, complete with drainage ditches, road signage and runaway lanes on steeper downhill sections. 
Roadbed material is fluvial sand or gravel along its lower reaches along the Yukon River and coarse 
sand along its upper reaches. The majority of the road is constructed on stable south facing slopes, 
which do not have permafrost, except for one short section where insulating tech cloth was laid down 
prior to the road fill to keep the permafrost from melting and eroding. The road crosses one major 
tributary of the Yukon River, Big Creek, using a single lane bridge made with reinforced concrete 
abutments and deck. The approaches to the bridge have been stabilized with berms and a spillway 
constructed to divert floodwaters exceeding the bridge capacity.
The mine maintains a 1,300-metre long gravel airstrip located approximately 2 km south of the 
camp.

Landing
5.2  Climate
The climate at the Minto Mine is characteristic of a sub-Arctic continental location and experiences 
short cool summers and long cold winters. The average temperature in the summer is 10°C and the 
average temperature in the winter is –20°C. Average precipitation is limited to about 25 cm of rain 
equivalent per annum in the form of rain and snow.
Weather will not normally impede year-round mine operations, including outdoor activities in the 
winter, however, short-term temperature and precipitation extremes may cause temporary 
interruptions or production adjustments.
5.3  Local Resources
Fuel and lodging services are available at Carmacks, 75 km south of Minto as well as at Pelly 
Crossing, 35 km north of Minto. Whitehorse, the capital of Yukon Territory has a population of 
~20,000 and is serviced by daily commercial flights from British Columbia, Alberta and other 
northern communities. There are all-weather paved highways to the south and west to the port of 
Skagway, Alaska where the Minto concentrate is loaded into ships for transport to smelters.

The majority of workers at Minto are sourced from local communities and Whitehorse.  A limited 
number of employees are from outside the Yukon.
5.4
Infrastructure
The mine has a 170-person ATCO trailer camp.  The camp facility has full catering, food storage and 
recreation facilities supported by potable water, fire water and arctic sewage systems.
Storage capacity for consumables at the mine site, including fuel and blasting agents are designed for 
2 ½ months supply which, historically, is sufficient for the impassable freeze up and break up 
periods of the Yukon River.
The Minto Mine was connected to the Yukon Energy Corp. (“YEC”) electrical grid in the fall of 
2008, eliminating the mine’s reliance on diesel-generated power. The new grid power connection to 
the mine was part of a YEC project to establish a new 172 km long 138 KV power line running from 
Carmacks to Stewart Crossing.  This line was planned to be built in two phases: Carmacks-Minto-
Landing-Pelly Crossing, which is now complete and later Pelly Crossing-Stewart Crossing. A 32 km 
34 KV mine spur line was constructed to connect the mine to the main grid at Minto Landing.
5.5  Physiography
The Minto property lies in the Dawson Range, which is part of the Klondike Plateau, an uplifted 
surface that has been dissected by erosion. Topography in the area consists of rounded rolling hills 
and ridges with relief of up to 600 m. The highest elevation on the property is 975 m above sea level, 
compared to elevations of 460 m along the Yukon River. The property is at a height of land where 
slopes are relatively gentle, thereby providing accessible areas for waste storage and tailings 
containment for the anticipated development. The hills and ridges often have spines of bedrock 
outcrops at their crests. Bedrock exposures are limited in the other areas of the property.
Overburden colluvium is primarily made up of sand derived from decomposition of the largely 
granitic bedrock in the area and is generally thin but pervasive. In south-facing locations, this 
material provides a well-drained, sound foundation for buildings and roads. The north-facing slopes 
in the area are permanently frozen solid with permafrost. Vegetation in the area is sub-Arctic boreal 
forest made up of largely spruce evergreen trees and poplar deciduous trees. The trees prefer well-
drained south-facing slopes and may be sparse on the north-facing slopes where moss and alder 
‘buck brush’ prevails. The area has experienced several wild fires, the latest of which was in 1997, 
which made the area devoid of mature living trees.

6  History
Production results for 2007, the first year of mining on the property, are shown in Table 6.1.  
Commercial production was declared on October 1, 2007 after a 4-month commissioning period.  
Results for the first half of 2008 have shown a consistent increase in production and recovery as the 
mill facility optimization plans are carried out and mill expansion plans are implemented.  The 
positive processing results at Minto have been largely driven by the amenability of the ore to 
flotation at a coarse primary grind size.

6.2  Drilling
The project has been actively explored since the early 1970’s. ASARCO and Falconbridge drilled on 
the property in 1973 and 1974. MintoEx completed further drilling programs between 1993 and 
2001. Since Sherwood’s acquisition, MintoEx has completed two drilling programs on the property, 
in 2005 and 2006. Table 6.2 includes a list of the drilling programs completed in the area of the 
deposit. 
Table 6.2: Summary of Drill Holes Included in the Resource Estimation
6.3  ASARCO and Falconbridge 1972 to 1974
Most of the drilling on the property was performed in the early 1970s by Falconbridge and ASARCO 
during the initial exploration on the property. Subsequent definition drilling was conducted once the

deposit was discovered and exploration continued in the area. The project reports fail to detail the 
drilling procedures, but basic drilling procedures have changed little over time.
Early drilling was conducted with BQ drill rods, which return a core diameter of 1.43 in. Within the 
main zone of the deposit, the drill hole density is on 100 ft centres on the DEF (Falconbridge) part of 
the deposit (locally as close as 50 ft), and generally on 150 ft to 200 ft centres on the Minto 
(ASARCO) side as illustrated in Figure 6.1. Figure 6.2 shows a typical cross-section through the 
deposit.

Figure 6.2: Typical Cross Section, Section 6945050N
Falconbridge drilled 11 angled holes, and all other holes were drilled vertically. The average sample 
length for ASARCO is 2.4 m with the majority of samples being either 1.5 m or 3.0 m long. The 
average sample length for the Falconbridge drill holes is 1.5 m.
The locations of the holes were surveyed in by Underhill Geomatics using a local grid controlled by 
local benchmarks. The drill roads and pads for this drilling are still visible and the holes are often 
identifiable by casing and/or wooden posts protruding from the ground, although the labels are no 
longer attached or legible.
The core from this drilling was stored onsite in two core sheds. Over time the sheds have collapsed 
and/or have been burned out by wildfires, rendering most of the core unusable. In addition, the labels 
on the few remaining intact boxes are missing and/or are not legible.
In their compilation of the results, MintoEx has distinguished the ASARCO drill holes with an ‘A’ 
prefix and the Falconbridge hole with a ‘K’ prefix.
The results of this drilling have been instrumental in estimating the grade and tonnage of the deposit. 
The drilling was carried out using accepted practices of the time and is documented well enough to 
be reliable for the purposes of grade and tonnage estimations, particularly when compared to the 
results of subsequent infill drill completed by MintoEx in 1993-2001 and MintoEx in 2005-06.

Page 35
MintoEx has carried out several diamond drilling programs for deposit definition drilling and 
exploration on the property in general, as follows:
1993 
•  960 m drilled in eight holes (93 – A to H) within the deposit area to sample the two main
mineralization types (foliated granodiorite and quartz-feldspathic gneiss) for metallurgical test 
work
•  Six of the holes were located to intersect the lower zone mineralization immediately below the 
main zone and one was designed to test deeper mineralization indicated in the 1970’s drilling
•  The core was used for metallurgical testing and some of it was not split and assayed 
•  Four of the holes were logged for magnetic susceptibility 
 
1994 
•  2,185 m drilled in 19 exploration holes to test mineralization south of the main deposit 
•  This drilling outlined a mineralized horizon roughly 6 m thick grading 2 – 3% Cu 
•  One hole (94-17) filled in a large gap in the deposit area 
 
1995 
•  572 m drilled in 6 holes: 425 m drilled in five exploration holes to test geophysical anomalies
and 160 m completed in one condemnation hole north of the proposed mill site
•  The exploration holes failed to intersect any anomalous mineralization 
 
1996 
•  545 m completed in four condemnation holes in the area of the proposed west waste rock dump 
 
2001 
•  552 m drilled in five confirmation holes within the proposed open pit area
All the drilling on the project was contracted to E. Caron Diamond Drilling of Whitehorse.
The 1993, 1994, 1995 and 2001 programs utilized HQ core and the 1996 drilling was NQ core. This 
historical drilling was completed in the 1990s, prior to the legislation for NI 43-101. There was less 
regulatory scrutiny and results were the focus of reporting, rather than details of data collection. 
There is little in the way of documentation for the methods used in the pre-1990s drilling and 
sampling.
The 2001 drilling was subject to a rigorous report by both MintoEx (Minto Explorations Ltd., 2003) 
and ASARCO (Simpson, 2001), which loaned a geologist to the project to log and sample the core. 
The results of the 2001 drilling are discussed in the Data Verification section of this report. Some of 
the core from the 1993, 1996 and 2001 drilling programs is stored in the Ken Bostock Core Library 
in Whitehorse. Some of the other core from the exploration on the property (away from the deposit)

is stacked on site in  pile behind the camp buildings. Older core was stored in sheds, which were 
burnt in a forest fire and is now unidentifiable.
6.5  Historic Resource Estimates
The Minto deposit has been subject to several historical tonnage and grade estimations, as 
summarized in Table 6.3.  These resource estimates were based on up to 160 drill holes (totaling 
more than 25,000 m of drilling). 
Table 6.3: Historical Tonnage & Grade Estimates of the Minto Deposit
The estimates in Table 6.3 do not follow the required disclosure for reserves and resources (as 
outlined in National Instrument 43-101) because they were prepared prior to the inception NI 43-
101. The resource estimates have been obtained by sources believed reliable and are relevant but 
cannot be verified. No effort has been made to refute or confirm these estimates and they can only be 
described as historical estimates.

7  Geological Setting
7.1  Regional Geology
The following section was taken from Section 9 in the “Technical Report (43-101) for the Minto 
Project” by Hatch (August 2006) found on the sedar.com website.  For the purposes of this report, 
the original tables and figures numbers have been adapted to this report.
The Minto Project is found in the eastern margin of the Yukon-Tanana Composite Terrain, which is 
comprised of several metamorphic assemblages and batholiths (Figure 7.1). It is broadly 
contemporaneous with the Omineca Belt in nearby British Columbia.

The Minto Property and surrounding area are underlain by plutonic rocks of the Granite Mountain 
Batholith (Early Mesozoic Age) (7.2). They vary in composition from quartz diorite and granodiorite 
to quartz monzonite. The batholith is unconformably overlain by clastic sedimentary rocks of the 
Tantalus Formation and andesitic to basaltic volcanic rocks of the Carmacks Group, both are 
assigned a Late Cretaceous age. Immediately flanking the Granite Mountain Batholith, to the east, is 
a package of undated mafic volcanic rocks, outcropping on the shores of the Yukon River. The 
structural relationship between the batholith and the undated mafic volcanics is poorly understood 
because the contact zone is not exposed.
Geobarometry and geothermometry data (Tafti and Mortensen, 2004) suggests the Granite Mountain 
Batholith was emplaced at a depth of at least 9 km, while the presence of euhedral to subhedral 
epidote, interpreted by Tafti and Mortensen as magmatic in origin, suggests a deeper emplacement 
depth in the order of 18-20 km.

7.2  Property Geology and Lithological Description
Outcrop exposure on the property is poor. Where exposure is available, it has been affected by deep 
weathering and variable oxidation, as the terrain was not glaciated during the last ice age event. Due 
to the very poor outcrop exposure and the buried nature of the Minto deposit, much of the property 
geology is based on observations from diamond drill core and extrapolation from regional 
observations.
Lithologically the Property is underlain by predominantly igneous rocks of granodiorite composition. 
In the few available outcrops and in drill core two basic units are distinguished, an equigranular 
phase and a potassic feldspar megacrystic phase. The equigranular phase is relatively leucocratic, 
grey to whitish in color and uniform in texture. The potassic-feldspar megacrystic phase can be 
slightly darker, may contain more biotite and hornblende and may be light pink in color. In surface 
exposures, the latter exhibits a very weak alignment of the feldspar megacrysts, defining an 
interpreted magmatic foliation.
Other rock types, albeit volumetrically insignificant include dykes of simple quartz-feldspar 
pegmatite, aplite; and an aphanitic textured intermediate composition rock. Bodies of all of these 
units are relatively thin and rarely exceed one metre core intersections. These dykes are relatively 
late, generally postdating the peak ductile deformation event, however some pegmatite and aplite 
bodies observed in a rock cut located north of the mill complex are openly folded. Conglomerate and 
volcanic flows have been logged in drill core by past operators but have not been confirmed by the 
authors as the drill core from previous campaigns was largely destroyed in forest fires and no new 
drilling has intersected such rocks.
As the copper sulphide mineralization at Minto is hosted in foliated granodiorite all core logging by 
past and by the present operators separates the foliated granodiorite as a distinctly discernable unit. It 
is the authors’ opinion that this foliated granodiorite is just variably strained equivalents of the two 
primary granodiorite textures and not a separate lithology. Tafti & Mortensen (2004) noted that the 
relatively massive plutonic rocks have similar mineral and chemical composition as the foliated 
rocks.
The nature of the contact between the two massive phases of granodiorite appears gradational but 
occasional chilled contacts have been observed. In contrast, the contact relationship between the 
deformation zones and the massive phases of granodiorite is generally very sharp. These contacts do 
not exhibit chilled margins and are considered by the authors to be structural in nature, separating the 
variably strained equivalents of the same rock type. Tafti and Mortensen (2004) had interpreted the 
sharp contacts to be pendants of deformed rock within the unfoliated rock.
7.3  Structure
As noted above copper-sulphide mineralization at Minto is strongly associated with foliated 
granodiorite. This foliation is defined by the alignment of biotite in areas of weak to moderate strain
GED/ha

Page 41
and by the segregation of quartz and feldspar into bands in areas of higher strain, giving the rock a 
gneissic texture in very strongly deformed areas. The deformation zone forms sub-horizontal 
horizons within the more massive plutonic rocks of the region and can be traced laterally for more 
than 1000 metres in the drill core. They are often stacked in parallel to sub-parallel sequences. The 
regular, sub-horizontal nature of the deformation zones allows a high degree of predictability when 
planning diamond drilling campaigns.
Contrary to some previous reports (Orequest, 2005), the foliated zones do not appear to inter-finger 
with the more massive rocks. Rather, it appears that blocks of unfoliated granodiorite are sometimes 
incorporated within the thicker deformation zones and anastomose around them.
Internally, the foliation exhibits highly variable orientations within individual deformation zones. 
Small scale folds are observed internally, however the deformation zones or enveloping surfaces 
themselves do not appear to be folded at an easily discernable scale. It is fair to say that no 
systematic fold geometry has been identified but it does not seem to affect the overall sub-horizontal 
attitude of the mineralized envelope. Without orientated core measurements and because the deposit 
is blind to surface further speculation about fold geometries is futile.
The similarity of chemistry and texture of both the deformed and the massive granodiorites suggest 
the deformation zones are structural in origin and not stratigraphic. Several of these foliated units can 
be traced in drill holes over long distances at similar elevations. While this could suggest either a 
structural or a stratigraphic origin for the foliated rocks it was noted that obvious plutonic textures 
were found in both the deformed and the massive rocks. However the absence of chill margins or 
absorption rims, at contacts combined with the great depth of emplacement (Tafti and Mortensen, 
2004) likely preclude them from being remnant rafts or roof pendants of metasedimentary or 
metavolcanic strata, as some workers have postulated. It is the authors’ opinion that these foliated 
and mineralized rocks do not exhibit any sedimentary or volcanic features. A structural origin 
remains the best explanation.
The deformation zones appear to be healed structures within the Granite Mountain Batholith and not 
units of different lithologies. It is postulated that they represent healed, shallowly dipping faults, and 
may have formed when the rocks passed through the brittle/ductile transformation zone in the earth’s 
crust in transition from a deep emplacement environment to eventual exhumation of the batholith. 
They may represent thrust faults related to regional crustal thickening of the Yukon-Tanana Terrane 
when the batholith was being exhumed.
Late brittle fracturing and faulting is noted throughout the property area and is associated with a 
conjugate set of regional faults. Within the deposit at least one of these faults, the DEF fault, is 
significant from an economic standpoint. The DEF Fault strikes more or less east-west and dips 
north-northwest and cuts off the main zone mineralization at its northern end, as shown in Figure 7.3. 
The presence of several other faults is suspected, but the vertical orientation of most of the drilling is 
less than optimal to intersect steep to vertical faults.

Figure 7.3: North- South Cross Section through Minto Deposit showing DEF Fault
and MC Fault
The Minto Creek fault (MC Fault) bisects the main deposit, dividing it into north and south areas and 
is modeled as dipping steeply north-northeast with an apparent left lateral reverse displacement. The 
northern block moved up and to the west relative to the southern block. Both the vertical and 
horizontal displacements are evident by offsets in the main zone mineralization and appear to be 
minimal. A lack of marker horizons in the plutonic rocks, however, makes it difficult to determine 
the absolute magnitude of the movement (Figure 7.3).
The DEF fault defines the northern end of the deposit. Although it may share a similar sense of 
movement, a significant amount of displacement is inferred. Determining the magnitude of this 
displacement could lead to locating an extension of the main zone mineralization on the north side of 
the DEF fault. This late block faulting is noted throughout the Granite Mountain Batholith and in 
some instances a rotational component is noted as well. Tafti & Mortensen (2004) found the 
Cretaceous Age Tantalus Formation rotated up to 60o from horizontal in areas located south of the 
Minto deposit. A zone of pervasive fracturing on the west side of the deposit limits ore grades in this 
direction. Limited historical drilling west of this structure did intersect some weak copper 
mineralization, foliated horizons do not line up across this fracture zone. It is presumed to be one of 
the north-south faults that are part of the late brittle conjugate set.
While the limits to mineralization on the north and west side are structural in nature, the southern 
limit is an erosion channel cutting below the elevation of the mineralization and thereby removing it. 
This zone of deeper erosion is a paleo-channel that is interpreted to follow another roughly east-west

striking fault. Only on the east side does mineralization appear to peter out and have no obvious 
structural limit.
All mineralized horizons exhibit locally pervasive fracturing (typically chloritic) and therefore 
interpreted to postdate the main copper-sulphide mineralization event. This late 
structural/hydrothermal event may have potential economic significance, as coarse-grained visible 
gold has been logged on these fractures.
7.4  Veining
Veins in the Minto Deposit appear to have been emplaced after the copper sulphide mineralization 
and are therefore not economically significant. The most common veins are very narrow (less than 
30 cm) steeply dipping, simple quartz-feldspar pegmatite veins that often contain cavities that are 
indicative of shallow emplacement. The veins crosscut foliation in the deformation zones and the 
sulphide mineralization, evidence of their post sulpide mineral emplacement. Other types of late 
veins found in the deposit include thin (less than 2 mm) calcite stingers and fracture coatings and 
very rare narrow quartz veins.

8  Deposit Types
This section was taken from Section 10 in “Technical Report (43-101) for the Minto Project” by 
Hatch (August 2006) found on the sedar.com website.
At various times since its discovery the Minto deposit has been described as an example of Porphyry 
Copper, Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide (VMS), Redbed Copper, Magnetite Skarn (see discussion by 
Pearson and Clark, 1979) and Iron Oxide Copper Gold “IOCG”(Minto Explorations Ltd., 2003). 
Based on the preceding paragraph it is reasonable to say that the origin of the Minto deposit is 
enigmatic. Various workers (including the current authors) appear to have ascribed different 
interpretations for the most part based on their empirical observations, the background of the 
observer and the popular models of the day. The abundance of the high Cu/S mineral bornite in a 
moderately oxidized magmatic system along with the obvious magnetite association suggests that 
Minto belongs to one of three recognized deposit types; Alkalic Porphyry Copper; Magnetite Skarn 
or Iron Oxide Copper Gold. The lack of a typical calc-silicate skarn mineral assemblage seems to 
preclude this deposit type. Alternatively it is a previously unrecognized deposit type.
The host rocks to the Minto deposit were emplaced in a deep batholitic setting (exceeding 9 km deep 
to perhaps as much as 18-20 km deep), which is not considered to be the typical porphyry 
environment. The host is a moderately oxidized magma (Tafti and Mortensen, 2004) with 
widespread iron oxide (magnetite and hematite) mineralization. There are very strong structural 
controls on ore mineral emplacement and there is no apparent genetic link to a specific phase of 
intrusion. Typical porphyry-type alteration zoning such as widespread propilitization, argillization; 
barren silicic core, stockwork style mineralization or large barren pyritic halo is not recognized.
Some examples of IOCG mineralization with similar characteristics and setting to Minto include 
Copperstone in Arizona, Caldelaria in Chile and Ernest Henry in Australia (Williams et al., 2005). 
From a genetic and structural prospective, albeit not size wise, the Sossego Deposit in Brazil may be 
a reasonable analog. While an IOCG origin for the Minto Deposit cannot be unequivocally 
demonstrated, the authors are of the opinion that this style of deposit provides the most consistent 
model for our current level of understanding.

9  Mineralization
This section was taken from Section 11 from the “Technical Report (43-101) for the Minto Project” 
by Hatch (August 2006) found on the sedar.com website.  .  For the purposes of this report, the 
original tables and figures numbers have been adapted to this report.
9.1  Mineralization
The Minto Deposit has no surface exposure and the following discussion on the mineralization is 
based on observations made from drill core. The primary sulphide minerals include: chalcopyrite, 
bornite, minor pyrite and rare chalcocite. Silver telluride (hessite) is observed in polished samples 
but has not been logged macroscopically. Native gold and electrum have both been reported as 
inclusions within bornite and accounts for the high gold recoveries in test concentrates. Occasionally, 
coarse free gold is observed associated with the chloritic fractures that cross-cut the sulphide 
mineralization. The free gold may be due to secondary enrichment during a later hydrothermal 
process overprinting the main copper sulphide-gold event.
The deposit exhibits crude zoning from west to east. The bornite zone is dominant in the west and a 
thicker, lower grade chalcopyrite zone is dominant on the east side of the deposit. The bornite zone is 
defined by the metallic mineral assemblage magnetite-chalcopyrite-bornite. Bornite mineralization is 
conspicuous, but chalcopyrite is the dominant sulphide species. Stringers and massive lenses of 
chalcopyrite with various quantities of bornite are typical. Massive mineralization occurs locally 
over intervals exceeding 0.5 m in thickness and semi-massive mineralization over several metres in 
thickness may occur. In these sulphide rich areas, textures often resemble those seen in magmatic 
sulphide zones with sulphide mineralization interstitial to the rock forming silicate minerals.
The higher grade portion of the Minto Deposit roughly corresponds to the bornite zone; local 
concentrations of bornite up to 8% are seen. The precious metal grades are elevated in the bornite 
zone (very fine gold and electrum occur as inclusions in bornite). The chalcopyrite zone is 
characterized by the metallic mineral assemblage chalcopyrite-pyrite +/- very minor bornite. 
Magnetite is absent.
Empirical observations indicate the highest concentrations of bornite are associated with coarse 
grained, disseminated and stringer-style magnetite mineralization, up to 20% by volume locally. The 
stringers of magnetite are often folded or boudinaged, suggesting that at least some of the magnetite 
mineralization predates peak ductile deformation. Sulphide mineralization on the other hand, shows 
both evidence and absence of ductile deformation locally and is interpreted to have formed 
contemporaneous with, to late in the ductile deformation history. Texturally, the sulphide minerals 
occur as disseminations and foliform stringers along foliation planes in the deformed granodiorite 
(i.e. sulphide stringers tend to follow the foliation planes). Sulphide mineral content, however, tends 
to increase where this foliation is disrupted by intense folding, while the thicker, more massive 
mineralization tends to obliterate the foliation altogether.

9.2  Alteration, Weathering and Oxidation
Page 46
Pervasive, strong potassic alteration occurs within the flat lying zones of mineralization. It is 
characterized by elevated biotite contents relative to the massive waste rock and secondary 
k-feldspar overgrowth on plagioclase. Biotite concentrations range up to 30% by volume locally, 
compared to about 5% in waste rock. The contacts between the altered and unaltered rocks are sharp, 
as are the contacts between mineralized rocks and waste rocks.
Silicification is present but not pervasive in the Minto Deposit. It is sporadic within the bornite zone 
(west) and lacking in the chalcopyrite zone (east). The relationship between silicification and the 
mineralization is unclear, due to inconsistent core logging over three decades. Sericite occurs rarely 
and is associated with post-mineral brittle faults or as thin halos around some of the post-mineral 
pegmatite veins.
Copper oxide mineralization found on surface in float and trenches, is the result of supergene 
oxidation processes. This surface mineralization represents either the erosion remnants of foliated 
horizons that are located above the main deposit or is vertical remobilization of copper up late brittle 
faults and fracture zones that intersect primary sulphide mineralization at depth. Malachite is the 
prime mineral in these zones, with secondary chalcocite, minor azurite and rare native copper. The 
mineralization is found as fill and coatings in fractures. The vertical mobilization of copper oxide 
mineralization along late fractures offers an excellent exploration vector to otherwise blind deposits.
In addition to the obvious copper oxide minerals, oxidation is also evident by pervasive iron staining, 
earthy hematite, clay alteration of feldspars and a significant loss in bulk density. The degree and 
distribution of copper oxide minerals appears to be directly related to the depth of the water table. 
For the most part this is confined to about -30 metres but up to -60 metres beneath the surface and is 
generally sub parallel with the present topographic surface. The main zone has experienced relatively 
little oxidation since it is generally more than 60m below the surface except at its southern end where 
it crops out directly beneath unconsolidated overburden in th Minto Creek Valley. Very locally this 
oxidation may be drawn deeper along late brittle faults cutting primary sulfide mineralization.
9.3  Additional Mineralization Targets
The most favourable exploration targets (based on the evaluation of geophysics, soil geochemistry 
and diamond drilling completed by past operators) are summarized below. Targets are identified as 
Ridge Top, Area 2, Airstrip, Connector and DEF are all located within a 2 km by 2 km area, south of 
the DEF fault. MintoEx also sees good exploration potential in the area north of the DEF fault, as 
evidenced by at least two copper showings on surface and multiple coincident soil and magnetic 
anomalies in the area. However further understanding of the geology in this area is required before 
drill targets can be identified and a field assessment of the two copper showings is imperative since 
the historical reports do not appear to agree on the orientation of the mineralized structure. Various 
exploration targets are identified in Figure 10.2.

9.3.1  Ridge Top
This high priority target is one of the best targets currently defined on the Minto Property. The 
eastern half of this target was formerly called Area 3 by past operators. A reinterpretation of the 
airborne magnetic data (flown post-drilling) and historical drill logs suggests that the extent and 
orientation of the target mineralized horizon is much larger than previously suggested. 
Reinterpretation of the 1993 airborne magnetic data indicates that the Ridge Top target is at least 
1100 m long and 250 m wide. Further processing of this data, including a 3-D inversion modeling 
exercise, is recommended. Follow-up detailed ground-based geophysics is also warranted to better 
define the target. Historical drilling in this area was widely spaced and shallow, but still intersected 
two distinct horizons of interest and included several ore grade intercepts. Highlights of this past 
drilling are presented in Table 9.1 below. Previous operators preferred a north-south vector when 
drilling and not the more favorable east west trend associated with the magnetic high anomalies 
(Figure 9.2).

9.3.2  Area 2
Another priority exploration target, Area 2, is located southeast of the Minto Deposit and starts 
approximately 300 m from the proposed ultimate limit of the planned Minto Mine pit floor (Figure 
9.3). Area 2 corresponds to an airborne magnetic anomaly of similar amplitude as characterizes the 
Minto Deposit. The two magnetic anomalies corresponding to the main zone and Area 2 are 
separated by a paleo-erosion channel. In one possible interpretation, the channel follows a late brittle 
fault with left lateral displacement, which would make Area 2 mineralization an extension of the 
main deposit displaced 400 m eastward. Most of the intervening magnetite associated mineralization, 
if it were ever present, would now be eroded off in this paleo-channel. Five historical diamond drill 
holes completed in Area 2 intercepted good grade copper mineralization at a similar elevation as the 
Minto main zone (Table 9.2). The mineralization remains open to the east, west and south on 
multiple levels but has eroded away in the north, in the paleo-channel.
Based on previous drilling, soil sampling and airborne magnetics Area 2 covers an aerial extent of 
approximately 200m by 200m and is a target with potential on par to the main Minto orebody. 
Drilling to date, on the upper two horizons at Area 2, have intersected copper-gold mineralization of 
a similar tenor and located at similar vertical depths below surface as the Minto Deposit. Given the 
similar characteristics to the main Minto orebody and its close proximity to the proposed open pit

mine and mill infrastructure, mining characteristics similar to the Minto Deposit are anticipated. 
Because of the ease of access via existing mine and exploration roads it is relatively easy to drill off 
to resource standards.

Drilling
*Geological modeling shows that the best continuity between drill holes indicates horizontal to sub-
horizontal mineralized horizons.  Therefore the intervals indicated in Table 9.2 are to be near true 
widths.
During the first quarter of 2006, MintoEx completed three diamond drill holes at Area 2, to a depth 
of approximately 350 m. The results were very encouraging with significant copper-gold values over 
vertical extents greater than 220 m including higher grades, similar to the main deposit 
mineralization in multiple, stacked sub-intervals. Significant assay results from holes 06SWC-068, 
06SWC-071 and 06SWC-074 are included in Table 9.3, Table 9.4 and Table 9.5 respectively.

While the mineralization in the higher-grade zones at Area 2 is similar in character, thickness and 
grades to the main deposit, the appreciable thickness of lower grade mineralization between these 
intercepts suggests a much larger mineralized system than predicted by the predominantly shallow 
historical drilling on the target. These initial exploration results are very encouraging and warrant 
immediate follow-up. MintoEx has been conducting resource definition drilling on Area 2 for the 
past three months, with encouraging results, and it hopes to be in a position to estimate a resource for 
Area 2 by the end of 2006.
9.3.3  Copper Keel
Located immediately northeast and east of Ridgetop, (Figure 10.1) Copper Keel is interpreted by 
MintoEx geologists to lie on the axis of a synformal fold defined by broad open folding of the 
subhorizontal deformed ore horizons. It is associated with a north-south oriented, linear magnetic 
anomaly that is relatively strong in tenor despite the deep overburden deposits in the order of 50 to 
70 metres thick in permafrost rich clay that lie above bedrock in that area. Mineralization intersected 
to date is relatively high grade and similar in style to that discovered at Minto Main deposit and at 
Area 2.  Results for the latest hole to be drilled into Copper Keel are presented in Table 9.5.

9.3.4  Airstrip
Formerly identified as Area 3 by the previous operators, this prospect is identified in three diamond 
drill holes located on the flanks of a magnetic anomaly located near the old Minto Project airstrip. 
None of the drill holes adequately tested the magnetic anomaly, which should be a more favorable 
target based on the magnetite-copper-gold association recognized at the main deposit and at Area 2. 
Drilling was completed in 1974, nearly 20 years prior to the airborne magnetic survey. Using this 
exploration model of magnetite-bornite association suggests the best targets remain to be tested.
United Keno Hill geologist Norm Burmeister (pers. comm., 2006) indicated a greater than one  tonne 
boulder of massive sulphide mineralization, comprised mostly of bornite with lesser amounts of 
chalcopyrite and magnetite, was exposed by a bulldozer on the northeast end of the airstrip while it 
was being cleared (Figure 9.3). The presence of bornite-rich boulders at surface is a strong indication 
of insitu bornite-rich rock nearby. The Airstrip target is located in unglaciated terrain, therefore 
transport of the boulder is expected to be minimal and certainly not up slope of other mineralized 
anomalies.
Significant assay results for the Airstrip are presented in Table 9.6.

9.3.5  Connector
The previous operators considered the northern part of the Connector area to be a continuation of the 
Area 2 target. It is now considered to be a separate target, until such time as continuity with Area 2 
can be demonstrated with core drilling. It is being treated as a separate target at a much deeper level 
than the near surface mineralization at Area 2, +200 m below surface vs. 100-120 m below surface in

Area 2. The Connector target is identified in four historical holes tracing the unit over 550 m in an 
east-west direction. A fifth hole (A16-72) failed to intersect the target, as it was not drilled deep 
enough. Connector may be a down-faulted block of mineralization originally related to the Area 2 
upper horizons. Despite the greater depth, the reported gold and copper grades make this an 
attractive drill target (See Table 9.7). Close proximity to Area 2 also provides development options 
that may mitigate its depth if sufficient tonnage could be outlined in both areas. 
Table 9.7: Somme Assay Interval Highlights from Connector Historical Drilling
*Geological modeling shows that the best continuity between drill holes indicates horizontal to sub-
horizontal mineralized horizons.  Therefore the intervals indicated in Table 9.7 are to be near true 
widths.
9.3.6  DEF
This target, which lies along the DEF fault, is currently poorly understood due to the lack of angled 
drill holes in the area. MintoEx favours this area as a drill target as it appears to be an extension of 
the main zone between two splays of the DEF fault zone. The northernmost fault appears to be a 
splay of the southern or main fault zone with the gap between the two widening up toward surface. 
While the extents of the target appear to be limited in the immediate area because of the fault 
geometry, sufficient room exists to warrant follow-up.
The target is open along strike; any information gleaned from this area could help resolve both the 
magnitude and orientation of displacement along DEF fault and vector toward any fault displaced 
portion of the main deposit further to the north.
Significant assay results for the Connector are presented in Table 9.8. 
Table 9.8: Somme Assay Interval Highlights from DEF Area Drilling
* There is insufficient information to model this mineralization therefore the intervals in Table 9.8 
are intersected widths, actual true widths are unknown.

10  Exploration
Mineral exploration on the Minto property has been conducted intermittently since 1971.  
Subsequent to the discovery of the Main deposit, now the producing open pit Minto mine, the 
adjacent southern half of the property has undergone systematic should be considered brownfields 
exploration.  There are currently more than 500 hundred diamond drillholes within a roughly 2 
square kilometre area.  As such, following up on open mineralized horizons in geological models, 
projecting mineralized horizons into areas of little or no drilling and drilling near historical drill hole 
intercepts are the principal exploration tools employed by MintoEx and its geologists.  Subsequent to 
Sherwood Copper’s acquisition of Minto Explorations Ltd. in June 2005, exploration from 2005 to 
2008 has concentrated mostly on diamond drilling however, an extensive historic soil sample survey 
and some ground based geophysics have been conducted and are sometimes useful to guide drilling 
activity. The predominant geophysical methods used are Gradient Array Induced Potential (GAIP) 
and total field magnetics (MAG) on cut grid lines.  Local test surveys of Bouger gravity and HLEM 
over known mineralization proved to be of little use and were not conducted over significant areas.
The focus of exploration since 2006 involves systematic exploration of the property area south of the 
current open pit mine in a south-southeast striking trend MintoEx calls the Priority Exploration 
Corridor (PEC).  In a cycle of discovery and definition, new deposits have now been identified by 
diamond drilling three separate areas, outside of the original or Main Minto deposit that was known 
when the project was acquired in 2005; the new deposits include Area 2 discovered in 2006, Area 
118 discovered in 2007 and Ridgetop drilled for the first time by MintoEx in 2007 In 2008 drilling at 
Copper Keel (Figure 10.1) following up a discovery hole from 2006 confirmed the presence of high 
grade copper-gold mineralization associated with a large magnetic anomaly there. The 2008 drill 
intercepts coupled with the magnetic response significantly upgrades this target and warrants further 
diamond drilling.
A brief chronological summary of work conducted on the property is contained in the history section 
of this report and is described in the “Technical Report (43-101) for the Minto Project” by Hatch 
(August 2006) and “Area 2 Pre-feasibility Study Minto Mine, Yukon” (November 2007) found on 
the sedar.com website.

While exploration since 2005 has benefited from geophysical surveying, principally GAIP and 
MAG, the main exploration tool used by MintoEx is following up on 3D geological models and 
interpretations constructed largely in house or in conjunction with the Company’s consultants. 
Follow-up drilling to pursue vectors identified in these models or open mineralization in sparsely 
spaced historical holes has been a successful strategy for resource expansion at Minto.  Due to the 
highly visual nature of the mineralization, drilling can be guided by immediate visual estimates of 
mineralization rather than waiting to obtain assay results.  The company takes advantage of this to 
minimize time lags between drill programs, thereby reducing costs and aggressively pursuing 
opportunities for resource expansion. This has allowed MintoEx to run extended drill programs to 
advance new drill discoveries rapidly to NI43-101 resource standards. Since 2005 MintoEx has 
increased NI43-101 resources by 140% and reserves by 43%. The lower increase in reserves is due 
to the resource being updated to incorporate two year’s worth of exploration drilling (2006-07), 
whereas the reserve has only been updated to incorporate one year’s exploration results (2006).
Starting in 2005 MintoEx concentrated on compiling historical data acquired with the purchase of 
the property and on conducting confirmatory drilling on the main resource area, now the current 
open pit Minto mine.  Upon acquiring the property, MintoEx initiated a data compilation and 
conversion exercise using MapInfo Professional 8.0 and Gems 5.5, followed up with two separate 
diamond drill programs.  The drill programs were largely confirmatory and infill, within the resource 
limits, to test the geological model and to facilitate resource calculations.  Some exploration drilling 
was also conducted on targets located south of and west of the deposit.
Considerable care was taken to level various sets of analog data to one single datum (UTM NAD83 
Zone 8) to build a GIS project.  The Gems database was converted from the old mine grid based 
system in imperial units to metric units based on the UTM NAD83 Zone 8 datum.  In March 2006, a 
test program of combined ground-based total field magnetic and gravity surveying was conducted 
over and around the Minto Deposit before mining commences.  The intent was to establish a 
geophysical signature to use as an analog model for future exploration on the property.
Subsequent to the deposit discovery at the Minto Main Deposit, ASARCO had discovered 
potentially interesting copper – gold mineralization approximately 500 m to the south of the Main 
deposit in 1974.  While the premise for drilling at this location is not known, it appears from the 
distribution of the drill holes ASARCO was continuing a step out program started in 1973 to explore 
south of their Main discovery. Three East-West orientated drill fences with holes spaced roughly 118 
m (400ft) apart on the sections were executed.  Several shallow holes completed in 1973 intersected 
narrow intercepts of anomalous to low grade mineralization while the deeper holes (200-300m) 
located on the southernmost of the drill sections in 1974 intersected much higher copper – gold 
grades but more than 200m below surface. This was well below the Main deposit horizon.
These “deep” intersections are located on the south margin of what was subsequently defined as the 
current Area 2 resource, discovered by Sherwood in 2006.  One can only assume that, because the 
shallow holes had sub-economic results, it was believed at the time that the potential for

Page 57
mineralization at similar elevations to the emerging Main deposit immediately to the north was 
adequately tested. However, one hole drilled a year later in 1974, A138-74, actually did intersect all 
of the potential ore zones subsequently defined by Sherwood; presumably the ASARCO geologists 
failed to recognize its significance in light of the poor results from the shallow drilling from 1973.
In the early 1990’s, MintoEx certainly believed the potential for significant copper – gold 
mineralization on similar elevations to their proposed open pit mine had been adequately tested south 
of the known deposit; they too had failed to recognize the significance of drill hole A138-74.  
Coupled with the misconception the area was thought to be too deeply oxidized to be of serious 
exploration interest for primary sulphide ore (Lutz Klingman Pers. Comm. 2006) and despite 
positive results from an airborne total field magnetic survey, the target remained untested for yet 
another decade until Sherwood acquired MintoEx and the project in 2005.
Sherwood geologists could find no clear evidence in the ASARCO drill logs to support the 
assumption of deep oxidation south of the Main deposit and reappraised the region in early 2006 
after completing a NI43-101 compliant resource model for Main.  This new resource model 
suggested the Main deposit should project southward across, the Minto Creek valley, into the area 
now known to host the Area 2 deposit. A subsequent examination of the historical drilling in the area 
also clearly showed the area was not adequately tested on the elevations of the Main deposit.  
Sherwood geologists hypothesized that the shallow ASARCO holes which intersected anomalous to 
low grade copper mineralization north of the deeper Area 2 mineralization, stopped just above the 
top of the Minto Main deposit horizon and that A138-74 had, in fact, tested and intersected the 
“Minto” ore horizon.  The significance of this hole had escaped both the ASARCO and subsequent 
MintoEx geologists, presumably because of the poor results in the shallow drill holes A76-73 and 
A77-73, located about half way between A138- 74 and the Main deposit, and because of the 
erroneous assumption of deep oxidation.  Unbeknownst to both ASARCO in the 1970’s and 
MintoEx in the 1990’s, the shallow ASARCO drill holes A76-73 and A77-73 had stopped just above 
the main Area 2 resource horizons, so it remained undiscovered for more than three decades despite 
sitting less than 250 metres from the principal deposit discovered in the early 1970’s.  However, 
based upon the projection of the resource model and upon the presence of a significant total field 
magnetic high in the 1993 Sander Airborne magnetic survey, completed nearly two decades after the 
ASARCO drilling, Sherwood geologists considered the target area to have considerable exploration 
potential at shallow depths.  The deeper potential was also apparent.
In February 2006, while finishing up a second phase of ore delineation drilling at Main, the 
hypothesis, postulating the 1973 ASARCO drilling had stopped above the top of the Minto deposit 
horizon projected southward, was tested.  Drill hole 06SWC-068 was collared into the centre of a 
magnetic high anomaly, approximately 135 m south of the short ASARCO drill holes and 
approximately 60 m west of A138-74.  The drill hole intersected multiple mineralized layers to a 
total depth of 395 m, including five intervals considered significant.  This hole was immediately 
followed up with two others; 06SWC-71 and 06SWC -74, located to the northeast and north, 
respectively, of 06SWC-68.  When both of these holes also intersected high grade copper 
mineralization, MintoEx realized a significant discovery of primary sulphide mineralization,

proximal to the Main Deposit and at similar relative elevations and depths beneath surface.  Follow-
up drilling of 76 holes, for a total of 79, in 2006 delineated the mineral resource used in the 
November 30, 2007 PFS.  Subsequent drilling in 2007 significantly expanded the Area 2 
mineralization, as detailed in the new resource estimates contained herein.
In 2006, exploration begin in earnest after the discovery at Area 2 less that 0.5km south of the 
Minto mine orebody, by then the subject of a feasibility study.  Area 2 was subsequently drilled to a 
standard sufficient to support a resource calculation for a PFS, which was completed in November 
2007.
Spanning 2006-2007, a program of Gradient Array Induced Potential (GAIP) surveying and total 
field magnetic surveying was completed by Aurora Geosciences of Whitehorse, Yukon, over much 
of the property considered to have the highest exploration potential.  The GAIP survey identified 
chargeability anomalies directly associated with known copper-gold deposits at several locations, 
confirming its usefulness.  Several additional GAIP anomalies in previously undrilled to sparsely 
drilled areas were drill tested, and further discoveries were made, such as those at Airstrip SW and 
Copper Keel South.  Likewise, discrete magnetic anomalies are associated with mineralization at 
Minto Main deposit, Area 2; Area 118 and Ridgetop East and West.  Coincident GAIP and MAG 
anomalies are considered high priority drill targets.  Most of these anomalies have now been tested in 
the southern half of the property, south of the DEF fault and are associated with significant new 
mineral resources.  Several coincident chargeability/magnetic anomalies and some either just 
chargeability or just magnetic anomalies located north of the DEF remain to be tested.  Significant 
areas of the property are overburden filled valleys with permafrost conditions and cannot be easily 
penetrated by GAIP surveying, presumably due to poor coupling with the frozen ground.  The GAIP 
surveying method is discussed in more detail in section 10.1 below.
In 2007, exploration concentrated on Area 118, located west of and contiguous with Area 2, where 
Area 118 was identified as a possible extension of Area 2, based upon the resource model completed 
At the end of 2006.  Several additional targets, located near the south claim boundary were chosen 
because preliminary geological modelling, using very wide spaced historical drill holes, suggested a 
large untested area held significant exploration potential and was associated with several broad GAIP 
anomalies.  New high grade copper-gold discoveries were subsequently made by drilling in 2007 at 
Area 118, Airstrip and Copper Keel South.  Also in 2007 Ridgetop (ASARCO’s original Area 1) was 
drill tested on a wide spaced basis in support of a preliminary resource estimate.  Magnetic and 
GAIP data were used to guide drilling for the preliminary model.
Drilling in 2007 was conducted in a two phase program, Phase I from February to April and Phase II 
from May to October.  The objectives for the 2007 exploration program were partly to further define 
the limits of the Area 2 deposit, test for its extension into Area 118 and to provide technical 
information for the Area 2 pre-feasibility study.  A significant second component of the 2007 
program was to broadly test a wide swath of the Minto property south of the Area 2 deposit and to 
test a narrow corridor north of Area 2 between the Main and Area 2 deposits.  These are all areas

where various combinations of information from prior drilling, geophysics and MintoEx’s geological 
interpretation suggested potential for the discovery of further high grade copper-gold mineralization.
2007 exploration drilling focused on nine separate exploration target areas.  One hundred and one 
exploration and geotechnical drill holes were completed, 28 more than originally planned in the 2007 
budget.  Due to positive results, the drill program was expanded from the budgeted 16,500 metres to 
23,618 metres by program’s end, approximately a 40% increase over the planned metres.  Significant 
new copper-gold mineralization was discovered at Gap, Copper Keel S. and Airstrip SW, while Area 
118 was expanded from a localized historic drill hole occurrenceto a fully fledged discovery of a 
new copper-gold deposit.
Subsequent geological and resource block modelling conducted in 2007 – 2008 showed that the 
Area 2 and Area 118 deposits are continuous through a zone of transition between the two deposit 
areas.  Much of what was initially considered to be Area 118 during the exploration drilling period 
was subsequently reassigned in the model to Area 2.  This distinction was made on the basis of 
geological continuity and similarity of copper-gold grades.  The joint model was completed in 2008 
and a new NI43-101 resource calculation was released for both deposits on June 17, 2008; discussed 
in detail in Section 17 of this report.
MintoEx geologists reassessed the Ridgetop area in 2007 (ASARCO’s original Area 1 discovery 
area) and drilled twenty-five new diamond drill holes, following up on sixteen historical holes from 
the 1970’s and early 1990’s.  The subsequent interpretation and drill density allowed for the 
completion of a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate for Ridgetop East.  No prior NI43-101 
compliant resource estimate for Ridgetop had been calculated, despite it being the original discovery 
area at Minto. The NI43-101 resource calculation for Ridgetop is discussed in greater detail in 
Section 17 of this report. It should be noted that subsequent to that mineral resource estimation 
discussed in Section 17 a further 47 drilled holes have been completed in the Ridgetop area. A new 
mineral resource estimation is expected to be completed in Q1 of 2009.
Company geologists proposed, in 2006, that the separate prospects and deposits mentioned above 
comprise a single large continuous to contiguous mineralized system that has subsequently been 
deformed; openly folded and cut by late regional faults (some with vertical displacements and some 
with inferred lateral displacements).  The sum of MintoEx’s drilling and geological modelling to date 
since 2005 continues to support the single system thesis and ongoing exploration work in 2008 and 
beyond will focus on creating a unified geological model for the property south of the DEF fault.
Projecting 3D geological models, based on drill hole data into untested areas and then following up 
on promising targets, remains the most important exploration tool at Minto.  Most exploration work 
in 2008 is concentrated on infill drilling followed by stepping out from the Area 118/Area 2 deposit 
and Ridgetop deposits.  Infill drilling will yield a statistically more robust resource calculation, 
potentially supporting future PFS studies, while step-out drilling will test for further extensions of 
the deposits.

Early in 2008, a limited program of drilling in the overburden filled upper area of the Minto Creek 
valley identified several previously unknown areas of copper-gold mineralization now considered 
prospective.  These discoveries are totally blind to surface, not discernable with GIAP surveys, have 
very muted magnetic high signatures and are essentially wildcat discoveries.  Geological modelling 
at the western edge of the Priority Exploration Corridor (“PEC”) at West Ridgetop and the western 
margins of Area 118, suggested the mineralized horizons may continue westward and dip beneath 
upper Minto Creek, expanding the PEC.
Drilling continues in 2008 with the aim of increasing the drill hole density at Area 118 and Ridgetop 
and to conduct step-out exploration in both areas where the 2007 drilling had not closed off the 
deposits.  The discovery of three new high grade copper-gold deposits in 2007 and several other 
significant drill prospects attests to the validity of the exploration methods being used at the Minto 
Mine by Sherwood Copper and its subsidiary MintoEx.

The 2007 survey was completed on ten separate blocks expanding upon the 2006 survey area to 
provide near seamless coverage over a total area of approximately 10 km2.  Areas with extensive 
mining activity or infrastructure could not be surveyed.  The 2007 GAIP program was much more 
extensive than the 2006 pilot survey because drilling of the chargeability anomalies generated in the 
2006 survey was positive.  The GAIP survey showed a coincidence of significant copper sulphide 
mineralization with chargeability anomalies and suggested Sherwood had developed an additional 
exploration tool for prioritizing exploration drill targets.
The focus of the 2007 geophysical program was two-fold.  Firstly, to evaluate areas south of the 
main Minto deposit, expanding coverage into areas of known prospectivity that was not covered in 
the 2006 program.  Secondly, to begin evaluating areas north of the Minto mine, where there are 
multiple coincident copper-in-soil and magnetic anomalies, but very little core drilling.  After 
positive drill results were obtained late in the drill program on a changeability anomaly, located at 
the Airstrip SW and Copper Keel prospects on the southern limit of the 2006 survey area, a decision 
was made to expand the GAIP survey to an area south of the drill discovery.
The additional survey at Airstrip-Copper Keel defined a large chargeability anomaly in an 
under-explored region located to the south of the diamond drilling.  This area was previously thought 
to be not prospective due to the presence of Cretaceous Age cover rocks.  These cover rocks are 
thought to represent a significant down throw and burial of the prospective host Jurassic Age 
granodiorite.  The new drilling had indicated the cover sequence was shallower than expected and 
granodiorite is locally exposed beneath overburden in small erosion windows through the 
conglomerate.  Recent drill discoveries of high-grade copper-gold mineralization at Airstrip and 
Copper Keel are on the northern edge of a much larger chargeability feature than shown by the 2006 
GAIP survey, suggesting additional potential beyond the range of recent drilling.  Because the 
survey data was not received in time to build the necessary road and pad infrastructure over this 
permafrost region for drill testing in the current season, this large chargeability anomaly remains a 
high priority drill target for 2008.

Several other chargeability anomalies identified in the 2007 GAIP survey are located to the north of 
the main Minto Main open pit mine, indicating exploration potential north of the mine.  This is an 
area where total field magnetic data and soil geochemistry indicate a prospective exploration 
environment but it has had only very cursory exploration drilling by past operators.  Two anomalies 
identified in the 2007 program include a strong east-west linear chargeability feature located 
approximately 600 metres north of the Main pit and the very large horseshoe shaped anomaly to the 
northeast of the Main pit.  The latter lies immediately north of the all weather project access road.  
Both targets are associated with total field magnetic highs and positive copper-in–soil geochemistry. 
These anomalies are also priority drill targets for future exploration drill programs.
Not all anomalies have produced positive results.  A chargeability anomaly from the 2006 GAIP 
survey was drill tested in 2007 with negative results.  No significant copper-gold mineralization was 
encountered despite the intersection of multiple, thick sequences of foliated favourable host rock.  
Minor pyrite and trace chalcopyrite was sporadically encountered in four drill holes but it is believed 
that the low concentration of this mineralization does not satisfactorily explain the chargeability 
results.
Despite excellent correlation of copper-gold mineralization with GAIP anomalies at other locations 
on the Minto property, the survey does not yield a unique correlation with high grade mineralization.  
The GAIP survey is a tool that is more efficient when used in conjunction with other corroborating 
data suggestive of buried mineral deposits.  For example, at Copper Keel and Airstrip, direct 
targeting of GAIP anomalies was considered instrumental in their discoveries.  However, at Ridgetop 
and Area 2/Area 118, breaks in the GAIP and Magnetic anomalies were helpful in inferring some 
limiting structures but the projection of nearby 3D models and previous drilling provided the 
strongest rationale for 2007 drilling.
Drilling in 2008 has shown that the GAIP method is less effective in areas of deep overburden with 
variable permafrost conditions.  Three new areas of mineralization were discovered in the Upper 
Minto Creek Valley under permafrost bearing overburden in areas that did not show any significant 
GAIP anomalies.  Total Field Magnetic data was of some use in these areas, but drilling magnetic 
anomalies also produced inconsistent results.  Future success in areas of deep overburden will rely 
heavily on geological modelling.

In 2007 MintoEx drilled a total of 23,618 metres in 101 diamond drill holes at Minto, Area 2, 
Area 118, Ridgetop Deposits and at various other prospects.  Drilling was conducted between 
February 17 and October 12, 2007 by Cabo Drilling (Pacific) Corp. of Surrey, BC under the direct 
supervision of MintoEx and Sherwood Copper Corporation staff geologists. The results of this 
drilling were used in the mineral resource estimations discussed below and herein.
A total of 74 holes for 16,749 metres of the 2007 drilling were incorporated into the four resource 
models described in this report.  The remaining 27 holes for 6,869 metres were drilled at exploration 
prospects outside of these resource models.  The median length of 2007 MintoEx drill holes is 243 
metres (average 231 metres), with the shallowest hole being 51 metres in length and the deepest, 426 
metres. MintoEx Diamond drill holes by year and deposit, from 2005 through 2007, are summarized 
in Table 11.2. Figures 11.1 to 11.3 show wireframes of the various mineralized zones.

In 2007, MintoEx drilled 5 drill holes (754 m) into the Minto deposit (see Figure 17.1).  The drilling 
comprises 3 angled HQ holes (293 m) and 2 vertical NQ holes (462 m).  Hole length ranges from 
89 m to 362 m. The median drill length was 99 m; average drill length was 151 m. These drill holes 
were used to update the resource estimate originally prepared in 2006.
The Area 2 resource estimation incorporates 2007 drilling within Area 2, drill holes connecting 
Area 118 to Area 2 and 21 drillholes completed by ASARCO in the 1970’s that were not included in 
the previous estimation (SRK, 2007).  In 2007, 7672 m in 26 vertical NQ drill holes and 493 m in 2 
angled NQ holes were drilled.  The Area 2 drill holes drilled in 2007 range from 127 m to 426 m in 
length, with a median length of 322 m and an average length of 295 m.  5 drill holes of the 26 are 
also used in the resource estimation for Area 118.  A total of 19 vertical holes and 2 angled holes 
drilled by ASARCO in 1973 and 1974 were included in the resource estimation. Drill holes used in 
the resource are shown in Figure 10.1.  The size of the historical ASARCO drill core was not 
recorded but is believed to be BQ size, based on observation of core found in core storage sheds 
destroyed by forest fire.  Drill collars are spaced at approximately 28 m centers on a northeast 
striking grid.

At Area 118, MintoEx drilled a total of 6,437 metres in 23 vertical diamond drill holes between 
June 4 and October 12, 2007. The drill core size was NQ.  The median length of the drill holes was 
279 metres (average 280 metres).  The shallowest hole was 215 metres long and deepest hole was 
383 metres. The 23 drill holes include 5 drill holes (1,546 m) also used in the Area 2 resource 
estimation. Five vertical holes (1,391 m) drilled by ASARCO in 1974 were included in the Area 118 
resource estimate.  ASARCO core is assumed to be BQ.  Drill hole collars are spaced approximately 
every 60 m.  Mineralized zones, shown in Figure 11.2, undulate and dip shallowly to the northwest.

At East Ridgetop, MintoEx drilled a total of 3,432 metres in 25 vertical diamond drill holes from 
May 26 to October 7, 2007.  The size of the MintoEx drill core is NQ.  The median length of 2007 
East Ridgetop drill holes is 129 metres (average 135 metres); the shallowest hole was 55 metres long 
and the deepest hole was 216 metres.  One vertical hole (150 m) and three angled holes (468 m) 
drilled by ASARCO in 1971 and three angled holes (410 m) drilled in 1972 were included in the 
resource. Size of the ASARCO drill core is assumed to be BQ. In 1994, four vertical holes (520 m) 
and five angled holes (654 m) of HQ-sized core were drilled; these holes were used in the resource 
estimate.  Drill hole collars are spaced at approximately 40 to 60 m centres.  Mineralized zones are 
sub-horizontal, dipping shallowly to the east.

All drilling for MintoEx since 2005 was completed using the imperial system and footages were 
converted to metres by MintoEx personnel who logged and recorded all data in metres.  Drill hole 
collar locations were initially located using a differential GPS unit and more precise location 
coordinates were surveyed after completion of drilling by the Minto Mine survey team.
Acid tests were performed at the end of each hole from February to July 2007; longer holes often had 
additional acid tests at various depths down the hole. However, all but 4 of 29 drill holes, where acid 
tests were used to determine downhole dip deviations, were vertical.  Minimal deviations were the 
norm in all holes. From July to October 2007, downhole surveys were performed using a FLEXIT 
tool.  Although local magnetite concentrations sometimes prevented measurement of azimuth 
deviations, the tool overall provided realistic readings showing minor deviation in azimuth and dip.  
Mineralized intervals measured in the vertical drill holes are believed to represent very close to the 
true widths of mineralized layers within the deposit because of the sub-horizontal attitude of the 
mineralized zones.
The core was transported from the drill rig to the logging facility by the drilling contractor, where 
MintoEx personnel logged it for geology; sampling and geotechnical purposes.  Geological data, 
including lithology, structure, alteration and mineralization was recorded for all drill holes.  All drill 
core was photographed for easy reference when constructing geological models for resource 
estimation.
Geotechnical data was collected on all drill holes in 2007, including RQD, core recovery, fracture 
density and orientation, hardness and joint data.  Orientation data for individual joints and structures

was not measured as most holes were drilled vertically, but the approximate alpha angle was 
recorded.  Recovery was typically very good to excellent.
Magnetic susceptibility data was also collected for each drill hole in 2007.  No direct correlation 
between the degree of magnetic susceptibility and grades of mineralization can be made, but a 
marked increase in the magnetic susceptibility is noted in mineralized intervals.  This is not 
surprising since increased magnetite content is frequently logged in all mineralized horizons. 
However, magnetite is often more pervasive than sulphide mineralization and magnetite 
concentrations are not directly proportional to copper grade.  Elevated levels of magnetite are found 
within the mineralized horizons, but where sulphide mineralization has a sharp transition from 
foliated to unfoliated domains, magnetite alteration can persist, although at much lower 
concentrations into unmineralized domains.  In some instances, the presence of hematite or 
hematite/magnetite combinations in unmineralized domains corresponds to brittle structures, 
suggesting some remobilization of iron after mineralization and is thought to be due largely to 
supergene processes.  In such case, the magnetic susceptibility readings are muted somewhat.
Sample intervals were marked on the core and a cut line was drawn with a china marker for the 
diamond saw cutter to follow.  Half of the core was placed in a sample bag and the other half was 
returned to the core box.  Sample intervals were nominally taken at 1.5 m in the mineralized zones, 
with three samples taken into the waste contact.  Waste material between mineralized zones was 
sampled at 3 m intervals to avoid gaps in assay data.  Sample intervals from the vertical holes 
approximate the true width of the mineralized zones.  Sampling results are described in detail in 
subsequent sections.
Bulk density measurements were taken from all holes drilled in 2007 in both mineralized and waste 
material.  Measurements were taken at approximately 3 m intervals in ore, corresponding to 
1 measurement per run in strongly mineralized material, 1 every 5 m in poorly mineralized material 
and at least 1 measurement every 20-30 m in waste.  Pieces of core were weighed both in air and in 
water using an Ohaus triple beam balance.  Spot checks on the field data were undertaken internally 
by MintoEx, where 121 samples from 100 drill holes were analyzed.  Measurements were recorded 
on a triple beam scale on the same piece of core that was originally measured.  Bulk density 
measurements obtained prior to 2005 were not used in the resource estimations.
For additional information regarding drilling and bulk density measurements obtained prior to 2007 
for the Minto and Area 2 deposits, please refer to Section 7 in “Technical Report (43-10 1) for the 
Minto Project” by Hatch (August 2006) and to Section 11 in “Area 2 Pre-feasibility Study Minto

12  Sampling Method and Approach
12.1  1973 to 2001
The sampling programs in place for the historical samples were implemented by geological 
employees of large Canadian, American and International mining companies.  No reports or data 
detailing the sampling methods, analyses methods, quality control measures or security procedures 
used by the previous lessee companies were available to the authors for review and verification 
during the time of this report preparation.
Based on the information available, most of the samples sent for analysis were obtained by splitting 
the core using a mechanical wheel core splitter (in contrast to a diamond saw in 2005-2007).  In the 
case of two holes drilled in 1993 for metallurgical grinding testing, the entire core through the 
mineralized interval was utilized to improve the validity and reliability of the metallurgical tests and 
hence no assay data are available.
In the early drilling, sample intervals were consistently 1.5 m or 3 m long, except in areas of 
complicated geology or contacts.  The 2001 drill program utilized a 1.5 m sample interval, with 
smaller samples taken at contacts or mineralization variations.  The mineralization is quite obvious 
and contacts between mineralized and non-mineralized material are generally sharp.
In the deposit, the intensity of sulphide mineralization is generally consistent and evenly distributed, 
so no inadvertent biasing of the results, depending on what part of the core was sampled, is expected.
12.2  2005 to 2006 (MintoEx)
The mineralized intervals intersected in core have been sampled in lengths ranging from 0.3 m to 3.0 
m and averaging 1 m to 1.5 m.  The sampling intervals are typically 1.5 m in mineralized material 
and 3 m in longer waste intervals within the mineralized zones.  Two shoulder samples are taken in 
waste at both the upper and lower contacts, consisting of a 1.5 m sample and a 1 m sample.  Samples 
do not cross geological contacts.  The author believes this approach is sound and is appropriate for 
this style of mineralization and the objectives of the program.
MintoEx analyzed 1,391 sawn core samples in 2005 and 1,354 in 2006.  The samples were tagged 
and then split in half using a rock saw on site.  One half of the core was put into sample bags and 
then packaged into rice bags with security zip seals and sent to Vancouver for assaying.  Manitoulin 
Transport was used to send the samples by ground in 2005 and Air North was commissioned in 2006 
to air freight the samples.  The remaining core was returned to the boxes and remains on site as a 
record of the hole.

In 2005 and 2006, the core was photographed after the sample tags were stapled to the boxes at the 
downhole end of each sample.  Sample tags for standards were also stapled to the box in the order 
they were taken.
12.3  2007 (MintoEx)
The mineralized intervals in core were sampled in lengths ranging from 0.24 m to 3.49m and 
averaging 1.33 m with a median of 1.5 m from 7,450 sawn core samples.  Sampling intervals were 
typically 1.5 m in mineralized material and 3 m in longer waste intervals between mineralized zones. 
Drill core assay samples were collected from all foliated granodiorite horizons and, typically, 
sampling extended into the surrounding massive, unfoliated and unmineralized rock for at least 
3 metres.  Individual samples do not cross the geological boundary between foliated and unfoliated 
rock which is generally a sharp contact.  The sampling methodology is appropriate for this style of 
mineralization.
In 2007, MintoEx cut 9,386 core samples by diamond saw, located on site adjacent to the exploration 
camp.  One half of the core was put into sample bags and then packaged into large rice bags with 
security zip seals and transported to the laboratory for assaying.  From July 5 to 15, 2007, 
485 samples were transported by truck to SGS Laboratories (under contract agreement) at the Minto 
Mine Site, Yukon for assaying for copper and silver.  Lab capacity was unsuited to a large, ongoing 
influx of exploration samples so no further samples were submitted.  The coarse rejects for the 485 
samples and sawn core for all subsequent samples were sent to ALS Chemex in Terrace for 
processing, and on to Vancouver for assaying and ICP multi-element analysis.  Samples were 
transported initially to Whitehorse by Small’s Expediting Ltd and then to Vancouver or Terrace by 
bonded carrier; either Manitoulin Transport or Air North Ltd. The remaining half of the core was 
returned to the wooden boxes and remains on site as a record of the hole.
Drill core was photographed after the sample tags were stapled to the boxes at the down hole end of 
each sample. Sample tags for standards were also stapled to the box in the order they were taken.

13  Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security
The information in this Section 13 applies only to Area 2, Area 118 and Ridgetop.  For additional 
information regarding sample preparation, analyses and security prior to 2007 for the Minto and 
Area 2 deposits, please refer to the “Technical Report (43-10 1) for the Minto Project” by Hatch 
(August 2006) and to the “Area 2 Pre-feasibility Study Minto Mine, Yukon” (November 2007) found 
on the sedar.com website.
13.1  Historic Samples
13.1.1 ASARCO 1971 to 1974
There are no detailed descriptions of the historical sampling methods used by ASARCO, however, 
based on observations, it is thought that they favoured 5 and 10 foot long samples.  It should be 
noted that there are very few ASARCO holes in the resource and all of them have nearby MintoEx 
holes so the effect of the ASARCO data on the resource calculation is very limited.
Little is known about the sampling protocols and quality control procedures used for the ASARCO 
drill holes.  No usable core survives from that period. It is inevitable that company employees would 
be involved in this process but the exact involvement or names of these ASARCO employees is 
unknown (other than the project manager F.T. Graybeal who is an advisor to Sherwood Copper).  It 
is not known whether officers or directors of ASARCO were involved in the sample preparation but 
is considered unlikely, given the minor nature of the project. Subsequent sample preparation such as 
crushing, pulverizing and sample splitting would have been the responsibility of the laboratory.
Chemex in Vancouver is believed to have been responsible for the 1970s analyses (Simpson, 2002). 
At the time, copper analyses were typically performed by digesting a 2 g sample pulverized to 100 
mesh, in perchloric and nitric acid with an AA finish.  Modern practices use a 0.4 g 150 mesh 
samples and aqua regia digestion.  Gold analyses in the 1970’s probably used a 10 g pulp digested in 
aqua regia and an AA finish.  Electronic microbalances and improvements in AA analysis have 
combined to reduce detection limits in the past 25 years.
Some of the early samples were not analyzed for precious metals.  Most samples were analyzed 
solely for total copper.  The result is an incomplete data set in terms of gold and silver.  Copper 
oxide mineralization is confined typically to the upper level of the deposit and, historically, 
non-sulphide copper was not universally quantified by analysis of soluble copper.
13.1.2 TECK 1993 to 2001
From 1993 to 2001, TECK (now part of Teck Cominco) drilled 48 diamond drill holes on the Minto 
property.

Page 73
Eight 1993, two 1999 and five 2001 drill holes are included in the drill hole database for the Minto 
main deposit, now a producing open pit.  Nine 1994 drill holes are included in the drill hole database 
for the Ridgetop East project area.  The nine holes are located in the southern half of the Ridgetop 
East resource area; MintoEx drill holes are located 39 m to 118 m from the mineralized intersections.
Sample lengths vary from 0.55 m to 2.75 m, averaging 1.59 m with a median of 1.53 m.
Sampling protocols used for the TECK drill holes were not well documented.  The historic samples 
would likely have been prepared on site from split core under the supervision of TECK and MintoEx 
geologists, bagged and shipped to the laboratory. As in 1974, it is assumed company employees 
would be involved in the sampling process but the author does not know the exact involvement or 
their names other than the project manager, F.T. Graybeal. It is considered unlikely officers or 
directors of TECK or MintoEx were involved in sample preparation.  Subsequent sample preparation 
such as crushing, pulverizing and sample splitting would have been the responsibility of the 
laboratory.
Northern Analytical Services of Whitehorse, Yukon conducted the analyses for copper, gold and 
silver.  Analytical methods are not documented in the certificates of analysis for this work, but are 
believed to be equivalent to the methods listed on the certificates for check analysis performed by 
Chemex, detailed below.  Non-sulphide copper was not initially quantified by analysis of soluble 
copper at Northern Analytical Services.
At the completion of the 1994 drilling campaign, 10 samples ranging in grade from 0.77% to 18.00% 
copper were submitted to Chemex for check analysis.  The copper analyses were performed by 
digesting a 0.4 g sample pulverized to 150 mesh, in reverse aqua regia digestion with an AA finish. 
Gold analysis on all check samples was initially performed using the half-assay ton fire assay 
method with an AA finish.  The gold analyses were subsequently re-assayed using a one-assay ton 
fire assay with AA finish and one-assay ton fire assay with gravimetric finish; results were found to 
be comparable. Silver analysis was performed using reverse aqua regia digestion and 
AA determination.
Bondar-Clegg of North Vancouver carried out the analyses of the 2001 samples. Each sample was 
coarse analysis, a 0.25 gm sample was digested with HCL, HNO3, HCLO4 and HF acids with final 
copper determination by AA Spectroscopy. Gold and silver were determined by fire assay using a 30 
gm sample and AA finish.
No useable mineralized intersections of the 1994 TECK Ridgetop East drill holes remain on-site.  A 
few stacks of 1994 core were discovered at the old location of the Minto Exploration camp site and 
at the Yukon Geoscience core library but the bottom of the holes containing mineralized intervals 
were not present.  No other useable drill core from the 1993 to 2001 period remains on-site.
Quality control procedures used in during the 1993 to 2001 drill programs are not known.  The 2001 
sample shipments were accompanied by 4 types of quality control samples, namely: a blank 
(granodiorite from the site), an ASARCO coarse standard, prepared pulp samples and duplicate splits

(coarse ground rejects and the pulverized rejects). Some of the blanks were placed immediately 
following a rich copper sample and they returned trace amounts of Cu. This could possibly indicate 
minor contamination during the sample preparation process, but the amount of contamination was 
deemed insignificant (Simpson, 2001). All of the other quality control measures produced acceptable 
repeatability (Simpson, 2001) verifying the results of the 2001 drilling.
Information regarding security of samples, as required in NI 43-101, was not documented during the 
1993 to 2001 drill programs.
13.1.3 MintoEx 2005 and 2006 Samples
During 2005 and 2006, drill core samples, blanks and duplicates were submitted to the Vancouver 
Chemex laboratory for copper and gold analysis in North Vancouver, Canada.  In 2005, all samples 
were processed in Vancouver.  In 2006, some samples were processed at other Chemex locations. 
Chemex-Elko, NV, USA processed 9% of the total number of samples and Chemex-Thunder Bay, 
ON processed 11%.
The samples submitted to Chemex were first crushed in a jaw crusher to reduce the material to 
greater than 70% -10 mesh (2 mm). A 100 to 250 g subsample was then split and pulverized to better 
than 85% passing -75 μm.
Copper was determined through four acid digestion method (HF, HNO3, HCLO4 digestion and HCL 
leach) with final copper determination by atomic absorption spectroscopy (“AAS”).  Non-sulphide 
copper was analyzed using sulphuric acid leach with AAS determination.
Gold was determined by one assay-tonne fire assay analysis.  During 2005, all sample analysis was 
completed by gravimetric finish.  During 2006, the first 17% (1,955) of the sample analysis was 
completed by gravimetric finish.  For the remaining samples (9,182), the gold analysis was 
determined using AAS method. Silver was analyzed using aqua regia digestion and AAS finish.
All samples were accompanied by Standard Reference Material (“SRM”) samples, blank samples 
and pulp and coarse reject duplicates to ensure the quality of the assay results are acceptable for 
resource estimation purposes and public disclosure.  Blank material in 2005 and 2006 is 
approximately 1 kg of unfoliated granodiorite chips collected from a rock cut located on the main 
access road approximately 2 km due east of the Minto deposit.  Two standard reference material 
samples (SRM) were inserted for each batch of 20 samples, one for copper and one for gold.
Pulp check samples representing 6.5% of the sawn core samples submitted were sent to Acme 
Laboratories in Vancouver, Canada at the end of the drill program in 2005. Acme analyzed these 
check samples using the same analytical procedure as Chemex. Overall, the gold and copper values 
show some scatter in the figures but there is not bias as the scatter appears even around the mean. 
The target for pulp samples analyzed at different labs should have a relative difference not exceeding 
15% at the 90th percentile.  The gold results for the check samples in 2005 had a relative difference 
of 15% for 70% of the population.  The copper results for the check samples in 2005 had a relative

Page 75
difference of 15% for the whole of the population.  This level of precision is acceptable but 
warranted improvement for gold and excellent for copper; the results are shown to be reproducible.
Overall the copper and gold analysis results from Chemex can be considered acceptable for resource 
estimation purposes.
In 2006, five percent of the database was been selected from Area 2 drill holes and samples were 
submitted back to the laboratory for blind analysis.  It can be a concern that the laboratory is aware 
of the placement of SRM samples in the sample stream as they typically receive core samples to be 
prepared into pulps, and a pulp envelope containing the standard.  A good practice is to gather 5% of 
the pulp samples that were analysed by the lab and resubmit them back to the lab with new sample 
numbers and standards reinserted into the shipment.  In this way, the lab receives a series of identical 
pulp envelopes and the actual placement of the standards is now unknown to them.  The results of 
these samples are reviewed for any difference in the tenor of the standard results when the lab does 
not know their placement in the shipment.  This process tests the ability of the laboratory to 
reproduce similar results of the original sample assays.
Results in all grade ranges were reproducible.  Despite some scatter in the gold results, the data was 
well distributed about the mean with a single significant outlier present in the gold duplicate pairs 
(original value 4.16 g/t Au compared to duplicate value of 2.68 g/t).  The copper duplicate results 
were satisfactory. For gold, 79% of the 97 pairs were within 15% of each other.  This level of 
precision is not optimal but does represent an improvement from the 2005 duplicate pairs program. 
For copper, more than 95% of the 114 pairs had absolute differences of less than 10%.
Of 595 blank samples analyzed, only 8 returned elevated gold and copper results.  Internal review by 
MintoEx indicated that most of these erroneous values may have been the result of sample switches. 
None of the samples with elevated gold or copper values is indicative of systematic or long term 
contamination of the samples during sample preparation procedures at the lab.
Analyses of the laboratory duplicates show sample preparation protocols used are excellent for 
copper analysis and are very good for the gold analysis.  To optimize the gold assay results, it was 
recommended that the coarse reject protocol change from 70% passing -10 mesh to 85% passing the 
-10 mesh screen and the pulp preparation protocol be changed from a 100 to 250 g sample pulverized 
to better than 85% passing -75 μm to a 250 g sample with better than 90% of the material passing -
75 μm mesh.  Changes to the sample preparation protocol were not completed during the 2007 
program and are anticipated for future analytical work.
Varying grades of copper and gold SRM, purchased from CDN Resource Laboratories of Delta, BC 
(“CDN”) and from WCM Sales Ltd of Burnaby, BC (“WCM”) were submitted in sequence with the 
sawn core samples.  A total of 578 SRM were analyzed.  The performance of all copper standards 
was acceptable, demonstrating the assay process was in control for all grade ranges in the 2006 
Area 2 samples.  Performance of the gold standards in all grade ranges was acceptable; the quality

and reproducibility of the analyses improved with the AAS finish over the gravimetric finish after 
fire assay.

13.1.4 MintoEx 2007 Samples
The 2007 drill core samples, blanks SRMs and duplicates were submitted to the Vancouver Chemex 
laboratory for copper and gold analysis in North Vancouver, Canada.  Some samples were processed 
at other locations.  SGS Laboratories under agreement with MintoEx processed 485 samples (6% of 
the total number of samples); assays were performed at the Vancouver Chemex Lab.  
Chemex-Elko, NV, USA processed 4% of the total number of samples, Chemex-Reno, NV, USA 
processed 10%, and Chemex-Terrace processed 50%.
The samples submitted to Chemex were first crushed in a jaw crusher to reduce the material to 
greater than 70% -10 mesh (2 mm).  A 100 to 250 g subsample was then split and pulverized to 
better than 85% passing -75 μm.
Copper was determined by four acid digestion method (HF, HNO3, HCLO4 digestion and 
HCL-leach) with final copper determination by atomic absorption spectroscopy (“AAS”). 
Non-sulphide copper was analyzed using sulphuric acid leach with AAS determination.  Gold was 
determined by one assay-tonne fire assay analysis.  The gold analysis was determined using AAS 
method.  Silver was analyzed using aqua regia digestion and AAS finish.
All sample submittals included SRM samples, blank samples and pulp and coarse reject duplicates to 
assure the quality of the assay data.
Of 674 blank samples analyzed, 3 returned elevated gold or copper results.  Internal review by 
MintoEx has shown that one of the erroneous values is likely the result of sample switches.  None of 
the samples with elevated gold or copper values is indicative of systematic or long term 
contamination.
Analyses of the laboratory duplicates indicate that the sample preparation protocols currently in 
place are excellent for copper analysis and are very good for the gold analysis.  Despite the 
recommendation to increase the amount of coarse and pulp material passing fine meshes, no 
adjustments were made to the sample preparation as any deviation from the standard processing 
protocols at Chemex unacceptably increased the turn around time for results.  Implementation of the 
recommendations was organized for 2008 analyses.

13.2  Standard Reference Material
Page 77
SRMs of varying grades for copper and gold were purchased from CDN of Delta, BC, WCM of 
Burnaby, BC and Analytical Solutions (“ASL”) of Toronto, ON.  Details of the SRM are 
summarized in Table 13.1.  The performance of all copper standards was acceptable and showed that 
the assay process was in control for all grade ranges in the 2007 Minto, Area 2, Area 118 and 
Ridgetop East samples. Performance of the gold standards in all grade ranges was acceptable.
MintoEx considered a SRM sample to have failed if a single value exceeds the third standard 
deviation limit or if two consecutive standards fell between the second and third standard deviation 
limits.  When a sample failed, MintoEx reviewed the data and if a re-assay was warranted, the assay 
laboratory was contacted and instructed to re-assay the failed sample batch.  The laboratory was 
instructed to review the samples for sufficient material for re-analysis.  If an SRM had insufficient 
material left in the sample bag, then the laboratory was supplied with a new standard before re-
assaying of the batch began. Some re-assayed samples and internal lab investigations requested by 
MintoEx are outstanding at the time of this report.
For copper, most of the charts for each of the SRM samples show good distribution about the mean 
and no apparent bias of the results.  Periods of weak apparent bias are evident on some of the charts 
and they are discussed in detail below.  For gold, all SRMs show good distribution about the mean 
and there is no apparent bias associated with the analytical results.  Results of QA-QC samples from 
2007 drilling including Minto, Area 2, Area 118 and Ridgetop East are shown in Figures 13.1 
through 13.17.

SRM CDNCGS07 has a mean value of 0.95 g/t Au and 1.01% Cu.  This SRM was inserted in the 
sample stream from February to late September 2007.  The SRM samples typically performed well 
for the gold analysis and show even distribution about the mean (Figure 12.1). There are three 
failures evident on the chart.  Re-assays of two of the failures remains outstanding; the third was not 
re-assayed as the assay batch contained only trace mineralization.

Figure 13.4: Plot of SRM CDNCGS08, Copper Results
The SRM samples typically performed well for copper analysis. The results appear biased 
approximately one standard deviation above the mean, however this is an absolute value of 0.005% 
Copper and could be due to rounding.  The single fail, shown in the chart (Figure 13.4) was not re-
assayed as it was in a poorly mineralized interval with less than 0.2% copper in the batch of 20 
samples.
13.2.3 SRM CDNCGS09
SRM CDNCGS09 has a mean value 0.34 g/t Au and 0.47% Cu.  This SRM was inserted in the 
sample stream February to early September 2007.

typically plot near the mean with a slight bias below mean for the SRM overall (0.01% copper less 
than the mean).
13.2.5 SRM CDNCGS11
SRM CDNCGS11 has a mean value 0.73 g/t Au and 0.68% Cu. The SRM was inserted in the sample 
stream from for the duration of the drilling campaign, February to November 2007.
Overall, the gold values are distributed about the mean with few periods biased slightly above and 
below the mean. (Figure 13.9).  Three sample failures of this standard occurred.  One sample failure 
remains outstanding; one was corrected upon re-assay. The third failure was not re-run because the 
batch of samples associated with the standard contained only trace amounts of gold.

Copper performance of the SRM was acceptable.  The SRM showed a slight bias above the mean for 
the first third of the drill campaign but subsequent analysis are well distributed about the mean.  
Three SRM failures occurred; one was corrected upon re-assays and two remain re-assays remain 
outstanding.
13.2.6 SRM CDNCGS12
SRM CDNCGS12 has a mean value 0.29 g/t Au and 0.27% Cu.  The SRM was inserted in the 
sample stream from for the duration of the drilling campaign, February to November 2007.
Gold values are distributed evenly about the mean and do not show an apparent bias of the results 
(Figure 13.11).  Ten failures of this SRM were reported; six were not re-assayed as the surrounding 
samples were in hanging wall, footwall or internal waste.  Two failures above three standard 
deviations returned acceptable results upon re-assay.  One failure below three standard deviations 
returned an acceptable value after re-assay.  One re-assay remains outstanding.

Copper values plot between the mean of 0.27% Cu and the second standard deviation limit, 
0.28% Cu. (Figure 13.12).  Although there is a bias, the bias represents a grade uplift of only 
0.005% Cu and should have no impact on the core sample results at this grade range.  The SRM had 
three failures outside three standard deviations; one passed upon re-assays and two re-assays remain 
outstanding.

The copper values for the SRM all returned acceptable values.  Most values plot near the mean; the 
difference between the analytical value of 0.33 and the calculated mean of 0.329% copper can be 
attributed to reporting to two decimal places by the lab.  Two of the eight SRM submitted plot at one 
standard deviation above the mean.  The bias represents a grade uplift of 0.01% Cu and should have 
no impact on the core sample results at this grade range.

Blanks
Page 89
MintoEx personnel inserted one field blank sample into the sample stream for every 19 drill core 
samples submitted to ALS Chemex.  The blank sample was inserted to ensure sample preparation 
procedures did not introduce any contamination of gold or copper to the sawn drill core samples.  
The field blanks consisted of pieces of local, barren granodiorite, void of any gold or copper values.  
A total of 674 blanks were submitted with the sawn core samples from the Minto, Area 2, Area 118 
and Ridgetop East 2007 drilling campaign.  Blanks performed very well, showing only very minor, 
sporadic contamination during sample preparation.
As shown in Figure 13.17, all but three of the blanks returned values well within acceptable limits 
for gold.  Two high values returned acceptable values after re-assay.  One failed blank is likely the 
result of a sample mix-up at the prep lab.  The contamination illustrated in Figure 13.17 indicates 
very minor contamination.  It is likely that contamination occurred during the sample preparation 
process for this sample; it is considered an isolated occurrence.  For the most part, the results indicate 
adequate control procedures during the laboratory’s preparation stages in the assaying process.

Figure 13.18: Plot of Blanks, Copper Results
Figure 13.18 displays one blank failure out of 674 blank samples sent for Cu analysis.  The one 
failed blank is likely the result of a sample mix-up at the lab (corresponds with the postulated sample 
mix up shown in the gold results for blanks, Figure 13.18).  Seven sample results are on or close to 
the fail limit.  This minor apparent contamination may have occurred during the sample preparation 
process and is considered an isolated occurrence rather than broad systemic contamination.
13.2.11
Duplicate Samples
Second splits of the coarse reject and pulp material were taken for every 18 drill core samples to test 
the homogeneity of the sample material and reproducibility of the results.  A total of 475 pulp and 
344 coarse reject duplicate samples were analyzed for copper and gold.
Overall, copper and gold results were reproducible from pulp duplicates (Figure 13.19 to 
Figure 13.22).  The duplicates were comparable to the original results and showed good distribution 
around the parity line with no apparent bias evident in the results for copper and a slightly lower 
value for the gold duplicate pulp where the original assay was greater than 1.5 gpt gold.  These 
results indicate that the sample preparation protocols that are in place at the lab work well for the 
Area 2, Area 118 and Ridgetop East samples submitted for gold and copper analysis.  One outlier 
was removed from the data set.

gold values and 5% in the copper values.  Values are acceptable for resource estimation purposes 
although the gold value is slightly elevated.  Minor adjustments can be made to the sample 
preparation protocols to optimize the gold analysis results.  The copper values are well within the 
acceptable range.  The coarse reject duplicates show that 90% of the gold values are within 20% and 
the copper values are within 14%.  The gold values are exactly at the acceptable level.  The copper 
reproducibility is excellent and well below the target threshold of 20%.

13.3  Between Lab Duplicates
Pulp check samples representing 1% of the sawn core samples analyzed during 2007 have been 
collected from Chemex. The pulp bags will be relabelled; SRM inserted every 20 samples and then 
submitted to Acme Laboratories in Vancouver, Canada for gold and copper analysis.  The analytical 
methods at Acme will be identical to those used during the 2007 program at Chemex. Work on the 
between lab duplicates is not complete at the time of this report.

14  Data Verification
14.1  1973 to 2001
Page 96
Independent data verification consisted of drilling by MintoEx, 2005 through 2007, in the Minto 
Deposit.  No confirmation drilling was undertaken in the Area 118 and Ridgetop East. At Ridgetop 
East, however, two 2007 drill holes were drilled within 30m of a historic hole.  No additional data 
verification was carried out on historic work.  The historic work on the property has been carried out 
by reputable companies and there does not appear to be any reason to question the validity of the 
information.  Core from the early drilling programs is not useable because both the Falconbridge and 
ASARCO core sheds have either collapsed and/or burned during regional forest fires.  Much of the 
old core is now in piles on the ground.  The core boxes appear to have been labelled by felt pen, 
rather than metal or plastic tags and the labels on core boxes that remain intact are not legible.
In 2002, ASARCO undertook a program to verify previous results and they were able to identify and 
recover holes from the dilapidated ASARCO core shed (Simpson, 2002).  Two of the holes (20–73 
and 22-73) cored the main zone mineralization.  Unfortunately, the split half of mineralized interval 
(60.7 ft @ 6.9% Cu) from hole 20–73 was missing and most of the interval (90 ft @ 4.48% Cu) from 
22–73 was missing.  The half core initially retained in the boxes was likely subsequently sent for 
metallurgical test work.  Nonetheless, a total of 14 samples of the remaining half of the split core that 
approximated or equalled the original sample intervals, were collected and analyzed by ASARCO.  
The results of this exercise are summarized in Table 14.1.

Comparing the 11 intervals that are exactly the same, the range of ratios between new and original 
vary from 0.14 to 1.35.  There are three abnormally low values that are difficult to account for.  The 
copper mineralization is disseminated, so a sampling bias from uneven distribution of the 
mineralization is not anticipated.  If the three abnormally low values in this group are ignored, the 
average ratio between new and original copper content is 0.94.  Given the poor state of the core, the 
reliability of this program is uncertain.
ASARCO also drilled a series of five confirmation holes in 2001 to confirm the grades and intervals 
of the main zone of the deposit (Simpson, 2001).  Some of the holes specifically targeted the Lower 
Zone below the main zone, which was not well delineated by the former drilling.  One hole 
(2001-12) is regarded as a direct twin of hole A101-74.  The collar of the old hole could not be 
found, but 2001-14 was located 2.0 m from the old hole, based on surveyed collar coordinates.  Hole 
2001-13 is regarded as a partial twin of hole K09-73 because the old hole was an angle hole while 
2001-14 was vertical.  For the other three holes, situated in other strategic parts of the deposit, the 
expected grade and thickness were determined from a weighted average of the results from the three 
closest holes.
The results for copper from the confirmation drilling are tabulated below in Table 14.2 and 
Table 14.3 and the gold results are included in Table 14.4 and Table 14.5.

The confirmation drilling shows that the grade and thickness of both the copper and gold in the 
mineralized zones are generally higher than indicated by the original drilling results.  The average 
uplift, for all of the intersections for Cu grade is 25% higher, Au grade is 300% higher and the 
thickness is 18% higher.  In particular, the thickness of the main zone is also 38% higher in hole 
2001-14 than predicted from adjacent holes and the gold grade is twice as high as adjacent holes and 
3.85 times higher than the 0.48 g/t deposit average.
Side by side, sample by sample comparison of the results from 2001-12 and A101-74 (determined to 
be only 2 m apart) shows some inconsistencies, particularly at the top of the main zone (Figure 14.1).  
A difference in sample interval (0.6 m to 1.5 m for new hole 2001-12 compared to 3.0 m for old hole 
A101-74) would account for this difference due to the averaging effect of the larger interval.  When 
the 2001-12 results are composited on similar intervals as the 1974 samples, or bench composites are 
calculated as shown in Figure 14.2 the differences are less pronounced.

The MintoEx database was validated by a 10% check of the collar, assay and survey data.  Of the 
218 holes in the project database, 24 were selected at random in the area of the resource estimation 
boundaries.  Only minor errors were detected and the database was found to be of good quality and 
accepted for resource estimation purposes.
In accordance with NI43-101 guidelines, MintoEx commissioned SRK to provide an independent 
verification of exploration data for Area 2. Data verification consisted of a site visit, examination of 
drill hole collars, examination of selected drill core and a check of the assay database against original 
laboratory certificates. Andrew Ham of SRK visited the Minto property between the 24th and 26th of 
January, 2007. Dr. Ham was accompanied to site by Brad Mercer.
Dr. Ham personally inspected drill core storage facilities, drill collars and selected drill core from 
mineralized zones within the Area 2 resource.  Of the 79 drill holes in the 2006 Area 2 database, 
eleven collars (13%) were selected at random in the area of the resource estimation boundaries and 
were checked by a handheld Garmin GPS. Table 14.6 compares the results of the collar locations as 
documented by SRK and Sherwood Copper. MintoEx sited the drill hole collars by differential GPS, 
which were later surveyed by the Minto Mine Survey team. The recorded values show good 
agreement and differences lie within the error of the handheld GPS.

During the site visit, SRK inspected mineralized domains from four drill holes to verify sulphide 
mineralization and ascertain the nature of the mineralized contacts. Copper mineralization is limited 
to strongly foliated domains (high strain zones) dominated by biotite, quartz, K-feldspar and 
magnetite (±hematite). The contacts between foliated high strain zones with unfoliated massive 
granitoids are very sharp. Mineralization abruptly terminates at this contact and does not continue 
into unfoliated intervals. It is important to note that not all foliated domains contain significant 
copper mineralization, but where mineralization does occur, it is within a well foliated domain.

Within foliated domains, there is evidence of up to two episodes of folding. There appears to be 
some correlation of higher grade mineralization with folding, with chalcopyrite replacing folded 
biotite foliations (Figure 14.3). This would suggest that mineralization post-dates or is synchronous 
with periods of folding. However, the number of drill holes examined was not representative to 
confirm the consistency of this relationship. SRK recommends that this relationship be followed up 
in future geological studies of the deposit.

The assay database was validated by a check of the original assay certificates against those recorded 
assays within the drill hole database. Out of the 104 laboratory certificates, 24 original assay 
certificates were randomly selected and checked by SRK, comprising approximately 23% of the 
assay database. Only minor errors were detected and the database was found to be of good quality 
and acceptable for resource estimation purposes.  The database is continually checked for errors by 
MintoEx as part of their ongoing quality assurance and quality control program.
Hole 07SWC254 was drilled adjacent to hole A11-72 (dip -45º, azimuth 105 º), approximately 9 m 
south at the 830-860 m elevation, intersecting similar grades and mineralization contained within 
solid RT1001 (LGGC, 2008) and approximately 65 m southeast, at a deeper elevation, within 
RT1003.  Hole 07SWC251 and A11-72 were approximately 28m apart at 805-820m elevation, 
within solid RT1003.  A comparison showing similar lithologies and grades is shown below in 
Table 14.7.

Comparing the drilling shows the grade and thickness of the copper varies; however, the subsequent 
2007 drilling shows the zones, although variable, are continuous.  The orientation of A11-72 is not 
ideal and cuts obliquely through the zone, both horizontally and vertically.  It is speculated some 
differences in the holes can be attributed to the fact that A11-72 was one of the earliest holes drilled 
on the Minto property.  Since then, a greater understanding of the geology and mineralization has 
been attained, leading to better drill hole placement, sampling (shorter intervals) and improved 
logging.

16  Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing
16.1  Mill Capacity
The mine production schedule was aligned with the anticipated mill processing capacity estimated to 
be 2,900 tonnes per day for July through December of 2008, 3,200 tpd for years 2009 to 2011 and 
then increasing to 3,500 tpd in year 2012 with the introduction of feed from Area 2.
16.2  Introduction
Production commenced in June of 2007 at a rated tonnage of 1,563 tonnes per day.  The plant was 
expanded in December of 2007 to a rated tonnage of 2,400 tonnes per day with the addition of 
flotation cells, two additional tailings filter presses and one additional ball mill.
Mill throughput and operating availability has been increasing steadily with time.  In May and June 
of 2008, average availabilities approached 90% and in June throughput exceeded design capacity.  
The average tonnes milled per operating hour have increased to 113 in May and June 2008.

Metallurgical performance has been consistent over the last four months.  Concentrate grades have 
averaged over 40% copper with recoveries averaging 93.6%.  Silver recoveries have averaged 86.9%

in the copper concentrate.  Gold recovery averaged 80.8% in the first quarter from a head grade of 
1.79 g/t Au.  As gold is not assayed on site, these are the most recent figures available.
Phase three expansion is in progress to increase throughput to 3200 tonnes per day.  The current 
bottle neck is the SAG mill.  The proposed plan to address the throughput increase is discussed 
further and in more detail in the following pages.
16.2.1 Primary Crusher
The primary crusher was supplied by Westpro.  There were significant issues with availability and 
maintenance especially during the winter months.  It is currently down for rebuild and a portable 
crusher is on site while the rebuild is being completed.  Capital has been allocated to redesign the 
crusher to minimize some of these issues and this work is expected to be completed in the third 
quarter of 2008.
Crusher performance has a marked effect on the SAG throughput and a fines content of 30-35% is 
needed to maximize tonnage.  It is particularly noticeable that, when the crusher is down for 
maintenance, that the feed becomes noticeably coarser within 30 minutes.  Compounding the 
problem is the fact that there is only one slot feeder under the coarse ore stock pile eliminating any 
chance of mixing the feed.  As a result the crusher must run 24 hours per day, while the design 
criterion was for one 12 hour shift per day.
16.2.2 Grinding Circuit
The grinding circuit comprises the SAG mill (16.5’D x5.0’L), and two grate discharge ball mills 
(10.5’Dx12’L) in parallel.  All three mills have 900 HP motors.  At the current operating tonnage of 
113 tonnes per hour, the ball mills are drawing approximately 72% of installed horsepower.
The limiting factor in increasing tonnage is the SAG mill.  The SAG has a reverse spiral and a 
trommel screen with 5/8” openings.  It is proposed to increase the trommel openings in two stages, 
first to ¾”, then to 1.0”.
To compensate for the coarser material feeding the ball mills, the steel charge will be 50% 3” balls 
and 50% 2” balls instead of the current 2” balls.  The power draw on the mills will also be increased 
to closer to maximum available power draw of 900HP.
The mill has on occasion processed in excess of 3,400 tonnes per day with the grind being in the 
order of 180 microns, so at full horse power, there is a reasonably good expectation of success.
The ball mills do not have trommel or magnets on the discharge, creating problems with tramp steel 
re-circulating in the discharge stream.  Magnets have been ordered and will be installed in the 4th 
quarter 2008.  This will reduce the level of maintenance on the cyclone feed pumps, cyclones and 
associated piping and improve operating times over the medium term.

16.2.3 Flotation
Page 107
The flotation circuit consists of three 1400 cubic foot rougher flotation cells, four 300 cubic foot first 
cleaner cells, six 100 cubic foot cells second cleaners, and five 500 cubic foot scavenger cells.  All 
flotation cells were supplied by Westpro.
The cells have been problematic since start up.  The 500 ft3 scavenger cells failed in the first month 
or so and is probably the reason the copper recoveries were low.  The 1400 cubic foot cells and 300 
cubic foot cells were installed in December 2008 and will all require modifications.  Two of the 
rougher cells have failed to date.  The sole control is reagent addition.  Air control is not possible and 
level control in the scavenger circuit is not possible as the control valve is always 100% open.
Despite these shortcomings, metallurgical results are excellent.  Recoveries of copper are in excess 
of 93% recovery at concentrate grades exceeding 40% copper.

Figure 16.2: Monthly Copper and Silver Recovery
As can be seen from Figure 16.3, concentrate grades have been steadily increasing with time as the 
flotation circuit was optimized as various circuit configurations were tested.  Reagent scheme is 
simple, Potassium Amyl Xanthate as collector, MIBC as frother and natural pH. There is no apparent 
correlation between copper head grades and concentrate grades in the range 2-4% copper.  For 
planning purposes, a target of 40% copper seems a reasonable goal given the actual mill performance 
to date.

16.2.4 Dewatering
The concentrate thickener is a 20 foot diameter Westpro model and is undersized for the phase 3 
production forecast.  Capital has been approved to install an Outotec 9.4 meter diameter Supaflo high 
rate thickener in the fourth quarter.
The concentrate is dewatered using a Larox ceramic filter.  Depending on slurry density, dewatering 
rate varies from 25-30 tonnes per hour with a moisture content of 7-8 percent, more than sufficient to 
accommodate the expansion to 3,200 tpd.
Concentrate storage shed on site is capable of holding 15,000 tonnes of concentrate.  Shipping from 
site stops in the fourth quarter, while the Yukon River freezes up and the ice bridge is built across the 
Yukon River and in the second quarter for spring break-up.  Both periods last 6 to 8 weeks.
Concentrate is trucked to Skagway for shipping overseas to customers.
16.2.5 Filtered Tailings
The tailings are thickened to 58% solids in a 40 foot diameter thickener manufactured by Westpro 
and pumped to a stock tank for temporary storage.  Five Lasta 1500 x 1500 pressure filters are used 
to dewater the tailings.  The filters are fully automatic and produce an average of 6.5 tonnes tailings 
per cycle at 16% moisture.  Cycle times are between 8.5 and 9 minutes, giving each filter a capacity 
in excess of 1,000 tonnes per day.

One of the five filters is currently set up as an alternate concentrate filter to the Larox ceramic filter, 
but capital has been approved to re-convert back to a tailings filter.
Filtered tails are conveyed to a stock pile and trucked to the dry stacked tailings area.
The plant operates exceptionally well, a credit to the operating personnel, and should easily handle 
Phase 3 tonnage.
16.2.6 Recent Developments
When run of mine ore was processed starting in October, the ore hardness was much higher than 
anticipated with a work index of approximately 19.
Mill throughput was severely restrained with tonnages as low as 80 tph.  A decision was made to 
implement pre crushing of the ore and this was started in the first week of November.  Tonnage 
increased to 130-145 tph depending on the ratio of fines added to the SAG feed.  The cost to fine 
crush is currently $3.95 per tonne, and with the mix at approximately 50% fines, crushing costs will 
increase by approximately $2.00 per tonne milled.
With the higher tonnages being processed, the flotation configuration was changed to open circuit 
cleaning as the rougher scavenger cells were unable to process the higher volumes of slurry.  
Metallurgical results have been unchanged.
The flotation circuit is shown in Figure 16.4.

17  Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve
Estimates
LGGC was contracted by MintoEx to estimate updated mineral resource estimations for the Minto 
Mine deposit and Area 2 and provide new estimates for Area 118 and Ridgetop of the Minto Project, 
located in Yukon.  The estimates included drill holes completed by the end of December 2007.
Ali Shahkar, P.Eng., Principal Consultant with LGGC, completed the mineral resource estimation 
update for the Minto Mine deposit in December of 2007.
Susan Lomas, P.Geo., Principal Consultant with LGGC completed the estimation work for Ridgetop, 
Area 2 and Area 118 in June of 2007.
17.1  Historical Estimates
In February 2006 LGGC completed the first mineral resource estimation for Area 2 of the Minto 
Project.  Ali Shahkar, P.Eng., Principal Consultant with LGGC, completed the work.  Andrew Ham, 
MAusIMM, and Marek Nowak, P.Eng., of SRK Consulting, both reviewed the estimation and found 
it reasonable for inclusion in the SRK pre-feasibility study.  SRK issued a 43-101 Technical Report 
documenting the resource estimation and the pre-feasibility study results in their report: “Area 2 
Pre-feasibility Study, Minto Mine, Yukon, November 30, 2007”.
Table 17.1 below summarizes the results of the historical mineral resource estimates completed to 
date on the Minto Mine Main Deposit and Table 17.2 summarizes the historical estimates completed 
for the Area 2 deposit.  The results for the most recent resource estimates are included in the tables 
for comparative purposes.  All the estimates are reasonably close in the tonnage and grade values 
reported for the Minto Mine Main Deposit.  The tonnages for Area 2 have increased from 7.6 Mt to 
11.3 Mt in the measured and indicated resource categories, 1.4 to 3.5 Mt in the inferred resource 
category.  This is largely due to new drilling, confirming the presence of mineralization further to the 
south than was previously modeled.  The most recent resource estimate results quoted for the Minto 
Mine deposit (December 2007) are exclude material mined up to the 21st of December, 2007.
The estimates completed in July 2005, January 2006 and June 2006 were done by Gary Giroux, 
P.Eng., of Giroux Consulting.
The July 2005 estimate is discussed in the 43-101 Technical Report, “Technical Report on the Minto 
Project, Whitehorse Mining Division, Yukon Territory for Sherwood Mining Corporation, July 15, 
2005”.
Giroux completed an interim model in January 2006 for the Minto Main deposit based on the data 
from 39 new drill holes that were drilled in 2005.  MintoEx completed a further 19 new drill holes in 
the spring of 2006 and an updated estimate was completed for the Minto Mine Main Deposit in June

2006 by Giroux.  This estimate was used to support a feasibility study on the deposit that was 
completed by Hatch and is documented in “Technical Report (NI 43-101) for the Minto Project,

17.2  Minto Mine Main Deposit Resource Estimation Methodology
In December of 2007 Lions Gate Geological Consulting Inc. (LGGC) was commissioned by 
MintoEx to provide an update to the 2006 mineral resource estimate for the Minto Mine Main 
deposit, originally completed by Gary Giroux and SWC.  This updated estimate included the new 
data from the 2007 drilling program and accounted for the material removed by mining activity in 
2007.  LGGC was provided with the new drill hole data in the resource area and a 3-D pit surface 
representing the limits of the open-pit at the Minto Mine as of December 21st, 2007.
17.2.1
Drill Hole Data
LGGC used the same database that was used for the April 2006 resource estimation and added the 11 
new drill holes that were completed in 2007.  A list of the new drill holes added to the April 2006 
resource estimates is included as Table 17.3.

These intervals were selected based on the same criteria as the previous rounds of modeling and 
resource estimation.  The zone selections correspond to the main host lithology for copper 
mineralization at the Minto project, which is the foliated granodiorite (fG) horizon.  As in the past, it 
was found that this selection criterion corresponds well with the grades for copper, gold and silver 
and serves well as a hard boundary to the mineralization.
These intervals were then compared to the solid for the Main Zone that was used in the previous 
estimate to make any necessary adjustments.  In all 5 cases it was observed that the new drill hole

intervals matched well with the existing Main Zone interpretation; therefore, no adjustments were 
made to the Main Zone solid boundaries.
17.2.2
Capping
The new assay data was treated using the same capping limits used for the April 2006 resource 
model.
At a capping limit of 36.7% copper, 7.3 g/t gold and 95 g/t silver; only one assay value, from the 
2007 assay data for Main Zone, was capped for gold (DDH 07SWC169).
17.2.3 Compositing
In all, 33 new composites were generated from the 2007 data.  The same compositing methodology 
was used as in the April 2006 resource estimation.
Down-hole composites of 3 meters in length were created within the Main Zone intervals.  Only one 
composite less than 1 meter was generated (hole 07SWC177) at 0.95 meters.  The new composites 
were then added to the composite file used in the April 2006 resource estimation.
17.2.4 Block Model Definition
The block model definition remains unchanged from the previous estimate and is shown in Figure 
17.2: for reference.  The blocks are 5 meter by 5 meter horizontally and 3 meters vertically in size.

17.2.5 Bulk Density Values
The Main Zone bulk density block values remain the same values which were interpolated into the 
model using Inverse Distance Squared method (ID2) in 2006.  For all other zones, LGGC assigned

Page 116
the averaged density values for each of the zones based on the zone code and the oxidation state as 
listed in Table 17.5.  The main reason for reassigning these values is that the original block model 
file (as provided by Gary Giroux) contained a number of blocks (within the Upper Zone and Zone 5) 
with bulk density values of zero.  In the past, several different patches and default values have been 
used by different users to correct this error.  For consistency, the values have now been reassigned to 
the values originally intended in the April 2006 model.
LGGC recommends that this newly assigned bulk density model be used for any future work, to 
avoid any inconstancies or potential errors.

17.2.6 Variography
Only the blocks within the Main Zone were re-interpolated in 2007 by LGGC.
LGGC reviewed the semi-variogram parameters that were used for the Main Zone grade 
interpolation runs in the April 2006 model and made only one change to that the z axis (vertical) 
range for the first pass sample search ellipse.  This was changed from 4 m to 10 m to better reflect 
the variogram ranges.  The 4 m range was used in the April 2007 resource estimation because the 
software being used by Giroux could not restrict the number of composites selected from a single 
drill hole.  In order to artificially restrict the maximum samples from a single drill hole to 
approximately 3 samples, Giroux was forced to severely restrict the vertical or z range of the sample 
search ellipse.  LGGC used software that can restrict the number of samples to no more than 3 
composites from a single drill hole, so this allowed for extending the vertical range to improve the 
sample search for the first pass of the ordinary kriging (KG) run, where over 90% of the Main Zone 
blocks are interpolated for copper.
LGGC used ordinary kriging in three passes to interpolate the grades for copper and silver and four 
interpolation passes for the gold grades in the Main Zone block model.
Other than the changes to the interpolation parameters discussed above, LGGC applied the same 
sample search and interpolation parameters that were used for the April 2006 resource estimation.  
The following parameters were outlined by Giroux in the report “Technical Report (NI 43-101) for 
the Minto Project- August 2006” (filed on SEDAR) and are quoted below:

Kriging was completed in a series of passes for each variable within each mineralized zone.  Pass 1 
used a search ellipse with dimensions equal to ¼ of the semivariogram ranges in the 3 principal 
directions.  If a minimum 4 composites were not found within this search ellipse, centered on the 
block, then the ellipse was expanded to ½ the ranges for Pass 2.  For blocks not estimated in Pass 2, 
the search ellipse was expanded to the full range in Pass 3.  In some cases, a fourth pass using the 
maximum range for copper was required to assure all blocks estimated for copper also had a gold 
and silver grade estimated.  Blocks not estimated in pass 4 were left un-estimated.  In all cases, if 
more than 16 composites were found the closest 16 to the block centroid were used
17.2.7 Search Parameters
In all passes a maximum of 16 and a minimum of 4 composites and a maximum of three composites 
from a single drill hole were used to interpolate the grade elements into a block.  The direction and 
ranges for the search ellipse used in each pass are listed in Table 17.6.

Block grades were visually inspected on sections and levels against the composited and raw assay 
data.  This check determined that the interpolated grades in the block model appeared reasonable 
compared to the assay and composited data.
Swath Plots
A nearest neighbour (NN) model was also run for Cu and Au (the main contributors to the value of 
the blocks). This NN model was used for both global comparisons and swath plots to check the 
performance of the interpolation.  A review of the swath plot found that the interpolated block grades 
for the kriged runs appeared reasonable when compared to the NN block grades.  Swath plots for 
copper block grades along northings, eastings and elevations for the Main Zone (showing the number 
of blocks averaged, April 2006 KG, December 2007 KG and NN models for all Measured and 
Indicated blocks containing any portion of Main Zone) are included in Figure 17.3 and Figure 17.4 
and Figure 17.5.

Global comparison of the block grades in Main Zone (including all partial blocks) with the NN 
model and the composite grade averages (see Table 17.7) shows no signs of a global bias.

17.2.9 Resource Estimation Results for the Minto Mine Main Deposit
LGGC has tabulated the results for the December 2007 resource estimation for the Minto Main 
deposit.  These results show the tabulated blocks for the material remaining in the zones and those 
materials mined up to December 21, 2007.  The tonnages and grades for the Minto Main deposit are 
being declared using a copper grade cut-off at 0.50% (Table 17.8) but for sensitivity and comparative

purposes, the results are also reported at 0.20%, 0.30%, 0.40%, 0.75%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% copper 
cut-offs (17.9 and 17. 15 ).
At a cut-off grade of 0.50% copper, the estimation shows an in-situ mineral resource for the Minto 
Main deposit of 7,970,000 tonnes with grades of 1.84 % copper, 0.66 g/t gold and 7.65 g/t silver in 
the measured and indicated categories, from all the zones in the Minto deposit.  According to the 
same tabulation, as of December 21 2007, a total of 460,000 m3 (or 1,240,000 tonnes) of material 
with averaged grades of 1.38 % copper, 0.36 g/t gold and 5.31 g/t silver, from the measured and 
indicated categories have been mined in the open pit.  The model also estimates that 20,000 tonnes of 
inferred categorized material (almost all form the Upper Zone) have been mined.  Whether this 
inferred material ultimately contributed to the mine production will need to be reconciled with the 
detailed mine records; but it could be a source of material not included in the Mineral Reserves due 
to its lower mineral resource classification.

17.3  Area 2 and Area 118 Resource Estimation Methodology
In March 2008, LGGC was commissioned by MintoEx to provide an update to the 2006 mineral 
resource estimate for Area 2, originally completed by Ali Shahkar, P.Eng., of LGGC.  Andrew Ham,

MAusIMM, and Marek Nowak, P.Eng. of SRK Consulting both reviewed the estimation and found it 
reasonable for inclusion in the SRK pre-feasibility study. SRK issued a 43-101 Technical Report 
documenting the resource estimation and the pre-feasibility study results in their report, “Area 2 Pre-
feasibility Study, Minto Mine, Yukon, November 30, 2007”.
New drilling to the south west of Area 2 had identified a body of mineralization called Area 118 that 
now contained sufficient drilling data to support an initial mineral resource estimation.
Both of these estimates include geology and assay data from the 2007 drilling program.
17.3.1 Geology Model
LGGC used the geological model from the 2006 resource estimation for the Area 2 deposit and 
updated it with the geology and assay data from 26 new drill holes completed in 2007.  The same 
modelling philosophy was used where the foliated granodiorite (fG) units were constrained into 
domains.  A lower grade limit of 0.20 % Cu was introduced into the geology model to eliminate 
large areas of waste that had been included in the previous estimate.
The geology data for Area 118 was reviewed on sections and plans.  The same zones that are 
domained in Area 2 are found to continue into the Area 118 deposit and so the same modelling 
philosophy was used to domain the mineralization in Area 118.  A zone of deformation (see
Figure 17.6) is found between the two deposits where the mineralization continues through this zone 
but there is evidence of displacement of the zones.  Angled drill holes through this deformation zone 
could help to gain a better understanding of the nature of the deformation.
The solids for each of the domains were considered hard boundaries during grade interpolation runs, 
and grades from one domain were not allowed to influence the block grades in other domains.
The mineralized zones occur in five, flat-lying horizons that overly one another.  The five major 
horizons of the fG units were assigned the following numeric codes; 240, 270, 280, 290 and 250.  
Domains 250, 270 and 280 were modelled into multiple solids and each solid was assigned a 
sub-domain code; 251, 252, 253, 254, 271, 272, 273, 280, and 281.  All of these domains are present 
in the Area 2 deposit but some of these zones (240, 271, 272, 281, and 254) have not been identified 
in Area 118 thus far.  The upper zones may be missing due to erosion at the surface and the lower 
zones may be identified with more detailed drilling. Table 17.16 includes a list of the domain codes 
assigned to the drill data and the block model.
Figure 17.6 is a 3-dimensional view of the zones solids, showing their block model codes (or 
Zone-ID).

Zone codes were modified to reflect their location within Area 2, Transition Zone or Area 118.  
Table 17.17 includes a list of the Zone codes as they were modified to include an area prefix.  
Throughout this section of the report and unless stated otherwise, the transition zone is considered to

For Area 118, LGGC added the data for 28 drill holes to the project database.  MintoEx drilled 23 of 
these holes in 2007 and five of the drill holes were historical holes drilled by ASARCO in 1974.  
Assay data had not been received from the assay lab for drill holes 07SWC236 or 07SWC259 for 
inclusion in this resource estimation, but the geology data was used to guide the domain 
interpretations. A list of the drill holes used to build the Area 118 deposit domains is included in 
Table 17.19.

Data analyses were completed using all the assay data for Areas 2 and Area 118.  Descriptive 
statistics and histograms were reviewed for the copper, gold and silver grades.  The results were used 
to guide the interpolation parameters applied to the Area 2 and Area 118 mineral resource 
estimations.
Table 17.20 contains the summary statistics for the uncut % Cu assay data for Area 2 and Area 118.

17.3.3 Evaluation of Extreme Grades
Extreme grades were examined for copper, gold and silver assay values, mainly by histograms and 
probability plots.  Copper, gold and silver showed extreme grade values where a clear break in the 
sample trend is observed in the probability plots.  LGGC implemented grade caps at the break values 
for each grade element and zone as outlined in Table 17.21.

17.3.4 Compositing
Assays were composited into 3 m down-hole composites.  The compositing process honoured the 
zone domain boundaries.
Of the 4443 composites created from the assay data, only 136 of them were shorter than 0.5 m.  
These short composites were reviewed and there was no grade bias associated with these remnant 
composites for copper, gold or silver and they were deleted from the database.  This was done since 
GEMS cannot length weight composites during grade interpolation.  Table 17.22 contains the 
summary statistics for the cut 3 m composite data for Area 2 and Area 118.

17.3.6 Bulk Density Values
The bulk density model for Area 2 and Area 118 was built by interpolation of the bulk density 
determinations provided by MintoEx geologists.  A subset of these values has been checked by an 
independent lab and the results are considered acceptable for resource estimation purposes by 
LGGC.
The bulk density values were interpolated into the blocks inside each zone solid by means of ID2, 
with the exception of the overburden domain which was assigned a constant bulk density value of 
2.00 (g/cm3).
The following search parameters where used for interpolation in all zones: 
•  Search Ellipse: 200 m radius in the X (Easting), 200 m radius in the Y (Northing) and 100 m
radius in the Z (Elevation) directions.
•  A maximum of 8 and a minimum of 3 determinations were used in interpolation of each block.
Blocks that were not filled using the criteria above, were assigned the average value for their 
corresponding zone as listed in Table 17.23.

LGGC has reviewed the results of the bulk density model on sections and plans to ensure that the 
procedures above had been executed properly.
17.3.7 Variography
The variography for Area 2 was not updated from the previous estimation as there were not enough 
new data points to impact the original variography used in the initial model.
The grade values for Area 118 were interpolated using ID2, so no variography study was completed 
on this data.
It should be noted that variography was completed on the original larger domain groupings and not 
the sub-domained data (i.e. Zone 270, not 271, 272).  Due to a lack of sufficient number of 
composites, no correlogram was produced for Zone 240 and the correlogram for Zone 270 is used to 
interpolate the Zone 240 blocks.
LGGC considers these correlograms to be valid for resource estimation purposes.
17.3.8 Grade Model and Interpolation Plan
The domain solids were used to assign rock codes (Zone-ID) to the block model.  Blocks above the 
topographic surface were tagged as air (code 0) and blocks outside of the fG zones but below 
topography were tagged as background (code 99).
A percent model was used to record the percentage of the block inside the solid for each zone code.
Values from the composites for copper and gold were interpolated into the block model using 
ordinary kriging (KG), ID2 and nearest neighbour (NN) methods.  Silver values were interpolated 
into the blocks using ID2 only.  Due to the differences in the data density the kriged values for 
copper and gold were used for the Area 2 resource estimation tabulations and the ID2 values were

Page 138
used for the Area 118 tabulations.  The NN method assigns grade to the block model using the single 
closest composite value to the block center.
Interpolation was restricted by Zone-ID so there was no intermixing of grade values between the 
different zones.  For all domains a minimum of 3 composites were used, with an additional 
parameter for maximum composites per drill hole set to 2.  This strategy forces the interpolation to 
require a minimum of two holes within the search ellipse before a grade value can be assigned to a 
block.  Table 17.24 and Table 17.25 list the interpolation parameters used for all metals (Cu, Au, and 
Ag) in Area 2 and Area 118.

17.3.9 Model Validation
Visual Inspection
LGGC completed a review of the Area 2 and Area 118 resource block model.  The model was 
checked for proper coding of drill hole intervals and block model cells.  The coding was found to be 
properly done.  Interpolated grade in the blocks was examined relative to drill hole composite values 
by inspecting the sections and plans.  The checks showed good agreement between drill hole 
composite values and model cell values.
Global Means
LGGC also checked the block model estimates for global bias by comparing the average copper and 
gold grades from the KG model with means from ID2 and NN estimates.  The NN estimator 
produces a theoretically unbiased estimate of the average value when no cut off grade is imposed and 
is a good basis for checking the performance of different estimation methods.  Results in Table 
167.26 show no evidence of bias in the estimate.

Swath Plots
LGGC also checked for local trends in the grade estimates by plotting the results from the KG, ID2, 
and NN estimate results on easting, northing and elevation swath plots.  The KG and ID2 estimates 
should be smoother than the NN estimate and the ID2 should be smoother than the KG estimate.  
The NN estimate should fluctuate around the ID and OK estimates on the plots.  LGGC has included 
the plots for the copper grades in Zone 251 in Area 2 (indicated blocks only) as examples of the 
charts (Figure 17.11, Figure 17.12 and Figure 17.13).
The results for the copper and gold grades show close tracking between the three estimates and no 
local trends.

The mineral resources of the Area 2 model were classified using logic consistent with the CIM 
definitions referred to in National Instrument 43-101.  The project mineral resources were classified 
into one of three categories; measured, indicated or inferred mineral resources.
All blocks within Area 118 were classed into the inferred mineral resource category due to the 
current wide drill hole spacing and preliminary nature of the geology/grade model.  MintoEx is 
currently infill drilling the area and early indications are that the model is being corroborated by 
these new holes, but a detailed review is required before a higher level of classification can be 
assigned.
In Area 2, LGGC applied the same modelling plan that was applied in the previous resource 
estimation for this deposit.   
•  For measured mineral resources to be applied to a block, three or more drill holes must
contribute grade composites within 30 m of a block centre for Zones 240, 270 and 280 and 
within 18 m for Zone 290.  No measured mineral resources were assigned to Zone 250 due to its 
deeper location in the deposit.
•  For indicated mineral resources to be applied to a block, two or more drill holes must contribute
grade composites within 50 m of a block centre for Zones 240, 270 and 280, within 45 m for 
Zone 250 and 30 m for Zone 290.
•  All other blocks that were assigned a grade within the domains were classed as inferred mineral
resources.

Table 17.27 contains the results of the resource estimation for Area 2 and Area 118 copper, gold and 
silver values as of data available from March 2008.  The resource estimate results for Area 2 and 
Area 118 are being declared using 0.50 % Cu cut-off.  For comparative purposes, additional gold 
grade cut-offs equal to 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.75, 1.00, 1.50 and 2.00% Cu are also tabulated in Table 
17.28 to Table 17.34.
The resources are reported to a depth of approximately 400 m elevation, which is approximately 
400 m below the surface.
Based on the study herein reported, delineated mineralization of Area 2 and Area 118 is classified as 
a mineral resource according to the following definitions from NI 43-101.
“In this Instrument, the terms "mineral resource", "inferred mineral resource", "indicated mineral 
resource" and "measured mineral resource" have the meanings ascribed to those terms by the 
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, as the CIM Standards on Mineral 
Resources and Reserves Definitions and Guidelines adopted by CIM Council on 11 December 2005, 
as those definitions may be amended from time to time by the Canadian Institute of Mining, 
Metallurgy, and Petroleum.”
“A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic 
material, or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and 
industrial minerals in or on the Earth’s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or 
quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, 
geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted 
from specific geological evidence and knowledge.”
“An ‘Inferred Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or 
quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably 
assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity.  The estimate is based on limited 
information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.”
Due to uncertainty associated with Inferred Mineral Resources, additional exploration work on the 
property may or may not succeed in upgrading the portions of the deposit currently classified as 
Inferred Mineral Resource to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource.  Because confidence in 
these portions of the estimate is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of technical and 
economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic viability worthy of public disclosure, 
the Inferred Mineral Resources must be excluded from estimates forming the basis of feasibility or 
other economic studies.
An ‘Indicated Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be estimated with a level of confidence 
sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 
mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on

detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques 
from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely 
enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.
A ‘Measured Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be 
estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic 
parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. 
The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information 
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings 
and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity.

17.4  Ridgetop Deposit Resource Estimation Methodology
In March 2008, LGGC was commissioned by MintoEx to provide a resource estimate for the 
Ridgetop deposit at the Minto Project.  Susan Lomas, P.Geo., and Principal Consultant with LGGC 
is responsible for the resource estimation.  There are no historical resource estimates for this deposit.
17.4.1 Geology Model
LGGC used the same philosophy for building the geological model as was used in the Minto Mine 
deposit, Area 2 and Area 118.  The mineralization associated with the foliated granodiorite (fG) units 
were constrained into domains on sections using a grade constraint of 0.20 % Cu to exclude areas of 
unmineralized foliated granodiorite material.
The solids for each of the domains were considered hard boundaries and grades from one domain 
were not allowed to influence the block grades in other domains during grade interpolation runs.
The mineralized zones occur in five, flat-lying horizons that overly one another.  The five major 
horizons of the fG units were assigned the following numeric codes; RT1000, RT1001, RT1002, 
RT1003 and RT1004.  Table 17.35 includes a list of the domain coding assigned to the drill data and 
the block model.  Figure 17.14: Ridgetop Domain Model Solids and Coding (View is looking 
towards the North-east).
Figure 17.14 is a 3-dimensional view of the zones solids, showing their block model codes (Zone 
Code).

17.4.3 Evaluation of Extreme Grades
Extreme grades were examined for copper, gold and silver assay values, mainly by histograms and 
probability plots.  Copper, gold and silver showed extreme grade values where a clear break in the 
sample trend is observed on the probability plots.  LGGC implemented grade caps at the break 
values for each grade element and zone as outlined in Table 17.38.

17.4.4 Compositing
Assays were composited into 3 m down-hole composites.  The compositing for the data analysis 
honoured the zone domain boundaries.  LGGC reviewed the compositing process and found it to 
have been performed correctly.
Of the 412 composites created from the assay data, only 31 of them were shorter than 0.5 m.  These 
short composites were reviewed and there was no grade bias associated with these remnant 
composites for copper, gold or silver and they were deleted from the database.  This was done since 
GEMS cannot length weight composites during grade interpolation.
Table 17.39 contains the summary statistics for the cut 3 m composite data for Ridgetop.

17.4.6 Bulk Density Values
LGGC received a bulk density database from Minto personnel and imported this data into the assay 
database that was tagged for each zone.  Table 17.40 shows the averaged bulk density data by zone 
and for the intervals that are in waste (not assigned a zone identifier).  The averaged values were 
assigned to the block model by zone since there are currently insufficient data points to support an 
interpolated density model at Ridgetop.

17.4.7 Grade Model and Interpolation Plan
The zone domain solids were used to assign rock codes (Zone-ID) to the block model.  Blocks above 
the topographic surface were tagged as air (code 99) and blocks outside of the fG zones but below 
topography were tagged as background (code 999).
A percent model was used to record the percentage of the block inside the solid for each zone code.
Values from the composites for copper, gold and silver were interpolated into the block model using 
ordinary kriging ID2 and NN methods.  The NN method assigns grade to the block model using the 
single closest composite value to the block center.
RT1000
RT1001
RT1002
RT1003
RT1004
Interpolation was restricted by Zone-ID so there was no intermixing of grade values between the 
different zones.  For all domains a minimum of 3 composites were used, with an additional 
parameter for maximum composites per drill hole set to 2.  This strategy forces the interpolation to 
require a minimum of two holes within the search ellipse before a grade value can be assigned to a 
block.  Table 17.41 lists the interpolation parameters used for all metals (Cu, Au, and Ag) for the

17.4.8 Model Validation
Visual Inspection
The model was checked for proper coding of drill hole intervals and block model cells.  The coding 
was found to be properly done.  The project block grades were visually inspected on sections and 
compared to the 3 m composite grades for each zone.  This review found that the block grades 
reflected the composite grades well.

Swath Plots
Swath plots were also made for each zone and the ID2 block grades were compared to NN block 
grades for the copper blocks only.  The results from the ID2, and NN estimate results were plotted on 
easting, northing and elevation swath plots.  The ID2 estimate should be smoother than the NN 
estimate.  The NN estimate should fluctuate around the ID2 estimate on the plots.  LGGC has 
included the plots for the copper grades in RT1001 Zone in Ridgetop as examples of the charts 
(Figure 17.19, Figure 17.20 and Figure 17.21).
The results for the copper grades show close tracking between the three estimates and no local 
trends.

17.4.9 Resource Classification and Summary
Block Count
Block Count
The resources are classified wholly into the inferred mineral resources category for this estimate due 
to the current wide drill hole spacing, preliminary nature of the geology/grade model and lower 
confidence in the continuity of the grades within the zones.  MintoEx is currently planning more 
drilling at Ridgetop to address these concerns and review the geology interpretation.

The resources are reported to a depth of approximately 730 m elevation, which is approximately 
230 m below the surface.
Based on the study herein reported, delineated mineralization of the Ridgetop deposit classified as a 
mineral resource according to the following definitions from NI 43-101.
“In this Instrument, the terms "mineral resource", "inferred mineral resource", "indicated mineral 
resource" and "measured mineral resource" have the meanings ascribed to those terms by the 
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, as the CIM Standards on Mineral 
Resources and Reserves Definitions and Guidelines adopted by CIM Council on 11 December 2005, 
as those definitions may be amended from time to time by the Canadian Institute of Mining, 
Metallurgy, and Petroleum.”
“A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic 
material, or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and 
industrial minerals in or on the Earth’s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or 
quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, 
geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted 
from specific geological evidence and knowledge.”
“An ‘Inferred Mineral Resource’ is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or 
quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably 
assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity.  The estimate is based on limited 
information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.”
Due to uncertainty associated with Inferred Mineral Resources, additional exploration work on the 
property may or may not succeed in upgrading the portions of the deposit currently classified as 
Inferred Mineral Resource to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource.  Because confidence in 
these portions of the estimate is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of technical and 
economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic viability worthy of public disclosure, 
the Inferred Mineral Resources must be excluded from estimates forming the basis of feasibility or 
other economic studies.
The mineral resource estimation results for Ridgetop are being declared using a 0.50 % Cu cut-off as 
shown in Table 17.42.  For comparative purposes the resources are also tabulated using cut-offs of 
0.20 % Cu, 0.30 % Cu, 0.40 % Cu, 0.75 % Cu, 1.00 % Cu and 1.50% Cu presented Table 17.42 to 
Table 17.48.

17.5  Minto Mine Main Deposit Mineral Reserves
The Minto Main pit reserve estimate was compiled using the updated mineral resource model 
provided by LGGC.  The model was imported into Mintec’s MineSight® software for the reserve 
calculation. The mineral reserve calculation was bounded by the 2007 year-end survey surface and 
the most current ultimate Main pit design surface.  A cut-off grade of 0.62% copper was used. The 
mineral reserve summary was based on measured and indicated mineral resource classifications 
totalled within ore zones 2, 4, 5 and 8 in the Main deposit. Details of the historical Area 2 mineral 
reserve estimate are provided in the previously released PFS.
The mineral reserves are summarized in Tables 17.49 through to 17.51 below for both the Main pit 
and Area 2 pits.

18  Other Relevant Data and Information
18.1  Reconciliation of Reserves
The extensive use of stockpiles at Minto makes the reconciliation of the mineral reserve estimate to 
actual production results difficult.  As of the end of October 2008, the stockpiled ore totaled 
approximately 495,000 tonnes.  Sampling of the stockpiles has not been conducted and would not be 
representative of the stockpile grade unless a very large number of samples were taken which is not 
practical.
The reconciliation of mineral reserve block model grades versus blasthole drill cuttings samples is 
the only reconciliation possible at Minto.  Blasthole cuttings are not assayed for gold and only 
recently being assayed for silver, therefore the reconciliation is incomplete for precious metals.  The 
data from the monthly reports as provided by Minto personnel is summarized in Table 18.1.  The 
blasthole sample volumes are calculated using the area of each ore polygon multiplied by weight 
averaged depth of blast holes.

tonnes are approximately 4% greater than the block model.  This result indicates that there may be 
slightly greater actual mining dilution than was assumed in the mineral reserve estimate block model.  
Overall, the total copper content of the ore seems to be slightly greater than originally modeled.
The reconciliation of the Minto resource will benefit from continued analyses as more data is 
captured but at the moment does not indicate any unusual results and are well within industry norms.

19  Additional Requirements for Technical
Reports on Production Properties
19.1  Mine Operating Plan
19.1.1 Mine Design
The Minto Mine currently encompasses two open pits, Minto Main pit (“Main”) which is currently 
being mined, and Area 2 pit as outlined in the overall site plan illustrated in Figure 19.1 below.  The 
expanded Area 2, Area 118 and Ridgetop resources defined in 2007 that are the subject of this report 
have not been considered in the LOM plan as they have not been the subject of a preliminary 
feasibility study and have, therefore, not reached the reserve category.  An updated preliminary 
feasibility study for these resource additions, plus any additions from currently on-going 2008 
drilling, is planned to commence once 2008 drilling is complete, resources re-estimated and mine 
planning updated.
The combined 3D mineral resource model of the Main and Area 2 was used as the basis for deriving 
the economic pit limits.  A number of calculations were performed on the resource model in order to 
determine the net smelter return (“NSR”) of each individual block based on a number of parameters 
(e.g. metal price, grade, recovery, treatment and refining charges).  The ultimate economic pit limit 
was based on a Lerchs-Grossman (“LG”) pit optimization evaluation of the resources in the NSR 
model.  The evaluation included the aforementioned NSR calculations as well as geotechnical 
parameters (summarized in Table 19.1 below) and mining/milling costs. The basic designs of the pits 
vary according to the wall orientation but, in general, the design parameters shown in Table 19.1 are 
used.  The 30° slope angles apply to the portion of the pits in overburden.

The economic pit limits were constrained to only consider measured and indicated reserve class 
material. An analysis of the NSR-based optimized LG pit shells was conducted and a final pit shell 
selected as the basis of further detailed pit designs to arrive at the final pit configurations shown in 
Figure 19.1.

19.1.2 Mine Operation 
Minto mine uses conventional open pit mining techniques and equipment for all of its ore and waste 
extraction and is undertaken by a contract mining company.  Minto Exploration and Pelly 
Construction have entered a long term agreement for the open pit mining activities. The existing 
open pit fleet of contractor equipment is shown in Table 19.2.  Variations in production and stripping 
levels will be handled by the contract mining company.  After the pits are depleted, the mining 
equipment required on site will be reduced, as only loading and hauling from the low grade 
stockpiles to the crusher will be required.  The proposed mill upgrade to 3,500 tpd will not demand 
more mining equipment than is already on site.  The Pelly fleet has an approximate capacity of 
13,000 bcm/day, which will be sufficient for the LOM plan. Pelly Construction also maintains a shop 
facility on site with the cost included in the unit rates.
Approximately 60% of ore from the pits is hauled directly to the crusher feeding the mill.  40% of 
the mined ore goes to various temporary stockpiles according to the graded characteristics of the ore.  
The stockpiles in the LOM plan are used to blend ore going to the plant to maximize copper head 
grade.

The I.R. DML45 drill performs the majority of the production drilling in the mine, utilizing a down-
the-hole hammer and a 10” diameter bit.  The I.R. ECM690 hydraulic drill with a 4” diameter bit is 
be used for secondary blasting requirements and may be used on the tighter spaced patterns required 
for ore blasts.  The main loading and haulage fleet consists of Cat 777D haul trucks, which are 
loaded with the Cat 992G loader or the Cat 385 excavator, depending on pit conditions.  The fleet of 
Cat 769C haul trucks supplement the main haulage fleet, if and when necessary.  As pit conditions 
dictate, the Cat D11R and Cat D10N dozers are used to rip and push material to the excavators, as 
well as maintaining the waste dumps.

The additional equipment listed in Table 19.3 are used to maintain and build access roads, along with 
various site facility requirements, including ore stockpile maintenance, tailings storage construction 
and maintenance, as well as further exploration development.  The work schedule is based on two 
twelve hour shifts, seven days a week.
Grade Control 
In order to minimize ore dilution, maximize ore recovery, and thereby improve the operation’s 
overall economics, grade control plays an important role throughout the mining process at Minto.
Grade control begins with the proper identification of the ore/waste zones and contacts in the field 
through; information obtained from up-to-date 3-D resource model; blast hole sampling; driller 
reports; face sampling (includes mapping, visual inspections, sampling); and trenching (as required, 
to provide better definition of ore/waste contacts, sampling). During the drilling of the 6m benches in 
the ore zone of Phase 1 Main pit, one sample per blasthole was collected for analysis.
Once the above information has been gathered and compiled it is communicated to operational 
personnel through daily/weekly production meetings; detailed “dig” maps – outlining ore zones, 
waste contacts, faults, field surveying and layout of dig limits, ore contacts and any trenching 
required.
In order to maintain the effectiveness of the grade control process; regular field inspections are 
undertaken by engineering/geology personnel and clear lines of communication are maintained with 
operational personnel, including equipment operators and front line supervisors.
As part of the grade control process, variable bench heights have been designed in order to maximize 
the ore recovery.  These include: variable bench heights in waste in order to target the top of the ore 
zone and a varying bench height within the ore zones (during the mining of the ore zones in 
Phase 1 Main pit the mining bench height was reduced to 6m from the regular 12m high benches).  
Drill and blast control also plays an important role in order to minimize dilution of the ore zones 
during the blasting process (e.g. minimize heave in the ore zone). Minto personnel are working 
together with the blasting contractor, Dyno Nobel, in an ongoing basis to continually improve overall 
blast performance.
19.1.3 Production Schedule
Mine Sequence/Phasing
Mining commenced with pre-stripping in the Main pit in 2006 with the first ore produced in 
mid 2007. The Main pit was divided into 5 phases or pushbacks in order to achieve the LOM plan 
targets. As of the end of October 2008, Phase 1 and 2 had essentially been completed (pit bottom at 
the 736 m elevation) and Phase 3 was currently being mined at the 748 m elevation (north wall 
pushback portion nearing completion). Completion of the remaining three phases of the Main pit is 
scheduled to be in 2011.

Area 2 will commence once mining nears completion in the Main pit (in year 2011). The Area 2 pit 
has been scheduled in three phases with mining to be completed in early 2015. Waste material from 
Area 2 is to be backfilled into the Main pit, thereby, significantly reducing the Area 2 waste haul 
distances required and reducing the waste dump impact on the environment. The 2008 LOM plan has 
a slight overlap with the final ore benches of the Main pit being completed when the pre-stripping 
commences in Area 2. Further detailed engineering is required in order to determine if this requires 
that some initial waste production from Area 2 be hauled to an alternative location or if it can be 
backfilled into the Main pit while mining nears completion in the lower reaches of the pit.
The design phase tonnages and associated grades (based on copper cut-off grade of 0.62%) and 
metal recoveries of the Main pit and Area 2 LOM plan are summarized in Table 19.4 and Figure 
19.2.  The quantities summarized exclude 2008 actual budget figures and are phase design mine 
production values from the LOM plan for 2008 through to 2015 (remaining three phases of the Main 
pit along with the three phases in Area 2). Figure 19.2 illustrates the phase layout on elevation 790 
for both the Main pit as well as Area 2.
The phase designs appear to be designed to maintain reasonable mining widths throughout the 
schedule in order to maintain productive headings both in ore and waste.  Area 2 is a higher strip 
ratio pit when compared to the Main pit along with slightly lower grades.  Currently, the sequencing 
of Area 2 is in the pre-feasibility stage and, as such, will require further detailed engineering in terms 
of final phase configurations, ramp designs, minimum mining widths, and ore release.
LOM Schedule 
The LOM schedule is summarized in Table 19.4 and Figure 19.4 below using a copper cut-off grade 
of 0.62%. The current mine reserves (as of beginning of 2008) give the Minto mine (Main and 
Area 2 pits combined) approximately 8 more years of operating life to early 2015.  The processing of 
the stockpiled material is schedule to continue for approximately another year until early 2016.  The 
2008 LOM plan shows 70.6 Mt of total material, ore and waste, mined including 9.2 Mt of ore for an 
overall strip ratio of 6.7:1 tonnes waste ore.  A total of 9.7 Mt of ore is planned to be processed at an 
average mill feed grade of 1.86% Cu, 0.68 g/t Au, and 7.32 g/t Ag. This results in 370.4 Mlbs of 
copper recovered, approximately 158,000 oz of gold and 1,950,000 oz of silver.
The Minto LOM operating plan was developed to meet several specific objectives of mine 
management such as maximizing net present value, mining higher grade zones in early years of 
operation, generating positive cash flows each year, minimizing capital expenditures, minimizing 
risk and targeting exploration in the surrounding areas.  The average daily total material mined for 
the LOM plan is approximately 10,700 bcm/day (or 27,500 tonnes/day).  The processing target is 
2,900 t/day for 2008, with a mill expansion planned to increase throughput to 3,200 t/day for 2009 
through to 2011 (end of Main pit), followed by a further mill expansion to increase throughput to 
3,500 t/day for 2012 through to the end of the LOM plan in 2016.

Figure 19.2: Phase Tonnages and Copper Recovery
The total mine production for the Main pit in the LOM schedule varies slightly from the mineral 
reserve estimates previously noted. This may be attributable to the 2008 actual production values that 
were provided and formed part of the mining production in the LOM plan for 2008.
The LOM schedule is based on whole bench tonnages and grades and will require further detailed 
engineering of individual mining cuts for budgeting purposes.  This fine tuning of the mining 
sequence will ensure that mined tonnages and grades will be able to meet the specified targets. The 
large increase in strip ratio in year 2011 is a function of the commencement of pre-stripping in the 
Area 2 pit.

Figure 19.5 below illustrates the 2008 LOM schedule (from the start of 2009) in terms of the 
sequence and durations of mining for each phase.  The current plan has up to four phases active at 
any one point in time. With the relatively small footprint of Area 2 pit, further detailed engineering is 
required in terms of ensuring that the schedule will allow for adequate allocation of equipment and 
personnel resources and limit the number of active mining faces.  The mining phases and schedule 
are designed so that when the lower benches and reduced strip ratios of one phase are active the next 
phase of stripping is commenced.  This is required to balance strip ratios and provide the required 
ore mill feed throughout the schedule.
Figure 19.5: Phase Sequence
The LOM schedule is further illustrated in Figure 19.6 below in terms of number of benches mined 
per annum for each phase. The average number of benches mined per phase in any one given year is 
5 (maximum of 12). This annual advance is within industry norms and should not present any 
challenges in terms of sequencing of the mining cycle (drill, blast, load, haul). However, as 
mentioned above further work should be conducted in order to ensure that the phase designs and 
schedule will allow for four phases in Area 2 to be mined within the same one year period (e.g. year 
2011).
Table 19.5 shows the results of actual versus LOM plan mine production from July to October 2008.  
Ore was drawn from stockpiles to make up the shortfall in mine production.

Ore Stockpiles 
Several ore stockpiles exist on the property that will be active throughout the LOM plan.  The 
stockpiles are defined in terms of estimated copper grade mined as shown in Table 19.6 below and 
their locations are noted on the site plan in Figure 19.1.

The ore stockpile balance as of the end of October 2008 is summarized in Table 19.7 below.  The 
ending stockpile balance is determined from material movements to and from the stockpiles and is 
based on a combination of load counts, truck counts as well as surveys of the individual stockpiles.  
The grades are determined from blasthole assays.

The stockpile material will be used to supplement open pit ore throughout the schedule and allow for 
increased flexibility in the mine plan while providing the highest grade mill feed possible.  When the 
ore from the open pits is exhausted in early 2015, the mill will be fed exclusively from these 
stockpiles. Table 19.8 summarizes the yearly stockpile inventories from the end of 2008 through to 
the end of the LOM plan.  As illustrated by the lack of year end inventories, the high grade ores are 
fed to the mill as they are exposed in the pits in order to maintain the ore production at the highest 
possible head grade while mining.  The low grade stockpile increases in inventory until it is used for 
the primary mill feed in the later part of the schedule.

Waste Management
The Main waste dump, low grade stockpile, and ice-rich overburden dump (“IROD”) are based on 
existing designs derived from the Minto Main Feasibility and their locations are noted on the site 
plan in Figure 19.1. The Main pit backfill dumps will be composed primarily of waste material from 
Area 2. An additional dump has recently been created directly west of the Main dump that contains 
overburden material.
Waste rock from the Main pit will be deposited in an expansion of the existing waste dump areas and 
in the new valley fill dump, west of the Main pit. Area 2 waste rock and tailings is proposed to be co-
deposited into the Main pit when Main pit mining nears completion. The 2008 LOM plan has a slight 
overlap with the final ore benches of the Main pit being completed when the pre-stripping 
commences in Area 2. Further detailed engineering is recommended in order to determine if this 
requires that some initial waste production from Area 2 be hauled to an alternative location or if it 
can be backfilled into the Main pit while mining nears completion in the lower reaches of the pit.
The 2008 LOM plan did not include annual waste dump progressions nor did it include an analysis 
of waste haul distances.  As with most open pit mines, the management of waste production and 
placement plays an important role in the overall economic success of an operation.  An important 
waste rock disposal option, located in the upper Minto Creek Valley, has recently been permitted and 
will offer an improvement in the waste haulage cycle for the trucking of waste out of the Main pit.

Further detailed waste dump designs and annual progressions would provide a useful tool for 
managing the various streams of waste material produced from the Minto pits.
Tailings from the mill will be sent to the currently permitted existing dry-stack location and two 
unpermitted locations; an adjacent paste fill containment area and backfilled into the Minto Main and 
Area 2 pits, after they are mined out.  Again the 2008 LOM plan did not provide detailed dump 
progressions for this tailings facility. Currently, Pelly Construction is responsible for the loading, 
hauling and dumping of mill tailings.  Consideration is being given by Minto personnel to revise this 
and separate out the overall management of the dry stack facility in order to deal with the transport 
and placement of the mill tailings and assist in reducing overall onsite costs.
Main Waste Dump
The Main Waste dump, as described in the Minto Main Feasibility, is located on a south-facing slope 
west of the Main pit. This dump includes waste rock as well as thaw-stable overburden from the 
Main pit.  The dump is constructed by placing material at its natural angle of repose (approximately 
1.5H:1V) with safety berms spaced at regular 15 m (vertical) intervals.  The berms are designed with 
a minimum width of 7.5 m.  The Minto Main Feasibility ultimate dump design had a final crest 
elevation of 960 m.  As of October 2008, the Main Waste dump platform elevation was 
approximately at the 922 m elevation.  The dump is visually inspected on a daily basis to ensure 
stability. Surveyed toe stakes were noted in the field in order to ensure that the dump design was 
being adhered to.
As mentioned above, the upper Minto Creek Valley will offer a considerable improvement in the 
waste haulage cycle for the trucking of waste out of the Main pit.
An additional dump has been recently created directly east of the Main dump and contains 
overburden material. The material contained within this dump is planned to be used for reclamation 
purposes as required.  The design of a detailed waste management plan for the LOM plan as well as 
for mine closure should address all of these waste dumps.
Low Grade Stockpile
The low grade stockpile, as per the Minto Main Feasibility, lies between the Main Waste dump and 
the Main pit ultimate limit.  Its design configuration follows the same parameters of the Main Waste 
dump described above.  Material that is hauled to this location includes; sulphide ore less than the 
copper cut-off grade of 0.62% Cu but above 0.5% Cu; all oxide ore; and partially oxidized material 
with a copper grade of less than 1.0% Cu but above 0.5% Cu.  As of October 2008, the low grade 
stockpile platform elevation was approximately at the 907 m elevation.
Ice-Rich Overburden Dump
This dump, as designed in the Minto Main Feasibility, was to contain ice-rich overburden material 
excavated, primarily, from the southern highwall of the Main pit.  There was concern that once this

Page 183
material begins to melt it could begin to flow if not contained.  As such, a containment berm was 
constructed to the south west of the Main pit, in an area of shallow overburden.  The berm was 
constructed to a final elevation of 890 m with a minimum crest width of 6 m.  It should be noted that 
only the total overburden has been modeled to date and that the quantity or extent of the ice-rich 
overburden has not been clearly defined.
To date, no ice-rich overburden material has been placed in this dump.  Instead the dump was used 
for storage of mill tailings during the initial stages of start-up while issues with the tailings filtering 
system were remedied.  The current plan is to remove these tailings from this dump and haul them to 
the dry stack storage facility.  The ice-rich overburden material that has been encountered to date has 
been placed on the Main Waste dump and has been blended in with other waste rock generated from 
the Main pit.  No apparent issues with the overall stability of the Main Waste dump have been noted 
to date with the addition of this ice-rich overburden material.
Main Pit Backfill Dumps
The LOM Plan has the Main Pit backfill dumps being comprised of all waste material from Area 2. 
This will include all waste rock, overburden and any ice-rich overburden encountered (the 
excavation left behind from the mining of the Main pit will provide adequate containment for all 
material types).  The backfill dumps will be built in a series of lifts, with the ultimate face 
configuration as per the Main waste dump described above.  The co-deposition of tailings into the 
Main pit will allow the filling of waste rock void spaces with slurried tailings.
19.2  Recoverability
The Minto ore is relatively simple to process and is well suited to the existing process plant.  Further 
improvements and optimization are expected as greater processing and metallurgical experience is 
gained.  The LOM plan flotation plant performance assumptions, shown in Table 19.9, are based on 
2008 and the Area 2 metallurgical test results.
Actual gold and silver recoveries for 2008 are approximately 79% and 85% respectively (Mar-Aug 
2008 for gold and Jan-Nov 2008 for silver).

19.3  Markets
Minto currently has three marketing contracts for the sale of concentrates and metals.
19.3.1 Concentrate Sales
Minto has an established concentrate purchase contract with MRI Trading AG (“MRI”).  Under the 
terms of the contract, MRI has the obligation to buy all of Minto’s concentrate production and Minto 
has the obligation to sell all of its concentrate production to MRI.  The contract is in effect from July 
2007 to June 2010.  The contract may be extended by mutual agreement one or more years.
This study assumes that treatment charges will be US$70.00/dmt of concentrate and US$ 0.07/lb 
payable copper beyond June 2010.
19.3.2 Metal Price Contract
Minto has metal price guarantee contracts with Macquarie Bank for copper, gold and silver 
production that are valid until the third quarter of 2011.  The contracts have varying levels of metal 
take and metal price.  A summary of the overall contract metal volumes and prices are shown in

19.4.1 Contract Mining 
Minto and Pelly Construction have entered an agreement to the end of 2010 for open pit mining and 
support activities.  The unit rate per bank cubic metre (“bcm”) for loading, hauling and dumping 
(“LHD”) is based on two standard haul criteria; haul distance and road gradient.  Variations to the 
haul criteria greater than 10% lead to change in contract costs.  LHD rates are exclusive of fuel, 
explosives and force account charges.  Drilling and blasting costs for waste vary based on powder 
factor (“PF”) requirements for various types of material but is generally categorized as ore, waste 
and overburden ( PF = kg of explosive per m3 of material blasted), as well as the drilling equipment 
used.

The blasting is conducted by another contractor, Dyno Nobel Canada, who also ships, stores, blends 
delivers explosives on site and performs blast hole loading services.
The work performed by the contractors appeared to be of good quality and they have been an integral 
part of the mining operation for over two years. Pelly and Dyno combined maintain a workforce at 
Minto of between 30 and 40 people depending on the amount of work being done.
The Pelly and Dyno contracts do not contain productivity incentives.  Pelly is paid per bcm moved 
for the pit fleet and per hour worked for force account equipment.  This arrangement offers little in 
the way of financial gains to Minto should the efficiency of the contractor be improved.  MintoEx is 
currently in discussions with Pelly on amending the contract to incorporate incentives and reduced 
costs as a result of efficiencies and actual experience achieved since the contract was initially 
executed.  MintoEx anticipates overall unit costs can be reduced through this process; alternatively 
MintoEx has the option of rebidding the contract on its expiry or switching to self mining in order to 
achieve the cost reductions deemed reasonably appropriate.
One of the most significant force account items for the mine is the contracting of the dry-stacked 
tailings transport and placement.  Pelly is currently doing this work on a cost per hour per machine 
basis.  Minto management are currently reviewing alternates ways handling dry-stacked tailings to 
reduce cost of this task.
19.4.2 Precious Metal Purchase Agreement
On November 21, 2008 Silverstone reached an agreement with Sherwood, Minto Explorations Ltd. 
(“Minto”) and Kutcho Copper Corp. (“Kutcho”) to acquire gold and silver production from the 
Minto Mine, for a US$37.5M up-front payment plus further payments of the lesser of US$300/oz Au 
and US$3.90/oz Ag (subject to a 1% inflation adjustment after 3 years and each year thereafter); and 
the prevailing market price of gold and silver as quoted on the London Bullion Market Association.
In the Silverstone agreement, if the precious metal production from the Minto Mine exceeds 50,000 
oz payable gold per year in the first two years of the agreement or 30,000 oz payable gold per year 
thereafter Silverstone will be entitled to purchase only 50% of the excess amounts.  Silverstone also 
obtained the right of first refusal to purchase gold and/or silver streams from Sherwood’s wholly-
owned Kutcho Copper project on terms and conditions to be agreed by mutual consent.
The agreement starts on December 1, 2008 and carries on for the life of the mine.  Table 19.12 
shows the current Minto LOM plan payable precious metal production estimates.

19.5  Environmental Considerations
19.5.1 Environmental Assessment and Permitting
Page 187
MintoEx has completed extensive environmental and permitting work for the Minto Project.  In 
December 1994, a four volume Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) was submitted under 
Environmental Assessment and Review Process Guidelines Order (EARPGO) to the Department of 
Indian Affairs & Northern Development (DIAND) for review.  The IEE prepared by Hallam Knight 
Piesold (HKP, 1994), encompassed: 
•  Volume I – Development Plan providing a general overview of the Minto Project; 
•  Volume II – Environmental Setting which described the local environmental conditions and
studies undertaken at the site since the 1970’s;
•  Volume III – Socio-Economic Description and Impact Assessment describing socio-economic
conditions and archaeological evaluation and impact assessment for the Minto Project; and
•  Volume IV – Environmental Mitigation and Impact Assessment was submitted in May 1995 and
summarized the results of overburden and waste characterization studies.
The assessment indicated no acid generation potential as tailings solids and effluent test work 
indicated very low levels of metals present and showed solids that were strongly acid consuming.  
DIAND issued an EARPGO screening report decision on April 7, 1997, indicating that potentially 
adverse environmental effects that may be caused by the project are mitigable, using known 
technology and that the project could proceed.  The Type A Water License (QZ96-006) was issued in 
April 1998 and a Quartz Mining Production Licence (QML-9902) was issued in October 1999 for 
the Minto deposit.  A Type B Water Use Licence application was issued in August 1996 for 
construction of the Yukon River barge landing sites, the Big Creek Bridge, and Minto Creek road 
culvert installations.  A summary of the subsequent project assessments and licensing is provided 
below.
Water Use Licence QZ96-006 was amended (Amendment #1) to revise the decommissioning 
requirements for the project, and to request the submission of an interim plan as the project was not 
yet constructed.  The project is still subject to Water Use Licence QZ96-006.
As the Type A Water Use Licence (QZ96-006), Type B Water Use Licence (MS95-013), and Yukon 
Quartz Mining Licence (QLM-9902) were set to expire in June 2006, and in recognition of the 
project development delays, licence amendment applications to extend the licenses to June 30, 2016 
were filed with the YWB and Government of Yukon (GOY), Department of Energy, Mines & 
Resources (EMR) in October 2004.
In response to the amendment applications, GOY Development Assessment Branch completed a 
Yukon Environmental Assessment Act (YEAA) screening of the Type A Water Use Licence using 
the previous EARPGO screening and issued their screening report in March 2005.
GEDHA

December 15, 2008
SRK Consulting 
Minto Mine Technical Report – Silverstone Resources Corp.
Page 188
The YWB completed a YEAA screening of the Type B application and subsequently issued the 
amended Type B Water Use Licence (MS04-227) in February 2005.  GOY Development 
Assessment Branch completed a YEAA screening of the Type A Water Use Licence and Yukon 
Quartz Mining Licence using the previous EARPGO screening and issued their screening report in 
March 2005.  The YWB issued the amended Type A Water Use License (QZ04-064) in September 
2005 and GOY EMR issued amendments to the Yukon Quartz Mining License QLM-0001, 
Amendment No. 05-001 in December 2005 and Amendment No. 05-002 to change the mill rate to 
2,500 tonne/day in October 2006.  In July 2008, the Quartz Mining Licence was amended again to 
increase the mill rate to 3200 tonnes/day following a Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic 
Assessment Act (YESAA) review of the amendment request.
Generally the amended licences contain similar terms and conditions as the original licences and are 
typical of other Yukon mining licences.  All of the above noted licences have an expiry date of June 
30, 2016.
In addition, the Federal Metal Mining Effluent Regulations (MMER) under the Fisheries Act 
currently apply to the Minto mine.  These Regulations are a law of general application and the 
requirements of this legislation are the responsibility of the Company.  Generally, the Type A Water 
Use Licence is considered more restrictive that the MMER; however, separate reporting for effluent 
discharge and receiving water monitoring is required by the Federal Department of Environment 
Canada.
MintoEx also has a number of minor authorizations to operate the facility including an air emissions 
permit, commercial dump permit, special waste permit and land treatment facility permit.
Project authorizations typically require the company to monitor environmental and physical 
performance and track key project statistics.  The licences require the submission of various 
operation plans including Tailings Management Plan and Operational Surveillance Manual, 
Environmental Surveillance Monitoring Plan, Spill Contingency Plan and Detailed 
Decommissioning and Closure Plans.   Key monthly reporting is provided to the YWB for all 
environmental surveillance programs and annual reports provided to the YWB and GOY EMR.  All 
reports are provided to Selkirk First Nation (SFN).  Generally the company has been in compliance 
with all their authorizations.  There have been isolated exceedances of water use licence effluent 
discharge standards typical of mine start up and mitigative measures have been fully implemented by 
management to correct these events.  The company is in full compliance with the MMER 
requirements.
MintoEx and the SFN have a Cooperation Agreement (CA) which establishes cooperation protocol 
with respect to permitting and environmental monitoring.  Both parties are content with the CA 
progress to date.
MintoEx has initiated work on revisions necessary to various licences for development of the Area 2 
zone.  A YESAB Designated Office level of assessment will be required to support amendment

applications to the Water Use and Quartz Mining Licences.  As part of the licence amendment 
process, minor amendments will also made to the Type A Water Use Licence to streamline 
monitoring requirements and revision of effluent discharge standards that are more reflective of site 
and receiving waters.  The company continues to work with SFN as it develops the licence 
amendment applications for the new development.  As the Area 2 zone is an extension the Minto 
main deposit and exhibits similar geochemical characteristic it is expected that the environmental 
assessment and permitting process will be straight forward.  The company maintains a good working 
relationship with regulatory agencies as noted by the timely approvals of previous licence 
amendment requests.  These relationships will be relied upon for permitting of the Area 2 zone to 
ensure timely permitting.
Environmental challenges that the company is presently addressing is improved water management 
of clean and waste water streams to ensure operation of the reclaim pond with low metal 
contaminant levels.  The property is somewhat unique in that an elaborate water treatment system is 
not in use even though effluent discharge criteria are restrictive.  Best management practices and 
alternative treatment technologies are being used to ensure environmental compliance is achieved.  
Further refinements in these areas are expected to ensure continued performance in the long term.
19.5.2 Closure Plan
MEL has an approved Detailed Decommissioning plan for the site.  This plan will be revised to include the 
Area 2 development and resubmitted to YG to ensure that the site liabilities are fully secured.  Conceptually, 
the Area 2 closure plan will adhere to the principles on which the Main Zone closure plan is based.  
The following points summarize the main incremental closure items that will result from 
development of the Area 2 ore body:
•  The Main Zone pit will be backfilled with Area 2 waste rock and tailings.  Backfill is
expected to flood over time to the level of the lowest point on the rim of the Main Zone pit.  
The Area 2 rock dumps will roughly re-establish the cross-sectional profile of the valley that 
existed prior to excavation of the Main Zone pit.  The waste dumps will be re-sloped and an 
appropriate self-sustaining vegetative cover will be established.
•  A channel will be developed across the backfill to convey the flow of Minto Creek over the
backfilled Main Zone pit and into the original channel downstream.  This channel will be 
armoured with 1 m of riprap if the gradation of the granodiorite waste rock is not 
appropriate.  There will be no requirement to line the channel to prevent seepage losses, as 
the channel will occupy the low point in the Minto Creek valley.  Channel slopes will be 
covered in 0.25 cm of growth medium and re-vegetated with willows or other species as 
appropriate.
•  The Area 2 pit will be excavated to a stable overall angle, and the highwall will be left in
that state at closure.  Benches above the 808 m level will be scarified to promote re-
vegetation. Uncontrolled access to these benches will be prevented by placement of boulders 
up to 1 m in size at access points, or by other measures as appropriate, to prevent access.  
Berms will be constructed and signage will be placed around the pit rim as required to 
prevent inadvertent access.

•  A lake will likely develop in the Area 2 pit post-closure, with a final lake surface elevation 
of approximately 808 m.  Provision will be made to convey drainage to the valley bottom 
from the spill point at the northeast corner of the pit, as required. .  A schematic depiction of 
the flooded pit and discharge channel is shown in Figure 19.7. Water quality in the pit lake is 
expected to be low in dissolved solids, including metals, and to contain low levels of 
nutrients in the long term.
•  Area 2 tailings will be contained within both the Main and Area 2 pits.  The Main pit will be
covered with a minimum of 1 m of waste rock at closure.  The waste-rock covered tailings 
will be reclaimed as described above for Area 2 waste rock.  The Area 2 pit will be only 
partially filled with tailings and will be left to flood to natural water levels (808 m elevation).

Other than the Area 2 pit, the main zone backfill waste dumps and some incremental infrastructure, 
there will be no additional site component requirements due to the extraction of the Area 2 resource.

19.6  Taxes
Federal and Provincial tax calculations start with the before tax cash flow amounts from the cash 
flow portion of the model and essentially deducts the cost of building the mine and mill (Class 41 
UCC, CEE and CDE) as would be expected over the life of the mine as allowed by the Canadian tax 
rules.  Generally Class 41 UCC and CEE can be deducted 100% against profit from the mine while 
CDE can only be deducted on a declining balance basis at 30% per year.  The losses that are 
generated in the first few years of mine operation are deducted against income in later years.
The Yukon Quartz Mining Royalty (“Yukon mining tax”) is a much different tax calculation than 
would normally be expected.  It also starts with before tax cash flow from the cash flow portion of 
the model and deducts depreciation at 15% per year on a declining balance basis for the mine capital 
assets and mill capital assets.  It, however, does not have loss carryover provision.  Taxes are paid at 
rates that increase as income increases.
The opening balances for the tax pools for both taxes are included in the cash flow model.
There is a circular calculation in the financial analysis since income tax is deductible for Yukon 
mining tax and Yukon mining tax is deductible for income tax.
Hedging gains and losses are not taken into account for taxation.
Since the model is based on operating cash flow the actual tax results may differ between periods 
from the model as concentrate shipment dates vary from the model.
19.7  Capital and Operating Costs
Capital and operating costs in this report were taken from the most recent LOM plan and budget as 
described in Sherwood’s June 30, 2008 Technical Report.  The assumptions have not been re-
estimated or adjusted for current conditions.
19.7.1
Operating Costs (“OPEX”)
With approximately one year of operation to reference, Minto has established adequate historical 
costs for budgeting purposes.  Projections of future costs are based upon the anticipated production 
volume increases currently planned.  Some of the Main cost assumptions in the LOM plan are shown 
in Table 19.13.  SRK has reviewed the major cost items and found then to be reasonable.  The total 
LOM opex was estimated to be $0.89/lb Cu including by-product credits and $1.22/lb Cu without 
by-product credits.
Royalties paid to the Selkirk First Nation were included in operating costs and are defined as a 0.5% 
of Net Smelter Return.

Mine OPEX
Mining costs are based on a mining contract with Pelly Construction and the explosives contract with 
Dyno Nobel Canada.  The contract prices do not include fuel.  There appears to be the potential for 
efficiency improvement with the mining contractor and Minto will be pursuing these with Pelly.  A 
$0.50/bcm cost reduction as a result of these efficiency improvements was budgeted in 2001 and 
later.  It is SRK’s opinion that this cost reduction estimate is justified and appropriate, particularly in 
light of the current economic conditions.
The unit mining cost over the life of the mine is $3.02/t mined or $7.85/bcm.  Loading, hauling and 
dumping make up 65% of the total cost.  Drilling and blasting is approximately 25% of the cost with 
mine administration, placement of dry-stacked tailings, dewatering and other costs making up 10% 
of the total.
Milling OPEX
Milling costs are based on historical consumable usage, with current costs applied.  The unit milling 
costs are relatively constant through the mine life at approximately $11/t milled.  The main mill cost 
drivers are labour (38%), grinding (27%) and crushing (15%).  Crushing costs assume 12 hr/day of 
crushing that are deemed achievable following process upgrades in 2008.

Site Services OPEX
Page 193
Site services include power generation, access (barge and road) and waste management (sewage and 
garbage).  Site service operating costs are almost entirely (88%) driven by power costs.  Once power 
grid is connected and diesel generation is not needed, power costs drop by $600,000 to $800,000 per 
month.  Barge operations crossing the Yukon River account for about 10% of the site services 
budget.  The LOM site services costs average around $5.29/t milled.
Camp Services OPEX
Camp services costs derived from meals, janitorial and other minor services associate with the man 
camp.  A cost of approximately $38/man/day was used for the life of mine cash flow estimate.
Technical Services OPEX
Engineering, geology and environmental services (excluding labour) are included in the technical 
service cost centre.  The technical service budget is approximately $1M per year and is flat for the 
LOM.
Administration OPEX
Administration costs encompass site management, health and safety, government affairs, SFN 
affairs, crew rotations and human resource costs.  The average Administration cost is $4.10/t milled.
19.7.2 Capital (“CAPEX”) Costs
Mining Capital
No mining capital was included in the economic analysis as it is assumed that the mine will continue 
to be serviced by a mining contractor that will provide its own equipment fleet.
Mill Capital
A total of $ 2.2 M in plant capital was budgeted in 2008 to increase plant throughput to 3,200 tpd.  
The 2008 plant capital includes costs for primary crusher upgrades and thickener and filter press 
additions as well as other modifications.
It is unknown at this time whether further capital will be required to increase the mill throughput to 
3,500 tpd when Area 2 ore is processed.  The Area 2 PFS stated that thickening and grinding 
improvements would have to be made to reach 3,500 tpd, however recent plant performance suggests 
that the upgrade may not be needed and, therefore, the capital cost was not included in the LOM cash 
flow.

Power Line Capital
Page 194
The power line capital total is estimated to be $16 M financed over 7 years.  Minto’s capital 
contribution to the main Carmacks-Pelly line is fixed at $7.2 M.  The capital cost of the mine spur 
line will be fully paid by Minto and is expected to be $ 8.8 M.  No contingencies were added to these 
capital items.
Other Capital
Environmental components of the project were determined to be financed through an independent 
facility and, for that reason, no costs have been incorporated into the specific cash flow for the 
project, except for an additional $2M added for the reclamation of Area 2.
Exploration capital was deemed as discretionary as it is not required to support LOM production and 
has, therefore, not been included in the LOM cash flow.

19.8  Economic Analysis 
19.8.1
Assumptions
A financial model was compiled by SRK based on the June 2008 Minto LOM operations plan and 
the 2008 budget.  It does not include the new Silverstone PMPA.  The model includes taxation but 
excludes financing costs (debt and interest payments).   Net annual cash flows were calculated by 
considering net smelter return from the payable Cu, Au and Ag metals, and then deducting the 
operating costs, capital costs and applicable taxes.
Metal prices were estimated by applying prices from the existing sales contract as shown in Table 
19.15 and non-contract metal price assumptions as shown in Table 19.16 (Case 3 in the June 30, 
2008 technical report).

•  1.10:1 beyond 2009
•  A discount rate of 10%;
•  Variable metal pricing;
•  Nominal 2008 dollars; and
•  No inflation.
Costs, revenues and taxes were calculated for each period in which they occurred rather than at the 
actual date of payment.  For example, taxes were calculated each month in the model even though 
they are actually paid only once per year.
19.8.2
Economic Results
Minto Mine (Excluding Precious Metals Purchase Agreement)
The June 2008 LOM plan financial results are shown in Tables 19.17 to 19.18.
It must be noted that the net present value (“NPV”) calculations in the financial model were done 
using 2008 as the starting year and do not take into account approximately $150M in capital spent in 
2006 and 2007 for plant and mine construction.  This methodology only looks at the project going 
forward from the beginning of 2008 and, therefore, shows high returns.
Based on the assumptions described previously, the economic analysis shows a very robust project.  
It must be noted that the results could change considerably if the current drop in copper prices 
remain for the long-term.  SRK has no opinion on what future metal prices might be.

Silverstone PMPA Economic Results 
A simplified, pre-tax economic model was developed to show the potential benefits of the PMPA to 
Silverstone.  The results are shown in Table 19.18.  The model was compiled using the LOM plan 
precious metal production but not LOM plan precious metal prices and exchange rates.  The LOM 
plan assumptions are listed in the previous section.
The Silverstone PMPA model yields a pre-tax NPV10% of $11M and a pre-tax IRR of 19%.  Using 
the assumptions in Table 19.18, gold makes up about 85% of the PMPA contract value.

19.8.3 Sensitivities
Minto Mine
The project was evaluated for sensitivity to the operating costs, capital costs, grade and metal price. 
All sensitivities were assessed for the range of -20% to +20% with the resulting after-tax NPV10% 
value shown with the base case.  Figure 19.10 shows the graphical results of the sensitivity analysis.
All sensitivities were done as mutually exclusive variations.  A combination of variable changes was 
not conducted nor was an analysis of the probability of any variations.
Both the pre-tax and after taxation cash flow models show the project is most sensitive to changes in 
Cu grade and Cu price.  The grade sensitivity is somewhat mitigated in the mine plan by the 
significant use of stockpiles to allow the early extraction of higher grade ore and the ability to blend 
different grades to provide a consistent mill feed.  The metal price sensitivity is tempered to a 
significant degree by Minto’s forward sales agreements.  These features are important in maximizing 
the economics of the project.

Minto Mine Technical Report – Silverstone Resources Corp.
Page 199
A 20% drop in Cu grade yields a $78 M drop in after-tax NVP10%.  Diligent grade control practices 
will be important in achieving undiluted mill feed, especially in Area 2 where the mineralized zones 
are smaller and more numerous than is found in the Main pit.
Not taking into account the Silverstone contract, a 20% drop in un-hedged metal prices, gives a 
$68M drop in after-tax NPV10% by $68M.  An increase in un-hedged metal prices of 20% increases 
after-tax NPV10% by $68M.
A 20% reduction in OPEX yields a $46 M increase in after-tax NPV10%.  Many of Minto’s major 
operating expenses including mining, explosives, TCs and RCs and concentrate transport are covered 
by contracts and, therefore, offer some protection from variances in the next 2 to 4 years.
As all of the construction capital expenses have already been incurred, the project is not sensitive to 
CAPEX.
It must be noted that if the sensitivity variables occur concurrently the results, both positive and 
negative, could be much greater than estimated in this report.

19.8.4 Comments
Metal Price 
Regardless of which tax or pre-tax model is selected, changes to the metal grades and prices each 
contribute to make the most impact on the cash flow for the project. Considering Minto’s significant 
hedged metal prices, including the newly-signed PMPA with Silverstone, the mine has a reduced risk 
of metal price fluctuations when compared to many other operations.
Grade 
Changes to the grade of Cu represent the project’s greatest economic vulnerability and the variable 
that can also be affected by internal efforts associated with mining and milling operations.  With the 
high profile and mandate related to the management of the stockpiled ore, the concerted effort to
GED/HA

Page 201
optimize recovery grades and reduce mine dilution, the mitigation of the grade risk has been woven 
into the project strategy.
Tonnage 
Changes to tonnage are only expected should grade control and waste mining require modification. 
The mine plan that has been modeled is the result of stringent efforts and continued monitoring of 
mining operations can alleviate risks associated with tonnages.
Foreign Exchange 
The effect of foreign exchange can have a significant negative or positive impact on the project cash 
flow, mainly because Minto’s revenue contracts are fixed in US dollars while operating costs, taxes, 
and capital are in Canadian dollars.  The magnitude of this impact is measured from the 
1.08 CDN:USD average exchange rate used in the economic model and the actual exchange rate 
affecting the project.
19.9  Payback
The payback period for the entire project capital spent to date is expected to be within two years 
depending on number of external factors including metal prices, exchange rates, etc. The payback on 
all future capital spending will be almost immediate due to large cash flows and minimal capital 
expenditures planned.
The payback to Silverstone for its US$37.5M investment in the PMPA is estimated to be 
approximately 3 years, but may change due to precious metal prices, mine production results and 
exchange rate fluctuations.
19.10 Mine Life
With the current mineral reserve estimates used in the LOM plan, the mine operation will end in the 
first quarter of 2015.  Open pit mining is estimated to finish in January 2015 and the mill will 
continue to run on stockpiled material until the first quarter of 2016.
It is SRK’s opinion that, based on the continuing upgrading of mineral resources and the past 
exploration success on the property, there is good potential for the extension of the mine life.

20  Interpretations and Conclusions
•  The Minto Mine has shown continuous production throughput improvement since start-up.   
•  Mill recoveries and concentrate grades are on target 
•  The Minto deposit, encompassing both Main pit and Area 2, represents a significant ore reserve. 
The current mining in the Main pit has helped confirm the expected grade and extent of the ore 
reserves and the detailed drilling has provided a good level of confidence in the reserve estimate.
•  The expanded Area 2, Area 118 and Ridgetop deposits are resources that represent potential
additional reserve tonnage and increased mine life.
•  The potential exists to improve the waste management system of the property in order to
enhance productivity and reduce overall mine costs (i.e. the recently permitted valley fill spoils). 
•  The sequential rather than concurrent mining of the Main and Area 2 pits is the preferred mining
schedule and will enhance reclamation activities.
•  Based on the testwork conducted to date, the Area 2 waste rock does not appear to have any
ARD issues.
20.1  Risks
The following risks have been identified for the Mine: 
•  Exchange rates, metal prices and external influences:  MintoEx has no control over exchange
rates and their impact on the economics of the operation is significant.  Metal prices are also not 
controllable, other than by forward sales contracts, and can have an appreciable affect on project 
return.
•  Process Capacity:  The ability of the mill to be modified and sustain 3,500 tpd is a risk, as there 
may be certain unit operations that could create bottlenecks to the operation that have not been 
identified.
•  Water management:  Both the lack of water and the overabundance of water are potential issues
for the mine.  The lack of water may be an issue during the during the in-pit co-deposition of 
tailings in the Main pit as water will be lost.
•  Grade control:  The Area 2 deposit is made up of several zones of ore that are not as continuous
and thick as the Main zone.  As a result, a very thorough and proactive grade control program 
will be necessary to reduce dilution.  The NPV of this project is very sensitive to copper grade, 
so excessive dilution will have a serious negative impact on the project economics.
20.2  Opportunities
•  Optimization of mine plan:  The mine plan has not been fully optimized and it is likely that 
further scheduling work will smooth out some of the grade and ore extraction variations and 
provide higher grade ore sooner with delayed waste mining.
•  Resource additions:  The resource updates contained in this report show considerable additional
mineralization that has not been considered in the LOM plan summarized in this report, and 
extensive drilling is underway in 2008 to upgrade the confidence in these new resources, attempt

Page 203
to increase them and test new targets.  A further update to the LOM plan will be completed once 
the 2008 results are available, and offers opportunities for further increases in grades, potential 
rescheduling of the different zones to optimize project economics, etc.
•  Exploration target potential:  There are several interesting exploration targets on the Minto
property.  MintoEx has plans to further explore these targets with the hope that they will become 
resources and eventually reserves.  There is absolutely no guarantee these targets will ever be 
economic to extract, however, the past exploration record at Minto is a positive indication of 
further potential.
•  Underground mine potential:  MintoEx has identified some exploration targets that may have the 
potential for underground mining.  If these targets are added to Minto’s resources, a study should 
be undertaken to determine if the deposits are sufficient in grade and volume to support 
underground development.
•  Processing efficiency:  As the Minto ore is better understood, the processing plant may be further
optimized to increase recovery, improve concentrate grade or increase throughput.

21  Recommendations
21.1  Metallurgy and Processing Plant
•  Work should continue in automating the process plant to improve efficiencies of the various
processing stages.
•  An automated reporting package should be implemented to improve accuracy and reduce staff
time spent typing data into various spread sheets.
•  Further enhancements are possible in the flotation configuration that could result in enhanced
recoveries.  The rougher concentrate assays cover 40% copper and should only require one 
additional stage of cleaning.
•
Investigate the potential for gravity recovery of gold.
•  More Area 2 testing on expanded resources including metallurgical testing of Area 118 and
Ridgetop.
21.2  Mining
•  A pre-feasibility study and subsequent LOM plan revision should be conducted to determine the 
economic viability of underground mining at Minto as well as the economic potential of the 118 
and Ridgetop resources.
21.3  Geology and Resources
•  More infill and step-out drilling is recommended for Ridgetop to follow-up open mineralization
trends toward the east and southeast.
•  Additional drilling would be desirable at Copper Keel to follow-up a high grade intersection in
08SWC-389 reported in the Company’s news release of November 4, 2008. Infill drilling on 160 
m centres is recommended in the area between Area 2/Area 118; Ridgetop and Copper Keel to 
assess the possibility of linking the mineralization into one larger deposit.
•  Continued drill testing of untested regional magnetic and GAIP targets is also recommended.
•  Geological mapping north of the DEF fault is recommended.
•  Pursuit of a joint venture agreement with the Selkirk Development Corp. to explore the ground
immediately adjacent to the current MintoEx land holdings is recommended.
21.4  Waste Management
•  The detailed design of a waste management plan for the entire site, including co-deposition of
tailings and waste in the Main pit need to be studied in detail along with the closure plan and will 
be part of a new PFS.

The cost of the recommendations, except Geology and Resource recommendations, will be 
addressed in an upcoming PFS and will cost approximately $700,000.
The costs for the Geology and Resource recommendations are estimated to be $2.65 M.
