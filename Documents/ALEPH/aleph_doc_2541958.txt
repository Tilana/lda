NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
September 30, 2014
(Expressed in US Dollars) (Unaudited)
 
1. NATURE AND CONTINUANCE OF OPERATIONS
 
EMC Metals Corp. (the “Company”) is a specialty metals and alloys company focusing on scandium and
other specialty metals. The Company intends to utilize its knowhow and, in certain instances, patented
technologies to maximize opportunities in scandium and other specialty metals.
The Company was incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada in 2006. The
Company currently trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol “EMC”.
Our focus of operations is the exploration and development of our specialty metals assets, including the
Nyngan scandium deposit located in New South Wales, Australia and the Tørdal scandium/rare earth
minerals deposit in Norway. Prior to January 1, 2014, the Company’s principal asset was the Springer
Tungsten mine and mill, held by the Springer Mining Company. On September 13, 2013, the Company
signed a binding Letter of Intent to sell 100% of the Springer Mining Company entity, its assets and mineral
and water rights to America’s Bullion Royalty Corp. (“AMB”), for $5 million cash. The transaction was
closed on December 31, 2013.
The sale also included the transfer of interests in the Company’s Carlin Vanadium property mineral assets
and the Copper King property tungsten assets in Nevada to AMB, along with Springer Tungsten.
One of EMC’s directors is also a director of the company that purchased Springer. The common director
recused himself from director level voting on all board level decisions related to the sale.
With the completion of the sale of the Tungsten asset, the Company’s focus is on the exploration and
evaluation of its specialty metals assets, specifically the Nyngan scandium deposit located in New South
Wales, Australia and the Tørdal scandium/rare earth minerals deposit in Norway. In June 2014, the
Company made the final installment payment to acquire the Nyngan property. The Company is an
exploration stage company and anticipates incurring significant additional expenditures prior to production
at any and all of its properties.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis that contemplates
the realization of assets and discharge of liabilities at their carrying values in the normal course of
business for the foreseeable future. These financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that may be
necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.
The Company currently earns no operating revenues and will require additional capital in order to advance
both the Nyngan and Tørdal properties. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is uncertain
and is dependent upon the generation of profits from mineral properties, obtaining additional financing and
maintaining continued support from its shareholders and creditors. These are material uncertainties that
raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. In the event that
additional financial support is not received or operating profits are not generated, the carrying values of the
Company’s assets may be adversely affected.
2.BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Basis of presentation
The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The
interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of EMC Metals
Corp. (the “Company”) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries with all significant intercompany transactions
eliminated. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods have been
made. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed
or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations. These interim condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2013 and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 25,
2014. Operating results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2014 may not necessarily be
indicative of the results for the year ending December 31, 2014.
Change in functional and presentation currency
The Company’s expenses and overheads are now primarily being incurred in United States Dollars
(“USD”) and it is anticipated that cash flows will continue to be primarily in USD. Accordingly the Company
determined that effective January 1, 2013, the functional currency of the Company would change from the
Canadian Dollar to the USD for the parent company and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
 
Use of estimates
The preparation of interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates
and assumptions related to the deferred income tax asset valuations, asset impairment, stock-based
compensation and loss contingencies. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current
facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the other sources. The
actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s
estimates. To the extent there are material differences between estimates and the actual results, future
results of operations will be affected.

Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
The  Company  measures  the  fair  value  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities  based  on  US  GAAP  guidance
which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements.
 
The  Company  classifies  financial  assets  and  liabilities  as  held-for-trading,  available-for-sale,  held-to-
maturity, loans and receivables or other financial liabilities depending on their nature. Financial assets and
financial  liabilities  are  recognized  at  fair  value  on  their  initial  recognition,  except  for  those  arising  from
certain related party transactions which are accounted for at the transferor’s carrying amount or exchange
amount.
 
Financial  assets  and  liabilities  classified  as  held-for-trading  are  measured  at  fair  value,  with  gains  and
losses recognized in net income. Financial assets classified as held-to-maturity, loans and receivables,
and  financial  liabilities  other  than  those  classified  as  held-for-trading  are  measured  at  amortized  cost,
using  the  effective  interest  method  of  amortization.  Financial  assets  classified  as  available-for-sale  are
measured  at  fair  value,  with  unrealized  gains  and  losses  being  recognized  as  other  comprehensive
income until realized, or if an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary, the unrealized loss is
recorded in income.
 
Financial  instruments,  including  receivables,  accounts  payable  and  accrued  liabilities,  convertible
debentures  and  promissory  notes  payable  are  carried  at  amortized  cost,  which  management  believes
approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments.
The following table presents information about the assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring
basis  as  at  September  30,  2014,  and  indicates  the  fair  value  hierarchy  of  the  valuation  techniques  the
Company utilized to determine such fair value. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs
utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values
determined by Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability, and included situations
where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset:

Recently Adopted Accounting Policies
On June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2014-10 (ASU 2014-10), Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain
Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in
Topic 810, Consolidation. ASU 2014-10 eliminates the requirement to present inception-to-date
information about income statement line items, cash flows, and equity transactions, and clarifies how
entities should disclosure the risks and uncertainties related to their activities. ASU 2014-10 also
eliminates an exception provided to development stage entities in Consolidations (ASC Topic 810) for
determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity
that is at risk. The presentation and disclosure requirements in Topic 915 will no longer be required for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and the revised consolidation
standards will take effect in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2014-10 effective for its financial statements for
the interim period ended September 30, 2014, and accordingly, is no longer presenting the inception-to-
date financial information and disclosures formerly required.
Accounting Standards Update 2013-05 - Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830) - Parent’s Accounting for
the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets
within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity. This standard provides guidance with
respect to the treatment of the cumulative translation adjustment upon the sale of a foreign subsidiary
whereby the cumulative translation adjustment associated with that subsidiary are taken into net income of
the parent company.
Accounting Standards Update 2013-11 - Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax
Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carry forward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carry forward
Exists. This accounting standard deals with the treatment of tax loss carry forwards. The Company has
reviewed this standard and has determined that it has little impact on the presentation of its financial
statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting Standards Update 2014-15 – Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Subtopic
205-40). This accounting pronouncement provides guidance in GAAP about management’s responsibility
to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and
to provide related footnote disclosures. In doing so, the amendments should reduce diversity in the timing
and content of footnote disclosures. The policy is effective December 15, 2016. The Company is
evaluating this guidance and believes it will have little impact on the presentation of its financial
statements.
RESTRICTED CASH
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Accounting Standards Update 2014-08 - Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property,
Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360) Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of
Components of an Entity. This accounting pronouncement provides guidance on the treatment of Property,
Plant and Equipment plus the reporting of discontinued operations and disclosure of disposals of
components of an entity. The policy is effective December 15, 2014. The Company is evaluating this
guidance and believes it will have little impact on the presentation of its financial statements.

mineral and water rights to Americas Bullion Royalty Corp. (“AMB”), for $5 million cash. The transaction
was finalized on December 31, 2013.
 
At the signing of the LOI, AMB paid $3.1 million directly to the existing convertible debt holder to retire a
maturing debt plus accumulated interest.
 
·Cash paid by AMB to the convertible debt holder paid the debt in full and released the security interest in
the Springer property and assets,
·The cash advanced by AMB formed a new loan, with AMB as lender, as at September 13, 2013,
· The new loan carries a zero interest rate, and
·AMB agreed to additionally fund all Springer property carrying costs until the final payment and closing
date.
The sale also included the transfer of interests in the Company’s Carlin Vanadium property mineral assets
and the Copper King property tungsten assets in Nevada to AMB, along with Springer Tungsten.
 
Springer was actively involved in the evaluation and re-start of the Company’s tungsten property, located
in Pershing County, Nevada. Going forward, the Company has no further assets located in the US or
continuing involvement with Springer.

Title to mineral property interests involves certain inherent risks due to the difficulties of determining the
validity of certain claims as well as the potential for problems arising from the frequently ambiguous
conveyancing history characteristic of many mineral property interests. The Company has investigated title
to all of its mineral property interests and, to the best of its knowledge, title to all of its properties is in good
standing.

SCANDIUM PROPERTIES
Nyngan, New South Wales Property
On February 5, 2010, the Company entered in to an earn-in agreement with Jervois Mining Limited
(“Jervois”), whereby it would acquire a 50% interest in the Nyngan Scandium property (the “Nyngan
Project”) located in New South Wales, Australia. The JV Agreement, as amended, gave the Company the
right to earn a 50% interest in a joint venture with Jervois, for the purpose of holding and developing the
Nyngan Project. On June 22, 2012, the Company received notice of a lawsuit filed against the Company
with regard to the achievement of certain milestones required under the JV Agreement. On February 6,
2013, the Company announced agreement of an out of court settlement to the dispute with Jervois. The
terms of the settlement transferred 100% ownership and control of the Nyngan Project to the Company, in
return for AUD$2.6 million cash payments and a percentage royalty payable to Jervois on sales of product
from the project. A total of $1,108,484 (AUD$1.2 million) was paid in June 2013 as part of the settlement. A
total of $1,364,031 (AUD$1.4 million) was paid in June 2014 to fulfill the obligations under the settlement
agreement which gives 100% of the property to the Company.
Tørdal and Evje-Iveland properties, Norway
During fiscal 2012 the Company entered into an option agreement with REE Mining AS (“REE”) to earn up
to a 100% interest in the Tørdal and Evje-Iveland properties pursuant to which the Company paid
$130,000 and issued 1,000,000 common shares valued at $40,000. To earn its interest, the original
agreement required the Company to pay REE an additional $500,000, incur $250,000 of exploration work
and issue 250,000 common shares upon releasing the second of two full feasibility studies on the two
properties. The Company subsequently renegotiated the payments required to earn the interest and the
Evje-Iveland property was removed from the option agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, the Company
earned a 100% interest in the Tørdal property by paying an additional $35,000 and granting a 1% Net
Smelter Return (“NSR”) payable to REE.
Hogtuva property, Norway
During fiscal 2011 the Company entered into an option agreement with REE to earn a 100% interest in
three scandium and beryllium exploration sites in Norway pursuant to which the Company paid $50,000.
To earn its interest, the original agreement required the Company to pay REE an additional $100,000 and
issue up to 200,000 common shares. During fiscal 2013, the Company renegotiated the payments required
to earn the interest and removed two of the exploration sites from the agreement.
Pursuant to the amendment, the Company earned a 100% interest in the Hogtuva property in consideration
for the $50,000 original payment and the grant of a 1% NSR payable to REE. In early fiscal 2014 a
decision was made by the Company not to renew its interest in the Hogtuva property and $50,000 in
acquisition costs were written off during the year ended December 31, 2013.

On February 22, 2013, the Company completed a $650,000 loan financing consisting of convertible
debentures. The convertible debenture had a maturity date of February 22, 2014 and bore interest at 10%
per annum. The lenders had the option to convert the loan into 13,000,000 common shares of the
Company. There was no beneficial conversion feature associated with the conversion option. The loan
was secured by an interest in the assets of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Wolfram Jack Mining
Corp. and the Company’s interest in the Hogtuva and Tørdal properties in Norway. This financing was
repaid in full in February 2014.
On February 17, 2012, the Company completed a $3,000,000 loan financing consisting of a term loan of
$1,000,000 (Note 8), a convertible debenture of $2,000,000 and warrants to acquire 3,000,000 common

annum. The lender had the option to convert a maximum of $2,000,000 of the principal amount of the loan
into 10,000,000 common shares of the Company. The loan was secured by an interest in the assets of the
Company’s subsidiary, Springer Mining Company. There was no beneficial conversion feature associated
with the conversion option. The warrants were exercisable at C$0.20 per share expiring February 15,
2014. A relative fair value of $217,267 was assigned to the warrants and recorded in additional paid in
capital. The Company paid financing costs of $249,827 and also issued 750,000 purchase warrants

a volatility of 120%, expected life of 2 years, risk free rate of 1.0% and expected dividend yield of 0.0% and
recorded in additional paid in capital. The financing costs were allocated between debt and the equity
components. This resulted in a convertible debenture carrying amount of $1,663,681 upon deducting a
debt discount of $336,319 from the principal balance of $2,000,000. During fiscal 2013, the Company
recognized $138,627 in accretion through interest expense. During fiscal 2012, the Company recognized

Promissory Note related to discontinued operations
Promissory note with a principal balance of $3,750,000, bearing interest
at 6% per annum, maturing July 3, 2013 and secured by land and water
rights.
During  fiscal  2008  the  Company  entered  into  a  promissory  note  for
$6,750,000 as consideration for the acquisition of land and water rights.
The  Company  subsequently  made  principal  payments  of  $3,000,000
consisting  of  a  cash  payment  of  $1,000,000  and  4,728,000  units  of  the
Company  equity  valued  at  $2,000,000.  Each  unit  consisted  of  one
common  share  and  one-half  share  purchase  warrant  exercisable  at
C$0.75  each  and  exercisable  for  a  period  of  two  years.  The  note  was
secured by a First Deed of Trust on the Cosgrave property land and water
rights.
In  June  2013  the  Company  returned,  to  the  note  holder,  the  Cosgrave
Ranch  for  the  value  of  the  promissory  note  thereby  extinguishing  this
debt. (Note 5)
 
Promissory Notes related to continuing operations
On June 24, 2014, the Company completed a $2,500,000 loan financing
which  includes  a  convertible  feature.  The  loan  has  a  maturity  date  of
December  24,  2015  and  bears  loan  interest  that  increases  in  quarterly
increments from 4% to a maximum of 12%. The full loan can be converted
into  an  effective  20%  JV  interest  in  Nyngan  and  Honeybugle.  This
conversion  features  can  convert  at  the  lender’s  option  or  once  EMC
raises  $3,000,000  million  in  equity.  The  20%  JV  partner  has  a  carried
interest until EMC meets two milestones: (1) filing a feasibility study on
SEDAR, and (2) receiving a mining license on either JV property. The JV
partner  becomes  fully  participating  on  development  and  build  costs
thereafter. The JV partner holds an option to convert their 20% JV interest
into  equivalent  value  of  EMC  shares,  at  market  prices,  rather  than
participate in construction. The JV partner’s option to convert its project
interest  to  EMC  shares  is  a  one-time  option,  at  such  time  the  partner
becomes fully participating on project costs. If the Company is unable to
raise $3,000,000 and repay the loan, the lender may exercise a purchase
option wherein the debt will be settled in exchange for 100% interest in
the Nyngan mineral rights.

EMC Corporate Overview
EMC is a specialty metals and alloys company focusing on scandium and other specialty metals. The
Company intends to utilize its knowhow and, in certain instances, patented technologies to maximize
opportunities in scandium and other specialty metals.
The Company was formed in 2006, under the name Golden Predator Mines Inc. As part of a reorganization
and spin-out of the Company’s precious metals portfolio in March 2009, the Company changed its name to
EMC Metals Corp. The Company currently trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol
“EMC”.
In 2013, the Company sold the Springer Mining Company, a tungsten mine and mill in Imlay, Nevada. The
sale of this asset allowed the Company to direct its efforts towards the development of its scandium
properties.
Our focus of operations is the exploration and development of our specialty metals assets, including the
Nyngan scandium deposit located in New South Wales, Australia and the Tørdal scandium/rare earth
minerals deposit in Norway. Prior to January 1, 2014, the Company’s principal asset was the Springer
Tungsten mine and mill, held by the Springer Mining Company. On September 13, 2013, the Company
signed a binding Letter of Intent to sell 100% of the Springer Mining Company entity, its assets and mineral
and water rights to America Bullion Royalty Corp., for $5 million cash. The transaction was closed on
December 31, 2013.
On February 5, 2010, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (“JV Agreement”) with Jervois
Mining Limited (“Jervois”) to develop the Nyngan scandium property in New South Wales, Australia. The
JV Agreement, came into dispute in February 2012, and was settled by the parties in February 2013. That
settlement provided for EMC to acquire 100% of the project for A$2.6 million cash, in two installments.
EMC has met the total payment obligation and now owns 100% of the project.
During the first half of 2014 EMC focused on financing the final required payments to secure the Nyngan
project rights. Those required payments were successfully financed in June, along with additional working
capital financings during June and July.
Principal Properties Review
Nyngan Scandium Project (NSW, Australia)
On February 5, 2010, EMC entered into an Exploration Joint Venture Agreement (“JV Agreement”) with
Jervois Mining Limited (“Jervois”) of Melbourne, Australia (ASX: JRV) to co-develop the Nyngan scandium
property in New South Wales, Australia which is commonly referred to as the Nyngan Scandium Project
(“Nyngan”). The JV Agreement, gave EMC the right to earn a 50% interest in a joint venture with Jervois,
for the purpose of holding and developing Nyngan, provided EMC met certain technical and financial
milestones. EMC met all financial requirements and delivered proof of technical milestone achievement to
Jervois on February 24, 2012.
 
 
16
On February 27, 2012, Jervois formally rejected EMC’s claim to have met the earn-in conditions specified
in the JV. The parties discussed and successfully reached an agreed settlement in February 2013 that
resolved all issues in dispute. The terms of the binding settlement provided for the transfer of 100%
ownership and control of the Nyngan Project, including the relevant exploration tenements and surface
(freehold) land holdings, to the Company, in return for AUD$2.6 million in future cash payments.. The
settlement agreement also applied a production royalty on the Nyngan project of 1.7% of sales for products
produced from the site, payable to Jervois. The royalty has a 12 year term from first production date, and a
10 tpa scandium oxide production minimum..
EMC has now completed all settlement payments required under its agreement with Jervois, and formal
transfer of the Nyngan Project Exploration Tenements is currently underway, with completion of the
transfers anticipated later in 2014.
Substantial Nyngan Project metallurgical test work has been completed, and additional work in this area is
planned for 2014. EMC intends to produce a Feasibility Study demonstrating project economics and
development viability on the project, expected to be completed in the second half of 2015.
Nyngan Property Description and Location
The Nyngan scandium resource is located approximately 500 kilometers northwest of Sydney, Australia.
The property consists of two exploration licenses, EL 6009 and EL 6096, which encompass over 9,000
hectares (29.6 sq km). Nyngan is classified as an Australia Property for purposes of financial statement
segment information.
The scandium resource is hosted within the lateritic zone of a geologic structure known as the Gilgai
Intrusion, one of several Alaskan-type mafic and ultramafic bodies which intrude on the Cambrian-
Ordovician metasediments, collectively called the Girilambone Group. This laterite zone, locally up to 60
meters thick, is layered from surface with hematitic clay, followed by limonitic clay, saprolitic clay,
weathered bedrock and finally fresh bedrock. The scandium mineralization is concentrated within the
hematitic, limonitic, and saprolitic zones with values in excess of 350 ppm scandium.
The location of the property is provided in Figure 2 below. The location of the exploration licenses are
provided below.

Nyngan Scandium Project – Development Overview
EMC established rights to the Nyngan Scandium Project in February 2010, and began advancing the
project understanding immediately. The first step taken was to establish a NI 43-101 Resource Report on
the property for scandium, which was completed and filed on SEDAR in May 2010.
In the two years prior to EMC involvement, EMC’s (former) partner, Jervois Mining Limited (“Jervois”) of
Melbourne, had commissioned several metallurgical studies on potential recovery systems for separating
scandium from the lateritic clays which contained the resource. EMC adopted and pursued this flow sheet
process architecture, in four key work programs:
1.  Roberts  &  Schaefer  (Utah,  USA)  was  commissioned  in  2010  to develop  a  preliminary,  conceptual
engineering  and  economic  report  for  the  processing  elements  of  the  project.  The  work  was  based
entirely on prior Jervois-commissioned test work research. No mining or commercial elements of the
project were considered, and the accuracy level was +/-50%, done for management only.
2.  Hazen Research (Colorado, USA) was commissioned in 2010 to do bench scale test work to confirm
the earlier property test work results provided by Jervois, which it did,
3.  Hazen Research was subsequently commissioned in 2011 to do pilot scale test work to further confirm
and optimize the process plant flow sheet, consistent with the acid bake systems, as initially defined,
and
4.  SNC-Lavalin  (Brisbane,  Australia)  was  commissioned  in  2011  to  do  a  feasibility  study  on  the
economics  and  process  viability  of  the  Nyngan  Scandium  Project,  to  absorb  the  Hazen  test  work
results, to confirm the project was economic, and to satisfy the primary condition of the JV with Jervois.
The SNC Report was done to inform management and the JV partners, and is not public information.
The Hazen test work and SNC Report were completed in early 2012. EMC had also commissioned some
different test work programs with SGS-Lakefield (Toronto, Canada), using Nyngan resource material,
beginning in late 2011 and continuing through 2013. This work focused on high pressure acid leach
(HPAL) rather than acid baking with concentrated sulfuric acid, and the results showed more promise for
Nyngan resource recoveries and suggested better suitability in the Nyngan locale.
Now that EMC is in full (100%) control of the Nyngan Scandium Project, the Company intends to
commission more process test work in 2014, to support a refined and optimized process flow sheet for
scandium recovery from the resource. The results of this work will be incorporated into a NI 43-101
Technical Report (feasibility study) for completion in Q3 2015.
Nyngan Property – NI 43-101 Mineral Resource
In March of 2010, a NI 43-101 technical report which outlined a resources estimate on the Nyngan
Scandium Project was completed and filed on SEDAR. The resource report, titled, “NI 43-101 Technical
Report on the Nyngan Gilgai Scandium Project, Jervois Mining Limited, Nyngan, New South Wales,
Australia”, was prepared by or under the supervision of Max Rangott (BSc). The resource estimate is
summarized below.

Nyngan Project - Flow Sheet Development Detail
Jervois commissioned various technical reports and studies on the Nyngan property resource in 2008-09.
These early technical/process reports were done by METCON Laboratories of Sydney, Australia, the
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Organization (CSIRO), Australia’s national science agency, and
by other research work groups, proprietary to or sourced by Jervois. The CSIRO designed a preliminary
processing plant flow sheet, that formed much of the early thinking around processing options at Nyngan.
EMC began efforts to duplicate this early work in late 2010, when the Company commissioned Hazen
Research, Inc. of Golden, Colorado to review and verify historical work from the Australian groups. In
January 2011, EMC announced results of phase I bench scale test work from Hazen that generally
confirmed historical findings on conventional acid leach systems, suggesting resource recoveries of up to
75%. No secondary recoveries were considered in these tests.
20
The second phase of the Hazen test work program, done to pilot plant scale, ran through all of 2011, and
involved larger scale testing of the high temperature acid bake water leach systems, solvent extraction
systems and product finish systems, as outlined and established by earlier CSIRO work. The overall
objectives of this expanded test work program were to define and optimize a process or series of
processes that achieved an 80% overall scandium recovery, with lowest possible capital and operating
costs, and the most benign environmental impact, using standard and accepted processes.
On January 19, 2012 EMC announced the results of the phase II Hazen test work program. EMC received
an independent metallurgical test-work report, titled "Purification of Scandium Extracted from Laterite Ore",
outlining the results of a number of pilot-scale tests on Nyngan resource material, and estimated recoveries
and grades of scandium oxide product. The report was independently prepared by Hazen and covered the
full results of the phase II pilot scale test work programs, completed in late November 2011.
 
Highlights of the 2011 Hazen phase II pilot scale test work were as follows:
·Results  of  conventional  sulfuric  acid  bake  and  water  leach  systems,  at  atmospheric  pressure,
demonstrated scandium recoveries averaging 75%,
·Results of conventional solvent extraction ("SX") on the pregnant leach solution, demonstrated scandium
recoveries exceeding 99%,
·Results on final stage precipitation of scandium oxide, focused on highest combined purity and recovery,
demonstrated scandium recoveries of 97.5%, at purity levels of 97.5% Sc2O3,
·Overall recovery results ranged from 70% to 80%, based on Nyngan ore type (limonite or saprolite), and
·All process assumptions were based on standard and accepted techniques for ore preparation, leaching,
solvent extraction and final product preparation.
In late 2011, EMC also commissioned some test work on high pressure acid leach (HPAL) processes, with
both Hazen and with SGS-Lakefield (Ontario, Canada). The initial HPAL work was applied to residue from
the acid bake process sourced from the earlier Hazen test work, specifically to determine if additional
scandium could be effectively recovered in a second pass with a pressure system. Those results were
encouraging, and led to later test work in 2012-13 which applied HPAL techniques directly on the laterite
resource material. No HPAL research results were included in the report and findings compiled for
management by SNC-Lavalin in early 2012. However, the work that subsequently continued on HPAL,
after that SNC Report was completed, is expected to be incorporated into future engineering studies and
flow sheet strategies for the Nyngan project. Existing HPAL work results were done to bench scale, and
not to pilot scale, and will be followed up with further test work in 2014 to confirm suitability as an
alternative to acid bake techniques.
Nyngan Project Environmental Permitting
In April, 2011 EMC announced a general progress report on the project which outlined a series of
environmental work steps designed to advance the Environmental Impact Study (“EIS”). Work steps
included both ground and surface water assessments, along with other assessments of Aboriginal,
ecology, traffic, noise and air quality matters.
All of this work has subsequently been completed, including 8 water bores with ongoing test monitoring
equipment, and reports on the various other targeted assessments, without material issues in any area. An
aerial photography and contour mapping program was also completed, to support the feasibility study work
regarding location of site facilities.
On January 18, 2012 EMC announced that that key elements of environmental site work on the Nyngan
Scandium Project were completed and a Conceptual Project Development Plan (CPDP) submitted to the
NSW, Australia state regulators. The CPDP submission forms the basis for an Environmental Impact Study
("EIS"), the foundation environmental document required for a mining permit in the state.
21
Specific EIS and property work, contained in the CPDP, completed by year end 2011:
·Draft ground water assessment study finalized and submitted to regulators,
·Surface water assessment results favorable, State review ongoing,
· Aboriginal heritage study finalized, no areas of significance,
· Soils study finalized, no issues, and
·Property aerial photography and contour mapping completed, location of site facilities defined.
Continuing EIS work underway:
·License applications (6), for access to groundwater as generated from property water bores have been
submitted,
·Flora and fauna studies are ongoing; to-date no significant issues have arisen, and
·Traffic, noise and air quality baseline monitoring are ongoing.
The environmental work was performed under direction from R. W. Corkery & Co., (Orange, NSW,
Australia), and formed part of the SNC-Lavalin Nyngan feasibility study.
Nyngan Preliminary Economic Assessment
On  October  14,  2014  the  Company  announced  completion  of  a  Preliminary  Economic  Assessment
(“PEA”).  entitled, NI 43-101F1 Technical Report on the Feasibility of the Nyngan Scandium Project. The
PEA  was  prepared  by  the  engineering  firm  of  Larpro  Pty  Ltd,  of  Brisbane,  Australia,  and  supported  by
Mining  One  of  Melbourne,  Australia  and  Rangott  Mineral  Exploration  Pty  Ltd  of  Orange,  Australia,  and
confirms the technical and economic potential of the Nyngan Scandium Project (the “Project”). The PEA
has been independently prepared as a technical report on the standards prescribed under NI 43-101 F1
Technical Report and is available for public review on the EMC website, www.emcmetals.com, or on the
Canadian public company reporting system SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
The PEA is preliminary in nature and should not be considered to be a pre-feasibility or feasibility study, as
the economics and technical viability of the Project have not been demonstrated at this time. While this
PEA does not consider or include any Inferred Mineral Resources, and does include only Measured and
Indicated Resources, it remains a preliminary analysis that is not sufficient to enable Project Resources to
be categorized as Mineral Reserves. Furthermore, there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.
We advise U.S. investors that while the terms “measured resources”, “indicated resources” and “inferred
resources” are recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission does not recognize these terms. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or
all of the material in these categories will be converted into reserves. It should not be assumed that any
part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category.
The PEA concludes the Project has the potential to produce 35,975 kilograms of scandium oxide (scandia)
per annum, at grades of 97%-99%, generating an after tax cumulative cash flow over a 20 year Project life
of US$565 million, with an NPV10% of US$175 million. The PEA also concludes the project can achieve
this financial result with a conventional flow sheet, employing high pressure acid leach (HPAL) and solvent
extraction (SX) techniques, which have been modeled and validated from METSIM modeling and bench
scale/pilot scale metallurgical test work.
PEA Financial Highlights and Key Assumptions
The PEA concludes the Project has the potential for robust economics, based on a capital estimate
supported by conventional process designs. The overall PEA level of accuracy is +/-30%. The PEA is
expressed in US dollar (US$) currency, unless otherwise noted. A foreign exchange rate of US$0.90
(1A$=US$0.90) to United States dollars (US$) was applied in all conversions. No escalation for inflation
was assumed in cash flows. All cash flows and discounted cash flows (NPVs and IRRs) in this news
release are shown on an after tax basis, based on a 30% tax rate.
22
Highlights and key assumptions are as follows:
Table 1. Nyngan PEA Financial Highlights
PEA Mineral Resource Estimate
The PEA does not alter the existing Nyngan Project resource estimate, established in 2010. The NI 43-101
Measured and Indicated scandium resource totals 12 million tonnes at an average grade of 261ppm
scandium, from both limonite and saprolite resource material. The PEA assumes that a portion of limonite-
only resource, in one particular area of the overall resource, will provide a 20 year mining pit sufficient to
supply the processing facility at a rate of 75,000 tpy and an average grade of 371ppm scandium. A 20 year
mining pit design was developed from drill hole data in support of this assumption and included in the
PEA.
The current Nyngan Project scandium mineral resource is as follows:
Table 2. Nyngan Scandium Resource(1)
(1)  Mineral resources that are not mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic viability.
 
PEA Mining and Processing Assumptions
Mining represents a relatively minor part of the overall Project activity, based on a plant feed of 240tpd or
75,000 tonnes per year requirement. Mine production is based on conventional open pit methods, strip
ratios of 1.5:1 to 3:1 (overburden/resource), contract mining assumptions and mining activity in campaigns
of one month, three times per year, avoiding the wet season. The plant will run continuously, fed from field
and plant stockpiles of mined resource, covered against moisture and weather.
The processing plant operations will size the input material, apply high pressure acid leaching (HPAL)
using sulfuric acid, and then recover the liberated scandium using solvent extraction (SX), oxalate
precipitation and calcination, to generate a finished scandium oxide product. The output of the plant is
forecast at 35,975 kilograms per year, at grades between 97% and 99%, as Sc2O3. Product output will be
refined to suitable grade for direct sales to end users, recognizing that grade varies based on application.
Plant tailings will be neutralized with lime to pH 8.5, dewatered, and stored in a permanent tailings facility
meeting the environmental requirements of mining permits and NSW State regulators.
 
 
23
PEA Capital Cost Assumptions
Total capital costs for the Project are estimated at US$77.4 million, and includes a 20% contingency. The
majority (70%) of the capital cost in the PEA was Australian-sourced, and consequently initially priced in
Australian dollars (A$), supported by direct vendor capital pricing. Concrete and steel costs have been
estimated from concept drawings, and piping, electrical and instrumentation costs were estimated using
standard industry factors. The capital cost estimate is considered to be +/-30% accuracy. Capital costs
included in overall cash flow include US$2 million per year for sustaining capital items (US$38M over full
PEA term), and US$3M in final reclamation costs in year 20. No salvage costs were assumed. On the
basis that the resource is adequate for 45 years at the assumed grade, it is unlikely the Project would be
closed in year 20 if current assumptions remain viable.
Table 3. PEA Capital Cost Detail
PEA Operating Costs Assumptions
Operating costs were estimated based on metallurgical test work results and METSIM modelling quantities
and requirements. The single most significant cost item in operating costs is sulfuric acid, which is used in
quantity and requires transport to site. The second most significant cost item is staff/labor cost. Reagents in
total  represent  approximately  57%  of  total  operating  cash  costs.  Quantities  were  established  through
METSIM  software  outputs,  and  were  100%  vendor-priced.  The  level  of  accuracy  on  the  operating
component costing in the PEA is +/-25%.
Operating cost details in the PEA are as follows:
Table 4. PEA Operating Costs, and Unit Costs Per kg Oxide
24
PEA Revenue Pricing Assumptions
The price assumption in the PEA is US$2,000 per kilogram (kg), as an average price covering all product
sold, over various product grades. Current pricing is substantially above these levels, based on small unit
quantities and varying grades. The pricing benchmark applied in the PEA was supported by limited current
trading and pricing information, EMC discussions with potential customers, and the understanding that
lower prices than scandium trades for today will be necessary to penetrate potential markets with
significant sales tonnages in the future.
PEA Sensitivities Analysis
The project is most sensitive to changes in product pricing, and somewhat less sensitive to either
operating cost or capital cost changes, as shown below.
Table 5. Profitability Sensitivities to Changes in Key Assumptions
25
PEA General Assumptions
The PEA is presented on a 100% ownership basis. Potential conversion of an existing loan to the
Company into a 20% interest at the project level in the Nyngan Scandium Project is a possibility, but at
present the Company retains 100% of the Project.
All cash flows and financial analyses have been presented on a 100% equity basis. No debt leverage has
been assumed in providing capital for development. No inflation factors have been applied to future cash
flows, making the discounted cash flow performance measures constant dollar figures. Had inflation been
applied to future cash flow streams, the NPVs and IRRs would have been higher.
The PEA incorporated considerable metallurgical test work independently prepared for EMC over the
previous four years, along with engineering, project design work and economic estimates done previously
for EMC management. The PEA also utilized existing environmental and detailed mine planning work
previously undertaken on the property, and previously incorporated in prior management studies. The PEA
had the benefit of prior flow sheet designs, and results, but it did not compare previous designs. The batch
autoclave HPAL design presented in the PEA was the only design considered.
PEA Conclusions and Recommendations
This PEA consolidates a significant amount of metallurgical test work and prior study on the Nyngan
Scandium Project. The work demonstrates a viable, conventional process flow sheet utilizing the HPAL
leaching process, and good metallurgical recoveries of scandium from the resource. The metallurgical
assumptions are supported by various bench and pilot scale independent test work programs that are
consistent with known outcomes in other laterite resources. Combined with the capital cost estimate, the
Project exhibits robust financial outcomes.
The PEA recommends that project owners proceed to a full feasibility study, including additional test work
to confirm certain key process variants. Those recommendations include:
·Consider test work to support process changes that could reduce capital/operating costs,
·Conduct a comparative study between batch and continuous autoclave systems,
·Consider/test certain alternative reagents/techniques in the solvent extraction area,
·Conduct  test  work  to  develop  engineering  parameters  around  the  materials  handling  properties  of  the
laterite resource as it relates to optimum sizing for best leach results, and
·Conduct test work on pumping and settling properties of process slurries.
Tørdal Scandium/REE Property (Norway)
During 2011 we entered into two option agreements with REE Mining AS of Norway, to obtain exploration
rights  to  several  properties  in  central  and  southern  Norway.  The  Tørdal,  Evje-Iveland  and  Hogtuva
properties are classified as Norway Property for purposes of financial statement segment information.
Option agreements to acquire the Tørdal and Evje-Iveland exploration properties were entered into in April
2011,  followed  by  an  option  agreement  on  the  Hogtuva  property  in  September  2011.  Both  of  these
agreements  were  subsequently  renegotiated  to  secure  100%  ownership  positions  for  EMC.  Based  on
exploration  results  and  holding  costs,  the  Evje-Iveland  and  Hogtuva  properties  were  subsequently
dropped and the Tørdal property holdings have been reduced from 140 sq km to 90 sq km.
Tørdal Property Location

2012 Tørdal Field Exploration
On February 14, 2013 we announced promising results from field exploration work on the Tørdal property
during  the  summer  and  fall  months  of  2012,  focused  on  scandium-bearing  pegmatites.  The  2012  work
included independent assay results of pegmatite rock samples taken from one specific property area, and
also  includes  an  extensive  pegmatite  mapping  program  covering  approximately  30  sq  km.  The  assay
results  indicated  the  presence  of  high  levels  of  scandium  and  various  rare  earth  elements  (REE’s),
including  heavy  rare  earth  elements  (HREE’s)  in  particular.  Field  XRF  readings  indicated  elevated
scandium  content  in  hundreds  of  large  and  small  pegmatite  bodies  found  and  mapped  in  the
reconnaissance area.
Highlights of the results of the 2012 field exploration are as follows:
·Tørdal 2012 assays of pegmatite rocks show presence of both scandium and REE’s,
· Best scandium assays exceed 1,600 ppm,
·Promising HREE assay results from pegmatites with gadolinite mineralization,
·Host rock mineralization points to higher grade scandium or HREE contents,
·2012 summer exploration program mapped and sampled over 300 pegmatites,
·A total of 1,940 Niton XRF scandium readings were taken on whole rock samples, and
·Overall program results at Tørdal are very encouraging and warrant expanded exploration.
 
Tørdal Assay Results (Grab Samples)
Work  originally  began  on  the  property  in  2011,  with  a  summer  exploration  program  that  consisted  of
reconnaissance, surface soil sampling, and limited pegmatite mapping work in a relatively small area north
of the village of Kleppe, in Southern Norway.
As  a  follow-on  from  that  2011  program,  the  company  then  returned  to  the  same  area  and  conducted  a
series  of  ‘blasts’,  using  small  explosive  charges  to  generate  whole  rock  samples  on  select  exposed
pegmatites, at the locations of the best soil sample results. The exploration team planned 9 blasts and
conducted 8, on 5 different pegmatite bodies, from which they assembled 23 grab samples for analysis and
assay by OMAC Laboratories in Ireland. Assay results on these samples were received in Q1 2012—in
time  to  help  formulate  the  2012  summer/autumn  season  pegmatite  mapping  program,  conducted  on  a
much wider area.
27
Independent assay results on 20 of the 23 samples, covering all 5 targeted pegmatites, are shown below.
Assay results are as-reported elemental assay results from OMAC Laboratories, and are not converted to
oxide equivalent (REO & Sc2O3). Heavy rare earth elements abbreviated “HREE”; and include
Yttrium;Total rare earth elements abbreviated “TREE”.
The numbered assay samples were formed either by random selection of fresh (un-weathered) whole rock
material broken loose from individual pegmatite bodies, or alternatively, based on selectively collecting
fresh rock material that was clearly (1) garnet-laden, (2) mica-laden, or showed clear visible (3) gadolinite
mineralization. Gadolinite is a beryllium and rare earth-bearing mineral with the chemical formula
[(Ce,La,Nd,Y)2FeBe2Si2O10]. The intent was to determine from assay results if certain visible
mineralization correlated to the presence and concentrations of target elements; specifically scandium,
rare earth elements (REE’s), or other metals of interest and value.
The results in the assay table indicate that all of the selected pegmatites contain interesting levels of both
REE’s and scandium. In general, all of the pegmatites contained both target elements, while the mica
phase appears to hold the higher scandium concentrations with small REE additions, and the gadolinite
phase holds the highest REE concentrations and small scandium additions. The presence of garnet
material in samples tended to generate interesting but moderate values for both REE’s and scandium.
Assay work was designed to identify 30 specific elements, including all 16 REE elements plus scandium,
and the relative concentration of heavy REE’s was of particular interest. The mica and garnet grab sample
materials had generally only trace levels of thorium and uranium (average <15 ppm), while the gadolinite
grab sample materials had thorium levels between 2,500-5,000 ppm, and uranium levels between 500-
1,300 ppm. A full table of OMAC assay results related to these 23 sample analyses is available on EMC’s
website at www.emcmetals.com.
Tørdal Pegmatite Mapping Program
 
Following on from the 2011 work and the 2012 assay results, EMC conducted an expanded 2012 summer
work reconnaissance program at both Tørdal and Evje-Iveland, from July through October. The goals of
the 2012 program were to develop detailed mapping of outcropping pegmatite fields over a much broader
area than the 2011 program, while also conducting field sampling of scandium mineralization on those
pegmatites using a hand-held Niton XRF Analyzer.
 
 
28
The 2012 program concentrated on five separate areas (approximately 30 sq km) as can be seen in the
map below:
 
 
A total of 1,940 Niton XRF readings were logged on whole rock and pegmatite mineral separates, logged
against individually mapped and numbered pegmatite bodies. The XRF readings ranged up to +6,000 ppm
scandium  (on  a  mineral  separate),  and  averaged  661  ppm  on  1,504  total  logged  readings  above  the
instrument’s 20 ppm detection limit. XRF readings focussed on scandium data collection only, although the
team diligently noted the visible presence of gadolinite and amazonite mineralization.
 
The reader is cautioned that hand-held Niton XRF readings are not the same as laboratory assays, and
are not NI 43-101 compliant with regard to estimating resource grades. However, the Company is confident
that  these  data  readings  are  highly  useful  in  confirming  and  shaping  the  next  stage  of  the  exploration
program on this property.
 
A summary of results by area is as follows:
·Area 1 (Kleppe); Mapped more than 50 pegmatite bodies. Best average XRF Sc readings from 1,000-
1,500 ppm, some very large surface expressions. Gadolinite present.
 
·Area 2 (Heftetjern); Partially mapped more than 40 pegmatite bodies, many large surface expressions,
green amazonite mineralization. Better XRF Sc readings from 500-1,500 ppm.
 
·Area 3 (Solli); Mapped numerous large and small pegmatites. Generally lower XRF Sc readings, ranging
300-700 ppm. Red feldspars, quartz and gadolinite mineralization present.
 
·Area 4 (South Kleppsvatn); Partially mapped large area containing more than 80 pegmatites, generally
mica-based. Typical XRF Sc readings in the 300-900 ppm range, with some reaching 1,500 ppm Sc.
 
·Area  5  (Buvatn);  Partially  mapped,  numerous  pegmatite  bodies,  some  very  large.  Typical  XRF  Sc
readings in the 300-1,000 ppm range. Old feldspar quarries, amonizite mineralization present.
 
Similar  work  done  at  Evje-Iveland  (total  180  sq  km)  identified  several  interesting  target  areas,  but
scandium  readings  were  not  sufficiently  attractive  when  compared  to  results  at  Tørdal,  and  led  to  the
decision to drop the Evje-Iveland property. The exploration results of the 2012 work program also allowed
EMC to selectively reduce property holdings at Tørdal .
 
 
29
Tørdal Exploration – Next Steps
EMC’s mapping and sampling work has confirmed that much of the Tørdal property is heavily populated
with complex, near-surface pegmatite bodies. Based on hand-held XRF readings and mineralogy, these
pegmatites show excellent promise for significant scandium enrichment, particularly within bodies
containing micas, and for REE mineralization where the rare earth silicate gadolinite is present. Based on
the results of 2012 exploration work, planning for future exploration work is warranted, subject to funding
constraints.
 
Qualified Person and Quality Assurance/Quality Control
Sampling methods followed industry quality control standards. Mr. Kjell Nilsen, an independent geologist
consultant currently employed by EMC, conducted the reconnaissance and sampling on the property.
Individual whole rock grab samples were collected by hand shovel, from areas where blasted material
could be seen to have come from blast points on pegmatite bodies. The assayed samples were
individually bagged, sealed, logged on the grid map as to location, boxed in a container suitable for
mailing, and sent by express mail to OMAC Laboratories Limited in Galway, Ireland for testing. Assay
testing on the samples utilized an ICP-MS spectrometer (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry)
to test for numerous elements, specifically scandium. The numerous Niton XRF (X-ray Fluorescence)
readings were taken at field locations, logged and identified with individual numbered pegmatites, located
on grid maps, by the field geology team. Mr. Willem Duyvesteyn, Chief Technology Officer of EMC, is the
Qualified Person who is responsible for the design and conduct of the exploration program, and reviewed
the program results.
Honeybugle Scandium Property (NSW, Australia)
On April 2, 2014 the Company announced that it had secured a 100% interest in an exploration license (EL
7977) covering 34.7 square kilometers in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The license area is located
approximately 24 kilometers west-southwest from EMC’s Nyngan Scandium Project and approximately 36
kilometers southwest from the town of Nyngan, NSW. The license held by EMC covers only a part of the
Honeybugle geologic complex.
The Honeybugle tenement contains lateritic material common to the region. The property itself is located in
semi-arid broad-acre wheat farming country and is routinely planted. Farming is the largest industry in the
area, although mining activity is evident, past and present.
The tenement includes four (4) distinct magnetic anomalies; Seaford, Woodlong, Yarran Park and Mallee
Valley, which reflect underlying mafic to ultramafic bedrock. These areas were previously identified by
groups exploring principally for platinum, nickel and cobalt in the 1980’s, but scandium was of little interest.
Surface soil and rock chip sampling conducted by previous license holders and EMC, on each of the four
areas, did detect anomalous scandium values that are well above background levels (20-30 ppm). The
results of this previous soil sampling work is what led to EMC’s interest in acquiring the Honeybugle
exploration tenements.
Honeybugle Drill Results
On May 7, 2014 the company announced completion of an initial program of 30 air core (AC) drill holes on
the property, specifically at the Seaford anomaly, targeting scandium (Sc). Results on 13 of these holes are
shown in detail, in the table below. These holes suggest the potential for scandium mineralization on the
property similar to EMC’s Nyngan Scandium property.
Highlights of initial drilling program results:
·The highest 3-meter intercept graded 572 ppm scandium (hole EHAC 11)
·EHAC 11 also generated two additional high grade scandium intercepts, grading 510 ppm and 415 ppm,
each over 3 meters,
·The program identified a 13-hole cluster which was of particular interest;
·intercepts on these 13 holes averaged 270 ppm scandium over a total 273 meters,
· at an average continuous thickness of 21 meters per hole,
·representing a total of 57% (354 meters) of total initial program drilling.
·The  13  holes  produced  29  individual  (3-meter)  intercepts  over  300  ppm,  representing  31%  of  the
mineralized intercepts in the 273 meters of interest, and
·This initial 30-hole AC exploratory drill program generated a total of 620 meters of scandium drill/assay
results, over approximately 1 square kilometer on the property.
30
The detail results of 13 holes in the initial drill program are as follows:
Seaford is characterized by extensive outcrops of dry, iron-rich laterites, allowing for a particularly shallow
drill program. Thirty (30) air core (AC) holes on nominal 100-meter spacing were planned, over an area of
approximately 1 square kilometer. Four holes were halted in under 10 meters depth, based on thin laterite
beds, low scandium grades, and shallow bedrock.
The 13 holes highlighted in the table are grouped together on either side of Coffills Lane, and represent all
of the drill locations where meaningful intercept thickness generated scandium grades exceeding 175
ppm. Some of these 13 holes showed significant scandium values on the immediate surface, and
alternately, other holes exhibited favorable scandium grades that began at shallow depth. The highest
grade Sc sample was found in a 21-24 meter interval (572 ppm), although several holes produced better
than 350 ppm Sc intercepts at depths of under 9 meters. The deepest hole (EHAC 7) was drilled to 57
meters, showing good scandium grades over a 12-meter horizon (245 ppm) near the bottom of the hole,
from 39 to 51 meters depth. Higher scandium grades were associated with higher iron levels. Holes were
drilled to a depth where they contacted the fresh ultramafic bedrock, which generally signalled the end of
any scandium enrichment zones.
The drill plan divided Seaford into four sub-areas, 1-4, as highlighted on the map below. Area 1 was
relatively higher ground and therefore the least impacted by ground moisture. Consequently this dryer area
received the greatest attention, although that had been the general intention in the plan. Area 1 received
17 holes, with 13 presented in detail in the table above. Areas 2-4 were each intended as step-out areas
that need to be further examined in the next program. The three step-out areas did not generate results of
particular note, although hole locations were not optimal due to ground conditions and access.
31
·Area 2 received 3 holes, 60 meters total, and generated Sc grades from 45-75 ppm,
 
·Area 3 received 4 holes, 87 meters total, and generated Sc grades from 47-122 ppm,
 
·Area 4 received 5 holes, 72 meters total, and generated Sc grades from 60-101 ppm, and
 
·The average depth of all of these holes was 18 meters, with the deepest 30 meters.
 
Initial Drill Program Map
 
 
This 13-hole cluster (Area 1) was noted to be in a relatively thick laterite zone which was constrained to the
west by contact with metasediments, to the east by fresh ultramafic bedrock, and to some extent in the
north by a poor intersection result in hole 30. Area 1 remains somewhat open to the south, with the two
southern-most holes (EHAC 9 and EHAC 29) generating some of the best scandium grade intercepts in
the area.
The surface and near surface mineralization at this property is an advantage, both in locating areas of
interest for future exploration work, and also because of extremely low overburden ratios. This particular
characteristic for the Honeybugle property is different to EMC’s Nyngan property, where mineralization is
typically covered by 10-20 meters of barren alluvium.
Further drilling at Seaford is warranted, based on the results of this introductory and modest program,
specifically to the north and south of the existing area 1 drill pattern, along with investigation and select
drilling at the other three remaining anomalies on the property.
Qualified Person and Quality Assurance/Quality Control
John Thompson, B.E. (Mining); Vice President - Development at EMC Metals Corp is a qualified person as
defined in NI 43-101 and has reviewed the technical information on this property. The drilling, sampling,
packaging and transport of the drill samples was carried out to industry standards for QA/QC. EMC
employed an independent local geology consulting and drill supervisory team, Rangott Mineral
Exploration Pty. Ltd., (RME) of Orange, NSW, Australia, to manage the drill work on-site. Bulk samples of
drill returns were collected at one metre intervals from a cyclone mounted on the drilling rig, and a separate
three-tier riffle splitter was used on site to obtain 2.0-4.5kg composite samples collected over 3 metre
intervals, for assay. Individual sample identifiers were cross-checked during the process. The assay
samples were placed in sealed polyweave bags which remained in RME’s possession until the
completion of the drilling program, at which time they were transported to RME’s office in Orange. There,
the sequence of sample numbers was validated, and the assay samples were immediately submitted to
Australian Laboratory Services’ (ALS’) laboratory in Orange. The remnant bulk samples, which were
collected in sealed polythene bags, were transported by RME to a local storage unit at Miandetta, for long-
term storage.
 
ALS/Orange dried and weighed the samples, and pulverized the entire sample to 85% passing 75 microns
or better (technique PUL-21). These 50g sample bags of pulps were then sent to the ALS laboratory at
Stafford in Brisbane, Queensland for analysis. ALS/Brisbane analyzed the pulps for scandium, nickel,
cobalt, chromium, iron and magnesium, using Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy
(ICP-AES) after a four acid (total) digestion (technique ME-ICP61). The lower detection limit for scandium
using this technique is 1ppm. For their internal quality control, ALS/Brisbane added 4 standard samples
(for 20 repeat analyses), 10 blank samples and 16 duplicate samples to the batch. Please see news
release see news release dated May 7, 2014 and available on www.sedar.com for further information on
the Honeybugle drill results.

Explanation
 
The Company’s results from one year ago included a write-down of assets
on the sale of the Springer mine in the second half of 2013.
 
The Company reduced its debt load from one year ago with the sale of the
Springer operations in the second half of 2013. The lower debt resulted in
lower interest costs in the current quarter.
 
$59,500 of this favorable variance is the result of certain accruals for salary
in  2013  being  renegotiated  to  much  lower  costs  in  2014.  Without
consideration of the renegotiated salaries, the actual variance is $(1,438),
bringing the costs in line for the two quarters.
 
Lower  amortization  is  reflective  of  the  fact  that  the  assets  held  in  our
Sparks office are declining in value.
 
Costs for the comparative periods are almost identical.
 
In 2014 travel to Australia to work on the Nyngan project resulted in the
higher costs when compared to 2013.
 
Increased salary expenses in Q3 2014 relate to the return of the CFO to a
more active role in the Company when compared to one year ago.
 
Unfavorable variance is due to legal fees incurred in association with June
2014 loan financing transaction. No such costs were incurred in Q2 2013.
 
In  Q3  2013,  certain  consulting  costs  carried  in  the  books  of  EMC  were
reallocated to Springer Mining Company, resulting in a credit balance in
that period. This variance is favorable when the costs associated with the
sale of Springer are taken into consideration.
 
In Q3 2013, the Canadian dollar weakened against the US dollar making
those assets held in Canadian dollars worth less when converted to US$.
In Q3 2014 the Canadian dollar weakened to a greater extent resulting in
funds held in Canadian dollars being devalued.
 
In Q3 2013, very little exploration took place as the Company was making
every  effort  to  conserve  cash.  With  a  new  financing  agreement  in  place
during  June  2014  and  private  placements  in  Q2  and  Q3  of  2014,  the
Company increased work effort on the Nyngan project in Australia.
 
The Company issued stock options in Q3 of 2014 of which 72% vested
immediately  and  resulted  in  an  expense  of  $272,292.  In  2013,  a  lower
number  of  options  were  granted  during  the  quarter,  resulting  in  a  lower
option expense.

Explanation
The Company’s results from one year ago included a write-down of asset
value on the sale of the Springer mine in the second half of 2013.
In 2013, the Company was making interest payments on the loan taken out
in February of 2012. This loan matured in August 2013 and the sale of the
Springer  operation  was  used  to  extinguish  that  debt.  Smaller  financings
were taken subsequent which has resulted in lower financing costs.
 
Lower overall activity in 2014 as well as a renegotiation of accrued costs
has resulted in this favorable variance.
 
Decreased  salary  expenses  in  2014  are  as  a  result  of  the  Company’s
decision  to  forgo  salaries  for  key  executives  in  an  effort  to  conserve
capital.
 
Consulting  in  the  pursuit  of  the  Springer  mine  and  mill  sale  in  2013
resulted in the higher consulting costs when compared to 2014. No such
costs were incurred in 2014.
 
In  2014,  the  Company  carried  out  a  small  exploration  program  at  its
Honeybugle operation and began work on the Nyngan project resulting in
costs  of  $292,763.  In  the  prior  year  funds  were  expended  to  secure  the
Nyngan project in Australia resulting  in  the  cost  differential  between  the
two comparative periods.
 
In  2014,  the  Company  received  a  refund  on  workers  compensation
premiums  charged  in  the  prior  year.  This  adjustment  resulted  in  current
charges being lower than in 2013.
 
Lower  amortization  is  reflective  of  the  fact  that  the  assets  held  in  our
Sparks office are declining in value.

higher costs when compared to 2013.
 
Unfavorable variance is due to legal fees incurred in association with June
2014 loan financing transaction. No such costs were incurred in Q2 2013.
 
In 2013, the Canadian dollar strengthened against the US dollar making
those assets held in Canadian dollars worth more when converted to US$.
In  2014  there  was  weakening  against  the  US  dollar  making  the  bank
deposits held in Canadian funds lower in value.
 
The  Company  issued  stock  options  in  Q3  2014  of  which  72%  vested
immediately  and  resulted  in  an  expense  of  $272,292.  In  2013,  a  lesser
number of options were granted resulting in a lower option expense.
Cash flow discussion for the nine month period ended September 30, 2014 compared to September 30,
2013
The cash outflow for operating activities was $944,534, a decrease of $70,743 (September 30, 2013 –
$1,015,277), due to decreased activity levels as described in the variance analysis in addition to an
increase in accounts payable and the collection of accounts receivable during the period.
Cash outflows for investing activities were $1,214,163, an increase of $105,679 (September 30, 2013 –
$1,108,484), principally due to the final payment made to secure the Nyngan project which was larger than
the Nyngan payment made in 2013.
Cash inflows from financing activities increased by $571,713 to $2,520,888 (September 30, 2013 -
$1,949,175), reflecting the repayment of a convertible debenture of $650,000 and a promissory note of
$1,204,875 which was more than offset by the issuance of share capital of $1,875,763 and the issuance of
a loan of $2,500,000. In Q1 2013, the Company took out the $649,175 convertible loan and the promissory
note of $1,300,000.

(December 31, 2013 - $785,075) primarily due to the issuance of share capital netting the Company
$1,875,763 and the issuance of a new promissory note of $2,500,000. This was partially offset by the
repayment of a convertible debenture in the amount of $650,000 and a promissory note of $1,204,875.
Prepaid expenses and receivables
Accounts receivable decreased by $94,740 to $32,670 due primarily to the receipt of cash early in January
on the finalization of the Springer sale (December 31, 2013 - $127,410).
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment consist of office furniture and computer equipment at the Sparks, Nevada
office. The decrease of $2,875 to $7,403 (December 2013 - $10,278) is due to amortization of net fixed
assets.
Mineral interests
Mineral interests increased by $1,364,031 to $2,977,234 due to the final payment to acquire the Nyngan
property in Australia of A$1,400,000 (December 31, 2013 - $1,613,203).
Accounts Payable
Accounts Payable has decreased by $41,959 to $205,654 (December 2013 – $247,613) due to payment of
deferred salary payments for key staff members from the first six months of this year.
Convertible Debenture
Convertible debentures decreased by $650,000 to $Nil (December 31, 2013 - $650,000) due to the
repayment of a convertible debenture taken out in Q1 of 2013.
Promissory notes payable
The promissory notes payable increased by $1,295,125 due to the negotiation of a new loan of $2,500,000
which was partially offset by the repayment of the prior promissory note of $1,204,875 (December 31, 201 -
$1,204,875).
Capital Stock
Capital stock increased by $1,875,763 to $89,186,471 (December 31, 2013 - $87,310,708) as a result of a
stock issuance in the period.
Additional paid-in capital increased by $272,292, to $2,380,619 (December 31, 2013 - $2,108,327) as a
result of expensing of stock options.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At September 30, 2014, the Company had a working capital deficit of $1,525,718 including cash of
$1,147,266 as compared to a working capital deficit of $1,190,003 including cash of $785,075 at
December 31, 2013.
At September 30, 2014, the Company had a total of 15,378,750 stock options exercisable between
CAD$0.05 and CAD$0.315 that have the potential upon exercise to generate a total of C$1,608,638 in
cash over the next five years. There is no assurance that these securities will be exercised. The
Company’s continued development is contingent upon its ability to raise sufficient financing both in the
short and long term. There are no guarantees that additional sources of funding will be available to the
Company; however, management is committed to pursuing all possible sources of financing in order to
execute its business plan. The Company continues its cost cutting measures to conserve cash to meet its
operational obligations.

month period ended September 30, 2014.
Proposed Transactions

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting policies requires
management of the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on past experience, industry trends and
known commitments and events. By their nature, these estimates are subject to measurement uncertainty
and the effects on the financial statements of changes in such estimates in future periods could be
significant. Actual results will likely differ from those estimates.
Stock-based compensation
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options and
compensatory warrants granted. This model is subject to various assumptions. The assumptions the
Company makes will likely change from time to time. At the time the fair value is determined; the
methodology the Company uses is based on historical information, as well as anticipated future events.
The assumptions with the greatest impact on fair value are those for estimated stock volatility and for the
expected life of the instrument.
Future income taxes
The Company accounts for tax consequences of  the  differences  in  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and
liabilities  and  their  tax  bases  using  tax  rates  expected  to  apply  when  these  temporary  differences  are
expected to be settled. When the future realization of income tax assets does not meet the test of being
more likely than not to occur, a valuation allowance in the amount of the potential future benefit is taken
and no future income tax asset is recognized. The Company has taken a valuation allowance against all
such potential tax assets.
37
Mineral properties and exploration and development costs
The Company capitalizes the costs of acquiring mineral rights at the date of acquisition. After acquisition,
various factors can affect the recoverability of the capitalized costs. The Company’s recoverability
evaluation of our mineral properties and equipment is based on market conditions for minerals, underlying
mineral resources associated with the assets and future costs that may be required for ultimate realization
through mining operations or by sale. The Company is in an industry that is exposed to a number of risks
and uncertainties, including exploration risk, development risk, commodity price risk, operating risk,
ownership and political risk, funding and currency risk, as well as environmental risk. Bearing these risks
in mind, the Company has assumed recent world commodity prices will be achievable. The Company has
considered the mineral resource reports by independent engineers on the Nyngan project in considering
the recoverability of the carrying costs of the mineral properties. All of these assumptions are potentially
subject to change, out of our control, however such changes are not determinable. Accordingly, there is
always the potential for a material adjustment to the value assigned to mineral properties and equipment.
Recently Adopted Accounting Policies
On June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2014-10 (ASU 2014-10), Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain
Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in
Topic 810, Consolidation. ASU 2014-10 eliminates the requirement to present inception-to-date
information about income statement line items, cash flows, and equity transactions, and clarifies how
entities should disclosure the risks and uncertainties related to their activities. ASU 2014-10 also
eliminates an exception provided to development stage entities in Consolidations (ASC Topic 810) for
determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of the amount of investment equity
that is at risk. The presentation and disclosure requirements in Topic 915 will no longer be required for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and the revised consolidation
standards will take effect in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2014-10 effective for its financial statements for
the interim period ended September 30, 2014, and accordingly, is no longer presenting the inception-to-
date financial information and disclosures formerly required.
Accounting Standards Update 2013-05 - Foreign Currency Matters (Topic 830) - Parent’s Accounting for
the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets
within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity. This standard provides guidance with
respect to the treatment of the cumulative translation adjustment upon the sale of a foreign subsidiary
whereby the cumulative translation adjustment associated with that subsidiary are taken into net income of
the parent company.
Accounting Standards Update 2013-11 - Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax
Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carry forward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carry forward
Exists. This accounting standard deals with the treatment of tax loss carry forwards. The Company has
reviewed this standard and has determined that it has little impact on the presentation of its financial
statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting Standards Update 2014-15 – Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Subtopic
205-40). This accounting pronouncement provides guidance in GAAP about management’s responsibility
to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and
to provide related footnote disclosures. In doing so, the amendments should reduce diversity in the timing
and content of footnote disclosures. The policy is effective December 15, 2016. The Company is
evaluating this guidance and believes it will have little impact on the presentation of its financial
statements.
Accounting Standards Update 2014-08 - Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property,
Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360) Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of
Components of an Entity. This accounting pronouncement provides guidance on the treatment of Property,
Plant and Equipment plus the reporting of discontinued operations and disclosure of disposals of
components of an entity. The policy is effective December 15, 2014. The Company is evaluating this
guidance and believes it will have little impact on the presentation of its financial statements.
Financial instruments and other risks
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash, receivables, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, convertible debentures and promissory notes payable. It is management's opinion that the
Company is not exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from its financial
instruments. The fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying values unless
otherwise noted. The Company has its cash primarily in one commercial bank in Vancouver, British
Columbia, Canada.

Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain
certain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to those with
respect to the prices of metals, the estimation of mineral resources and reserves, the realization of mineral
reserve estimates, the timing and amount of estimated future production, costs of production, capital
expenditures, costs and timing of the development of new deposits, success of exploration activities,
permitting time lines, currency fluctuations, requirements for additional capital, Government regulation of
mining operations, environmental risks, unanticipated reclamation expenses, title disputes or claims and
limitations on insurance coverage and the timing and possible outcome of pending litigation. In certain
cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects” or “does
not expect”, “is expected”, “estimates”, “intends”, “anticipates” or “does not anticipate”, or “believes” or
variations of such words and phrases, or statements that certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”,
“would”, or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
EMC to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied
by the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, the actual results of
current exploration activities, conclusions or economic evaluations, changes in project parameters as
plans continue to be refined, possible variations in grade and or recovery rates, failure of plant, equipment
or processes to operate as anticipated, accidents, labor disputes or other risks of the mining industry,
delays in obtaining government approvals or financing or incompletion of development or construction
activities, risks relating to the integration of acquisitions, to international operations, and to the prices of
metals. While EMC has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or
results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors
that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no
assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events
could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place
undue reliance on forward-looking statements. EMC expressly disclaims any intention or obligation to
update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Not applicable.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
At  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Quarterly  Report  on  Form  10-Q  for  the  nine  months  ended
September 30, 2014, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of
the  Company's  management,  including  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  ("CEO")  and  Chief  Financial  Officer
("CFO"),  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  design  and  operation  of  the  Company's  disclosure  controls  and
procedures  (as  defined  in  Rule  13a-15(e)  and  Rule  15d-15(e)  under  the  Exchange  Act).  It  is  the
responsibility of the Company’s management for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting for the Company.
The Company took into consideration the following three characteristics common to companies of a similar
size:
·The limited number of personnel in smaller companies, which constrains the Company’s ability to fully
segregate conflicting duties;
·The Company relies on an active Board and management with open lines of communication to maintain
the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures; and
·The dynamic and evolving nature of smaller companies, which limits their ability to have static processes
that are well-documented.
In  addition,  management  has  relied  upon  certain  informal  procedures  and  communication,  and  upon
“hands-on”  knowledge  of  senior  management  to  maintain  the  effectiveness  of  disclosure  controls  and
procedures.
Based on that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered
by  this  report,  the  Company's  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  and  internal  control  over  financial
reporting are effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports
that  it  files  or  submits  to  the  SEC  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  is  recorded,  processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material
information  required  to  be  disclosed  in  our  reports  filed  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow
for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the period covered by this report, there were no changes to internal control over financial reporting
that  materially  affected  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect  our  internal  control  over  financial
reporting.
