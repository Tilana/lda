and Patras, and held consultations with Government officials at central and local levels, 
civil society organizations and migrants themselves. 
</p>
<p> While recognizing that progress has been made on laws and policies directed 
towards managing migration and border management, much remains to be done in order to 
ensure the full respect for the human rights of migrants in Greece. 
</p>
<p> As Greece is the custodian of an external European Union border, presently one of 
the main points of irregular border crossings into Europe, the Special Rapporteur notes the 
need for a European-wide approach to this issue, focused on human rights.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Fran&#231;ois Cr&#233;peau, 
conducted an official visit to Greece from 25 November to 3 December 2012 at the 
invitation of the Government. The mission was carried out in the context of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8223;s year-long study on the human rights of migrants at the borders of the European 
Union (EU). The general management of the external borders of the European Union and its 
impact on the human rights of migrants is dealt with in the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s main report 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/23/46); this report deals more specifically with the human rights situation of 
migrants in Greece, as observed by the Special Rapporteur during his visit. 
</p>
<p>2. As the visit focused mainly on border management, this report does not provide a 
comprehensive overview of the human rights situation of migrants in Greece, but is limited 
to what the Special Rapporteur observed while trying to identify the impact on the European 
Union&#8223;s border management in the country. 
</p>
<p>3. During the mission, which included visits to Athens, Evros, Lesvos and Patras, the 
Special Rapporteur met with State officials at the national and local levels, international 
organizations, representatives of the European Union, civil society organizations and 
migrants themselves. He also visited 11 detention centres: Tychero Border Police Station in 
Evros, Venna and Komotini detention centres in the neighbouring Rodopi regional unit, the 
central police station in Mytilini on Lesvos, the central police station in Patras, the coast 
guard&#8223;s detention facility at the port in Patras, Korinthos detention centre, Amygdaleza 
</p>
<p>detention centre, Amygdaleza detention centre for minors, Agios Panteleimonas police 
station and Petrou Ralli detention centre. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation for the cooperation extended to 
him by the Government prior to, throughout and after the visit. He also thanks the 
international organizations in Greece, including the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and Greek civil society organizations, for their 
valuable contributions. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background: Migration and border management in 
Greece 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Greek-Turkish border is presently one of the main points of irregular border 
crossings into Europe. This is in large part due to its geographical location, at the south-east 
border of the European Union, and its proximity with countries which are, or have been, 
experiencing serious conflicts.  
</p>
<p>6. During the summer of 2012, Greece implemented Operation &#8220;Aspida&#8221; (shield) at the 
Greek-Turkish land border and a crackdown, known as Operation &#8220;Xenios Zeus&#8221;, on 
irregular migrants residing in Athens and elsewhere. The sweep operations in the context of 
&#8220;Xenios Zeus&#8221; have led to massive arrests and detention, including of migrants in a regular 
situation and others who have lived and worked in Greece for several years.  
</p>
<p>7. Migrants are particularly touched by the financial crisis in Greece and many of those 
who used to work in the informal sector, including in agriculture, have lost their jobs. The 
presence of a large number of migrants in the streets of Athens, many unemployed and some 
homeless, has reportedly led to some social and political tension. This was explained to the 
Special Rapporteur as part of the reason behind Operation &#8220;Xenios Zeus&#8221;, simply to remove 
</p>
<p>the migrants from the streets of Athens.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>8. The situation of irregular migrants residing in Greece has further deteriorated due to 
the significant increase in xenophobic violence against them. Xenophobic attacks against 
migrants have escalated during the past year and the entry into Parliament for the first time 
of the extreme right-wing political party Chryssi Avgi (Golden Dawn) has further 
exacerbated the situation.  
</p>
<p>9. It is estimated that there are around 470,000 irregular migrants currently living in 
Greece. For the overwhelming majority, Greece is not their final destination, but simply 
their entry point to the European Union and the Schengen area. However, many irregular 
migrants have become stuck in Greece as they are prevented from moving on to other 
European countries due to several mechanisms at the European Union level.  
</p>
<p>10. While the Schengen agreement abolished checks at internal borders and created a 
single external border for the signatory countries, irregular migrants who try to leave Greece 
on the ferries to Italy are apprehended and charged with attempting to leave the country 
irregularly. Those who make it to Italy are, if detected, prevented from disembarking from 
the ferry and returned to Greece through informal push-backs1. &#8220;Poseidon Sea&#8221;, the Frontex 
operation which used to cover the sea border between Greece and Turkey, was extended in 
2012 to also cover the west coast of Greece, where migrants trying to reach Italy by small 
boats operated by smugglers are intercepted and returned to Greece.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Normative and institutional framework for the protection of 
the human rights of migrants 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>11. Greece is a party to core international human rights treaties, with the exception of 
the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of their Families; the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance (signature only, 2008); and the optional protocols to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment  (signature only, 2011); to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights; and to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications 
procedure. 
</p>
<p>12. Greece has adhered to the principal international treaties relating to the protection of 
refugees, as well as to the prevention, suppression and punishing of trafficking. However, it 
has not adhered to the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness or the 
International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions on migrant workers (Nos. 97 and 143) 
or on domestic workers (No. 189).  
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>13. As a member state of the Council of Europe since 1949, Greece is a party to the 
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and 
the European Social Charter. However, it has not ratified the European Convention on the 
Legal Status of Migrant Workers (signed in 1977) or the Convention on Action against 
Trafficking in Human Beings (signed in 2005). 
</p>
<p>  
 1 A/HRC/23/46/Add.3  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>14. The European Union&#8223;s <i>acquis</i> on migration and asylum is applicable to Greece as a 
European Union member state, and Greece has transposed relevant EU directives into 
national legislation. Greece is also a part of the Schengen area, which provided for the 
strengthening of external border controls and eliminated internal border controls. 
Furthermore, as a member state of the European Union, Greece has an obligation to respect 
the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union when implementing EU law. 
</p>
<p><b> C. National legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. National laws 
</b></p>
<p>15. According to the Greek Constitution (art. 28, para. 1), international treaties ratified 
by Greece shall be an integral part of domestic Greek law, and shall prevail over any 
contrary provision of the law.  
</p>
<p>16. The Greek Constitution guarantees respect and protection of the value of the human 
being (art. 2); full protection of life, honour and liberty, irrespective of nationality, race or 
language, religious or political beliefs for all persons living within Greek territory (art. 5, 
para. 2) and inviolability of personal liberty (art. 5, para. 3). Furthermore, no person shall be 
arrested or imprisoned without a reasoned judicial warrant which must be served at the 
moment of arrest or detention pending trial, except when caught in the act of committing a 
crime (art. 6, para. 1) and torture, any bodily maltreatment, impairment of health or the use 
of psychological violence, as well as any other offence against human dignity are prohibited 
and punished as provided by law (art. 7, para. 2). Every person shall be entitled to receive 
legal protection by the courts and may plead before them his views concerning his rights or 
interests, as specified by law (art. 20, para. 1) and the right of a person to a prior hearing 
also applies in any administrative action or measure adopted at the expense of his rights or 
interests (art. 20, para. 2). 
</p>
<p>17. The main law governing migration is Law 3386/2005, which regulates the entry, 
residence and social integration of third-country nationals into Greek territory. Under Law 
3386/2005, illegal entry is a criminal offence (art. 83.1): &#8220;Third-country nationals who exit 
or attempt to exit Greece or enter or attempt to enter Greece without legal formalities shall 
be punished by imprisonment of at least three months and a fine of at least EUR one 
thousand five hundred (&#8364;1,500).&#8221; 
</p>
<p>18. Law 3907/2011, which entered into force on 26 January 2011, provides for the 
creation of an independent Asylum Service and an Appeals Authority, the establishment of a 
First Reception Service, and the adaptation of Greek legislation to EU Directive 
2008/115/EC (EU Returns Directive) on the return of irregular migrants. Law 3772/2009 
foresees stricter administrative and penal sanctions on smugglers and considers their 
activities a felony.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. National policies and institutions 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Hellenic Police, under the Ministry of Public Order and Citizen Protection, is 
responsible for the surveillance of land borders; detention of migrants, including the 
management of detention centres; deportations and the asylum system. The Hellenic Coast 
Guard, under the Ministry of Shipping, Maritime Affairs and the Aegean, is responsible for 
the surveillance of sea borders. The Ministry of Interior is responsible for regular migration, 
including immigration policy and the social integration of immigrants. Previously under the 
Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity, the reception system for asylum seekers, 
vulnerable groups of migrants and unaccompanied children is currently the responsibility of 
the Ministry of Labour. The relevant European funds (Solidarity and Management of 
Migration Flows (SOLID) funds) have been under different ministries. Spreading the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>responsibility for migration issues across several ministries makes it difficult to have a 
holistic approach to all aspects of migration. While there is an Inter-ministerial Committee 
on Migration, this Committee does not meet regularly.  
</p>
<p>20. The Greek authorities assured the Special Rapporteur that they are trying to ensure a 
more holistic approach to migration by moving both responsibility for the reception system 
and for the European Refugee Fund to the Ministry of Public Order and Citizen Protection, 
which is already responsible for the External Borders Fund and the European Return Fund. 
Furthermore, the new Asylum Service, Appeals Authority and First Reception Service will 
also operate under this ministry. However, the Special Rapporteur notes that the Ministry of 
Public Order and Citizen Protection, of which the police is one of its main components, may 
not be best placed to ensure the rights of migrants. He was assured, however, that the 
Hellenic Police will have no involvement in the Asylum Service, Appeals Authority, First 
Reception Service or European Refugee Fund. He hopes that giving one ministry the overall 
responsibility for migration will lead to a more holistic approach to migration, with an 
emphasis on the human rights of migrants.  
</p>
<p>21. In August 2010, Greece submitted to the European Commission a National Action 
Plan on Asylum and Migration Management, which addressed the gaps for managing 
migration and asylum in the Greek system, including in relation to screening procedures, 
asylum procedure, facilities for families with children and vulnerable groups, improving 
detention conditions and return procedures. The Action Plan led to the adoption of Law 
3907/2011, although the services provided for by this law (First Reception Service, Asylum 
Service, Appeals Authority) are yet to be operationalized, due to insufficient budget and 
staff. The Special Rapporteur was informed that all three services should be operational by 
June 2013. He urges the Greek Government and the European Union to work together to 
ensure their swift operationalization, including by providing appropriate staffing and budget.  
</p>
<p>22. A revised Action Plan on Asylum and Migration Management was presented to the 
European Commission in January 2013. The revised plan is based on two dimensions: 
access to international protection and the establishment of an effective system of border 
management and returns. It provides timetables for the operationalization of the First 
Reception Service and the new Asylum Service, and indicates that the new integrated 
migration management system in Greece will modernize the asylum system, protect 
vulnerable migrants, strengthen border control and pre-removal centres and increase the 
return of irregular migrants. The Special Rapporteur hopes that the implementation of this 
action plan will be carried out with full respect for the human rights of migrants. 
</p>
<p>23. The National Commission on Human Rights (NCHR) was established by Law 
2667/1998. It is accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; status by the International Coordination Committee of 
National Human Rights Institutions. The Ombudsman was established by Law 2477/1997. 
Law 3907/2011 provides for removal procedures to be subject to external control by the 
Ombudsman (art. 23.6). The Office of the Ombudsman and the NCHR are important 
institutions, able to enhance the protection of the human rights of migrants in Greece, 
including through visits to detention facilities. However, due to budgetary constraints, the 
Special Rapporteur observes that they are unable to carry out such visits systematically. The 
Special Rapporteur thus urges Greek authorities to ensure them a sufficient budget and 
guarantee the financial autonomy of the NCHR, in accordance with the Paris Principles. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Border management and returns 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background  
</b></p>
<p>24. In 2010, irregular migration across the Aegean Sea was diverted to the Greek-
Turkish land border, which can be attributed in part to the cooperation between the Greek 
and Turkish coast guards, and the deployment of Frontex in the area. However, this shift 
seems to also have been partly due to the completion of the demining operations on the 
Greek side of the land border, and the cheaper smuggling prices at that entry point. 
Migration was diverted back to the islands of the Aegean Sea in the summer of 2012, when 
Greek authorities significantly strengthened border controls at the land border through its 
Operation &#8220;Aspida&#8221;, which included the deployment of 1,800 additional border guards. 
</p>
<p>25. The Greek-Turkish land border is approximately 200 kilometres long, and with the 
exception of a 10.5 kilometre long stretch, it follows the Evros River. A fence covering 
those 10.5 kilometres was completed by the end of 2012, thus preventing migrants from 
crossing the border on land. Crossing the river is also increasingly difficult due to enhanced 
surveillance, including the use of a helicopter and thermal cameras. The main goal for Greek 
authorities, as explained to the Special Rapporteur, is to spot migrants before they cross over 
from the Turkish side of the river. When they spot migrants on the Turkish side, Greek 
police notify the Turkish authorities who proceed to apprehend the individuals. If Turkish 
authorities are unable to apprehend someone, Greek boats patrolling the river make their 
presence known in order to prevent migrants from crossing. 
</p>
<p>26. Close cooperation between Greek and Turkish authorities at the land border has 
been in place since summer 2012. Coupled with electronic surveillance of the border, 
deployment of patrol boats on the Evros river and completion of the border fence, this has 
led to a significant reduction of migrants crossing the Evros border (over 90 per cent since 
August 2012, according to Greek authorities). Most of the migrants who try to cross this 
border are now apprehended on the Turkish side. A decrease in apprehensions on the 
Turkish side of the border since October 2012 indicates that the migration flow towards the 
Greek-Turkish land border has diminished.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional framework and cooperation with FRONTEX 
</b></p>
<p>27. Border surveillance is carried out in cooperation with Frontex, currently through the 
joint operations &#8220;Poseidon Land&#8221; and &#8220;Poseidon Sea&#8221;. In 2010, Joint Operation RABIT 
(Rapid Border Intervention Teams) 2010 was deployed, as &#8220;a situation of &#8222;exceptional and 
urgent&#8223; pressure was experienced&#8221; at the Greek-Turkish border. Its objectives were to 
stabilize the situation, decrease the migratory pressure and support national authorities in 
building capacity. The RABIT deployment ended after four months and &#8220;Poseidon Land&#8221; 
and &#8220;Poseidon Sea&#8221; then continued. 
</p>
<p>28. A Schengen evaluation of Greece in 2010-2011 detected shortcomings regarding 
control of the external land and sea borders. Greece thus drew up a national action plan on 
how to remedy these shortcomings. The &#8220;Schengen-Greece Action Plan&#8221; identified concrete 
actions to address the border management shortcomings identified in the Schengen 
evaluation.  
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur heard numerous reports of pushbacks of migrants by Greek 
border guards from the Greek to the Turkish side of the Evros river in the past. However, he 
was pleased to hear that this has decreased significantly. He was also pleased to hear how 
seriously Frontex appears to be taking this issue, and that they report all cases of pushbacks 
to their own hierarchy, as well as to Greek authorities.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>30. The new fence and other efforts to seal the Evros border have led migrants to 
attempt the more dangerous journey crossing the Aegean Sea in small rubber dinghies, often 
exploited by unscrupulous smugglers. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur appreciates the 
dedication shown by both the Hellenic Coast Guard and Frontex in rescuing migrants in 
need. However, he stresses that while Greece has a right to control its own borders, sealing 
the border is impossible, and migrants will continue arriving regardless of Greek efforts to 
stop them. The Special Rapporteur thus urges Greek authorities and Frontex to implement a 
human rights-based approach to border management in their cooperation, with the safety of 
the migrants as the first consideration always. Furthermore, a full screening of all newly 
arrived migrants should be undertaken in order to identify protection needs. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Readmission agreements 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Greece-Italy readmission agreement 
</b></p>
<p>31. A readmission agreement between Greece and Italy was signed in 1999. It obliges 
both parties to accept &#8220;without formalities&#8221; the return of a third-country national who does 
not satisfy the conditions for entry or stay, when authorities can demonstrate the person has 
travelled irregularly from one country to the other. The agreement states that its provisions 
should not prejudice the application of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees or other international human rights instruments binding on its signatories. 
However, it does not provide any explicit references to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child or the principles therein, such as giving primary consideration to the best interests of 
the child. Furthermore, the procedures provided for in this agreement are not always 
complied with. Migrants detected as stowaways or upon disembarkation from a ferry in Italy 
are often returned by Italian authorities, on the same ship, without the formality of 
requesting permission from Greece. This also includes unaccompanied children.2 
</p>
<p>32. Greek authorities should insist that Italian authorities respect the conditions of the 
readmission agreement, and refuse summary returns outside said agreement. Furthermore, 
upon the return of migrants from Italy to Greece, Greek authorities should conduct 
individual screenings in order to identify unaccompanied children, asylum seekers, victims 
of trafficking and other protection needs. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Greece-Turkey and EU-Turkey readmission agreements 
</b></p>
<p>33. A readmission protocol between Greece and Turkey was signed in 2002. The 
Special Rapporteur is concerned that this agreement focuses almost exclusively on 
combatting &#8220;illegal&#8221; migration. While it &#8220;does not affect the rights and obligations arising 
</p>
<p>from other international agreements binding upon the Parties&#8221;, it does not provide any 
specific guarantees for respecting the human rights of migrants, such as non-refoulement or 
the principle of the best interests of the child. Given the obstacles to access asylum 
procedures and to identify other vulnerable groups such as unaccompanied children, victims 
of trafficking and victims of torture in Greece, there is a serious risk that persons returned 
under the readmission agreement with Turkey might indeed be in need of protection.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur notes that the number of migrants returned to Turkey under 
the bilateral agreement is low, and that Greece expects that it will be able to readmit more 
migrants once the EU-Turkey readmission agreement enters into force.3 
</p>
<p>  
 2 See A/HRC/23/46/Add.3.  
 3 See A/HRC/23/46/Add.2.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur strongly urges Greece to fully respect its human rights 
obligations in relation to all its readmission agreements, including the Greece-Italy, Greece-
Turkey and EU-Turkey agreements. The non-refoulement principle must always be 
respected for all migrants proposed for readmission. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Deportations 
</b></p>
<p>36. Deportations are implemented by the police, with some funding provided through 
the European Return Fund. &#8220;Project Attica&#8221;, coordinated by Frontex, supports building 
</p>
<p>return capacities through screening, facilitating cooperation with embassies and 
coordinating detention and return flights. 
</p>
<p>37. Law 3907/2011 provides for the deportation of third-country nationals found 
remaining irregularly in Greece. For irregular migrants apprehended in connection with 
irregular crossing of the external borders, the applicable legislation is Law 3386/2005 (art. 
76). Expulsion is ordered by the competent police authorities and the decision may be 
appealed within five days to the Minister of Public Order or the body authorized thereby; 
lodging an appeal shall result in the suspension of enforcement of the decision (art. 77). 
Objections against an expulsion may also be lodged with the competent administrative 
courts; however, an appeal before the courts does not automatically suspend the deportation.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that as there is no automatic judicial review of 
deportation orders and access to interpreters and lawyers is not guaranteed, there is a real 
risk of refoulement of persons in need of international protection or of other violations of 
international human rights law. He thus urges Greek authorities to provide for judicial 
review of all deportation orders and to respect procedural guarantees. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Voluntary returns 
</b></p>
<p>39. The European Return Fund provides support for assisted voluntary returns, inter 
alia, through a programme implemented by the International Organization for Migration 
(IOM) in cooperation with the Ministry of Citizen Protection/Hellenic Police Headquarters 
and UNHCR. UNHCR presence ensures that migrants applying for voluntary return are 
informed of the possibility of applying for asylum and staying in Greece until their asylum 
application has been decided upon.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur was informed that on average, 100-120 migrants show up at 
the IOM premises every day in order to apply for assisted voluntary return, and that there 
are funds for 10,000 voluntary returns in 2013. IOM is running an information campaign in 
this regard. Most of the migrants who return under the voluntary return programme receive 
EUR 300 when they leave Greece, while a few receive re-integration packages worth 
approximately EUR 2000, in order to ensure living expenses until they find a job or to 
receive education when they return home. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur also notes the work by the Greek Police Force, who carried 
out 4,236 assisted voluntary returns in 2012. Provided that they are implemented in full 
respect of the human rights of migrants and they are genuinely voluntary, the Special 
Rapporteur believes that assisted voluntary return programmes provide a good way for 
irregular migrants to return home with dignity; he encourages the continuation and 
expansion of these programmes. Providing more reintegration packages could increase the 
number of voluntary returns for migrants who are stuck in Greece with no way to either 
make a living there or continue their journey towards other European countries. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11</b> 
</p>
<p><b> V. Detention of migrants in an irregular situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Detention practices and legislation  
</b></p>
<p>42. The detention of migrants is based on Law 3386/2005, for those detained upon entry 
at the external border, and Law 3907/2011, which implements the EU Returns Directive, for 
those detained while already residing in Greece. It is unclear to the Special Rapporteur why 
two different laws are used. He notes, however, that according to the EU Returns Directive, 
States may decide not to apply the Directive to persons who are apprehended or intercepted 
in connection with their irregular border crossing. Law 3907/2011, if properly implemented, 
would provide more safeguards for migrants than Law 3386/2005, including the provision 
of alternatives to detention. 
</p>
<p>43. Law 3386/2005 allows for the detention of irregular migrants pending their 
deportation if he or she has infringed the provisions of said law (art. 76.3). Law 3907/2011 
provides for migrants who are subject to return procedures to be detained for preparation of 
their return and enforcement of the removal procedure, unless other sufficient, but less 
coercive measures can be implemented in a specific case (art. 30.1). However, during his 
visit to Greece, the Special Rapporteur learned that, in practice, no &#8220;less coercive measures&#8221; 
exist; migrants are routinely detained also under Law 3907/2011. In most cases, the 
authorities consider that being in an irregular situation automatically constitutes sufficient 
reason for detention.  
</p>
<p>44. Law 4075/2012 amended Presidential Decree 114/2010 and Law 3386/2005, 
providing for migrants and asylum seekers to also be detained if they represent &#8220;a danger to 
public health,&#8221; when they &#8220;suffer from an infectious disease,&#8221; &#8220;belong to groups vulnerable 
to infectious diseases,&#8221; or are living in &#8220;conditions that do not meet minimum standards of 
hygiene&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that these measures are discriminatory and 
target the most vulnerable migrants, and that they will lead to even more stigmatization. He 
also notes that the majority of the medical problems migrants in detention suffer from are 
caused by, or directly linked to, their detention conditions in Greece. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur deeply regrets the Greek Government&#8223;s new policy of 
systematically detaining all irregular migrants detected entering Greek territory, including 
families and unaccompanied children, as well as the &#8220;sweep operations&#8221; and subsequent 
</p>
<p>detention in the context of Operation &#8220;Xenios Zeus&#8221;. Due to the limited detention capacity, 
the Special Rapporteur noted that, in some parts of the country, migrants are released 
relatively fast and issued with an order to leave the country. This is particularly the case for 
families with children arriving in the Aegean islands. However, several new detention 
centres (called pre-removal centres) were built in 2012, and there are plans to build more, in 
order to increase the detention capacity in the country to 10,000 persons. The construction 
of these centres is partly financed by the European Return Fund. The Special Rapporteur is 
worried that this will lead to long-term detention for most, or even all, irregular migrants 
detected in Greece. According to Greek authorities, this new policy will be implemented in 
order to &#8220;send a strong signal to third-country nationals willing to illegally enter Greece,&#8221; in 
order to &#8220;warn all immigrants who do not fall under the status of international protection 
</p>
<p>that they will be arrested, detained and returned to the countries of origin&#8221;4.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur regrets the excessive duration of detention of migrants &#8211; six 
months, which may be extended up to 18 months if the person refuses to cooperate or if 
there are delays in obtaining necessary documentation (Law 3907/2011, arts. 30.5 and 30.6, 
</p>
<p>  
 4 Greek Action Plan on Asylum and Migration Management, p. 53.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>and Law 3386/2005, art.76.3), which is the maximum provided for in the EU Returns 
Directive. The long duration has been justified as a deterrent mechanism for other potential 
migrants, whether or not a durable solution can be found in each individual case. Also 
asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application in Greece may be detained for up to 
18 months, since the provisions governing the maximum length of detention for asylum 
seekers changed in October 2012.  
</p>
<p>47. Furthermore, migrants whose deportation is unlikely, inter alia, due to the situation 
in their country of origin or the non-cooperation of consular authorities, are routinely 
detained. The Special Rapporteur regrets this practice, which does not seem to comply with 
the purpose of detention as stated in the law, namely, to prepare for deportation. Law 
3907/2011 states that when a reasonable prospect of removal no longer exists, detention 
ceases to be justified and the person concerned shall be released immediately (art. 30.4). 
This does not seem to be implemented in practice. Law 3907/2011 further provides for a 
mechanism to deal with non-removable irregular migrants in the form of issuance of a 
certificate of suspension of removal (art. 24). The Special Rapporteur urges the Greek 
authorities to effectively apply this provision and to release all non-removable migrants.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Detention conditions  
</b></p>
<p>48. Irregular migrants are detained up to several months in various establishments, such 
as police stations, border guard stations and coast guard facilities, which are clearly not 
suitable for long-term detention. There are also some dedicated migration detention centres, 
some of which are converted military camps or police academies. As common standards are 
not applied, the detention conditions and the safeguards available vary significantly in the 
different establishments and locations. The Special Rapporteur visited 11 detention facilities 
in Greece. In general, detention conditions at all were inappropriate. Migrants were locked 
in their cells for most of the day with no activities to keep them occupied. Several of the 
detention centres did not have fenced-in outdoor areas, thus police officers were reluctant to 
letting the migrants go outside at all, as they risk disciplinary action if a migrant escapes. 
The conditions at Venna detention centre were particularly poor, and the Special Rapporteur 
was pleased to hear that this centre closed down shortly after his visit. 
</p>
<p>49. In some of the detention facilities, the migrants had limited access to toilets; some 
facilities had no artificial lighting so that during the winter, migrants were in the dark from 
early afternoon. Most of the detention facilities visited lacked heating and hot water and the 
detainees complained about insufficient amounts and poor quality of food, lack of soap and 
other hygiene products, as well as insufficient clothing, shoes and blankets. The medical 
services offered in some of the facilities by KEELPNO (Hellenic Centre for Disease Control 
and Prevention) were highly insufficient. Some of the centres had no permanent medical 
staff, and relied on daily visits by KEELPNO only. The Special Rapporteur met with several 
detainees who had visible health problems, but who had not received appropriate medical 
care. The Special Rapporteur noted the strong need for specialized staff in each detention 
facility, including doctors, nurses, psychologists, social workers and interpreters.  
</p>
<p>50. While the Special Rapporteur heard many reports of severe overcrowding in recent 
months and weeks, at the time of his visit, the situation in the detention facilities visited 
seemed to have improved. As an example, the detention capacity at Lesvos central police 
station is 28, and during the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s visit there were 26 detainees there. 
However, he was informed that a few weeks before his visit, 120 migrants were kept in the 
same space. In several of the facilities visited, migrants were sleeping on mattresses on the 
floor. Korinthos was particularly crowded, with approximately 70 detainees in each cell and 
very little space to move around. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur was particularly concerned at the detention of families at 
Petrou Ralli, as well as the detention of unaccompanied children at Amygdaleza detention 
facility for minors. At Petrou Ralli, families were separated, with women, girls and small 
boys kept on one floor, and men and teenage boys held separately on another floor. Families 
were thus split in three, and were only allowed to meet briefly in the evenings. Detention 
conditions were totally unacceptable: beds were concrete slabs, and some of the detainees 
were sleeping on mattresses on the floor; there were no toilets in the cells and as the 
migrants sometimes had to wait a long time before being allowed to go to the toilet, they 
resorted to using plastic bottles for this purpose. While there were two courtyards &#8211; for men 
and for women &#8211;, migrants were locked up in their cells most of the day. There were toys 
for the children to play with in the courtyard, but nothing in the cells.  
</p>
<p>52. At Amygdaleza detention facility for minors there was a small &#8220;cage&#8221; which was 
supposed to serve as a courtyard, but the Special Rapporteur was told that the children rarely 
went outside. Children thus remained inside with few activities and very little to keep them 
occupied. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that unaccompanied children, as well 
as families with children, not be detained at all, but rather be subjected to non-custodial 
measures, if necessary. For families, this should apply to the whole family, in accordance 
with the best interests of the child and the right to family unity.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Procedural safeguards 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned that detainees have limited ability 
to contact their families, limited access to legal assistance or consular services and little or 
no professional interpretation services.  
</p>
<p>55. In general, the detainees the Special Rapporteur met with had little or no information 
in a language they could understand about the reasons for detention, its duration, or the right 
to challenge their detention and deportation, despite the fact that Law 3386/2005 provides 
for the right to be informed about the reasons for detention in a language he or she 
understands (art. 76.3). While some detention centres had information posted on the walls 
near the entrance or in booklets, these were rarely available inside the cells or anywhere else 
where migrants could access the information. Those who had applied for asylum often had 
no information about the status of their case, and others could not apply for asylum from the 
detention facility (see section VI below). 
</p>
<p>56. Migrants are detained upon decision of the competent police authority (Law 
3386/2005, art. 76.2) and there is no automatic judicial review of the decision. Although 
migrants may present objections to their detention (Law 3386/2005, art. 76.3 and Law 
3907/2011, art. 30.2)), this is not automatic and does not provide for a direct review of the 
lawfulness of the detention. Moreover, objections need to be submitted in writing and in 
Greek. Access to an interpreter and lawyer is not guaranteed, which makes objection to the 
detention decision virtually impossible, particularly as detention and deportation orders are 
written in Greek. The Special Rapporteur was also informed of problems with access to 
detention facilities and communication with detainees for groups providing legal assistance 
to migrants. 
</p>
<p>57. Law 3907/2011 introduced an automatic judicial review of the legality of detention 
(art. 30.3); however, it regulates the extension of detention only and not the detention per se. 
The Special Rapporteur was also informed that the review is undertaken automatically, with 
no reference to the specificities of each case, and the fact that expulsion of a migrant has not 
yet been possible constitutes reason enough for the judge to extend the detention.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>58. Some of the migrants who had engaged private lawyers complained that the lawyers 
would simply take their money and not follow up on their cases. The Special Rapporteur 
heard these allegations from several migrants in different detention centres and he urges 
Greek authorities to take them seriously and find a solution to the problems relating to 
effective legal representation of detained migrants. 
</p>
<p>59. Contact with the outside world was difficult for some detained migrants. Of all the 
detention facilities the Special Rapporteur visited, Korinthos was the only which allowed 
migrants to have mobile phones. In the other facilities, access to a phone was not guaranteed 
for those who did not have money to pay for calls themselves, and mobile phones were 
confiscated for unspecified &#8220;security&#8221; reasons. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur is further concerned at the insufficient training and 
sensitization of staff in detention centres on international human rights standards and 
principles regarding the rights and treatment of persons deprived of their liberty, both with 
respect to detention conditions as well as safeguards. He received numerous complaints of 
police ill-treatment, both at the time of the apprehension and while in detention. He urges 
the Greek Government to develop regulations in line with international human rights 
standards concerning procedural safeguards and detention conditions and, in this respect, 
refers to his report A/HRC/20/24 on the detention of migrants in an irregular situation, 
which provides useful guidance.  
</p>
<p>61. Regular independent monitoring of all detention facilities is crucial in order to 
oversee the implementation of these standards. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the signature by Greece of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment. A draft law 
provides for the Ombudsman to be designated as the National Preventive Mechanism. The 
Special Rapporteur urges Greece to proceed with the swift ratification of the above-
mentioned Optional Protocol and provide the necessary resources to the Ombudsman&#8223;s 
office so that it could conduct regular unannounced visits to detention facilities all over 
Greek territory, including all places where migrants are deprived of their liberty. Civil 
society organizations (CSOs) should also be guaranteed access to all places where migrants 
are detained. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Alternatives to detention 
</b></p>
<p>62. As noted earlier, despite the fact that Law 3907/2011 provides for the detention of 
migrants only when less coercive measures cannot be implemented, in practice, no such 
measures exist and irregular migrants are systematically detained. The Special Rapporteur 
strongly urges the Greek authorities to undertake an individual assessment of the necessity 
of detention in all cases, in accordance with international human rights standards as well as 
its own legislation. Non-custodial measures should always be considered before detention. 
In this respect, the Special Rapporteur again refers to his report A/HRC/20/24, which 
provides useful information on different alternatives to detention and how to apply them. He 
also urges the European Union to assist Greece in the application of alternatives to detention 
in line with the EU Returns Directive.  
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur noted some ad hoc alternatives which demonstrate that non-
custodial measures may work, but they are not properly implemented. For example, in 
Lesvos, he observed that, due to the limited detention capacity and the resulting 
overcrowding, some migrants were quickly released with an order to leave the country 
within 30 days. Others, particularly families and unaccompanied children, were not detained 
at all. However, those who had not been detained were not provided with orders to leave the 
country and were thus not allowed to board boats leaving for Athens; as a result they were 
stuck on the island. Unaccompanied children were able to stay in the shelter in Agiassos, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>while families had to sleep on the street or in parks. Just before the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s 
</p>
<p>visit to Lesvos, the local authorities provided facilities (PIKPA, a summer camp close to the 
airport) to house some of these migrants. A few weeks after the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s visit, 
however, PIKPA was emptied by the police. Migrants residing there were briefly detained, 
then released with orders to leave the country. In February 2013, a group of migrants who 
had just been released by the police were again accommodated in PIKPA at the initiative of 
the local volunteers. While the Special Rapporteur greatly appreciates this initiative, he 
notes that it is run by volunteers from the local community and is not sustainable without 
support from Greek authorities. The Special Rapporteur urges Greek authorities to support 
such initiatives as an alternative to detention, particularly for children and families. The 
Greek government should cooperate with CSOs in this respect, without placing all the 
responsibility on the CSOs. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the information that two new reception facilities 
for especially vulnerable migrants will be established, according to the revised Action Plan 
on Asylum and Migration Management. He hopes that this will mean that children, families 
with children and other vulnerable categories of migrants will no longer be detained.  
</p>
<p><b> E. First Reception Centres 
</b></p>
<p>65. According to Law 3907/2011, when the First Reception Service becomes 
operational, migrants will be kept in closed First Reception Centres for a maximum of 25 
days. Thereafter, they will either be referred to reception centres for asylum seekers, 
facilities for other vulnerable groups, detention/pre-removal centres, or returned to their 
countries of origin. If properly implemented, the First Reception Service should be able to 
quickly and effectively screen in migrants with vulnerabilities (for example, asylum seekers, 
children, migrants with illnesses or disabilities, victims of trafficking, victims of violence, 
persons in need of family reunification), undertake an individual assessment of whether 
continued detention is necessary, release all other migrants with appropriate statuses and 
thus reduce the hardship experienced at present by many migrants.  
</p>
<p>66. While noting the short duration of detention in First Reception Centres, the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that detention in these centres will be imposed systematically on all 
irregular migrants who arrive in Greece and that no remedies seem to have been provided 
for to contest such detention. The Special Rapporteur urges the Greek authorities to 
undertake an individual assessment of the necessity of detention and establish open first 
reception centres as well as non-custodial measures as alternatives to detention, in addition 
to closed centres. 
</p>
<p>67. Also of concern to the Special Rapporteur is the information he received from the 
Government that First Reception Centres will be guarded by private security companies, 
rather than the police. While the police may not necessarily be best placed to guard a 
detention centre, using private companies can make it difficult to hold the guards 
responsible for misconduct. The Special Rapporteur thus welcomes information from Greek 
authorities that they will ensure an appropriate code of conduct for and disciplinary 
measures applicable to all persons guarding detention centres, as well as ensure their 
appropriate training on the human rights of persons deprived of their liberty. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Asylum seekers  
</b></p>
<p>68. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur took due note of the large number of asylum 
seekers entering Greece and the considerable challenges this imposes on the Greek asylum 
system, particularly as the Dublin II Regulation provides for asylum applications, as a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>general rule, to be examined in the first European Union member state where the asylum 
seeker arrived. This general rule is maintained in the recast Dublin Regulation. The situation 
is further complicated by the fact that the new civilian Asylum Service is yet to be put in 
place. The present system, whereby the Hellenic Police is responsible for asylum claims, is 
largely dysfunctional and the process takes several years.  
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur encourages the speedy operationalization of the Asylum 
Service and Appeals Authority provided for in Law 3907/2011, which he hopes will ensure 
full access to the asylum system and proper, timely treatment of all asylum claims. 
Specifically, all migrants, including those in detention, must be able to submit their asylum 
claims without undue delay. 
</p>
<p>70. In 2011, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the return of an asylum 
seeker from Belgium to Greece under the Dublin II Regulation constituted a violation of 
article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights5. Since then, most European Union 
member states have suspended returns of asylum seekers to Greece under the Dublin II 
Regulation. However, the Special Rapporteur was informed that there are still some Dublin 
Regulation returns to Greece. The Regulation exacerbates the challenges for managing an 
already dysfunctional asylum system. The Special Rapporteur believes that some form of 
responsibility sharing should be agreed upon by the European Union member states, as 
provided for in article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Making 
the country of the first point of entry responsible for processing all asylum claims may not 
be sustainable in the long run for countries at the external borders of the European Union, 
such as Greece, which has seen a very large number of arrivals of asylum seekers over a 
long period of time. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Cross-cutting concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Xenophobia and violence against migrants 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned at the widespread xenophobia and 
violence against migrants in Greece, which is often tolerated by the police and sometimes 
even perpetrated by police officers themselves. Irregular migrants who are victims of such 
attacks are often unwilling to report them as they risk detention and deportation if they 
approach the police. This contributes to a climate of impunity for violence against migrants. 
In November 2012, the Minister for Public Order and Citizen Protection announced the 
establishment of specialized police units to fight racially motivated crime. While welcoming 
this initiative, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that this unit will not be able to carry out 
its work effectively as long as irregular migrants risk detention and deportation if they report 
racist crimes. He further notes the need for specialized police units to receive training on the 
conduct of their specific duties and to be subject to appropriate oversight. 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur believes that there is a link between xenophobia, violence 
against migrants and terminology, such as &#8220;illegal migrant&#8221; employed by Government 
institutions and other interlocutors he met with in Greece. Coupled with the criminalization 
of irregular migrants, such terminology contributes to justifying the alienation, 
discrimination, marginalization and ill-treatment of migrants. The Special Rapporteur urges 
Greek authorities to urgently undertake all necessary measures to combat xenophobia, 
discrimination and violence against migrants, including by ensuring ways for migrants to

</b></p>
<p> <b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>report cases of violence without risk of apprehension by the police due to their irregular 
status. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Civil society organizations 
</b></p>
<p>73. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes the significant funds provided by the 
European Union to support migration management in Greece, he regrets the bureaucratic 
hurdles in the Greek Government relating to the disbursement of the funds, including the 
European Refugee Fund, which provides funding to CSOs which, inter alia, operate shelters 
for asylum seekers. The underutilization of these funds has created significant difficulties 
for CSOs which rely on them to implement their programmes. In this respect, the Special 
Rapporteur was very impressed by the work of CSOs and their strong dedication to the 
human rights of migrants, despite difficult working conditions. The Special Rapporteur 
urges both Greek authorities and the European Union to enhance their support to CSOs 
which provide services to migrants, including irregular migrants, and ensure more efficient 
disbursement of the funds. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Migrant children 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned at the systematic violations of the 
human rights of migrant children in Greece. He met with a large number of migrant children 
detained with their families, the youngest only one year old. He also met with many 
unaccompanied migrant children detained in the Amygdaleza detention facility for 
unaccompanied minors. Several of them claimed to have family members in other European 
Union member states. This was dismissed by the responsible authorities who simply told the 
Special Rapporteur that if this were true, the families would come looking for them, so there 
was no need to assist them with family reunification. The Special Rapporteur deeply regrets 
this attitude and the complete disregard for these children&#8223;s right to family reunification. 
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur met with migrants who claimed to be younger than 18, but 
who were kept in detention with adults, while others were kept in facilities for children, 
either detention centres or shelters, even though they were above 18 years. The Special 
Rapporteur urges Greek authorities to systematically undertake appropriate age assessment 
procedures in order to identify children and ensure they are treated in accordance with their 
age. 
</p>
<p>76. At the central police station in Lesvos, the Special Rapporteur met with a 15 year-
old boy who was charged with migrant smuggling. The boy did not speak any English or 
Greek; he seemed to be unaware of the charges against him and no guardian had been 
appointed to him. He claimed to be travelling together with his adult brother, but this man 
was also charged with smuggling and clearly not in a position to look after the best interests 
of the boy.  
</p>
<p>77. Children who are not detained live in very difficult situations in Greece. 
Unaccompanied migrant children are often released from detention without any particular 
status and without the appointment of a guardian, even though the Public Prosecutor is 
supposed to appoint guardians for all unaccompanied children. In Patras, the Special 
Rapporteur met with unaccompanied children who were living outside, in abandoned 
buildings or under highway overpasses, without any proper status and without any 
institutional support, apart from the action of some civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur strongly urges Greek authorities to refrain from detaining 
children, but to provide accommodation for unaccompanied children in shelters, either 
Government-run or those run by CSOs and supported by the Government. Guardians should </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>be appointed for all unaccompanied children. Furthermore, all children, whatever their 
administrative status, should be able to access education and health-care services, without 
fear of being reported to immigration authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Role of the European Union  
</b></p>
<p>79. Greece has been under strong pressure from the European Union and individual 
member states to prevent migrants from entering its territory. While commending the 
European Union authorities for refusing to fund the fence built at the Evros land border and 
deeming it an inappropriate means of responding to irregular migration, the Special 
Rapporteur notes that other efforts implemented to curb migration at the Greek-Turkish land 
border are partly financed by European funds, and partly coordinated by Frontex. &#8220;Sealing&#8221; 
the external borders of the European Union is impossible and attempts to do so contribute to 
driving irregular migration more deeply underground, reinforcing the power of 
unscrupulous migrant smugglers and enhancing the possibilities of exploitation and human 
rights violations. Furthermore, those efforts have diverted migration back to the Aegean 
Sea, thus placing the lives of migrants at greater risk.  
</p>
<p>80. As irregular migration to Greece is attracted in part by unrecognized labour market 
needs for exploitative labour existing in many economic sectors of most European Union 
countries, many Greek interlocutors expressed dismay at the reluctance of other European 
Union countries to accept a number of migrants stuck in Greece, with little possibility of 
being returned home or moving on within the European Union. Particularly considering the 
serious economic crisis that Greece is experiencing, those migrants have little chance of 
being successfully integrated in Greek labour market and society. As the large number of 
irregular migrants stuck in Greece is mainly a result of EU policies and practices, there is a 
strong need for solidarity and responsibility-sharing within the European Union to ensure 
full respect of the human rights of all migrants.  
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur notes the European Union&#8223;s extensive support to the Greek 
authorities towards the realization of their 2010 Action Plan on Migration and Asylum and 
the 2013 revised plan, including through the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). The 
European Union provides significant support to Greece for migration management, both 
financial assistance through the Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows (SOLID) 
funds and non-financial support, like Frontex operations and Asylum Support Teams 
deployed by EASO. The European Union also assists Greece in trying to improve the 
SOLID funds absorption rate.  
</p>
<p>82. Of the SOLID funds, the External Borders Fund receives by far the largest amounts, 
followed by the European Return Fund. The External Borders Fund has been used, inter 
alia, for border control infrastructure and technical means, as part of the strategy to &#8220;seal&#8221; 
the land border with Turkey. Funding for construction and operation of detention centres is 
provided by the European Return Fund, which also funds deportations and voluntary 
returns. The European Refugee Fund supports many Greek CSOs providing support to 
asylum seekers. The European Fund for the Integration of Third-country Nationals supports 
efforts to integrate migrants who are in a regular situation only. The Special Rapporteur 
urges the European Union to provide more funds to CSOs supporting irregular migrants in 
Greece, as their rights are often overlooked or not prioritized to the same extent as the rights 
of asylum seekers and regular migrants. Furthermore, given the difficulties Greek 
authorities have experienced in absorbing European funds, the European Union should 
consider providing more funds without going through the Greek Government to improve the 
living conditions of migrants, to the asylum and first reception services, rather than to 
construction of more detention centres and efforts to &#8220;seal&#8221; the land border. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>83. Concerning the pending conclusion of the EU-Turkey readmission agreement, the 
Special Rapporteur is concerned that this agreement focuses almost exclusively on 
combatting irregular migration and does not sufficiently ensure respect for the human rights 
of migrants. While Frontex conducts screenings of newly arrived migrants in Greece in 
order to determine their nationality and thus facilitate their readmission, the European Union 
does not provide Greek authorities with assistance to identify whether persons to be 
readmitted are in need of international protection. The Special Rapporteur urges the 
European Union to ensure that this agreement is not implemented at the expense of the 
human rights of migrants who are proposed for readmission. 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur strongly believes that there is need for more responsibility-
sharing within the European Union. Greece is tasked with managing an external European 
Union border, and the high number of irregular migrants and asylum seekers in Greece is 
largely a result of EU policies and legislation. In this respect, the European Union should 
consider further revising the recast Dublin Regulation, which, in its current form, 
overburdens the Greek asylum system. Other measures should be considered for 
responsibility-sharing in respect of irregular migrants who may not be returned to their 
countries of origin. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Greece has made commendable progress in adopting a revised Action Plan on 
Asylum and Migration Management and also in working jointly with the European 
</b></p>
<p><b>Union and other international partners to improve the situation of migrants in Greece. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The new First Reception Service and Asylum Service, although not yet operational, are 
</b></p>
<p><b>also positive developments. However, much remains to be done to ensure full respect 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the human rights of migrants in Greece. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>In the light of the information received and concerns expressed, the Special 
Rapporteur wishes to propose the following recommendations to the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Normative and institutional framework for the protection of the human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights of migrants 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>Ensure that Greek legislation fully respects the human rights of migrants; in 
particular, irregular migration should be decriminalized.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Proceed with swift operationalization of the Asylum Service, Appeals Authority 
and First Reception Service provided for in Law 3907/2011. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Ensure that the Action Plan on Asylum and Migration Management is 
implemented with full respect for the human rights of migrants. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which would provide the Greek 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government with a useful framework for managing migration while ensuring full 
</b></p>
<p><b>respect for the human rights of migrants. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and ensure the establishment 
</b></p>
<p><b>of a fully independent National Preventive Mechanism, in accordance with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Optional Protocol, mandated to undertake regular unannounced visits to all places 
</b></p>
<p><b>where migrants may be deprived of their liberty.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>92. <b>Reinforce, through the provision of competent staff and resources, the National 
Commission for Human Rights and the Office of the Ombudsman in order to allow 
</b></p>
<p><b>them to effectively accomplish their mission of human rights protection and promotion 
</b></p>
<p><b>for all, including migrants regardless of their administrative status, including by 
</b></p>
<p><b>undertaking regular unannounced visits to detention facilities.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Border management and returns 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Implement a human rights-based approach to border management, ensuring 
that the rights of migrants are always the first consideration. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Provide clear instructions and rules for the Hellenic Police on how to deal with 
migrants who have just crossed the border, including the need to systematically 
</b></p>
<p><b>conduct individual screening to determine if the person has international protection 
</b></p>
<p><b>needs.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Fully respect the human rights of migrants in relation to implementation of all 
readmission agreements concluded.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Ensure that migrants have full access to lawyers and interpreters to appeal 
deportation decisions and prevent refoulement of persons in need of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection.  
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Continue and expand assisted voluntary return programmes, including with 
reintegration packages, to ensure a way for migrants who so wish to return home in 
</b></p>
<p><b>dignity. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Detention of migrants in an irregular situation 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>End the policy of systematic detention of all irregular migrants and instead 
explore alternatives to detention. Detention should be a measure of last resort, limited 
</b></p>
<p><b>to cases where there is a risk of absconding or when the person poses a threat to his or 
</b></p>
<p><b>her own or public security; duration of detention should be limited to the minimum 
</b></p>
<p><b>time necessary to carry out removal or other proceedings. Less coercive measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>should always be considered before resorting to detention, in line with Law 3907/2011 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the EU Returns Directive. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Significantly improve detention conditions and procedural safeguards, and 
develop appropriate regulations for all detention facilities, in line with international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights standards. In particular: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure that all detained migrants have access to proper medical care, an 
</b></p>
<p><b>interpreter, adequate food and clothes, hygienic conditions, adequate space to move 
</b></p>
<p><b>around and access to outdoor exercise;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Systematically inform detained migrants in writing, in a language they 
</b></p>
<p><b>understand, of the reason for their detention, its duration, their right to have access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>a lawyer, the right to promptly challenge their detention and to seek asylum;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that all migrants deprived of their liberty are able to promptly 
</b></p>
<p><b>contact their family, consular services and a lawyer, free of charge. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Refrain from detaining children and families with children, in conformity with 
the principles of the best interests of the child and of family unity. Shelters should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>established, particularly for these categories of migrants. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>101. <b>Continue to facilitate, where possible, the voluntary return of migrants who are 
willing to return to their countries, as opposed to deportation proceedings, in full 
</b></p>
<p><b>accordance with international human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Ensure full access to all detention facilities for lawyers and civil society 
organizations, and implement a system of systematic, independent monitoring of 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention centres. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Asylum seekers  
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Ensure speedy operationalization of the new Asylum Service and Appeals 
Authority, as well as full access to the asylum procedure in all parts of the country and 
</b></p>
<p><b>proper, timely treatment of all asylum claims. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Ensure that all detained persons claiming protection concerns are adequately 
informed of their right to seek asylum and able to file an asylum application and 
</b></p>
<p><b>communicate with UNHCR, lawyers and civil society organizations.    
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Cross-cutting concerns 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Investigate all cases of xenophobic violence and attacks against migrants, 
including any law enforcement involvement in these crimes. In order to undertake 
</b></p>
<p><b>proper investigations, irregular migrants must be able to report these crimes without 
</b></p>
<p><b>risking detention and deportation.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Take great care in the terminology used in public discourse and official 
documents when referring to migration, and refrain from using incorrect terminology 
</b></p>
<p>such as &#8220;illegal migrant&#8221;.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Initiate strong public discourse on social diversity and inclusion, which stresses 
the importance of fighting discriminatory behaviour and attitudes towards 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized persons and groups, including migrants, regardless of their 
</b></p>
<p><b>administrative status.  
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>Improve the human rights training of all persons working in the area of 
migration, including judges, lawyers, police officers, border guards, prison guards, 
</b></p>
<p><b>public and private detention officers. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Conduct public campaigns on racism and xenophobia and, in cooperation with 
international organizations and civil society, include human rights education and 
</b></p>
<p><b>awareness-raising in the educational curriculum of public schools. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>Enhance support to civil society organizations providing support to migrants, 
regardless of their status, including through European funding. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>Ensure full respect of the human rights of migrant children, including giving 
primary consideration to their best interests in all actions concerning them, regardless 
</b></p>
<p><b>of their administrative status. In particular: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Refrain from detaining children, whatever the circumstances, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide them with appropriate accommodation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Systematically undertake age assessments to identify children and ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>they are treated in accordance with their age; also establish due procedural 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantees in this respect, including the right to appeal;  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/46/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that all children are able to access education and health-care 
</b></p>
<p><b>services, without fear of being reported to immigration authorities;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Appoint a guardian for all unaccompanied children, as required by 
</b></p>
<p>Greek law, and ensure access to all migrant children by official children&#8217;s aid 
</p>
<p><b>societies, civil society organizations as well as international organizations concerned 
</b></p>
<p><b>with child welfare; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Assist unaccompanied and separated children with family reunification, 
</b></p>
<p><b>whenever possible. 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Recommendations to the European Union  
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Recognize that sealing the external borders of the European Union is 
impossible, that migrants will continue arriving, despite all efforts to stop them, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>that, at some point, repression of irregular migration is counterproductive as it drives 
</b></p>
<p><b>migrants further underground, thus empowering smuggling rings and creating 
</b></p>
<p><b>conditions of alienation and marginalization that foster human rights violations, such 
</b></p>
<p><b>as discrimination and violence against migrants.  
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>Focus should thus be on ensuring full protection of the human rights of all 
migrants, regardless of their administrative status, as the primary consideration for its 
</b></p>
<p><b>support to Greek efforts in managing the migration flow entering the European Union 
</b></p>
<p><b>territory, including in relation to activities undertaken by Frontex at Greek borders. 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>Focus support to Greece on initiatives that may improve the conditions of 
migrants, such as the First Reception Service and Asylum Service, rather than 
</b></p>
<p><b>building more detention centres. 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>Consider alternative ways of funding projects in Greece, including providing 
more direct funding to civil society organizations supporting migrants, thus ensuring 
</b></p>
<p><b>that they receive the funds in time to implement their projects.  
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>Enhance support, both technical and financial, to civil society organizations 
offering services and support to migrants, regardless of their administrative status.  
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>Ensure that the human rights of all migrants concerned are the primary 
consideration in the implementation of the EU-Turkey Readmission Agreement. 
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>Encourage more solidarity and responsibility-sharing among European Union 
member states in relation to borders, asylum and migration, in accordance with article 
</b></p>
<p><b>80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In this respect, consider 
</b></p>
<p><b>further revising the recast Dublin Regulation, which, in its current form, 
</b></p>
<p><b>counterproductively overburdens the Greek asylum system. 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>Take great care in the terminology used in public discourse and official 
documents, when referring to migration, and refrain from using incorrect terminology 
</b></p>
<p>such as &#8220;illegal migrant&#8221;, <b>and encourage all Greek authorities to do the same.
