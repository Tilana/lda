<p><b>  Addendum 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Mission to Qatar</b>* 
</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> While recognizing that Qatar has the highest proportion of migrants of any country 
in the world, who outnumber Qatari nationals by far, and that this creates unique 
challenges, the Special Rapporteur concludes that efforts need to be stepped up to prevent 
human rights abuses against migrants. 
</p>
<p> Migrants often pay recruitment fees and arrive in Qatar heavily indebted, only to 
have their passports confiscated upon arrival and the contract signed in their home country 
replaced, significantly reducing their salary and often changing the nature of their work. 
Exploitation is frequent and migrants often work without pay and live in substandard 
conditions. Domestic workers are excluded from the labour law and are particularly 
vulnerable to abuse. 
</p>
<p>The recruitment process for migrants needs to be further formalized in order to 
prevent exploitation and legislation must be enforced in order to ensure their rights are 
respected. The <i>kafala</i> (sponsorship) system, which links a work permit to a single 
employer, is a source of abuse and exploitation of migrants and should be abolished. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur also notes the responsibilities of the countries that send 
migrants to Qatar and the private sector.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Fran&#231;ois Cr&#233;peau, 
conducted an official visit to Qatar from 3 to 10 November 2013 at the invitation of the 
Government. As the visit focused mainly on labour migration and recruitment practices, 
this report does not provide a comprehensive overview of the human rights situation of 
migrants in Qatar. 
</p><p>2. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur met Government representatives 
(including the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Justice, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Supreme Council for the Judiciary, the Public Prosecution, 
and the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee), representatives of the diplomatic community, the 
National Human Rights Committee, foundations, academics and migrants themselves. He 
also visited the deportation centre, the central prison and several shelters. 
</p>
<p>3. Due to the focus on recruitment of the visit, at the initiative of the Special 
Rapporteur the Ministry of Foreign Affairs organized a workshop during the visit to discuss 
recruitment practices. The workshop was attended by, inter alia, representatives of the 
Government, the United Nations, the National Human Rights Committee, the diplomatic 
community, foundations, recruitment agencies and construction companies. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation for the cooperation extended to 
him by the Government prior to, throughout and after the visit. He also thanks the staff of 
the United Nations Human Rights Training and Documentation Centre for South-West Asia 
and the Arab Region in Doha for their valuable support and assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background: migration in Qatar 
</b>5. Revenues from oil and natural gas have enabled Qatar to attain the highest GDP per 
capita in the world. Qatar has made significant investments in infrastructure and 
construction. The population has increased from approximately 111,000 in 1970 to 1.9 
million in 2013, largely due to the arrival of migrant labour beginning in the early 1980s. 
The majority of the migrants in Qatar are from South and South-East Asia, including 
Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. There is also 
a significant number of Arab-speaking migrants, many of whom hold posts in the public 
sector. 
</p>
<p>6. Qatar is heavily dependent on migrant labour and has the highest ratio of migrants to 
citizens in the world. Approximately 88 per cent of the total population are migrants, 
commonly referred to as &#8220;foreign workers&#8221;. They are employed largely in construction, 
services and domestic work. This situation poses unique challenges for the Qatari 
authorities and society and fuels a legitimate anxiety about national identity. However, it 
must be stressed that those migrants are in Qatar at the invitation of the Government and 
have received work permits in order to fill labour needs largely created by the booming 
economy, massive construction projects and widespread reliance on domestic workers, 
allowing Qataris to enjoy high levels of comfort.  
</p><p>7. The 2022 World Cup will create a need for additional migration to Qatar. In addition 
to stadiums and related infrastructure, a metro system and a railway system are in the 
process of being built and the road system and hotel capacity will be expanded.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/35/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>5</b> 
</p>
<p><b> III. Normative and institutional framework for the protection 
of the human rights of migrants 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. Qatar is a party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
and the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography and on the involvement of children in 
armed conflict. However, Qatar has not ratified the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights or its Optional Protocol; the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights or its two Optional Protocols; the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families; the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; or 
the Optional Protocols to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
or the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure 
</p>
<p>9. Qatar has ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention 
against Transnational Organized Crime (Palermo Protocol). However, it has not adhered to 
the Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the 
United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the Convention 
relating to the Status of Refugees and its protocol, the Convention on the Reduction of 
Statelessness, or International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions No. 97 concerning 
Migration for Employment (1949), No. 143 concerning Migrations in Abusive Conditions 
and the Promotion of Equality of Opportunity and Treatment of Migrant Workers (1975), 
No. 87 concerning Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize (1948), 
No. 98 concerning the Application of the Principles of the Right to Organize and to Bargain 
Collectively (1949), No. 189 concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers (2011), or 
No. 181 concerning Private Employment Agencies (1997). 
</p><p>10. The Special Rapporteur hopes that the assurances he has received that the 
Government of Qatar is looking into the ratification of treaties, such as the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights and some ILO conventions, will bear fruit soon. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>11. Qatar has been a member State of the League of Arab States since 1971 and became 
a party to the Arab Charter on Human Rights in 2009. 
</p>
<p>12. Qatar is a member of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (Gulf 
Cooperation Council). There have been discussions in the Council concerning the adoption 
of a common law or a common model contract for domestic workers. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p><b> C. National legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. National laws 
</b></p>
<p>13. The permanent constitution was adopted in 2005. According to its article 6, the State 
shall respect international charters and conventions and strive to implement all international 
agreements, charters and conventions to which it is a party.  
</p>
<p>14. The constitution further provides, in article 35, that all persons are equal before the 
law and that there shall be no discrimination whatsoever on grounds of sex, race, language 
or religion. Article 36 states that personal freedom shall be guaranteed and no person may 
be arrested, detained or searched, nor may his freedom of residence and mobility be 
restricted save under the provisions of the law; no person may be subjected to torture or any 
degrading treatment; and torture shall be considered a crime punishable by law. 
</p>
<p>15. Article 44 guarantees the right of citizens to assemble and article 45 guarantees the 
right of citizens to establish associations. Article 52 provides every person who is a legal 
resident of the State protection to his person and property in accordance with the provisions 
of the law. 
</p>
<p>16. The main law governing migration is Law no. 4 of 2009 Regarding Regulation of 
Expatriates&#8217; Entry, Departure, Residence and Sponsorship<b> </b>(the Sponsorship Law). Article 
18 provides that each expatriate granted an entry visa to Qatar shall have a sponsor. Apart 
from women sponsored by the head of the family, minors and visitors staying 30 days or 
less, all expatriates may only leave the country temporarily or permanently on submission 
of an exit permit granted by the residence sponsor. 
</p>
<p>17. The Labour Law of 2004 regulates the employment of all workers, except certain 
excluded categories (including domestic workers).  
</p>
<p><b> 2. National institutions and policies 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Ministry of Interior is responsible for the entry and exit of migrants and the 
sponsorship system, including the transfer of sponsorship. The Search and Follow-up 
Department of the Ministry is responsible for the deportation of migrants and manages the 
deportation centre. The Human Rights Department receives and investigates complaints 
from migrants and undertakes visits to the deportation centre.  
</p>
<p>19. The Ministry of Labour is responsible for labour inspections (both health and safety 
inspections and worksite inspections), receiving complaints from workers and the 
recruitment of migrant workers, including certifying contracts and issuing visas and work 
permits. The Ministry of Labour deals with cases of abuse against migrants by negotiating 
between the migrant and the employer and it can contact the Ministry of Interior to check if 
the sponsorship can be transferred.  
</p>
<p>20. The National Human Rights Committee was established in accordance with Law 
No. 38 (2002) and reorganized in accordance with Law no. 17 (2010). It is accredited with 
&#8220;A&#8221; status by the International Coordination Committee of National Human Rights 
Institutions. The National Committee undertakes important work to enhance the protection 
of the human rights of migrants in Qatar, inter alia by assisting them in making complaints 
to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Labour.  
</p>
<p>21. The Qatar Foundation for Combating Human Trafficking was established in 2003 by 
the Supreme Council for Family Affairs and transferred into a foundation by Sheikha Moza 
bint Nasser. The mission of the Foundation is to protect society from human trafficking and 
provide integrated care for victims. It operates a shelter for women victims of trafficking. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/35/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>22. The Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development is a 
private, non-profit organization. It was founded in 1995 by Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al 
Thani and Sheikha Moza bint Nasser. The Foundation has launched a welfare initiative that 
is designed to curb unfair employment practices. Its mandatory standards of migrant 
workers&#8217; welfare set forth minimum mandatory requirements with respect to recruitment, 
living and working conditions and general treatment of workers engaged in construction 
and other projects at the Qatar Foundation. 
</p><p>23. The Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee was created after Qatar won the bid to host the 
FIFA World Cup in 2022. Its main responsibilities are the infrastructure projects related to 
the World Cup stadiums.  
</p>
<p>24. Qatar National Vision 2030, launched in 2008, aims to transform Qatar into an 
advanced country. It rests on four pillars: human, social, economic and environmental 
development. The National Development Strategy 2011&#8211;16 was prepared to set a path 
towards achieving the goals of Qatar National Vision 2030. The Strategy provides that the 
labour laws will be revised to protect further the rights and safety standards of all expatriate 
workers within a comprehensive social protection framework and in accord with 
international norms and standards. It further states that improving labour rights will not 
only benefit employees but also enhance the global image of Qatar as a leading and 
progressive nation. It sets as a target an increase from 6 to 20 in the number of ILO 
conventions signed. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Recruitment practices 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The <i>kafala</i> (sponsorship) system 
</b>25. The <i>kafala</i> (sponsorship) system is used to regulate the relationship between 
employers and migrants, with a work permit linked to a single person, the sponsor, who is 
often the employer, although this is not always the case. Sponsors are empowered by the 
Sponsorship Law to prevent migrants from changing employers and from leaving Qatar. 
The <i>kafala</i> system enables unscrupulous employers to exploit employees. Frequent cases of 
abuse against migrants include the confiscation of passports, refusal to give &#8220;no objection&#8221; 
certificates (allowing migrants to change employer) or exit permits and refusal to pay 
migrants&#8217; plane tickets to return home. Some employers do not extend residence permits for 
their employees, often because of the fees incurred. This leads to migrants ending up in an 
irregular situation, with no valid identity card, despite the fact that they are regularly 
employed. 
</p>
<p>26. Migrants are required to stay with their employer unless they get a &#8220;no objection&#8221; 
certificate and employers are required to report migrants who abscond to the Ministry of 
Interior. Migrants who leave their employers without a &#8220;no objection&#8221; certificate are 
charged with absconding and labelled runaways. They lose their residence permit and risk 
fines, imprisonment and deportation. The Special Rapporteur believes this system can 
amount to forced labour.  
</p>
<p>27. The Sponsorship Law of 2009 replaced a law from 1963 and includes some positive 
legislative developments, such as the provision which made it illegal for sponsors to 
confiscate passports. It also allows for a change of sponsor in certain cases and provides 
that the Ministry of Interior can provide an exit permit if the sponsor who refuses to do so 
cannot bring a court case against the migrant. However, the Special Rapporteur regrets that 
this law is not effectively enforced, as the practice of confiscating passports seems to be 
still widespread and change of sponsorship is difficult. While the Sponsorship Law allows </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>for the transfer of sponsorship by the Ministry of Interior in the event of abuse by the 
employer, in practice this provision is applied in relatively few cases.  
</p>
<p>28. The majority of the migrants the Special Rapporteur met, including construction 
workers and domestic workers, had had their passports confiscated by their employer, in 
violation of the Sponsorship Law. This included many migrants in the deportation centre, 
who had allegedly absconded from abusive employers. The explanation provided by the 
authorities, that most migrants prefer to let their employers keep their passports for them 
out of fear of loss or theft, contrasts with the testimonies the Special Rapporteur heard from 
migrants. 
</p>
<p>29. It has been argued that the <i>kafala</i> system is necessary because of the large number of 
migrants in Qatar. This cannot be used as an excuse for maintaining legislation that renders 
migrants vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. The Qatari authorities decide on the number 
of migrants they wish to admit to their territory. The demographic situation in Qatar is thus 
a result of Government policies and decisions, a nationwide choice of rapid development 
and a high level of household services.  
</p>
<p>30. The <i>kafala</i> system has been said to balance the interests of both parties, namely the 
employer and the migrant. Employers pay for the recruitment of the migrant and therefore 
feel that the migrant is an investment they need to hold on to. One way to solve this would 
be to reduce the costs of recruitment, inter alia by reducing the fees employers pay 
recruitment agencies and reducing the cost of visas. That way, employers could no longer 
argue that hiring a migrant is such a big investment that they need to keep them for an 
extended period of time.  
</p>
<p>31. Many of the persons the Special Rapporteur met, including Government 
representatives, were of the opinion that the <i>kafala</i> system is problematic and a source of 
abuse against migrants. The National Development Strategy provides for &#8220;review and 
revision as may be necessary, of Qatar&#8217;s sponsorship system&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed that the Sponsorship Law is currently under review and that the Ministry of 
Interior will be granted broader powers to revoke sponsorship. The Special Rapporteur 
urges the authorities to make it easier for migrants to change sponsor and that this should 
happen automatically in all cases of alleged abuse by the sponsor. In the longer term, 
abolishing the <i>kafala </i>system and replacing it by a regulated open labour market, where the 
work permit allows the worker to change employer, would reduce the level of exploitation 
of migrants and at the same time ensure the mobility of labour and a better match of needs 
and skills. 
</p>
<p>32. Another problematic element of the <i>kafala</i> system is the exit permit requirement 
under the Sponsorship Law: migrants can only leave the country with an exit permit issued 
by their sponsor. This requirement violates the freedom of movement guaranteed by the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms Racial Discrimination. The claim that it is meant to prevent the 
flight of migrants after committing crimes can only apply to a few individuals and does not 
justify the pre-emptive punishment of thousands. It is a source of abuse and there is no 
valid justification for maintaining this system.  
</p>
<p><b> B. The recruitment process 
</b></p>
<p>33. Migrants who come to Qatar to work have often suffered abuse and exploitation in 
their home countries during the recruitment process. Recruitment fees are forbidden by 
Qatari law, yet many migrants the Special Rapporteur met had taken out a loan to pay 
recruitment fees in their home countries, a loan that may take months or years to be repaid. 
Some lacked information about their jobs and salaries before they left their countries. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/35/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>Others reported having signed a contract in their home country which was replaced by a 
different contract upon arrival in Qatar, with a lower salary and a different job description. 
As migrants cannot change jobs without the agreement of their sponsor and they often have 
recruitment loans to pay back, they become highly vulnerable to abuse and less likely to 
report violations. In many cases, this will amount to trafficking as defined in the Palermo 
Protocol, since migrants are recruited by means of deception to achieve the consent of a 
person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation in forced labour. 
</p>
<p>34. Recruitment fees also contribute to job mismatching, as the hiring is not based on 
competencies, but rather on the ability to pay the fee. In order to ensure the right person is 
hired for the job, there should be no fees imposed. While fees are banned in the Labour 
Law, some migrant-sending countries have legalized recruitment fees for migrants. It was 
also reported to the Special Rapporteur that recruitment agencies in Qatar sometimes 
receive kickbacks from recruitment agencies in the sending countries, thereby 
circumventing the Labour Law.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the system of certification of contracts by the 
Ministry of Labour before a visa is issued, but these contracts are often not respected by 
employers upon arrival. Moreover, some migrants are tricked by recruitment agencies and 
travel to Qatar on a tourist or business visa and then end up working irregularly, unless they 
can find a sponsor after their arrival. The Special Rapporteur thus believes other procedures 
are necessary to verify that these contracts are respected in practice and that migrants are 
empowered to demand that their contracts are enforced.  
</p>
<p>36. A common practice reported to the Special Rapporteur was the buying and selling of 
visas, as a result of the &#8220;block visa&#8221; system. Reportedly, there are companies in Qatar with 
no employees, which are registered in order to get visas from the Ministry of Labour and 
then sell these visas to the highest bidder. Such fraud in relation to migrants is part of a 
pattern of violations of the law that contrast with the immediate and stiff sanctions for 
violations of the traffic rules, for example. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur notes the need to formalize the recruitment process, to set 
up a centralized body for recruitment and to monitor strictly the role of private recruitment 
agencies and possibly streamline them. He believes it will be important for the Qatari 
authorities to work together with the migrant-sending countries to ensure that migrants 
arrive in Qatar debt-free with a clear understanding of their work and living conditions. He 
also hopes that the authorities will consider some of the issues discussed during the 
workshop conducted during his visit. In particular, the idea of creating Qatari labour offices 
in sending countries which would, jointly with local authorities, conduct information 
campaigns, create ethical rating systems for local recruitment agencies and electronically 
register contracts, should be explored, either for Qatar alone or together with other member 
States of the Gulf Cooperation Council.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the information that the Ministry of Labour is in 
the process of implementing a programme for electronic connection with labour-exporting 
countries, which will include the establishment of an electronic information base for those 
seeking jobs in Qatar. This will allow employers to choose their workforce from available 
applications and might effectively end the discrepancy between the job promised in the 
sending country and the job effectively occupied in Qatar. The Special Rapporteur hopes 
that this programme will prevent contract substitutions. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Bilateral agreements 
</b></p>
<p>39. Qatar has signed 31 bilateral agreements with migrant-sending countries. Those 
agreements include a model employment contract which provides for some regulation of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>the work, including the contract period, travel expenses, wages, accommodation, medical 
care and annual leave, but it does not provide any details concerning a description of the 
work to be performed or the working conditions. The model contract provides that the 
contract may not be terminated before the expiry of its duration (one or two years) except 
upon mutual agreement by the employer and the employee. It also provides that the 
employer shall give the employee a personal loan if requested. These loans are often used 
as a reason not to let the employee change sponsor or leave the country. 
</p>
<p>40. The bilateral agreements state that a joint committee, comprised of representatives 
of Qatar and the sending State, shall meet every year to coordinate implementation of the 
agreement, interpret its provisions in case of disputes, review job opportunities in Qatar and 
propose review or modification of the provisions of the agreement. However, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed that such meetings do not take place regularly with all sending 
States. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur believes that it will be important for Qatar to include in all 
bilateral agreements with migrant-sending countries a revised uniform model contract for 
all workers, including domestic workers, which should ensure respect for and protection of 
the human rights of migrants, including labour rights and a minimum wage. Labour 
contracts based on such a model should specify the job description, wages and labour 
conditions. In this respect, the mandatory standards of migrant workers&#8217; welfare of the 
Qatar Foundation could be used as an inspiring model. E-government solutions could be 
developed to protect contracts against change upon arrival in Qatar. 
</p>
<p><b> D. The role of migrant-sending countries 
</b></p>
<p>42. While the Government is responsible for human rights violations committed against 
migrants in Qatar, the sending countries also have a role in preventing abuse of their own 
nationals who migrate for work. Many of the problems migrants in Qatar face relate to the 
recruitment process in their home country. Prospective migrants routinely pay high 
recruitment fees and sign contracts which are not respected once they arrive in Qatar and 
some are given a business or tourist visa rather than a work visa. As some of these 
recruitment agencies seem mostly concerned with making a profit, they simply promise 
contracts to whoever can pay the fee. This often results in persons getting a contract for a 
job for which they are not qualified; thus when they arrive in Qatar, without the required 
qualifications, they are given a different job with lower pay. Better regulation of 
recruitment agencies in sending countries would be an important tool in combating the 
exploitation of migrants in Qatar. Many migrants receive false promises from the 
recruitment agency in their country, but so do the employers &#8211; who often do not get 
workers with the qualifications required. Better regulation of recruitment agencies in 
sending countries would thus also be in the interest of employers in Qatar, who would then 
get better qualified employees. 
</p>
<p>43. Providing information sessions and pre-departure training for potential migrants 
could help ensure that they have the necessary training and skills, as well as information on 
working conditions in Qatar, their rights and how to access those rights. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Human rights violations in the workplace 
</b></p>
<p>44. While it provides some rights and safeguards for workers, the Labour Law of 2004 
has important limitations. It does not provide for a minimum wage, it bans migrants from 
forming organizations and from collective bargaining and it excludes domestic workers 
from its application. Implementation of the law is also a problem. Many migrants in Qatar </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/35/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>face human rights violations in the workplace, partly due to lack of implementation of the 
Labour Law and a carelessness that may be fed by lack of consideration for Asian migrants. 
Some are not paid their wages on time, some are not paid at all and others are paid less than 
agreed. It has been argued that a minimum wage cannot be established because the 
recruitment agencies in Qatar are bound by contracts issued by sending countries. However, 
when sending countries have tried to set a minimum wage for their workers, this has 
resulted in workers of that country not being given visas for Qatar. 
</p><p>45. Living conditions in labour camps are often inadequate and in violation of Qatari 
law, such as the prohibition against bunk beds. The Special Rapporteur observed how a 
large number of migrants live in overcrowded and insalubrious conditions in the Doha 
industrial area. Many migrants do not have an identity card, because their employer did not 
provide them with one or did not extend its validity. As a consequence, they cannot obtain 
health cards to access subsidized health care. The Special Rapporteurs regrets the 
insufficient number of labour inspectors, who are not in a position to investigate thoroughly 
the working conditions or living conditions in labour camps, due to their small numbers and 
the lack of interpreters. He welcomes information received that the number of labour 
inspectors will be doubled from 150 to 300.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the level of accidents in construction 
sites and hazardous working conditions resulting in injury or death. He is also concerned at 
the lack of data on accidents and deaths, despite anecdotal evidence that too many of these 
mostly young men return home in a coffin. He notes the need for the workers&#8217; voices to be 
heard on issues that are of common interest to them, the employers and the Government. 
The authorities should consider allowing the creation of health and safety committees 
where workers would be represented. Ultimately, all workers should be allowed to form 
workers&#8217; organizations. The authorities should not see this as a threat, but as an opportunity 
to use the workers&#8217; voice to facilitate their own work, in the efficient management of a 
mobile and competent labour market, where grievances can be dealt with early on and not 
when accidents happen or workers abscond.  
</p>
<p>47. The Ministry of Labour has initiated a pilot programme with a three-tier ranking of 
companies based on the number of complaints against them. The Ministry also has a system 
for blacklisting companies. While blacklisting companies who abuse migrants may be a 
good idea, the problem is that if these companies cannot hire new employees, they will 
often be more reluctant to let their employees go. Thus, such companies will often refuse to 
provide &#8220;no objection&#8221; certificates or exit permits, resulting in their employees being stuck. 
When a company is blacklisted, attention must also be paid to the rights of those people 
who are currently working in that company.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Domestic workers 
</b></p>
<p>48. Domestic workers are excluded from the Labour Law. This includes housemaids, 
drivers, cooks and gardeners. One reason put forward for this exclusion is that these 
workers do not have fixed working hours. Another explanation provided to the Special 
Rapporteur was that domestic work is regulated in the contract signed between the 
employee and the employer, so there was no need for a law. The Special Rapporteur 
strongly disagrees with this assessment. Domestic workers have as much need for their 
work to be regulated by law as any other worker, if not more. The Special Rapporteur met 
domestic workers who had run away from their employers after severe cases of physical, 
mental and sexual abuse. Some were overworked, forced to work as much as 21 hours per 
day, and &#8220;loaned&#8221; to other employers. Some reported not being given food, while others 
had not been paid their salaries for up to 10 months. Some were injured in accidents in the 
home. The vast majority had had their passports confiscated.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>49. The National Development Strategy aims to reduce the heavy dependence on 
domestic workers in Qatar. The target is to reduce by half the average number of domestic 
helpers per household. The Strategy states that &#8220;The Government will devise a set of 
regulations, including standards and conditions, to better manage the recruitment and 
employment of domestic helpers. This way forward will be supported by new legislation 
covering the legal rights of domestic workers.&#8221; The Special Rapporteur was pleased to hear 
that the Government has worked on a draft law for domestic workers and hopes for the 
speedy finalization and adoption of this law, in order to better safeguard the rights of 
domestic workers, whose abuse is rarely visible. This law should include provisions on, 
inter alia, wages, working hours, working conditions, payment for overtime, annual leave 
and effective remedies, as set out in ILO Convention No. 189 concerning Decent Work for 
Domestic Workers. 
</p>
<p>50. While welcoming the blacklisting by the Government of companies that abuse 
migrant workers, the Special Rapporteur insists that this should also apply to domestic 
workers. Persons who abuse domestic workers should not be able to hire more domestic 
workers in the future. Similarly, labour inspections should be undertaken also in private 
homes, in order to inspect working conditions and combat the too-frequent abuse of 
domestic workers.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Access to remedy for human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>51. There are different complaint mechanisms available for migrants, which can be 
accessed through the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Interior, the National Human 
Rights Committee, or directly at the labour court. However, migrants have difficulty 
accessing these mechanisms, partly because of lack of information, legal aid and 
interpreters and partly because they fear losing their job and subsequently being detained 
and deported, or they fear their sponsor&#8217;s reactions. Often when a migrant reports abuse by 
their sponsor, the sponsor retaliates by filing criminal charges against him or her. Some 
migrants detained in the deportation centre reported not even being released from the 
deportation centre to attend their own court case filed against their employer. More efforts 
are needed to provide effective access to justice for migrants. Sponsorship should always be 
transferred at the request of the worker, at least temporarily, when a migrant files a 
complaint against their employer. Additionally, migrants who file a complaint against their 
employer often need help, including interpretation and legal aid, but often also a place to 
stay and food, while they wait for a decision in their case.  
</p>
<p>52. The complaint mechanisms are not very effective. Despite its good will and 
awareness of the issues, the National Human Rights Committee has limited means and 
cannot take any decisions, only transfer the complaint to the relevant ministry. The Ministry 
of Labour can only mediate and if the employer does not agree, the worker has to file a case 
with the court. Migrants find the division of competencies between the Committee and the 
Ministries of Labour and Interior confusing.  
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur notes the need for more effective sanctions against 
employers. He regrets the lack of effective investigation and prosecution measures for 
offences under the Labour Law and the small number of court cases against abusive 
employers, a situation which may be connected to the numerous non-Qatari judges without 
tenure. Access to the labour court is difficult: migrants have to pay a fee to file a case and 
getting a decision takes several months. The Labour Law provides that lawsuits filed by 
workers shall be exempted from judicial fees; however most migrants still have to pay 600 
riyals to file a case. Reportedly this covers the cost of an expert opinion. This is money 
migrants often do not have &#8211; in fact many of the complaints by migrants relate to non-
payment of their salaries for up to several months.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/35/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>54. The National Development Strategy provides for the establishment of a tribunal to 
solve labour disputes. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this proposal, as it seems clear that 
the current system, with mediation by the Ministry of Labour and the lengthy procedures in 
the labour court, is not working satisfactorily. This new tribunal should be easy to access, 
with information provided in the languages spoken by the migrants, with interpreters, legal 
aid, no fees and quick settlement of disputes and enforcement of decisions.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Detention of migrants in an irregular situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Detention practices and legislation  
</b></p>
<p>55. The detention of migrants is based on the Sponsorship Law. The Law provides that 
the detention of migrants awaiting deportation may be ordered for 30 days, &#8220;renewable for 
several similar periods&#8221;, which may lead to long-term administrative detention. The Special 
Rapporteur met migrants who had been detained for as long as one year. Many of them are 
trapped in Qatar, as they lack one or more of the three requirements to go home: their 
passport, an exit permit and a plane ticket (to be paid by their employer). During the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, there were approximately 300 women and 1,050 men detained at 
the deportation centre. A new ward to accommodate up to 500 women was under 
construction.  
</p>
<p>56. Migrants who abscond from abusive employers are routinely detained and deported. 
The Special Rapporteur was informed that most migrants who await deportation are not 
kept in the deportation centre, but rather have to report to the authorities daily. Those 
detained are reportedly those who have a criminal case or civil claims against them, those 
who have resisted deportation and those who abscond from their sponsors. The fact that 
those who abscond  may have been abused by their employer does not seem to be taken into 
consideration.  
</p>
<p>57. Some of the detainees had reported cases of abuse by their employers and in some 
instances their employers had retaliated by reporting criminal cases against the migrant who 
had absconded. Others could not leave the deportation centre until they had paid the fine for 
having overstayed their residence permit. However, it is the responsibility of the employer 
to ensure that migrants have a residence permit and often they do not extend the permits of 
the migrants working for them, mainly due to the cost incurred.  
</p>
<p>58. The majority of the women in the deportation centre had absconded from abusive 
employers, particularly the domestic workers, and they wanted to return to their countries 
of origin. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that it is very unlikely that they present 
any risk of absconding while trying to obtain their passport, flight ticket and exit permit. 
Their detention is therefore not necessary and constitutes a violation of their rights. 
Accommodating such women in open shelters, instead of building a new ward for women 
at the deportation centre, would provide a much better and cheaper solution. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that women who do not have any legal issues or a criminal case 
against them are referred to the Qatar Foundation for Combating Human Trafficking and 
stay in their shelter. However, most women will have legal issues cited against them, as 
simply running away from an abusive employer is considered as such.  
</p>
<p>59. There were several pregnant women in the deportation centre during the visit of the 
Special Rapporteur. The Special Rapporteur deeply regrets this practice. The authorities 
should either facilitate their return to their countries, or house them in shelters. Similarly, 
children should never find themselves in detention: migrant women with children should 
always be hosted in shelters. While there were no children in the deportation centre during 
his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed by several sources that women with small </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>children are routinely kept in the deportation centre and he was told that approximately 10 
women with children had been removed from the centre the day preceding his visit. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Detention conditions  
</b></p>
<p>60. While welcoming efforts undertaken by the authorities to ensure decent conditions 
for the migrants in the deportation centre, the Special Rapporteur found the centre to be 
overcrowded and unsanitary. The migrants lacked sheets, a change of clothes, soap and 
other hygienic products. Several migrants were sleeping on mattresses on the floor in the 
corridors. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur heard reports of severe overcrowding in recent months and 
weeks, with migrants sleeping 2&#8211;3 persons in each bed or on the floor, but at the time of his 
visit, the situation in the deportation centre seemed to have improved somewhat. Some of 
the detained women had been moved to a different ward only a few hours prior to his visit, 
most likely in order to reduce overcrowding.  
</p>
<p>62. Several of the migrants the Special Rapporteur met reported different health 
conditions, both physical and mental, but they had not had adequate medical attention. One 
housemaid had been beaten and burned by her employer before running away. Another had 
injured her leg in an accident. One ran away after an attempted rape. Access to a doctor was 
difficult, with no proper treatment given. The detainees reported that the only medication 
given was aspirin, regardless of their illness. The Special Rapporteur heard stories of 
pregnant women in detention not receiving prenatal care, including one who had miscarried 
inside the deportation centre. It was also reported to the Special Rapporteur that mentally ill 
persons had been kept in the deportation centre, with no adequate treatment. 
</p>
<p>63. Some migrants who had been both in the central prison and the deportation centre, 
stated that the deportation centre had the worst detention conditions, a remark that fits with 
an unfortunate pattern of treating migrants with little respect for their dignity.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Procedural safeguards 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that detainees have limited ability to contact 
their families, limited access to legal assistance or consular services and virtually no 
professional interpretation services. Access to a phone was not guaranteed for those who 
did not have money to pay for the pay phone and mobile phones were confiscated. The 
detainees therefore had difficult access to the outside world and little knowledge about 
complaint mechanisms and how to challenge their detention.  
</p>
<p>65. The detainees reported that there was no way for them to make complaints about 
their detention or the conditions in detention. Some of them had spent several months in the 
deportation centre and lacked information about their situation, not knowing why they were 
there or what would happen to them. In general, the detainees the Special Rapporteur met 
had little or no information in a language they could understand about the reasons for their 
detention or its duration and little or no consular access or means of challenging their 
detention and/or deportation. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur notes as positive the visits to the deportation centre by the 
National Human Rights Committee and the Human Rights Department of the Ministry of 
Interior. However, he believes it is important for Qatar to ratify the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and establish an independent national preventive mechanism 
tasked with undertaking regular unannounced visits to all places of deprivation of liberty in 
Qatar.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/35/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>15</b> 
</p>
<p><b> D. Alternatives to detention 
</b></p>
<p>67. As long as there is no specific risk of a migrant absconding from future proceedings 
and he or she does not present a danger to himself or herself or to others, detention is not 
necessary and thus a violation of that person&#8217;s rights. A large number of the detainees the 
Special Rapporteur met wanted to go home to their country and it is therefore highly 
unlikely that they would abscond. The Sponsorship Law provides that the Minister of 
Interior may oblige migrants to reside in a specific area instead of resorting to detention and 
the Special Rapporteur was informed that reporting requirements are also sometimes used 
as an alternative to detention. The Special Rapporteur urges the Qatari authorities to 
systematically rely on non-custodial measures rather than detention. An individual 
assessment of the necessity of detention should be undertaken in all cases, in accordance 
with international human rights standards, and non-custodial measures should always be 
considered before detention. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur refers to his report on 
the detention of migrants in an irregular situation (A/HRC/20/24), which provides useful 
information on the different alternatives to detention and how to apply them.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur was informed that some migrants asked to be kept in the 
deportation centre because they had no place to live. Keeping such people in a shelter 
would not only be much cheaper than detaining them, but would also better respect the 
human rights and dignity of those concerned. The Special Rapporteur visited the shelters 
run by the Qatar Foundation for Combating Human Trafficking and the Qatar Foundation 
for the Protection of Women and Children. He welcomes the work of these foundations and 
urges the authorities to transfer detained migrants to such shelters, unless there is a specific 
reason that requires them to be detained while they are waiting to return to their countries. 
The capacity in such shelters should be expanded and new shelters should be established 
for all migrants in difficult situations, men, women and children. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Cross-cutting concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Xenophobia and the perception of migrants 
</b></p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur regrets the negative perception of migrants in Qatar. 
Migrants are often seen as their employer&#8217;s &#8220;property&#8221; rather than human beings with 
human rights equal to those of Qatari nationals. This is reflected in the systematic 
exploitation of migrants, who often live in slum-like conditions, work excessive hours in 
difficult and dangerous conditions and are often not paid for several months. Domestic 
workers are particularly vulnerable to such practices. This may unfortunately reveal 
entrenched discrimination, if not racism, when the victims are non-Qataris. The Special 
Rapporteur notes the need for the Qatari authorities to undertake measures to create a more 
positive perception of migrants in Qatari society, stressing that migrants undertake 
important jobs in Qatar, are an essential part of its economic success and deserve to see 
their dignity and rights protected on a par with that of citizens. As law enforcement is 
generally good in Qatar, it is regrettable that this does not extend to situations where 
migrants are concerned. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned at the categorization of migrants based on 
their nationality, whereby some nationalities are seen as more valuable than others and 
migrants of some nationalities are paid higher salaries than others, while carrying out the 
same job. This form of discrimination constitutes a violation of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Irregular migrants 
</b></p>
<p>71. While the vast majority of migrants enter Qatar regularly, some become irregular, 
inter alia because they abscond from abusive employers, or because their employers refuse 
or neglect to renew their residence permits. Those migrants often live in hiding, in fear of 
being detained and deported. The Special Rapporteur met migrants who had absconded and 
as a consequence had become irregular, who were afraid to seek medical assistance. They 
feared being asked for an official identity card, which they no longer had. He also met 
irregular migrants who had nowhere to live, having been evicted from the accommodation 
provided by their employers. Additionally, he met children who were irregular migrants 
and thus were not allowed to attend school.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Single mothers 
</b></p>
<p>72. In the central prison, there were several women who were sentenced to one year in 
prison for adultery for having a baby while being unmarried. These women lived in the 
prison with their babies, in conditions which are in clear violation of the principle of the 
best interests of the child, as stated in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. While 
noting that these women have violated Qatari law, the Special Rapporteur finds it 
unnecessary to keep them and their babies in prison and urges the authorities to come up 
with alternative solutions.  
</p>
<p><b> D. The 2022 World Cup 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee is responsible for the infrastructure projects 
related to the World Cup stadiums. It has developed a workers&#8217; charter with 10 principles, 
which all of its contractors and subcontractors will have to comply with. The charter 
covers, inter alia, health and safety, employment, equality, dignity, working and living 
conditions and wages. The Committee is in the process of developing employment 
standards based on the principles set out in the workers&#8217; charter. The charter is based on 
Qatari law, but goes further in relation to enforcement. It provides that the subcontractor is 
obliged to comply with the same rules as the contractor and it promotes an independent 
audit of companies. It provides a three-tier system for auditing: firstly, the contractor 
himself will do spot checks and report back; secondly, an independent auditor appointed by 
the Committee will undertake audits; and the third tier consists of labour inspections 
conducted by the Ministry of Labour.  
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the commitment by the Committee to ethical 
recruitment and to developing employment standards in line with international human 
rights and labour standards. It is too early to say, however, how this will work in practice, 
as the World Cup construction projects have not yet started. The Special Rapporteur urges 
the Committee to ensure that workers&#8217; rights are fully respected in relation to the 
preparations for the World Cup. The standards of the Committee should fully comply with 
international human and labour rights standards. The Government should also ensure that, 
if successful, this experience is extended to all other construction projects, which should 
fully respect the human rights of migrants well before 2022. If this is the case, the World 
Cup could be used as an opportunity to improve the human rights of migrants in Qatar. 
</p>
<p><b> E. The responsibilities of the private sector 
</b></p>
<p>75. International standards on business and human rights provide that private actors 
must as a minimum respect internationally recognized human and labour rights. The </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/35/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights adopted by the Human Rights Council 
in its resolution 17/4 state that business enterprises are required to avoid causing or 
contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their own activities, to address such 
impacts when they occur and to seek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts 
that are directly linked to their operations, products or services through their business 
relationships. 
</p>
<p>76. The private sector can play an important role in ending the abuse and exploitation of 
migrants in Qatar. This includes ending practices such as contract substitution, the 
confiscation of passports, not providing identity cards, not paying employees on time and 
inadequate working and living conditions. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur was repeatedly told that the most serious abuse of migrants 
is not committed by large transnational companies, but rather by small companies which act 
as subcontractors. Transparency in the labour supply chain is crucial in order to prevent 
abuse: all intermediaries, subcontractors and other partners should therefore be identified 
and suppliers and other business partners should not engage unauthorized subcontractors. 
Companies must ensure that workers, including subcontracted labour, are not subjected to 
exploitative working conditions.  
</p>
<p><b> X. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>78. <b>The high proportion of migrants in Qatar creates unique challenges for the 
country, but the Special Rapporteur concludes that efforts need to be stepped up to 
prevent human rights abuses against migrants in the country. Qatar has made 
progress in advancing the human rights of migrants, inter alia through some of the 
improvements introduced in the Sponsorship Law of 2009. However, much remains to 
be done in order to ensure full respect for the human rights of migrants in Qatar. 
</b>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur notes that there is some good legislation in place, 
which could potentially prevent some of the abuse migrants currently experience in 
Qatar. However, this legislation is not adequately enforced.  
</b>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur believes that a better informed and better protected 
workforce is a more productive and reliable workforce. It would benefit businesses in 
Qatar to have a more streamlined recruitment process. Abolishing the <i>kafala</i> system 
would attract more highly qualified workers. Recruitment fees mean that the people 
recruited are those who can pay the fee, not the ones who are most qualified. 
Formalizing the recruitment process, certifying recruitment agencies in sending 
countries and abolishing all recruitment fees would lead to better skills matching.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>In light of the information received and the concerns expressed, the Special 
Rapporteur wishes to propose the following recommendations to the Government of 
Qatar. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Normative and institutional framework for the protection of the human 
rights of migrants 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Effectively implement existing legislation, prosecute violations and impose 
appropriate sanctions on companies and individuals who violate the rights of 
migrants. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>In accordance with Qatar National Vision 2030 and the National Development 
Strategy 2011&#8211;16, revise labour laws to further protect the rights of all migrant 
workers.</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/35/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>Ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, which would provide the Qatari 
government with a useful framework for managing migration while ensuring the full 
respect for the human rights of migrants. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and establish a national 
preventive mechanism with a mandate to undertake unannounced visits to all places 
where migrants are deprived of their liberty. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>Consider seeking technical assistance from the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in order to make sure Qatari 
legislation and practice are in line with these treaties. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Ratify a number of ILO conventions, including No. 97 concerning Migration 
for Employment (1949), No. 143 concerning Migrations in Abusive Conditions and the 
Promotion of Equality of Opportunity and Treatment of Migrant Workers (1975), No. 
87 concerning Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize (1948), 
No. 98 concerning the Application of the Principles of the Right to Organize and to 
Bargain Collectively (1949), No. 189 concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers 
(2011) and No. 181 concerning Private Employment Agencies (1997). 
</b>89. <b>Take fully into consideration the recommendations made by the National 
Human Rights Committee, including those in its reports in relation to the human 
rights of migrants.</b> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Recruitment practices 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Abolish the <i>kafala</i> system and replace it with a regulated open labour market, 
where the work permit allows the worker to change employer. This would include 
abolishing the &#8220;no objection&#8221; certificate and the exit permit requirement. In the 
meantime, the provisions of the Sponsorship Law should be strictly enforced and 
there should be clear criteria for when a sponsor can refuse to give a &#8220;no objection&#8221; 
certificate or an exit permit and abused migrants should always be allowed to change 
sponsor. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Conduct systematic checks to make sure that employers do not confiscate their 
employees&#8217; passports. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Ensure that migrants are properly informed as to their rights. In this respect, 
ensure that employment contracts signed by migrants are written in a language that 
they can read and understand.  
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Ensure that illegal recruitment fees are not charged and that contracts signed 
in the sending countries are not altered in Qatar without the informed consent of the 
migrant concerned. E-government solutions could be developed to protect contracts 
against change upon arrival of the worker in Qatar. 
</b>94. <b>Formalize the recruitment process, set up a centralized body for recruitment, 
consider initiating a process across all the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and 
strictly monitor the role of private recruitment agencies.  
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Consider seeking technical assistance from ILO and OHCHR to reform the 
sponsorship system, improve the recruitment process and train government officials. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/35/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>96. <b>Work with certified recruitment agencies in sending countries and refrain from 
providing visas to workers who have gone through an uncertified agency. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>Work together with countries of origin to ensure that migrants arrive in Qatar 
free of debt.  
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Consider opening offices of the Ministry of Labour in sending countries which 
would, jointly with local authorities, conduct information campaigns, create ethical 
rating systems for local recruitment agencies and approve and register contracts. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>Fully respect the human rights of migrants in relation to the implementation of 
all bilateral labour migration agreements entered into. Include in all bilateral 
agreements a revised uniform model contract for all workers, including domestic 
workers, which should ensure respect for and protection of the human rights of 
migrants, including labour rights and a minimum wage. Labour contracts based on 
such a model should specify the job description, the agreed salary, working and living 
conditions and effective recourse and remedies. The mandatory standards of migrant 
workers&#8217; welfare of the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community 
Development could be used as a model.  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Human rights violations in the workplace 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>Ensure that there is no discrimination in relation to salaries based on the 
nationality of workers and consider establishing a minimum wage. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Find a way to guarantee the payment of salaries and plane tickets for migrants, 
inter alia by ensuring that all migrants have a bank account to which their salary is 
transferred every month and that bank records are regularly checked. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Ensure that all migrants are provided with identity cards. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Create a strong and effective labour inspection system, with a sufficient 
number of labour inspectors, who should be well trained in international human 
rights and labour standards. Labour inspectors should undertake thorough and 
regular unannounced inspections in all worksites. They should monitor the 
enforcement of labour laws, including by speaking directly with migrant workers, 
reviewing their contracts and making sure they are allowed to keep their passports, 
are issued with identity cards and are paid on time. Labour inspections should also 
take place in labour camps in order to inspect living conditions. Labour inspectors 
must be accompanied by interpreters in languages understood by migrant workers. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>Collect disaggregated data, inter alia, on complaints by migrants against their 
employers and on workplace accidents, injuries and illnesses. 
</b>105. <b>Audit all construction companies and make the results public. 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Make the blacklisting and ranking of companies based on their compliance 
with labour standards public and accessible to migrants. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Revise the Labour Law in order to impose penalties on employers who do not 
pay workers their full salary on time and who do not grant them annual leave, as well 
as adequate penalties for employers who do not comply with accommodation 
standards for their employees. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>Establish health and safety committees with worker representation on all 
worksites. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Recognize the rights of association and self-organization for all workers,

deal more effectively with certification of contracts, labour inspections and labour 
complaints. 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Domestic workers 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>Adopt legislation on domestic workers that includes protection of labour rights, 
including in relation to working hours, overtime, a minimum wage, working 
conditions and annual leave, and effective compliance mechanisms.  
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Establish a minimum wage for domestic workers, which should apply to all 
workers, regardless of their nationality. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>Ensure that domestic workers&#8217; passports are not confiscated by their 
employers. 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>Blacklist employers who exploit domestic workers. 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>Undertake labour inspections in private homes to inspect the working 
conditions of domestic workers.  
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Access to remedy for human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>Provide migrants with information about their rights and how to access them. 
This could be done, inter alia, by disseminating the <i>Workers&#8217; Rights Book</i> of the 
National Human Rights Committee, both in migrant-sending countries and in Qatar. 
</b>117. <b>Effectively investigate and prosecute offences under the Labour Law and the 
Sponsorship Law and ensure effective access to complaint mechanisms. This could be 
done by creating one extensive complaint mechanism on violations of labour and 
human rights, including in relation to recruitment, sponsorship, residence permits, 
contracts, working conditions, living conditions, wages and other labour disputes. This 
mechanism should be easy to access, with interpretation provided and no fees 
charged.  
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>Ensure that migrants are not required to pay fees to file a case with the labour 
court and ensure easy access without fear of reprisals and speedy processing of court 
cases filed by migrants. Access to interpreters and legal aid should be guaranteed. 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>Ensure that detained migrants are able to appear in court. 
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>Pursue the establishment of a tribunal to solve labour disputes, which should be 
easy to access, with information provided in the languages spoken by the migrants, 
with interpreters, legal aid, no fees and quick settlement of disputes and enforcement 
of decisions. 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Detention of migrants in an irregular situation 
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>Refrain from detaining individuals for the sole reason of having absconded 
from their employer. End the systematic detention of migrants awaiting deportation 
and always explore alternatives to detention. Detention should be a measure of last 
resort, limited to those cases where there is a risk of a migrant absconding from future 
proceedings, or when the person poses a threat to his or her own or public security, 
and its duration should be limited to the minimum time necessary. A maximum time 
limit should be established by law. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/35/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>122. <b>Significantly improve detention conditions and procedural safeguards, in line 
with international human rights standards, and develop appropriate regulations on 
the detention of migrants in line with international human rights standards. In 
particular, ensure that all detained migrants have easy access to: 
</b></p>
<p>(a) <b>Adequate medical care, interpreters, adequate food and clothes, a bed 
and clean sheets, hygienic conditions, adequate space to move around and access to 
outdoor exercise;  
</b></p>
<p>(b) <b>Information in a language they understand as to the reason for their 
detention, its duration and the right and means to challenge the detention;  
</b></p>
<p>(c) <b>Means of contacting their family and consular services, as well as those 
of an interpreter and a lawyer, which should be free of charge if necessary, in order to 
be able to exercise their rights. 
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>Seek guidance from the report of the Special Rapporteur on the detention of 
migrants in an irregular situation (A/HRC/20/24). 
</b>124. <b>Refrain from detaining pregnant women. 
</b></p>
<p>125. <b>Refrain from detaining children and families with children, in conformity with 
the principles of the best interests of the child and of family unity. Shelters should be 
established, particularly for those categories of migrants. 
</b></p>
<p>126. <b>Ensure full access to all detention facilities for lawyers and international and 
local civil society organizations and implement systematic independent monitoring of 
detention centres. 
</b></p>
<p>127. <b>Seek technical assistance from OHCHR in relation to the detention of migrants, 
including on how to determine the criteria for detention, and on procedural 
safeguards and detention conditions. 
</b></p>
<p><b> G. Cross-cutting concerns 
</b></p>
<p>128. <b>Refrain from categorization of migrants based on their nationality and initiate 
a strong public discourse on social diversity and inclusion, which stresses the 
importance of fighting discriminatory behaviour and attitudes towards migrants. 
</b></p>
<p>129. <b>Develop a human rights culture, including through conducting public 
campaigns on racism and xenophobia, and in cooperation with international 
organizations and civil society, include human rights education and awareness-raising 
in the educational curriculum of the school system, including respect for domestic 
workers. 
</b></p>
<p>130. <b>Ensure that all migrants in an irregular situation can access their rights, inter 
alia to education, health care and housing. Those who have become irregular due to 
the actions of their employers, such as the non-renewal of residence permits, should 
receive assistance in order to solve their residence status. 
</b></p>
<p>131. <b>Ensure that single mothers are not imprisoned with their babies. Instead, those 
who wish to return to their countries should be assisted in returning home with their 
babies, with help from their consular authorities. In the meantime, they should be 
housed in shelters, whenever required. Measures should be undertaken to prevent 
children born out of wedlock from becoming stateless. 
</b></p>
<p>132. <b>Ensure that the standards of the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee fully comply 
with international human rights treaties and ILO labour conventions. Use the 2022 
World Cup as an opportunity to improve the human rights situation of migrants in </b></p>

the number of abuse cases relating to migrant workers. 
</b></p>
<p><b> H. Recommendations to migrant-sending countries  
</b></p>

ethical recruitment in compliance with international human rights and labour 
standards and impose sanctions on those who violate such regulations.

their contracts, travel or visas.  
</b></p>
<p>136. <b>Provide information sessions and pre-departure training for prospective 
migrants, in order to prepare them for their work in Qatar and ensure they have the 
necessary skills, including language skills, before their departure, as well as 
information on working conditions in Qatar, their rights and how to access those 
rights. This should also include information on the local culture and lifestyle in Qatar 
and on important legislation, which may be very different from those in their own 
countries. 
</b></p>
<p>137. <b>When negotiating bilateral agreements with the Government of Qatar, ensure 
that they contain terms and conditions for safeguarding the rights of their nationals, 
including clauses on working conditions, living conditions, wages, working hours etc. 
and monitor enforcement of those agreements. 
</b></p>
<p>138. <b>Ensure that their embassies in Qatar are properly equipped to provide 
assistance to their nationals in need. 
</b></p>
<p>139. <b>Those that have not yet done so, should ratify the International Convention on 
the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.
