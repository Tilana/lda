<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>Nigeria is a multi-ethnic and linguistically diverse society, where the great diversity 
</p>
<p>of the population constitutes a valuable asset and rich cultural heritage. Nevertheless, the 
</p>
<p>management of such a diverse population poses important challenges that have not been 
</p>
<p>fully addressed and that require good and inclusive governance and the full implementation 
</p>
<p>of minority rights.  
</p>
<p>Nigeria&#8217;s Constitution guarantees the right to equality and non-discrimination and 
</p>
<p>contains provisions conducive to fostering the equal representation of diverse groups at the 
</p>
<p>different governmental levels, in the application of the federal character principle. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the distinction between those considered the native inhabitants of a territory 
</p>
<p>(indigenes) and those who are not (settlers) leads in many cases to discriminatory treatment 
</p>
<p>of citizens in fields such as access to land and resources, public positions, university 
</p>
<p>education and scholarships, and has contributed to tensions and created and reinforced 
</p>
<p>ethnic and religious cleavages.  
</p>
<p>While, in most of the country, harmonious and peaceful inter-ethnic relations 
</p>
<p>prevail, Nigeria has seen violent intercommunal clashes in some States, particularly in the 
</p>
<p>North and Middle Belt regions, which have left thousands of victims. Root causes of 
</p>
<p>violence are complex and intertwined, involving several factors, such as the issue of 
</p>
<p>indigenes/settlers, competition for resources, poverty, good governance deficits, impunity 
</p>
<p>and polarization of ethnic and religious characteristics. Such factors and their underlying

<p><b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>causes must be adequately addressed through specific programmes and investment directed 
</p>
<p>to the most disadvantaged groups. In order to address the issue of violence, impunity must 
</p>
<p>be tackled, perpetrators must be held accountable for their crimes and victims must be 
</p>
<p>adequately redressed. 
</p>
<p>Many areas in the Niger Delta are still suffering from dire environmental 
</p>
<p>degradation due to frequent oil spills. Affected communities, including the Ogoni and 
</p>
<p>Ikwerre groups, have been deprived of their traditional livelihoods and face difficulties in 
</p>
<p>gaining access to basic services. Urgent clean-up operations of polluted areas are required 
</p>
<p>and concrete measures needed to guarantee alternative means of livelihood and adequate 
</p>
<p>services to affected communities.  
</p>
<p>Nigeria&#8217;s rich linguistic diversity encompasses hundreds of minority languages, 
</p>
<p>though several of them are under threat. Government programmes to preserve the major 
</p>
<p>minority languages are contributing to safeguarding Nigeria&#8217;s linguistic heritage. However, 
</p>
<p>further measures are required, including provisions for language education in lesser used 
</p>
<p>languages. </p>

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on minority issues visited Nigeria between 17 and 28 
</p>
<p>February 2014. She visited Abuja, where she conducted extensive consultations with senior 
</p>
<p>federal government representatives, including the Minister of the Interior, senior officials of 
</p>
<p>the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Justice and Culture, the National Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission and the Federal Character Commission. She visited Plateau and Kaduna 
</p>
<p>States, where she consulted with State authorities as well as with the National Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Commission branches in Jos and Kaduna. She travelled to Port Harcourt in Rivers 
</p>
<p>State, where she met with authorities and local communities. She held numerous meetings 
</p>
<p>with non-governmental organizations, minority communities, youth representatives, 
</p>
<p>religious leaders, academics, journalists and representatives of United Nations bodies. She 
</p>
<p>thanks the Government for its cooperation and thanks those organizations and individuals 
</p>
<p>that provided valuable information and facilitated aspects of her visit. 
</p>
<p>2. Nigeria is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country, with over 350 ethnic 
</p>
<p>groups and even more languages spoken within its territory. According to the most recent 
</p>
<p>census, conducted in 2006, the population of Nigeria stood at 140 million people. 
</p>
<p>According to the most recent data provided by the World Bank in 2014,1 the total 
</p>
<p>population stands at 178.5 million, making Nigeria the most populated African country.  
</p>
<p>3. The three largest ethnic groups in the country are the Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba. Other 
</p>
<p>large ethnic groups include the Ekoi, Edo, Fulani, Ibibio, Idoma, Igala, Ijaw/Izon, Itsekiri, 
</p>
<p>Gwari, Jukun, Kanuri/Beriberi, Nupe, Urhobo and Tiv. Muslims constitute about 51 per 
</p>
<p>cent of the population, while Christians comprise approximately 47 per cent and almost 
</p>
<p>1 per cent of the population professes traditional religions. There are no official data on the 
</p>
<p>religious and ethnic composition of the population, but most Muslims constitute a majority 
</p>
<p>in the northern states, while Christian populations are predominant in the southern states. 
</p>
<p>The majority of Hausa and Fulani are Muslim, while Igbo are predominantly Christians and 
</p>
<p>Yoruba present a varied religious composition.  
</p>
<p>4. Nigeria is Africa&#8217;s largest economy, with the above-mentioned World Bank data 
</p>
<p>putting its gross domestic product growth at 6.5 per cent in 2012, and with oil accounting 
</p>
<p>for nearly 75 per cent of the country&#8217;s consolidated budgetary revenues. According to the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Nigeria receives more foreign 
</p>
<p>direct investment than any other country in Africa.2 Notwithstanding Nigeria&#8217;s strong 
</p>
<p>macroeconomic performance, a number of human development indicators and 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic statistics reveal profound deficits that must be addressed: the poverty rate 
</p>
<p>has reached 48 per cent of the population, with stark disparities between regions; poverty is 
</p>
<p>particularly concentrated in the northern regions, while the south-west has the lowest 
</p>
<p>poverty rates;3 in 2011, almost 24 per cent of the population was unemployed;4 the infant 
</p>
<p>under-five mortality rate ranks among the highest in the world, with 124 deaths per 1,000 
</p>
<p>live births in 2012;5 and the school attendance rate is low, with only 54 per cent of children

<p>of secondary school age going to school, and with vast differences across States and gender 
</p>
<p>disparities favouring boys over girls.6 
</p>
<p>5. Despite the lack of specific data on socioeconomic indicators for minorities, 
</p>
<p>available studies point to minorities as being particularly affected by poverty and low 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic conditions. For instance, in the oil-rich Niger Delta region, minority 
</p>
<p>communities, such as Ogoni or Ikwerre, rank among the poorest population groups, with 
</p>
<p>many lacking access to clean water or health care. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s analysis of Nigeria is based on the 1992 Declaration on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities 
</p>
<p>and other relevant international standards, from which she has identified the following areas 
</p>
<p>of concern: (a) the protection of a minority&#8217;s survival, through combating violence against 
</p>
<p>them and preventing genocide; (b) the protection and promotion of the cultural identity of 
</p>
<p>minority groups and the right to enjoy their collective identity and to reject forced 
</p>
<p>assimilation; (c) the guarantee of the rights to non-discrimination and equality, including 
</p>
<p>ending structural or systemic discrimination and the promotion of affirmative action when 
</p>
<p>required; and (d) the guarantee of the right to effective participation of minorities in public 
</p>
<p>life, especially with regard to decisions that affect them. She applies a gender perspective in 
</p>
<p>all the areas of her work. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur focuses her work on national, ethnic, religious and linguistic 
</p>
<p>groups, whose generally non-dominant, disadvantaged positions within society require 
</p>
<p>measures to allow them to exercise all their rights, including minority rights, to the fullest. 
</p>
<p>She notes that, in accordance with general comment 23 of the Human Rights Committee on 
</p>
<p>article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,7 the existence of 
</p>
<p>minorities is neither dependent on a decision by the State alone nor limited only to those 
</p>
<p>officially recognized minorities, but should be based on objective and subjective criteria 
</p>
<p>and the principle of self-identification. Consideration given to minority issues in her 
</p>
<p>analysis of Nigeria does not only reflect the national context, but also extends down to the 
</p>
<p>State and local contexts, where the dynamics and dimensions of identity, ethnicity, religion, 
</p>
<p>language, political participation and access to resources play a crucial role in the daily lives 
</p>
<p>of individuals and communities. She acknowledges that the notions of &#8220;minority&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;majority&#8221; are changeable and dependant on the context analysed. Majority groups at the 
</p>
<p>national level may be minority groups at the State and local levels. Equally, minority ethnic 
</p>
<p>groups in a region may be the majority religious groups and vice versa.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Historical background 
</b></p>
<p>8. A brief overview of the contemporary history is necessary to understand the current 
</p>
<p>situation of minorities and the political structure, legislation and policies that have shaped 
</p>
<p>present-day Nigeria. The following information was obtained from public governmental 
</p>
<p>and civil society sources.

</p>
<p>9. Modern Nigeria has been greatly influenced by its colonial history under the British 
</p>
<p>in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. During the nineteenth century, the British gained 
</p>
<p>influence over a vast territory in West Africa that included several kingdoms and domains. 
</p>
<p>At the end of that century, the British Empire established in the Delta region the Niger 
</p>
<p>Coast Protectorate while it expanded its influence over the region. In 1903, the Protectorate 
</p>
<p>of Northern Nigeria was established and the colonial rule over the territory known as 
</p>
<p>Nigeria began.  
</p>
<p>10. During the British colonial period (1900-1960), the territory was subjected to 
</p>
<p>frequent regional reorganizations for administrative purposes. The Niger Coast Protectorate 
</p>
<p>became Southern Nigeria, while in the northern part strategic alliances were made with 
</p>
<p>local leaders to control the different territories; local governments were left in the hands of 
</p>
<p>the traditional rulers, but were ultimately supervised and controlled by British officers, a 
</p>
<p>policy known as &#8220;indirect ruling&#8221;. In 1914, the South and North regions were merged into 
</p>
<p>the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. In 1954, a federal constitution further divided the 
</p>
<p>territory into three regions (North, East and West), where the major ethnic groups (Hausa-
</p>
<p>Fulani, Igbo and Yoruba) held dominant positions over the others. As the London 
</p>
<p>conferences in 1957 and 1958 for the independence of Nigeria were ongoing, minority 
</p>
<p>groups, fearing a future domination by the three major groups after independence, started to 
</p>
<p>advocate for the creation of separate states.  
</p>
<p>11. In 1957, the British Government appointed the Commission on Minority Groups in 
</p>
<p>Nigeria (known after its Chairman as the &#8220;Willink Commission&#8221;) with the mandate &#8220;(1) To 
</p>
<p>ascertain the facts about the fears of minorities in any part of Nigeria and to propose means 
</p>
<p>of allaying those fears, whether well- or ill-founded; (2) To advise what safeguards should 
</p>
<p>be included for this purpose in the Constitution of Nigeria; and (3) If, but only if, no other 
</p>
<p>solution seems to the Commission to meet the case, then, as a last resort to make detailed 
</p>
<p>recommendations for the creation of one or more new States&#8221;. The 1958 report of the 
</p>
<p>Commission did not recommend the creation of new States, on the grounds that they would 
</p>
<p>soon lead to new minority groups with similar claims, and instead encouraged a balance of 
</p>
<p>power between the different groups under a united Nigerian State. The Commission 
</p>
<p>suggested broad measures, including the establishment of councils in each &#8220;minority area&#8221; 
</p>
<p>that would &#8220;foster the well-being, cultural advancement and economic and social 
</p>
<p>development of the minority area and to bring to the notice of the regional government any 
</p>
<p>discrimination against the area&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>12. In 1960, Nigeria attained independence and, in the following years, significant 
</p>
<p>territorial changes took place aimed at providing ethnic minority groups with more 
</p>
<p>autonomy. In 1963, a fourth region (Mid-Western region) was created; in 1967, the four 
</p>
<p>regions were broken up into 12 states and, by 1976, the number of states within the 
</p>
<p>Federation had reached nineteen. At present, , the country comprises 36 states, in addition 
</p>
<p>to the Federal Capital Territory, where the capital city Abuja is located, and six geopolitical 
</p>
<p>zones.8 Several civil society organizations highlighted that, despite the number of territorial 
</p>
<p>reorganizations, the issue of minority groups has not been solved and, in many States, 
</p>
<p>tension between dominant and non-dominant groups persist.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 8 The National Conference that took place in 2014 recommended the creation of 18 additional states; 
</p>
<p>see Final Draft of Conference Report, p. 280, available from 
</p>

<p><b> IV. Non-discrimination and equality: legal and institutional 
framework 
</b></p>
<p>13. Statistical analysis is of paramount importance for an accurate identification of the 
</p>
<p>ethnic, religious and linguistic make-up of a country as diverse as Nigeria. Data collection 
</p>
<p>plays a vital role in revealing inequalities between groups in society and informs 
</p>
<p>appropriate actions to address them. The Special Rapporteur notes that Nigeria does not 
</p>
<p>collect or analyse data disaggregated by ethnicity, religion or language. Some civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations as well as the National Human Rights Commission stated their concern over 
</p>
<p>the lack of disaggregated statistical data and the outdated census information, given that the 
</p>
<p>census was last conducted in 2006. Other voices, however, were reticent about the 
</p>
<p>collection of disaggregated data, stating fears that sensitive data could be manipulated for 
</p>
<p>political ends.  
</p>
<p>14. The 1999 Constitution of Nigeria is the supreme law and enshrines the principle of 
</p>
<p>equality and non-discrimination under its article 42, paragraph 1, which contains general 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination provisions on the grounds of belonging to &#8220;a particular community, 
</p>
<p>ethnic group, place of origin, sex, religion or political opinion&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>15. The Constitution establishes in its article 14, paragraph 3, the so-called &#8220;federal 
</p>
<p>character principle&#8221;, which aims to ensure that public appointments reflect an equal 
</p>
<p>representation of all groups at the federal Government level by affirming that &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>composition of the Government of the Federation or any of its agencies and the conduct of 
</p>
<p>its affairs shall be carried out in such a manner as to reflect the federal character of Nigeria 
</p>
<p>and the need to promote national unity, and also to command national loyalty thereby 
</p>
<p>ensuring that there shall be no predominance of persons from a few states or from a few 
</p>
<p>ethnic or other sectional groups in that Government or in any of its agencies&#8221;. Article 14, 
</p>
<p>paragraph 4, further guarantees the participation of the different groups at the state and 
</p>
<p>local levels, by affirming that &#8220;the composition of the government of a state, a local 
</p>
<p>government council, or any of the agencies of such government or council, and the conduct 
</p>
<p>of the affairs of the government or council or such agencies, shall be carried out in such 
</p>
<p>manner as to recognize the diversity of the people within its area of authority and the need 
</p>
<p>to promote a sense of belonging and loyalty among all peoples of the Federation&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>16. Despite these provisions, several interviewees stated that the federal character 
</p>
<p>principle was not applied in practice, because it only reflected the political representation of 
</p>
<p>states at the federal level without applying other criteria, such as ethnic affiliation, in order 
</p>
<p>to guarantee that all groups are adequately represented at the different government levels 
</p>
<p>(local, state and federal). 
</p>
<p>17. The Federal Character Commission is a constitutionally sanctioned independent 
</p>
<p>body made up of 37 commissioners representing the 36 states and the Federal Capital 
</p>
<p>Territory. It was established by Decree No. 34 of 1996, with the mandate to give effect to 
</p>
<p>the federal character principle, and is entrusted with &#8220;the responsibility to promote, monitor 
</p>
<p>and enforce compliance with the principles of the proportional sharing of all bureaucratic, 
</p>
<p>economic, media and political posts at all level of government&#8221;. The Commission&#8217;s main 
</p>
<p>functions include monitoring compliance with the Commission&#8217;s guidelines of the 
</p>
<p>recruitment procedures by the Government, investigation of complaints, enforcement 
</p>
<p>measures in case of failure to comply with the Commission&#8217;s guidelines and data analysis. 
</p>
<p>18. The National Human Rights Commission was created by a 1995 act that was 
</p>
<p>subsequently amended in 2010 to provide it with additional powers. As an independent 
</p>
<p>human rights monitoring body, it investigates alleged cases of human rights violations and 
</p>
<p>makes recommendations to the Federal Government, receives and investigates complaints 
</p>
<p>concerning human rights violations, assists victims and seeks appropriate redress and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/64/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>remedies on their behalf, conducts studies on all matters pertaining to human rights, 
</p>
<p>organizes seminars, workshops and other related activities. Since 2010, the decisions made 
</p>
<p>by the Commission&#8217;s Governing Council have been deemed as decisions of the High Court. 
</p>
<p>The Commission has branch offices located in each of the six geopolitical zones. 
</p>
<p>19. Nigeria is a State party to the core international human rights treaties of particular 
</p>
<p>importance to the rights of minorities, including the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
</p>
<p>International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and 
</p>
<p>other key treaties. Nigeria is also a State party to the African Charter on Human and 
</p>
<p>Peoples&#8217; Rights, the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance and the 
</p>
<p>Charter for African Cultural Renaissance. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Identity, ethnicity and religion 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Indigenes/settlers dichotomy 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Constitution contains a provision in its article 147, paragraph 3, relative to the 
</p>
<p>appointment by the President of &#8220;at least one Minister from each State, who shall be an 
</p>
<p>indigene of such State&#8221;. However, the Constitution does not provide a definition of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;indigene&#8221; or &#8220;settler&#8221; status. Those interviewed described a socially entrenched distinction 
</p>
<p>between those recognized as the original inhabitants of a State (indigenes) and those who 
</p>
<p>are not (settlers). 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the distinction between indigenes and 
</p>
<p>settlers can be traced back to colonial times, when British rule promoted alliances with 
</p>
<p>certain ethnic groups, imposing differentiated treatment to groups and allowing the rise of 
</p>
<p>new dominant ones. Community and civil society representatives repeatedly highlighted the 
</p>
<p>relevance of the categorization of indigenes/settlers at the state and local levels in today&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Nigeria, and its profound impact on people&#8217;s lives. It was pointed out that those regarded as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;indigenes citizens&#8221; are given preferential access to public resources, government jobs, 
</p>
<p>university education and scholarships and access to land, opportunities not provided to the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;settlers&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>22. In order to confirm the status of &#8220;indigene person&#8221;, a &#8220;certificate of indigeneship&#8221; 
</p>
<p>issued by the local government is required. In the light of the absence of guidelines to 
</p>
<p>regulate the indigeneship status, local and state governments enjoy total discretion to grant 
</p>
<p>it or not. The Special Rapporteur was informed that long-term residency in a state, even if 
</p>
<p>for generations, is not considered a criterion that entitles a person or community to be 
</p>
<p>considered indigenes, and therefore long-term residents are often denied indigeneship 
</p>
<p>certificates.  
</p>
<p>23. Supporters of the so-called &#8220;indigenes clause&#8221; maintain that this status is meant to 
</p>
<p>protect the rights of minority groups in States where indigenes are no longer a numerical 
</p>
<p>majority. In Kaduna and Plateau States, the Special Rapporteur met with some community 
</p>
<p>leaders who claimed that &#8220;indigeneship is defined by owning land, customs and traditions&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>that permitted the preservation of the linkage with their ancestors. She also met with critics 
</p>
<p>of the &#8220;indigenes clause&#8221;, who affirmed that this distinction had led to a privileged status 
</p>
<p>for some citizens and constituted a violation of the right to equality and non-discrimination 
</p>
<p>enshrined in the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>24. Some civil society representatives advocated for the introduction of clearer 
</p>
<p>provisions in the Constitution to regulate the status of indigeneship, on the grounds that the 
</p>
<p>current constitutional provision is vague and subject to discretional interpretation. Several </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/64/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>participants strongly advocated for a &#8220;residence clause&#8221;, whereby specific residency 
</p>
<p>requirements based on length of residence in a region replaced the indigene/settler 
</p>
<p>dichotomy.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Minority groups in the Middle Belt region 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur visited Plateau and Kaduna States, comprising the so-called 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Middle Belt&#8221; region, a central area characterized by its ethnic and religious diversity. The 
</p>
<p>region, and particularly Plateau and Kaduna States, have been the scene of several violent 
</p>
<p>intercommunal clashes among ethnic and religious communities over the past decades, 
</p>
<p>resulting in over 10,000 deaths since 1992.9 The terrorist group Boko Haram has recently 
</p>
<p>been responsible for numerous deadly attacks across the country, particularly in the North 
</p>
<p>and the Middle Belt, including bomb attacks resulting in more than 2,000 deaths in the first 
</p>
<p>half of 2014 alone.10 
</p>
<p>26. In the course interviews, including with security forces, representatives of the 
</p>
<p>National Human Rights Commission headquarters in Jos and Kaduna, Plateau State 
</p>
<p>authorities, Muslim and Christian leaders and victims of intercommunal violence, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was informed that the root causes of the intercommunal episodes of 
</p>
<p>violence are diverse, complex and intertwined, involving the issue of indigenes/settlers, 
</p>
<p>competition for resources, climate change, poverty, good governance deficits, partisan 
</p>
<p>politics, impunity and the use of ethno-religious dimensions for political purposes, given 
</p>
<p>that in many situations ethnic and religious identity overlap.  
</p>
<p>27. The distinction between indigenes and settlers has played a significant role in the 
</p>
<p>conflicts in the Middle Belt. In Plateau and Kaduna States, some ethnic groups who have 
</p>
<p>lived in the region for generations are still regarded as settlers and therefore cannot benefit 
</p>
<p>from certain economic and social opportunities. In Plateau State, indigene ethnic groups are 
</p>
<p>mainly Christian, while Muslim Hausa-Fulani residents and pastoralists are regarded as 
</p>
<p>settlers. Disputes include competing claims to indigene status, inequality in access to 
</p>
<p>politics owing to the difficulties and/or impossibility to run for elections for settlers, the use 
</p>
<p>of land and access to university education and scholarships, where indigenes have 
</p>
<p>preferential treatment. 
</p>
<p>28. Civil society representatives in Jos stressed that, in most places, there are no legal 
</p>
<p>provisions prohibiting the political participation of settlers at the local and state levels, but 
</p>
<p>there is &#8220;a social prohibition&#8221;, owing to the fear of indigene communities that settlers will 
</p>
<p>augment their power by running for elections. This prohibition, which would ignite feelings 
</p>
<p>of frustration and resentment, was identified as a relevant trigger of violence. Civil society 
</p>
<p>actors stated that political interference and the imposition of Government-favoured 
</p>
<p>candidates over more popular candidates can provoke violence if the pro-Government 
</p>
<p>candidate wins. The need for good governance as a mean to lessen tensions was repeatedly 
</p>
<p>emphasized.  
</p>
<p>29. During the consultations held in Plateau and Kaduna States, it was commonly stated 
</p>
<p>that the economic aspect of the situation of disadvantaged minority groups could not be 
</p>
<p>underestimated when analysing the root causes of the conflicts in the Middle-Belt region. 
</p>
<p>High levels of poverty, unemployment and illiteracy were identified as concrete 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic issues contributing to fuelling intercommunal violence. The lack of social

<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>and economic opportunities was regarded as a main driver that resulted in competition for 
</p>
<p>resources and growing suspicions and hostility among groups. Minority women and girls 
</p>
<p>were regarded as particularly affected by low socioeconomic status and insecurity.  
</p>
<p>30. Interviewees in Jos and Kaduna explained that competition for land between 
</p>
<p>nomadic pastoralists and local farmers was a major conflict-generating issue in both Plateau 
</p>
<p>and Kaduna States; the arrival of herders from Northern Nigeria, most of them Fulani 
</p>
<p>Muslims in search of new grazing routes, is perceived by farmers, mostly Christians, as a 
</p>
<p>threat to their economy and lifestyle. Pastoralists resent their limited access to public 
</p>
<p>resources and feel discriminated against. The effects of climate change are also a cause of 
</p>
<p>land competition in that, owing to the increasing desertification and droughts affecting the 
</p>
<p>north, the grazing lands where pastoralists can take their herds have been reduced, forcing 
</p>
<p>them to move south. In parallel, local farmers in the Middle Belt have been taking more 
</p>
<p>land for cultivation, in some cases including long-agreed grazing routes for herders, 
</p>
<p>resulting in a reduction of places for herders to water and graze their stock.  
</p>
<p>31. Most civil society and government representatives asserted that the current religious 
</p>
<p>and ethnic dimensions of the conflicts were not a primary cause by themselves, but a result 
</p>
<p>of the use of these factors by the different groups in order to mobilize and reach out to a 
</p>
<p>larger number of people to their cause. This has added an extra layer of complexity to the 
</p>
<p>situation while extending the conflict, owing to the escalation of violence through 
</p>
<p>retaliation. A commentator said that &#8220;if a person of an ethnic or religious group is killed, 
</p>
<p>that person goes and kills people of the other group&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>32. Most people consulted repeatedly highlighted the widespread lack of accountability 
</p>
<p>and impunity for instigators and perpetrators of violence. It was noted that law enforcement 
</p>
<p>is of paramount importance to guarantee the principle of rule of law and to prevent violence 
</p>
<p>from escalating further; in fact, participants in consultations affirmed that impunity was 
</p>
<p>reinforcing the cycle of violence and retaliatory actions, leading people to take the law into 
</p>
<p>their own hands. 
</p>
<p>33. State-sponsored security initiatives have been launched in both Plateau and Kaduna 
</p>
<p>States to tackle the recurring episodes of violence affecting the region. A special joint 
</p>
<p>security initiative, &#8220;Operation Rainbow&#8221;, began in Plateau State in 2010, inspired by a 
</p>
<p>similar security initiative implemented by Kaduna State known as &#8220;Operation Yaki&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Operation Rainbow is entrusted with &#8220;ensuring peace and security of lives and properties 
</p>
<p>on the Plateau through the process of proper articulation and deployment of all embracing 
</p>
<p>measures that would adequately address and contain the democratic values and rule of law 
</p>
<p>issues that have potentials of leading to crisis in the state&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>34. Operation Rainbow was framed as a multi-faceted intervention that focuses on four 
</p>
<p>different dimensions: (a) political, through fostering dialogue with a range of stakeholders 
</p>
<p>to promote good governance; (b) economic, by implementing youth and women 
</p>
<p>empowerment programmes as well as training courses to promote employment; (c) social, 
</p>
<p>by encouraging dialogue among a wide range of stakeholders, such as civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations, traditional rulers, religious leaders and family members; and (d) security, 
</p>
<p>through the deployment of security forces. Operation Rainbow includes a system of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;neighbourhood watch&#8221;, where specially trained members of communities gather and report 
</p>
<p>relevant information to prevent violent conflicts. It was acknowledged that shortages in 
</p>
<p>relation to police resources, such as lack of fuel for police vehicles, must be addressed. 
</p>
<p>35. Civil society actors stated that security forces must be given sufficient and adequate 
</p>
<p>capacity, training and resources to perform their duties. Training in human rights must be 
</p>
<p>an integral part of security forces&#8217; instruction. Nevertheless, they noted that sustainable 
</p>
<p>solutions to communal violence require not only a heightened security response, but also a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying causes of violence, particularly good </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/64/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>governance deficits, failure to hold perpetrators accountable and low socioeconomic status 
</p>
<p>of certain vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Religious minorities in Plateau and Kaduna States 
</b></p>
<p>36. Nigeria is a multi-faith society where religion plays an important role in people&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>daily lives. In most cases, religious communities live harmoniously in a climate of mutual 
</p>
<p>respect and acceptance, work together to foster interfaith dialogue, engage in shared 
</p>
<p>activities for the benefit of their communities and strengthen understanding and dialogue 
</p>
<p>between them. 
</p>
<p>37. Plateau and Kaduna States comprise large communities of Christians and Muslims 
</p>
<p>that have coexisted peacefully. Nevertheless, in some locations, the climate of mutual trust 
</p>
<p>and respect among interreligious communities has been eroded over recent years, leading to 
</p>
<p>growing feelings of mutual suspicions and fears. In some cases, the divisions have become 
</p>
<p>geographical, with separate neighbourhoods emerging along religious lines. It was stated by 
</p>
<p>some commentators that, in Kaduna State and its capital, the northern part is predominantly 
</p>
<p>inhabited by Muslim Hausa-Fulani communities while Christian ethnic groups were 
</p>
<p>moving to the southern part. 
</p>
<p>38. Episodes of intercommunal violence in both States have affected members of both 
</p>
<p>Christian and Muslim communities, which constitute religious minority groups depending 
</p>
<p>on their location in each State. Some victims of intercommunal violence reported growing 
</p>
<p>levels of religious intolerance and reprisals on the grounds of their religious beliefs, 
</p>
<p>including physical attacks.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur met with Christian victims of violence in Jos. They recalled 
</p>
<p>an attack against them and other members of the community in 2012 perpetrated by groups 
</p>
<p>they described as radical Islamists. The victims referred to the &#8220;radical ideology&#8221; of the 
</p>
<p>attackers as the root cause of the violence. They claimed to have reported the attack to the 
</p>
<p>police but that no action had been taken against the perpetrators. The victims insisted on the 
</p>
<p>need for accountability for justice and as a meaningful and effective deterrent. They 
</p>
<p>regretted what they regarded as a total impunity of those responsible for instigating and 
</p>
<p>conducting the attacks. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur visited the internally displaced persons camp of Mandu Hajj 
</p>
<p>in Kaduna South and held interviews with some Muslim victims who were still living in the 
</p>
<p>camp (they were required by authorities to leave by the same day). They recalled the attack 
</p>
<p>suffered by their community in Kaduna State in 2011, in which a mob of people started to 
</p>
<p>burn the houses of the community following the announcement of the presidential election 
</p>
<p>results. Dozens of people were reported to have died during the attack. Some contended 
</p>
<p>that the attack was mainly politically motivated, while others maintained it was religiously 
</p>
<p>motivated but sparked by political factors. They stated that security forces did not arrive 
</p>
<p>when the attack started, despite the numerous calls made. A victim affirmed that he was 
</p>
<p>told that the police could not go because &#8220;they did not have fuel in the cars&#8221;. It was stressed 
</p>
<p>that the perpetrators were currently free and had not been convicted or arrested.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur witnessed the poor conditions in which the victims had to 
</p>
<p>live at Mandu Hajj camp, where they were placed after the attack, including overcrowded 
</p>
<p>rooms separated by sexes and not on the basis of family ties and lack of electricity and 
</p>
<p>water supply. Some babies were reported to have died due to diarrhoea and other infections 
</p>
<p>during the months the camp was operative. The victims indicated that the Government had 
</p>
<p>promised them compensation to rebuild their houses but they had only received a minimal 
</p>
<p>amount that did not cover their expenses. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/64/Add.2

<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur met with leaders of the Muslim and Christian communities 
</p>
<p>in Plateau and Kaduna States. In Jos, she met leaders of the Muslim community, who 
</p>
<p>highlighted that the root causes of the violence against Muslims in the State included the 
</p>
<p>stigmatization of the Muslims, which had been caused by a widespread perception of 
</p>
<p>Muslims as &#8220;threats&#8221;. Political leaders were accused of playing a key role in fuelling the 
</p>
<p>tensions. Muslim leaders also stressed that Boko Haram did not represent Islam in Nigeria 
</p>
<p>or globally and had also targeted and killed Muslims.  
</p>
<p>43. Leaders highlighted other problems faced by the Muslim community, including the 
</p>
<p>impossibility to obtain an indigenes certificate despite numerous years of residence, the 
</p>
<p>lack of adequate political representation at the local and state levels and difficulties in 
</p>
<p>gaining access to university, given that scholarships were reserved for indigenes. One of the 
</p>
<p>participants stated that &#8220;this means making marginalized communities more marginalized&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>44. In Kaduna, the Special Rapporteur met with the Executive Secretary of the Northern 
</p>
<p>Christian Association of Nigeria. He claimed that distorted religious principles lay at the 
</p>
<p>root of the problems and violent episodes of intercommunal conflicts. He noted that 
</p>
<p>political competition was another factor leading to intercommunal conflicts, as the 
</p>
<p>Christian community had begun to get more involved in politics and governance. He 
</p>
<p>affirmed that, in order to address the menace of Boko Haram, it was necessary to combine 
</p>
<p>an effective security response with appropriate education measures, including human rights 
</p>
<p>education in the school curriculum. 
</p>
<p>45. While recognizing the profound problems and diverse challenges that threaten 
</p>
<p>sustainable peace in the Middle Belt, the Special Rapporteur was impressed by numerous 
</p>
<p>initiatives led by the civil society and religious leaders to achieve conflict resolution and 
</p>
<p>bridge the gap between communities in both Plateau and Kaduna States. In Jos, she learned 
</p>
<p>about examples of Muslim leaders working in partnership with Christian leaders to address 
</p>
<p>together the conflicts and find adequate solutions collaboratively. 
</p>
<p>46. In Kaduna, the Special Rapporteur met with the leaders of the organization 
</p>
<p>Christian-Muslim Alternative to Conflict, which was established in 2013. The organization 
</p>
<p>gathers several Christian and Muslim groups and its main focus is to promote dialogue and 
</p>
<p>mediation in community conflicts as a tool to achieve peace and foster interreligious 
</p>
<p>dialogue. She also learned about the activities of the Interfaith Mediation Center, a non-
</p>
<p>governmental organization founded in 1995 that had been conducting peacebuilding and 
</p>
<p>mediation work to settle conflicts between Muslim and Christian communities across the 
</p>
<p>Middle Belt. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn about peacebuilding initiatives led by 
</p>
<p>women. She met with the president of the Women Without Walls Initiative, an organization 
</p>
<p>jointly founded and run by Christian and Muslim women in Jos that works to implement a 
</p>
<p>non-violent and inclusive approach to conflict resolution through various educational 
</p>
<p>community projects targeting women and young people. Its initiatives include the 
</p>
<p>rehabilitation of schools, organization of conflict management seminars for young people 
</p>
<p>and the implementation of programmes to foster women&#8217;s economic empowerment. The 
</p>
<p>Initiative also promotes awareness of the role of women in peacebuilding and conflict 
</p>
<p>resolution. 
</p>
<p>48. Other peacebuilding initiatives led by women included a peace education project in 
</p>
<p>Bauchi carried out by a young woman using her own resources who had been working with 
</p>
<p>hundreds of children in different schools to foster understanding, trust and mutual 
</p>
<p>acceptance among them as well as to engage them with children in other countries affected 
</p>
<p>by conflict. </p>

<p><b> VI. Minority groups in the Niger Delta 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Niger Delta is located in the Southern part of Nigeria, comprising an area of 
</p>
<p>70,000 km
2
 that encompasses nine States: Abia, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, 
</p>
<p>Edo, Imo, Ondo and Rivers. The Niger Delta is crossed by the Niger River, the largest river 
</p>
<p>in Nigeria, in a land covered with swamps, rainforests and woodlands. It is a region 
</p>
<p>extremely rich in natural resources, particularly in oil, which was discovered in the 1950s. 
</p>
<p>50. The Niger Delta is home to a large number of ethnic groups and communities, 
</p>
<p>including Ijwa, Ikwerre, Itsekiri, Isoko, Ogoni and Ukwuani. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>travelled to Rivers State, where she visited Port Harcourt, the Ogoni communities of Bodo 
</p>
<p>and Goi and the Ikwerre community of Rumuekpe. 
</p>
<p>51. In Port Harcourt, representatives of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni 
</p>
<p>People briefed the Special Rapporteur on the current situation of the Ogoni communities. 
</p>
<p>Ogoniland is located in Rivers State and covers around 1,000 km
2
. It has been the site of oil 
</p>
<p>industry operations since the late 1950s. Ogoniland suffers from severe and well-
</p>
<p>documented environmental pollution from oil spills and oil well fires that have 
</p>
<p>contaminated the land, water, vegetation and air, with a devastating impact on the 
</p>
<p>livelihoods of many Ogoni communities. In a 2011 report, the United Nations Environment 
</p>
<p>Programme (UNEP) found that oil contamination in Ogoniland was &#8220;widespread and 
</p>
<p>severely impacting many components of the environment&#8221;.11 It also noted that most 
</p>
<p>residents had lived with chronic oil pollution throughout their lives, with grave impacts on 
</p>
<p>their health and livelihoods, as well as the presence of high levels of contaminants, 
</p>
<p>including the known carcinogen benzene, in communities&#8217; drinking water. 
</p>
<p>52. In the report, UNEP stated that the environmental restoration of Ogoniland was 
</p>
<p>possible, but warned that it would take 25 to 30 years. The recommendations contained in 
</p>
<p>the report included the creation by the Government of an Ogoniland Environmental 
</p>
<p>Restoration Authority to oversee the implementation of the recommendations and the 
</p>
<p>establishment of an Environmental Restoration Fund with an initial provision of $1 billion. 
</p>
<p>In July 2012, a special unit within the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources,  the 
</p>
<p>Hydrocarbon Pollution Restoration Project, was created and entrusted with the mission to 
</p>
<p>protect and restore the environmental human rights of all communities affected by 
</p>
<p>hydrocarbon pollution in Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>53. In Bodo community, some Ogoni leaders described the Ogonis as &#8220;a minority within 
</p>
<p>a minority&#8221; and highlighted the main problems faced by the community, particularly the 
</p>
<p>effects of the oil spills that they allege to be caused by the petrochemical company Shell, 
</p>
<p>which have severely polluted the soil and the water, resulting in health problems, limiting 
</p>
<p>farming and creating a food crisis. They claimed that neither the federal nor the local 
</p>
<p>government had visited the community to inquire about their situation. They described 
</p>
<p>having each being offered financial compensation by Shell that they had refused to accept, 
</p>
<p>considering it inadequate. The representatives stated that they wanted the oil company to 
</p>
<p>access the community and clean the polluted area. 
</p>
<p>54. Other areas of concern stressed by the Bodo community leaders included the 
</p>
<p>underrepresentation of Ogoni people in politics and the declining situation of the Ogoni 
</p>
<p>language, which is no longer included in the school curriculum, the only mandatory 
</p>
<p>languages since 1986 being Ibo, Hausa and Fulani. It was noted that the Ogoni language 
</p>
<p>was featured on local television for only 15 minutes per day, and not at all at the federal 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p>level. The representatives advocated for a multilingual education programme in schools that 
</p>
<p>included teaching children their mother tongue. One of the community representatives said 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;Once you lose the language, you lose your identity, and therefore who you are&#8221;, and 
</p>
<p>stated that between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of the children currently did not speak their 
</p>
<p>local languages. 
</p>
<p>55. In Goi, community representatives stated that the land of the community had been 
</p>
<p>abandoned owing to oil pollution. Many people in the community reportedly suffered from 
</p>
<p>health problems, particularly asthma and skin-related diseases, and there was a high 
</p>
<p>prevalence of miscarriages among women. The primary source of livelihood for the 
</p>
<p>community was fishing, which had been lost when the water and soil became polluted. Goi 
</p>
<p>representatives protested that the community had not been recognized as being affected by 
</p>
<p>oil pollution. They reported a lack of basic services in the community, such as a hospital or 
</p>
<p>a school. The Special Rapporteur visited areas of the community affected by oil spills and 
</p>
<p>saw first-hand the devastating effects of oil pollution. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur visited Rumuekpe, an Ikwerre community that had been 
</p>
<p>abandoned after an intercommunal conflict from 2005 to 2010. Community members 
</p>
<p>commented that tensions within the community were linked to the disagreements over 
</p>
<p>payments by oil companies to some community members. In 2010, the community had 
</p>
<p>signed a peace agreement and some currently displaced people were returning to the area. 
</p>
<p>During the visit, community representatives pointed out that, despite the fact that there were 
</p>
<p>currently four oil companies operating in Rumuekpe, the community lacked basic services, 
</p>
<p>such as a hospital, school and water supply. One commentator claimed that &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>Government has not provided any service and always takes the side of the oil companies. 
</p>
<p>They [oil companies] blackmail the Government by not paying revenues or stopping 
</p>
<p>production in order to get what they want&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur consulted representative from Shell Nigeria to seek the 
</p>
<p>company&#8217;s views on the situation and to find out its activities in the Niger Delta. Shell 
</p>
<p>informed her that the company had not operated in Ogoniland since 1993, but 
</p>
<p>acknowledged that two of its pipelines passed through the Ogoni territory. Shell claimed 
</p>
<p>that the profound environmental degradation was mainly due to oil spills caused by the 
</p>
<p>sabotage of pipelines and bunkering (the illegal tapping of pipelines and small-scale 
</p>
<p>refining). It indicated that, according to its own estimations, in 2012, 95 per cent of spill 
</p>
<p>volumes were caused by sabotage and only 5 per cent were due to Shell&#8217;s operations. The 
</p>
<p>company stated that compensation to the affected communities was only payable in the 
</p>
<p>event of an operational spill.  
</p>
<p>58. Shell affirmed that, if granted access to the territory of a community that has 
</p>
<p>suffered an oil spill, it would clean up the polluted area. It indicated that Bodo community 
</p>
<p>leaders had not granted them access to the community. It also stated that communities had 
</p>
<p>denied it access to the sites in order to claim higher compensation. Shell representatives 
</p>
<p>noted that it would like the Government to play a more active role in the development and 
</p>
<p>regeneration of the area. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Governance and political participation 
</b></p>
<p>59. It was frequently stated by civil society organizations, community representatives, 
</p>
<p>youth groups and religious leaders that good governance and inclusive political 
</p>
<p>participation were key factors to achieve social and political stability as well as a means to 
</p>
<p>overcome many of the socioeconomic challenges faced by Nigeria at present. One 
</p>
<p>commentator acknowledged that &#8220;Nigerians would care less about ethnicity and religion if 
</p>
<p>poverty and inequalities were really addressed&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/64/Add.2

</b></p>
<p>60. Several non-governmental organizations reported endemic corruption permeating 
</p>
<p>the local, state and Federal political levels, and denounced the lack of budgetary 
</p>
<p>transparency, which renders extremely difficult the monitoring and accountability of 
</p>
<p>political actors. There was a commonly shared claim that revenues from petroleum, which 
</p>
<p>constitute most of the national wealth, were not trickling down to communities. In the 
</p>
<p>December 2013 report on Nigeria of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, 
</p>
<p>C&#244;te d'Ivoire recommended that Nigeria &#8220;reinforce anti-corruption laws&#8221;.12 This 
</p>
<p>recommendation enjoyed the support of Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>61. The Government stated that the Constitution provided equal opportunities for 
</p>
<p>political participation. It was stressed that the Federal Character Commission was the body 
</p>
<p>in charge of guaranteeing equality of State representation in Federal institutions and 
</p>
<p>administrations, through the application of the federal character principle. This principle 
</p>
<p>can be traced back to the quota system introduced in the recruitment procedures of the 
</p>
<p>Nigerian Armed Forces before independence, as a means to ensure no particular group 
</p>
<p>would be a majority in the army.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur met with several members of the Federal Character 
</p>
<p>Commission in Abuja. They informed her about the work of the Commission to foster a 
</p>
<p>regional balance in public representation, particularly the development of a set of guidelines 
</p>
<p>for the distribution of posts in the federal public service, including a provision stating that 
</p>
<p>the indigenes of any State shall not constitute less than 2.5 per cent or not more than 3 per 
</p>
<p>cent of the total positions available, including junior staff at the head office. It was also 
</p>
<p>stressed that ethnic and religious aspects were not taken into account in applying the federal 
</p>
<p>character principle in order to preserve the secular character of the Nigerian State.  
</p>
<p>63. Numerous non-governmental sources contended that the fact that the Federal 
</p>
<p>Character Commission did not consider ethnic and religious aspects in applying the federal 
</p>
<p>character principle rendered the equality of the representation of States&#8217; groups ineffective. 
</p>
<p>Some representatives of non-governmental organizations affirmed that it was necessary to 
</p>
<p>rethink the mandate and composition of the Commission in order to establish a proportional 
</p>
<p>representation to ensure that ethnic and religious diversity was fully reflected within 
</p>
<p>national, state and local institutions.  
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, despite the relevant role played by 
</p>
<p>women, particularly minority women, in civil society initiatives, she hardly encountered 
</p>
<p>women participating in Government and political leadership. She was informed of the 
</p>
<p>adoption in December 2006 of the National Gender Policy,13 which includes among its 
</p>
<p>goals &#8220;to achieve gender equity in political participation and representation, and to draw up 
</p>
<p>mechanisms for the empowerment of women in politics&#8221;. The National Gender Policy 
</p>
<p>reserves a quota of 30 per cent of political positions for women, in order to increase the 
</p>
<p>number of women in elective positions and decision-making processes. She was informed 
</p>
<p>of the growing presence of women in high-level political positions, and the appointment of 
</p>
<p>13 women as ministers following the 2011 elections. Nevertheless, the political 
</p>
<p>participation of women in Nigeria remains low; according to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Development Programme, only 32 out of 469 seats in the National Parliament are held by 
</p>
<p>women, which constitutes 8 per cent of the total representation.14 There is a lack of 
</p>
<p>information regarding the political participation of minority women and the challenges they 
</p>
<p>face in having their voices heard.

</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the establishment of the National Dialogue 
</p>
<p>Conference 2014, a nationwide forum convened in Abuja under the auspices of the 
</p>
<p>Government to bring together a wide range of stakeholders (492 delegates representing 
</p>
<p>ethnic groups, civil society organizations, political parties and professional associations, 
</p>
<p>among others) to discuss and address the challenges Nigeria faces. Many civil society 
</p>
<p>actors noted that the Conference could provide an ideal arena to discuss nationally long-
</p>
<p>standing minority issues and challenges and provide communities with a participatory role 
</p>
<p>in this forum. Interviewees expressed hope that representatives of minority groups would be 
</p>
<p>invited to attend the meetings.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur notes that further consideration of the outcomes of the 
</p>
<p>National Dialogue Conference 2014 are required in order to understand the implications for 
</p>
<p>minority issues. However, she welcomed the recommendation of the Conference that States 
</p>
<p>should establish a 35 per cent quota to ensure that women, minorities, people with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and other marginalized groups participate and are represented in governance and 
</p>
<p>other spheres of life.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Linguistic rights 
</b></p>
<p>67. According to estimates of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Organization (UNESCO),15 27 languages are currently endangered in Nigeria. However, a 
</p>
<p>pilot survey on endangered languages and cultures in Nigeria conducted by the Federal 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Tourism, Culture and National Orientation in 2010 determined that there were 
</p>
<p>520 languages in the country, hundreds which fell into the category of &#8220;endangered 
</p>
<p>language&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>68. Diverse civil society actors also conveyed their concerns over minority languages in 
</p>
<p>decline or at risk of disappearing within their territories and lamented those already lost. 
</p>
<p>Many spoke passionately about the need to implement measures to protect their mother 
</p>
<p>tongues. Various reasons have been given as the leading causes of the disappearance of 
</p>
<p>minority languages, including the lack of mother-tongue instruction, the failure to include 
</p>
<p>minority languages in the school curriculum, the lack of political willingness to promote 
</p>
<p>local languages, the pressure exerted by languages spoken by large populations of speakers 
</p>
<p>and the abandonment of native languages in favour of Nigerian Pidgin or English, among 
</p>
<p>others. 
</p>
<p>69. It was evident that there were different and opposing approaches to how to tackle the 
</p>
<p>problem of the decline and disappearance of minority languages in Nigeria. Some described 
</p>
<p>the need to amend article 55 of the Constitution, which states that &#8220;the business of the 
</p>
<p>National Assembly shall be conducted in English, and in Hausa, Ibo and Yoruba when 
</p>
<p>adequate arrangements have been made thereof&#8221;, considering it gives prevalence to three 
</p>
<p>specific languages over all others. This approach was also very critical of the current 
</p>
<p>language education curriculum in Nigerian schools, in which it is compulsory to study 
</p>
<p>either Hausa, Ibo or Yoruba, in addition to English, and which does not have any provision 
</p>
<p>regarding minority language education. 
</p>
<p>70. On the other hand, some were of the opinion that prioritizing Hausa, Ibo and Yoruba 
</p>
<p>languages, the three most widely spoken languages, along with English, was beneficial. 
</p>
<p>Those of this perspective maintained that it was not feasible to provide mother-tongue 
</p>
<p>education in each of the minority languages, given their large number. Instead, they 
</p>
<p>maintained that the primary responsibility for educating children in their mother tongue was 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/64/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>of parents. They also emphasized the importance and significance of keeping at least these 
</p>
<p>three native Nigerian languages mandatory alongside English.  
</p>
<p>71. Representatives of the Ministry of Culture acknowledged they were in favour of the 
</p>
<p>introduction of some criteria to teach local languages in schools and highlighted the 
</p>
<p>importance of preserving minority languages as part of the cultural heritage of the peoples. 
</p>
<p>As one of the representatives asserted, &#8220;once the language dies, the culture dies&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>72. Article 4, paragraph 3, of the 1992 Declaration on Minorities calls on States to take 
</p>
<p>appropriate measures so that, wherever possible, persons belonging to minorities may have 
</p>
<p>adequate opportunities to learn their mother tongue or to have instruction in their mother 
</p>
<p>tongue. In its position paper on education in a multilingual world,16 UNESCO asserts that 
</p>
<p>mother-tongue instruction is highly beneficial in terms of school performance; it allows 
</p>
<p>students learn to read more quickly and to learn to read in a second language more quickly, 
</p>
<p>and students taught to read in their mother tongue also acquire academic learning skills 
</p>
<p>more quickly. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the programme implemented by the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Culture, currently in its second phase, to safeguard endangered languages, as well as the 
</p>
<p>existence of the National Institute for Nigerian Languages, a specialized body in the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Education in charge of languages, a main objective of which is the promotion 
</p>
<p>of &#8220;the study and use of Nigerian languages&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> IX. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The history and configuration of present-day Nigeria is inextricably linked to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the existence of hundreds of ethnic groups and languages. For the most part, Nigeria 
</b></p>
<p><b>has managed to achieve a relatively peaceful and harmonious coexistence among the 
</b></p>
<p><b>different groups. However, such diversity also poses important challenges to manage 
</b></p>
<p><b>and appropriately address intercommunal and minority issues and to foster the 
</b></p>
<p><b>conditions to ensure continued peaceful coexistence. While the principle of equality 
</b></p>
<p><b>and non-discrimination is recognized in the Constitution, in order to implement 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate measures to guarantee equality and minority rights it is necessary to know 
</b></p>
<p><b>in depth the composition of all groups within the country and understand the 
</b></p>
<p><b>inequalities, challenges and issues that exist.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Indigenes/settlers dichotomy 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur considers the distinction between indigenes and 
</b></p>
<p><b>settlers to be potentially damaging to intergroup relations and peaceful coexistence. It 
</b></p>
<p><b>has opened and reinforced ethnic and religious cleavages and contributed to tensions 
</b></p>
<p><b>and conflict. Some groups regard indigene status as a safeguard of their rights in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>light of the growing numbers, influence and economic dominance of other groups, 
</b></p>
<p><b>while others consider it a breach of the right to equality and non-discrimination. If 
</b></p>
<p><b>this distinction is maintained, further legal clarity will be required to regulate the 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigeneship status and guarantee that no person is unfairly discriminated against or 
</b></p>
<p><b>excluded from access to services and resources, land or the right to participate fully in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the economic, social, cultural and political life.</b>

</p>
<p><b>  Middle Belt communities 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The Middle Belt region comprises an ethnically, religiously and linguistically 
</b></p>
<p><b>diverse mosaic of groups and communities, which for the most part have lived 
</b></p>
<p><b>together in harmony and mutual respect. Nevertheless, over the past years, some 
</b></p>
<p><b>States in the region have suffered episodes of intercommunal violence that, while 
</b></p>
<p><b>exhibiting ethnic and religious dimensions, have root causes that are complex and 
</b></p>
<p><b>multi-faceted. They are rarely based on ethnicity or religious factors alone.</b> 
</p>
<p>77. <b>The distinct status of indigenes and settlers and the unclear criteria to 
</b></p>
<p><b>differentiate between them have frequently resulted in profound socioeconomic 
</b></p>
<p><b>inequalities among citizens living in the same State. Many of those regarded as settlers 
</b></p>
<p><b>have been living in a given State for generations and yet face insurmountable 
</b></p>
<p><b>obstacles to exercise their rights to political participation at the local and State levels, 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to public jobs, scholarships and land. This differentiated status has caused 
</b></p>
<p><b>resentment among communities, contributed to fuelling tensions and paved the way 
</b></p>
<p><b>towards episodes of violence.</b> 
</p>
<p>78. <b>The use of and competition for land has triggered many of the violent clashes 
</b></p>
<p><b>among communities. The growing presence of pastoralists from the North in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Middle Belt region seeking grazing pastures for their livestock and the increasing 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultivation of land by local farmers have resulted, in a number of cases, in violent 
</b></p>
<p><b>intercommunal conflicts. The dynamics of these tensions and conflicts have grown in 
</b></p>
<p><b>complexity when ethnic and religious affiliations of the groups involved have been 
</b></p>
<p><b>mobilized. </b> 
</p>
<p>79. <b>Availability and exploitation of natural resources, and the impact of climate 
</b></p>
<p><b>change in the North and Central regions, including desertification, droughts and food 
</b></p>
<p><b>and water shortages, must be recognized as key issues and adequately addressed. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government is urged to plan and implement coordinated National and State policies 
</b></p>
<p><b>to fight the adverse effects of climate change and provide sustainable solutions to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>use of land by different communities with competing lifestyles and livelihoods.</b> 
</p>
<p>80. <b>Federal and State Governments have acknowledged that socioeconomic factors, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including poverty, high levels of illiteracy, unemployment and insufficient income 
</b></p>
<p><b>levels are among the underlying causes fuelling tensions and violence among groups in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Middle Belt. Minorities are often among the most disadvantaged populations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>experience the worst socioeconomic conditions. A comprehensive national plan against 
</b></p>
<p><b>poverty and social exclusion should be urgently adopted, with clear objectives and 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific benchmarks and timelines for completion. The plan should contain measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>focused on the most vulnerable groups at the State and local levels, and include 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific attention to the issues of minority women. </b> 
</p>
<p>81. <b>Members of Christian and Muslim communities reported what they perceived 
</b></p>
<p><b>to be religiously motivated attacks against them. The Special Rapporteur is deeply 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerned by the escalation of attacks by Boko Haram, which provides a distorted 
</b></p>
<p><b>interpretation of religious principles to justify its violent actions. Leaders and 
</b></p>
<p><b>members of the Muslim communities emphasized that Boko Haram represents neither 
</b></p>
<p><b>Islam nor Islamic principles and that its attacks, including killings, kidnappings and 
</b></p>
<p><b>destruction of properties, are also targeted against Muslims, are unacceptable and 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be condemned. The Federal Government is urged to set up and implement as 
</b></p>
<p><b>soon as possible a comprehensive security and prevention strategy to combat these 
</b></p>
<p><b>unlawful actions by Boko Haram and/or other radical groups, in full compliance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights standards.</b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/64/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Lack of accountability and impunity were repeatedly stated as major flaws of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the criminal justice system. A culture of impunity has extremely pernicious effects; 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigations are not undertaken or poorly managed, prosecutions are not initiated or 
</b></p>
<p><b>pursued, victims are left defenceless, the role of security forces is negatively perceived 
</b></p>
<p><b>and, in many cases, people decide to take the law into their own hands. Perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be persecuted and held accountable for their crimes. Police and security forces 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be trained in human rights and minority issues and provided with sufficient and 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate means to carry out their tasks. Mechanisms for adequate compensation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>redress of victims must be implemented.</b> 
</p>
<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur stresses that sustainable solutions to communal 
</b></p>
<p><b>violence require not only a heightened and effective security response, but also a 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying causes of violence, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly good governance deficits, failure to hold perpetrators to account and low 
</b></p>
<p><b>socioeconomic status of certain vulnerable groups.</b> 
</p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur was impressed by initiatives led by a number of civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society actors directed at fostering intercommunal and interfaith dialogue and 
</b></p>
<p><b>peacebuilding among communities in the Middle Belt. Those initiatives promote 
</b></p>
<p><b>understanding and harmonious coexistence among communities, conflict prevention 
</b></p>
<p><b>and conflict solution. She urges the Government to provide financial support to such 
</b></p>
<p><b>initiatives and consider implementing similar projects where necessary.</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Niger Delta communities 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Oil industry operations began in the Niger Delta at the end of the 1950s. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Numerous oil spills during the past 50 years have resulted in extremely grave 
</b></p>
<p><b>environmental damage across the region, causing water and soil pollution and 
</b></p>
<p><b>destroying the livelihoods of many communities. One of the areas particularly affected 
</b></p>
<p><b>is Ogoniland in Rivers State, the home of the Ogoni people.</b> 
</p>
<p>86. <b>The Special Rapporteur witnessed the devastating effects of the oil spills in 
</b></p>
<p><b>affected Ogoni and Ikwerre communities, including the destruction of traditional 
</b></p>
<p><b>farming and fishing livelihoods owing to widespread soil and water pollution, severe 
</b></p>
<p><b>health problems among community members and population migration to other 
</b></p>
<p><b>areas. The lack of basic services and adequate facilities in the affected communities 
</b></p>
<p><b>have further contributed to their situation of marginalization and abandonment. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities are urged to take effective measures to assist the communities in need, 
</b></p>
<p><b>providing health care and education facilities and foster means for the creation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>alternative livelihood options.</b> 
</p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, to date, many areas polluted by oil 
</b></p>
<p><b>spills in Ogoniland have yet to be cleaned. The Government, in coordination with oil 
</b></p>
<p><b>companies implicated in the environmental damage, should implement the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations made by the 2011 United Nations Environment Programme report 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Environmental Assessment of Ogoniland</i>,
11
</b></p>
<p><b> including the proper maintenance of oilfield 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>training, employment and livelihood incentives to encourage people not to participate 
</b></p>
<p><b>in illegal oil-related activities; the implementation of clean-up actions in all affected 
</b></p>
<p><b>areas without further delay; the distribution of potable water to communities where

</b></p>
<p><b>monitoring of all such measures during and following clean-up operations, including 
</b></p>

<p><b>  Governance  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Good governance is essential for a fully democratic and inclusive Nigerian 
</b></p>
<p><b>society, minority rights, social stability and the promotion of the rule of law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nevertheless, a good governance deficit exists in Nigeria with implications for 
</b></p>
<p><b>minority issues and rights and community relations. Good governance comprises 
</b></p>
<p><b>different intertwined features, including inclusive participation, consultation, the fight 
</b></p>
<p><b>against corruption, transparency of political decisions and accountability by political 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders. In the context of minority rights, good governance is an essential 
</b></p>
<p><b>element to guarantee that minority groups who do not hold dominant positions 
</b></p>
<p><b>participate in and are fairly considered when taking political decisions. Good 
</b></p>
<p><b>governance plays a fundamental role in preventing tensions and conflicts, as it 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantees participation and the civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights of 
</b></p>
<p><b>all groups.</b> 
</p>
<p>89. <b>Persistent allegations of widespread political corruption are serious concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b>that affect minority rights and require an unequivocal response from the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>at all levels to effectively address those practices. Anti-corruption agencies should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthened and the establishment of a comprehensive national plan against 
</b></p>
<p><b>corruption as well as new legislation should be considered. Budgetary transparency 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be fully implemented as a means to effectively monitor political decision-making 
</b></p>
<p><b>processes and to provide accountability mechanisms. </b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Political participation 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>It is of great importance to ensure representation of ethnic, religious and 
</b></p>
<p><b>linguistic diversity at the different government levels. In order to guarantee equal 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation at the federal level, the Federal Character Commission promotes the 
</b></p>
<p><b>application of the federal character principle. Nevertheless, the Commission does not 
</b></p>
<p><b>consider ethnic or religious elements, which leads many civil society groups to 
</b></p>
<p><b>consider the principle of equal participation of the diverse groups ineffective in 
</b></p>
<p><b>practice. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to expand the scope of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>federal character principle and the work of the Commission to include ethnic and 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious identity. </b> 
</p>
<p>91. <b>Minorities, particularly minority women, are poorly represented in political life 
</b></p>
<p><b>at all levels, especially at state and local governments. The Special Rapporteur notes 
</b></p>
<p><b>the lack of information pertaining the situation and challenges faced by minority 
</b></p>
<p><b>women, particularly in decision-making processes. Concrete and targeted measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>are required to promote the active and effective political participation of women at all 
</b></p>
<p><b>levels. Affirmative action measures to promote minorities and minority women in 
</b></p>
<p><b>political life, including the use of quotas in political parties, should be considered.</b> 
</p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for the establishment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the National Dialogue Conference 2014 as a nationwide forum where the diverse 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders gathered and discussed the current political, social, economic and 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural issues, including long-standing minority issues. She encourages the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government to continue providing similar platforms for an inclusive participation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups in decision-making processes as meaningful ways to foster dialogue and find

<p><b>  Census and statistics 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Nigeria does not collect or analyse data disaggregated by ethnicity, religion or 
</b></p>
<p><b>language. The Special Rapporteur encourages collection and analysis of disaggregated 
</b></p>
<p><b>data, which are essential for Nigeria to fully map its population and provide a 
</b></p>
<p><b>complete picture of its diversity and the socioeconomic conditions of its various 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups. The advantages, in terms of strategic planning and implementation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective policies to ensure the rights of disadvantaged minorities and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>marginalized groups, outweigh the concerns. Provisions should be put into place to 
</b></p>
<p><b>safeguard against discrimination, stigmatization and any misuse of sensitive 
</b></p>
<p><b>information, in accordance with international standards of personal data protection 
</b></p>
<p><b>and privacy.</b> 
</p>
<p>94. <b>At the federal, state and local levels, disaggregated data gathering, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>the national census and social surveys, should be conducted and statistical analysis 
</b></p>
<p><b>undertaken to provide an accurate picture of the population and key characteristics 
</b></p>
<p><b>and socioeconomic status of different groups. Census questions should allow open and 
</b></p>
<p><b>multiple responses to enable respondents to self-identify according to their national, 
</b></p>
<p><b>ethnic, religious and linguistic affiliation, including multiple identities. </b> 
</p>
<p>95. <b>The scarce disaggregated data available reveal worrying issues in relation to 
</b></p>
<p><b>socioeconomic rights, including high poverty and unemployment rates and regional 
</b></p>
<p><b>disparities in access to education. The fulfilment of economic and social rights is not 
</b></p>
<p><b>only a human rights obligation but also a fundamental step to foster social peace and 
</b></p>
<p><b>stability. Measures to improve the socioeconomic conditions of the population, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly of those most disadvantaged groups, must be carefully planned and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implemented on the basis of comprehensive data. </b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Civil society organizations 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Special Rapporteur was impressed by the high quality of civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations. She acknowledges that their work makes a fundamental contribution to 
</b></p>
<p><b>raising awareness and tackling minority rights concerns, and encourages them to 
</b></p>
<p><b>continue their valuable work. She also urges the Government to enhance cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b>with civil society organizations and support them in all necessary and possible ways so 
</b></p>
<p><b>that they can continue their valuable work, often in essential areas where Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>action is lacking. </b> 
</p>
<p><b>  National Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the work of the National Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission as a key institution for the promotion and protection of the human rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>She welcomes the enhanced status given to the Commission in 2010, widening its 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandate and powers. Sufficient resources should be allocated to enable the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Commission and its regional offices to carry on their work and to ensure adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>and dedicated attention to the issues of minorities in each region. Its independence 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be always preserved to duly fulfil its fundamental mandate. Recruitment of staff 
</b></p>
<p><b>from diverse ethnic and religious communities should be ensured. </b> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/28/64/Add.2

</p>
<p><b>  Linguistic rights 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The linguistic diversity in Nigeria includes hundreds of languages. However, 
</b></p>
<p><b>many of them are seriously endangered and some have become extinct. The Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur recognizes the considerable efforts of the Government to safeguard 
</b></p>
<p><b>endangered languages and encourages it to continue and intensify its efforts to 
</b></p>
<p>preserve Nigeria&#8217;s rich language heritage.  
</p>
<p>99. <b>The multiplicity of minority languages poses challenges to the feasibility of 
</b></p>
<p><b>mother-tongue instruction. The Special Rapporteur recalls the 1992 Declaration on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic 
</b></p>
<p><b>Minorities, under which States are required to take appropriate measures to provide 
</b></p>
<p><b>mother-tongue language education or instruction wherever possible. The Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>should make available adequate funding and take practical steps, including provision 
</b></p>
<p><b>of teaching materials to assist teaching of and instruction in minority languages in 
</b></p>
<p><b>public schools. Where numerous languages exist in a locality, the Government should 
</b></p>
<p><b>consider formal and informal methodologies and programmes based on local language 
</b></p>
<p><b>traditions, needs and requirements.</b> 
</p>
<p>100. <b>Among the difficulties faced by speakers of minority languages is the scarce 
</b></p>
<p><b>presence of minority languages in public and private media. Media can play a 
</b></p>
<p><b>significant role in the promotion and preservation of minority endangered languages 
</b></p>
<p><b>and consequently the preservation of minority cultures and identities. The allocation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of specific spaces for local languages on television channels and radio programmes, as 
</b></p>
<p><b>well as in the written press, should be encouraged and supported. </b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Education 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>The Government must take appropriate actions to ensure that all children, 
</b></p>
<p><b>regardless their social status, have access to compulsory education. Special measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be adopted to combat school dropouts, including those owing to poverty and 
</b></p>
<p><b>socioeconomic factors, and ensure school attendance of children belonging to 
</b></p>
<p><b>minorities, particularly minority girls, including assessments of the situation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>minority children, increased provision of minority-language education, increase 
</b></p>
<p><b>funding for education and collaboration with state and local governments and civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>society organizations. </b> 
</p>
<p>102. <b>A specific subject on citizenship education should be introduced in the school 
</b></p>
<p><b>curriculum to provide students with the fundamentals of human rights, political 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions and the rule of law. Knowledge of the diversity of Nigeria, including the 
</b></p>
<p><b>history of its diverse ethnic, religious and linguistic groups and communities and their 
</b></p>
<p><b>important contribution to e</b>nriching Nigeria&#8217;s culture, society and unity<b>, should also 
</b></p>
<p><b>be an integral part of the national education programmes.</b> 
</p>
<p>   <b> </b></p>
