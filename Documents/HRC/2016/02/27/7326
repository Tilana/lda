<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twenty-first session 
</p>
<p>from 19 to 30 January 2015. The review of Guyana was held at the 15th meeting on 28 
</p>
<p>January 2015. The delegation of Guyana was headed by Carolyn Rodrigues-Birkett. At its 
</p>
<p>18th meeting, held on 30 January 2015, the Working Group adopted the report on Guyana. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Guyana: Ethiopia, Portugal and the 
</p>
<p>Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
</p>
<p>Guyana: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/21/GUY/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/GUY/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/GUY/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, 
</p>
<p>Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
</p>
<p>Ireland was transmitted to Guyana through the troika. These questions are available on the 
</p>
<p>extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Carolyn Rodrigues-Birkett, Minister of Foreign Affairs, presented the national report 
</p>
<p>for the second UPR of Guyana as well as the status of the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations made at the fifteenth session of the Human Rights Council in 2010. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation recalled that, as highlighted in the national report, Guyana had 
</p>
<p>submitted State party reports to various treaty bodies. Guyana had also submitted to the 
</p>
<p>International Labour Organization (ILO) 80 per cent of its reports that had been 
</p>
<p>outstanding.  
</p>
<p>7. Additionally, during the reporting period, Guyana had ratified or acceded to several 
</p>
<p>conventions, and was actively considering ratifying the 1951 Convention relating to the 
</p>
<p>Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation expressed its concern that the national report had not been posted in 
</p>
<p>a timely manner for the benefit of the various delegations; many of the questions submitted 
</p>
<p>in advance related to issues that had been addressed in the report. 
</p>
<p>9. Guyana had voluntarily committed to hold consultations on 28 of the 55 
</p>
<p>recommendations. Those included recommendations on the abolition of the death penalty, 
</p>
<p>on the abolition of corporal punishment, on the decriminalization of consensual same-sex </p>


<p>adult sexual relations and on discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
</p>
<p>(LGBT) persons, and on the age of criminality. 
</p>
<p>10.  As part of the consultative process, following the elections in 2011, a decision had 
</p>
<p>been taken to bring those recommendations before the National Assembly. The 
</p>
<p>Government had therefore tabled a motion and asked that those matters be sent to a 
</p>
<p>Parliamentary Special Select Committee. The motion had been approved by the National 
</p>
<p>Assembly; a Parliamentary Special Select Committee had been appointed and had 
</p>
<p>commenced meeting in 2012.  
</p>
<p>11. The Select Committee had not concluded its work at the time of reporting but had 
</p>
<p>commenced by focusing on the abolition of corporal punishment. Public hearings had been 
</p>
<p>held and submissions had been received from government agencies, civil society and 
</p>
<p>experts. It had become evident during the hearings that the abolition of corporal punishment 
</p>
<p>in schools remained an issue on which sections of society were staunchly and equally 
</p>
<p>divided. Nonetheless, the delegation highlighted the enactment of the Training School 
</p>
<p>(Amendment) Act 2010 and the Juvenile Offenders (Amendment) Act 2010, which 
</p>
<p>abolished corporal punishment in juvenile correctional institutions. Also, the new Child 
</p>
<p>Care and Development Services Act (2011) prohibited corporal punishment in institutional 
</p>
<p>residences. 
</p>
<p>12. Although the Parliamentary Special Select Committee had not completed its 
</p>
<p>mandate with regard to the recommendations on the abolition of the death penalty, the 
</p>
<p>Criminal Law Offences (Amendment) Act No. 21 of 2010 had removed the mandatory 
</p>
<p>death penalty for persons convicted of murder and made provisions for life imprisonment 
</p>
<p>and imprisonment with the possibility of parole. The death penalty was retained only in 
</p>
<p>limited cases, such as the murder of a police officer on duty or a judicial officer, or treason. 
</p>
<p>As a result, during the past five years more than 15 prisoners on death row had had their 
</p>
<p>sentences commuted to life imprisonment; some of those prisoners would be coming up for 
</p>
<p>parole. At the time of reporting there were 13 prisoners on death row. During the period 
</p>
<p>under review no prisoner on death row had been executed. 
</p>
<p>13. The Parliamentary Special Select Committee also had a mandate to receive and hear 
</p>
<p>submissions on the attitude of Guyanese regarding changes in legislative provisions and the 
</p>
<p>Criminal Code regarding consensual adult same-sex relationships and discrimination, 
</p>
<p>perceived or real, against LGBT persons. Due to the prorogation of the tenth Parliament, 
</p>
<p>the Committee&#8217;s work had ceased. The Government hoped to resubmit those matters to the 
</p>
<p>National Assembly following general elections in May. 
</p>
<p>14. During the reporting period, there had been unfettered freedom of expression by 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations (NGOs), religious organizations and the media on LGBT 
</p>
<p>issues. In response to an NGO submission on LGBT rights in Guyana, the Government 
</p>
<p>wished to reiterate that the State did not discriminate against persons based on their sexual 
</p>
<p>orientation and that every Guyanese was entitled to the fundamental rights and freedoms as 
</p>
<p>provided for in the Constitution, laws and policies of Guyana. 
</p>
<p>15. Consultations had been held across the country by the Ministry of Education on the 
</p>
<p>abolition of corporal punishment. 
</p>
<p>16. The delegation highlighted the Low Carbon Development Strategy and the Guyana-
</p>
<p>Norway partnership. Under the partnership, Guyana was targeted to earn up to 
</p>
<p>US$ 250 million for its forest climate services. The funds earned were being used for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of projects and initiatives identified in the Low Carbon Development 
</p>
<p>Strategy; a significant portion had gone to interventions that focused on the indigenous 
</p>
<p>population. </p>


<p>17. Much had been accomplished with regard to the recommendations on poverty 
</p>
<p>reduction and equal access to education, water, health, housing and food security for the 
</p>
<p>poor and vulnerable, including indigenous peoples. The delegation highlighted, among 
</p>
<p>other things: the poverty reduction programme and pro-poor pro-growth development 
</p>
<p>approach; continuous investments in the social sector, which now received 34.5 per cent of 
</p>
<p>the annual budget; and the enactment of a national minimum wage in 2013. 
</p>
<p>18. Progress within the education sector had been significant. The Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals Guyana Progress Report 2011 had indicated that Guyana had made 
</p>
<p>excellent progress towards achieving universal primary education and had met its target of 
</p>
<p>eliminating gender disparity in primary and secondary education.  
</p>
<p>19. The education sector had played a critical role in equalizing access to opportunities 
</p>
<p>for children regardless of where they lived or their ethnicity, religion or class. That was 
</p>
<p>most evident in the interior and Amerindian communities, where all children had access to 
</p>
<p>nursery and primary education and over 90 per cent had access to secondary education. The 
</p>
<p>delegation provided detailed information on programmes and initiatives implemented in the 
</p>
<p>area of education. 
</p>
<p>20. Health care services offered by the Government remained free of charge. In 2014, 96 
</p>
<p>per cent of all births were attended by skilled health personnel, in comparison to 85.6 per 
</p>
<p>cent in previous years. Guyana continued to offer free treatment for the prevention of 
</p>
<p>mother to child transmission and free antiretroviral treatment at its facilities; however, those 
</p>
<p>programmes were under pressure due to the reduction of international funding to assist 
</p>
<p>small developing countries. Immunization coverage in Guyana remained high in all rural 
</p>
<p>and hinterland areas, despite challenges regarding the high cost of gaining access to remote 
</p>
<p>areas. 
</p>
<p>21. The national housing programme continued to provide subsidized house lots for 
</p>
<p>poor families and low- and middle-income families. Through a number of legislative 
</p>
<p>measures and Government/commercial bank partnerships, low-income households could 
</p>
<p>gain access to loans to build their houses. Additionally, by the end of 2013, 18,000 
</p>
<p>households in squatter settlements that had emerged over three decades had been 
</p>
<p>regularized, with Certificates of Title to Land being provided. 
</p>
<p>22. The supply of potable water currently reached in excess of 95 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>population in the coastal areas and 73 per cent in the hinterland areas. 
</p>
<p>23. Guyana had been honoured by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations for attaining the targets set as part of Millennium Development Goal 1 and the goal 
</p>
<p>set by the 1996 World Food Summit of halving the absolute number of hungry people by 
</p>
<p>2015 and improving nutrition. The prevalence of undernourishment had been reduced from 
</p>
<p>19.1 per cent (1990&#8211;1992) to 5.1 per cent (2010 and 2012).  
</p>
<p>24. In recognition of the historic injustices perpetrated against the Amerindian peoples, 
</p>
<p>the revised Guyana Constitution and the Amerindian Act 2006 provided for and guaranteed 
</p>
<p>Amerindian land rights, governance and culture for the Amerindian population. 
</p>
<p>Amerindians were currently the second-largest land owners in Guyana, with the State being 
</p>
<p>the first. They owned communal land titles totalling 14 per cent of the country&#8217;s land mass. 
</p>
<p>A total of 103 Amerindian villages had been awarded absolute grants and 83 had been 
</p>
<p>demarcated thus far. The delegation indicated that the Government had continued to 
</p>
<p>channel resources toward the development of Amerindian communities, and reported on 
</p>
<p>numerous initiatives. Guyana would continue to give consideration to ratifying the ILO 
</p>
<p>Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169).  
</p>
<p>25. The delegation reported on efforts to address discrimination based on culture and 
</p>
<p>traditions and to promote and protect the rights of all citizens. It highlighted the enactment </p>


<p>of the Judicial Review Act 2010, the appointment of an Ombudsman in January 2014, the 
</p>
<p>recent parliamentary approval of the Ethnic Relations Commission, the functioning of 
</p>
<p>numerous institutions and the implementation of a number of initiatives.  
</p>
<p>26. Guyana had made major progress towards promoting gender equality and the 
</p>
<p>empowerment of women. In its Global Gender Gap Report 2013, the World Economic 
</p>
<p>Forum had ranked Guyana 33rd out of 136 in the area of overall political empowerment. 
</p>
<p>The country ranked 41st in the Report for wage equality for similar work. 
</p>
<p>27. Better-coordinated efforts were being made with regard to persons with disabilities 
</p>
<p>since the enactment of the Persons with Disabilities Act. Those efforts would continue to 
</p>
<p>improve as Guyana strove to implement its treaty obligations under the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).  
</p>
<p>28. Guyana was part of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Reparations 
</p>
<p>Commission, which called for reparations relating to Africans who had been enslaved and 
</p>
<p>brought to work in the British, French, Dutch and Spanish colonies. Guyana had established 
</p>
<p>a broad-based committee which was preparing the country&#8217;s submission to CARICOM on 
</p>
<p>its reparations claims for the former colonial powers.  
</p>
<p>29. The delegation indicated that although there had been some reduction, interpersonal 
</p>
<p>violence, including sexual and domestic violence, continued to cause grave concern. The 
</p>
<p>delegation highlighted some achievements and challenges in that area. In July 2014, the 
</p>
<p>National Task Force on Sexual Violence had held a special session to review the draft 
</p>
<p>protocols for the police, prosecutors, magistrates, social workers and medical practitioners 
</p>
<p>under the Sexual Offences Act 2010 and to examine the new draft action plan. With the 
</p>
<p>assistance of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the plan of action had been 
</p>
<p>completed and was submitted in January 2015 for Cabinet review. The draft protocols and 
</p>
<p>new regulations to strengthen the 1996 Domestic Violence Act had also been completed. 
</p>
<p>30. Over the past four years, the media, civil society and community and faith-based 
</p>
<p>organizations had played a more proactive role with regard to combating violence against 
</p>
<p>women and children.  
</p>
<p>31. The total number of reports of domestic violence had decreased by more than 50 per 
</p>
<p>cent, and the number of persons charged increased from 25 per cent to 52 percent. While 
</p>
<p>the number of persons charged and sentenced by Magistrates for domestic violence 
</p>
<p>offences had increased significantly, the number of successful prosecutions and convictions 
</p>
<p>of sexual offences had been disappointing.  
</p>
<p>32. The delegation recalled information provided in its national report on legislative 
</p>
<p>reforms to enhance the protection of children&#8217;s rights. The Child Care and Protection 
</p>
<p>Agency had continued to investigate child abuse cases reported throughout the country. The 
</p>
<p>delegation expressed its regret that the draft Juvenile Justice Bill was still not complete and 
</p>
<p>that, as a result, Guyana had been unable to implement the recommendation with regard to 
</p>
<p>the age of criminality.  
</p>
<p>33. The delegation also highlighted efforts to combat trafficking in persons, including 
</p>
<p>the work of the broad-based Ministerial Task Force on Trafficking in Persons.  
</p>
<p>34. Guyana had taken major steps and made significant financial investments in the 
</p>
<p>justice sector. A number of initiatives had been introduced to improve oversight, 
</p>
<p>monitoring and accountability and to enhance coordination within the sector. Such 
</p>
<p>initiatives included establishing civil and criminal justice committees; increasing the 
</p>
<p>number of judges; and removing the annual budget of the judiciary from under the Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Legal Affairs and establishing it as a direct charge on the Consolidated Fund to enhance 
</p>
<p>its independence. </p>


<p>35. The delegation reiterated that the Constitution strictly prohibited torture and 
</p>
<p>mistreatment of detainees and inmates, and that the Government had publicly condemned 
</p>
<p>abuse and torture and had repeatedly demanded that any such allegations be expeditiously 
</p>
<p>investigated and action taken. In 2014, several police ranks had been brought before the 
</p>
<p>courts, including for abuse and torture in lock-ups. Additionally, in an effort to strengthen 
</p>
<p>its investigative capacity, the Police Complaints Authority would be establishing its own 
</p>
<p>investigative unit in order to conduct investigations independent of the Guyana Police 
</p>
<p>Force. 
</p>
<p>36. As a result of major disturbances in July 2012, which resulted in three protestors 
</p>
<p>being shot, a commission of inquiry had been set up. Although the commission had been 
</p>
<p>unable to find that it was the police who had shot the protestors, it recommended that 
</p>
<p>compensation be provided for those who had suffered losses in the violence and that the 
</p>
<p>police protocols with regard to public order and safety be reviewed and amended. The 
</p>
<p>Government and the Guyana Police Force had implemented those recommendations.  
</p>
<p>37. The delegation reported on efforts to improve conditions in police lock-ups and 
</p>
<p>prisons, highlighting the 2014 strategic plan on the renewal and reconstruction of the 
</p>
<p>Guyana Prison Service and the appointment of a visiting committee for each prison 
</p>
<p>(provided for under the Prison Act) to monitor prison conditions.  
</p>
<p>38. The delegation expressed conviction that the constitutional rights commissions in 
</p>
<p>Guyana formed a critical component of the protection of human rights. In accordance with 
</p>
<p>legislation, the commissions were to be funded by a direct charge upon the Consolidated 
</p>
<p>Fund, in compliance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights (Paris Principles). However, until such time as 
</p>
<p>the umbrella Human Rights Commission was appointed, in compliance with the 
</p>
<p>Constitution, Guyana, regrettably, would not be fully compliant with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p>39. With regard to the special procedures, the delegation reiterated the readiness of 
</p>
<p>Guyana to continue to respond to invitations and to offer full collaboration with mandate 
</p>
<p>holders. 
</p>
<p>40. Positive achievements had been tempered and sometimes overshadowed by the 
</p>
<p>political situation that had emerged since the November 2011 elections. The ruling party 
</p>
<p>had one seat fewer than the two opposition parties combined, and the tenth Parliament had 
</p>
<p>witnessed the reduction of the annual budgets by the opposition majority, which had a 
</p>
<p>major impact on the implementation of the national development agenda. Following a no-
</p>
<p>confidence motion in 2014, the President announced elections, which would be held on 11 
</p>
<p>May 2015. 
</p>
<p>41. Guyana had made significant efforts to meet most of the commitments it had made 
</p>
<p>in 2010, despite the many challenges associated with small developing States. Such 
</p>
<p>challenges included climate change and the imposition of the &#8220;graduation&#8221; policy, using the 
</p>
<p>narrow measure of gross domestic product per capita, which would see countries like 
</p>
<p>Guyana losing concessionary financing. Notwithstanding those challenges, Guyana would 
</p>
<p>continue to make efforts to support the role of the United Nations human rights system, 
</p>
<p>including the UPR, within available means and prevailing conditions, even as it strove to 
</p>
<p>continuously improve the lives of its citizens. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>42. During the interactive dialogue, 54 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
</p>
<p>made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. </p>


<p>43. Ireland welcomed the positive efforts undertaken by Guyana since its first UPR. It 
</p>
<p>encouraged Guyana to extend a standing invitation to special procedures and establish a 
</p>
<p>national human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles. It urged a 
</p>
<p>moratorium on the death penalty with a view to its abolition. Ireland raised concerns about 
</p>
<p>the criminalization of adult same-sex relations and the rate of under-five child mortality.  
</p>
<p>44. Italy commended the progress achieved in the protection of human rights, in 
</p>
<p>particular the measures taken in promoting women&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>45. Jamaica noted with appreciation the follow-up to the accepted recommendations 
</p>
<p>from the first UPR cycle through legislation and various initiatives in a wide range of areas 
</p>
<p>related to human rights. It lauded the tremendous strides made in ensuring access to 
</p>
<p>education and food security for all Guyanese. It commended the continued efforts to 
</p>
<p>safeguard access to land for indigenous people. 
</p>
<p>46. Kuwait praised the efforts made in improving the human rights situation in the fields 
</p>
<p>of poverty, education, health care, reform of the justice system and gender equality. It 
</p>
<p>encouraged further efforts for child protection and to combat human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>47. Maldives commended the ratification of two Optional Protocols to the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the adoption of the Child Care and Development 
</p>
<p>Services Act of 2011. It welcomed the adoption of the Persons with Disabilities Act of 
</p>
<p>2010, the ratification of CRPD and the implementation of the National Commission on 
</p>
<p>Disability&#8217;s strategic plan for 2008&#8211;2011. 
</p>
<p>48. Mauritius congratulated Guyana for achieving gender parity in primary and 
</p>
<p>secondary education and encouraged it to pursue its strategic plan on education for 2014&#8211;
</p>
<p>2018 and the Hinterland Education Improvement Project. It encouraged the strengthening 
</p>
<p>of the anti-discrimination legislation to further promote the inclusion of women in the 
</p>
<p>socioeconomic development of the country in line with Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) recommendations.  
</p>
<p>49. Mexico highlighted advances such as the appointment of the head of the 
</p>
<p>Ombudsman&#8217;s office and the adherence to several international instruments. It urged 
</p>
<p>Guyana to adopt necessary measures to ensure transparency during the 2015 elections and 
</p>
<p>suggested that Guyana ask the United Nations for assistance in complying with human 
</p>
<p>rights commitments. 
</p>
<p>50. Montenegro welcomed the ratification of several human rights treaty bodies since 
</p>
<p>the last UPR. Montenegro asked Guyana to elaborate on the steps taken to address the 
</p>
<p>continuing prevalence of trafficking in women and girls and to protect the victims of 
</p>
<p>trafficking. It also inquired about the implementation of comprehensive programmes to 
</p>
<p>address health issues affecting infants, girls and women. 
</p>
<p>51. Morocco welcomed the ratification of several international instruments since the last 
</p>
<p>UPR cycle, namely, those related to trafficking, labour and sexual exploitation. It 
</p>
<p>commended Guyana on the nomination of an Ombudsperson in 2014 and the establishment 
</p>
<p>of institutions to protect children&#8217;s rights, including the rights of indigenous and 
</p>
<p>Amerindian children. It noted the adoption of the national strategy on health and the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the national commission for disabled persons. 
</p>
<p>52. Namibia took note of the legislative reform regarding the death penalty and its 
</p>
<p>substitution with imprisonment. It commended the appointment of an Ombudsperson in 
</p>
<p>January 2014 and the support provided to the Women and Gender Equality Commission.  
</p>
<p>53. The Netherlands noted with appreciation the enactment of legislation to strengthen 
</p>
<p>the protection of children from sexual abuse and exploitation. It raised concerns regarding </p>


<p>the pending debates on the follow-up to the UPR recommendations, given the prorogation 
</p>
<p>of the Parliament. 
</p>
<p>54. Nicaragua highlighted the commitment of the Government of Guyana to combat 
</p>
<p>discrimination against minority groups, indigenous peoples, women and children, and 
</p>
<p>welcomed the increased participation of women in public administration and the reforms to 
</p>
<p>the laws on domestic violence.

</p>
<p>mandate holders, particularly to the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman

</p>
<p>context of its previous examination.  
</p>
<p>57. Paraguay welcomed the approval of the law on sexual offences, while expressing 
</p>
<p>concern about the levels of physical and sexual violence against women and girls. It

</p>
<p>continue all efforts towards promotion, protection and fulfilment of all human rights. </p>


<p>65. Spain highlighted positively the adoption of a national policy on domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>It expressed concerns about Guyana&#8217;s votes against General Assembly resolutions on a 
</p>
<p>moratorium on the death penalty, about the number of allegations presented against the 
</p>
<p>police of Guyana regarding excessive use of force and about the lack of effective and 
</p>
<p>independent investigation into such allegations. 
</p>
<p>66. Sweden noted that rape was quite common and that the inclination to report rapes 
</p>
<p>was rather low. It further noted that violence against women was a significant problem, and 
</p>
<p>that indigenous peoples had a lower standard of living than the majority society. 
</p>
<p>67. Switzerland encouraged Guyana to pursue its efforts to ratify international 
</p>
<p>instruments. It welcomed the commitment made by Guyana to organize national and public 
</p>
<p>consultations on the recommendations from its first UPR. 
</p>
<p>68. Thailand noted that discrimination based on sexual orientation, as well as violence 
</p>
<p>against women, remained a challenge. It encouraged Guyana to further implement 
</p>
<p>education and awareness-raising programmes to help promote the inclusion and 
</p>
<p>participation of children with disabilities in society. 
</p>
<p>69. Timor-Leste noted with appreciation the enactment of the Sexual Offences Act, the 
</p>
<p>adoption of the Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act and the establishment of the 
</p>
<p>Indigenous Peoples Commission. 
</p>
<p>70. Trinidad and Tobago highlighted, inter alia, the development of an action plan to 
</p>
<p>combat human trafficking, an increase in awareness campaigns regarding sexual abuse, and 
</p>
<p>the drafting of a sexual and reproductive health policy. 
</p>
<p>71. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland encouraged Guyana to 
</p>
<p>ratify the Optional Protocol to CEDAW and to establish a formal moratorium on executions 
</p>
<p>with a view to eventually abolishing the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>72. The United States of America welcomed Guyana&#8217;s voluntary commitments to hold 
</p>
<p>national consultations on issues from its first UPR session. It remained deeply concerned by 
</p>
<p>continued and widespread reports of excessive violence by police officers. 
</p>
<p>73. Uruguay welcomed the country&#8217;s adherence to international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments, and encouraged Guyana to continue to work on the promotion of education for 
</p>
<p>children, addressing the issues of non-attendance at school and transport and nutrition costs, 
</p>
<p>in order to reduce illiteracy. 
</p>
<p>74. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela noted with appreciation the strategic plan for 
</p>
<p>the reduction of poverty (2011&#8211;2015), which targeted the most vulnerable segments of the

</p>
<p>and social security. 
</p>
<p>75. Algeria noted that, despite the challenges and difficulties in terms of resources, 
</p>

</p>
<p>persons. 
</p>
<p>76. Argentina welcomed the members of the delegation of Guyana and congratulated 
</p>
<p>them for their national report. 
</p>

<p>also noted that Guyana had not yet ratified a number of international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments, and referred to a number of challenges in the promotion of the right to 
</p>
<p>education. </p>


<p>78. Australia welcomed the ratification of CRPD and the accession to the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to CRC on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. It 
</p>
<p>remained concerned that Guyana had not yet implemented its national policy on domestic 
</p>
<p>violence, and noted with concern that Guyana had rejected recommendations to establish a 
</p>
<p>formal moratorium on the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>79. Botswana commended Guyana for the progress made towards achieving universal 
</p>

</p>
<p>enhance cooperation with OHCHR to address challenges that it continued to face. 
</p>
<p>80. Brazil welcomed the fact that the vacant position of Ombudsman had been filled, 
</p>
<p>and underscored the importance of providing the Ombudsman with appropriate funding and 
</p>
<p>staff for the fulfilment of his mandate. 
</p>
<p>81. Canada asked Guyana to provide information on the measures taken to address 
</p>
<p>challenges to freedom of expression and to prevent and investigate instances of intimidation 
</p>
<p>or violence against the media. 
</p>
<p>82. Chile acknowledged the efforts Guyana had made to comprehensively strengthen the 
</p>
<p>human rights sector, in particular with regard to respect for civil and political rights. It 
</p>
<p>noted with appreciation that the ratified international instruments had already been 
</p>
<p>transposed into domestic law. 
</p>
<p>83. China noted that Guyana supported measures to facilitate the reintegration of and

</p>
<p>84. Colombia praised the commitment demonstrated by Guyana in its efforts to

</p>
<p>country&#8217;s transparent collaboration with the human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>85. Costa Rica highlighted the ratification of CRPD and Optional Protocols to CRC. It 
</p>
<p>expressed its appreciation for the country&#8217;s efforts and achievements in the areas of gender 
</p>

</p>
<p>stressed the negative impact of the use of the death penalty and torture.  
</p>
<p>86. Cuba noted that Guyana demonstrated its commitment to protecting and promoting 
</p>
<p>human rights. It highlighted the progress made in promoting gender equality and the

</p>
<p>rights of all Afro-descendants. 
</p>
<p>87. Denmark expressed hope that concrete steps were under way to honour the 
</p>

</p>
<p>the Convention against Torture Initiative stood ready to explore avenues to assist Guyana in 
</p>
<p>advancing that issue.  
</p>
<p>88. Ecuador commended Guyana for the efforts it had made to implement the 
</p>
<p>recommendations from the first cycle, in particular the ratification of the International 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
</p>
<p>Families, the Optional Protocol to CRC on the involvement of children in armed conflict 
</p>

</p>
<p>pornography. 
</p>
<p>89. While acknowledging the progress made in the recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217;

<p>90. France asked Guyana about the results of consultations that, during its previous 
</p>
<p>UPR, it had committed to hold on the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and 
</p>
<p>intersex persons, on the state of its legislation regarding the relations between consenting 
</p>
<p>adults of the same sex and on violence committed against individuals because of their 
</p>
<p>sexual orientation and identity. 
</p>
<p>91. While expressing its appreciation for the ratification and accession by Guyana to 
</p>
<p>various international instruments, Germany remained concerned that the de facto 
</p>
<p>moratorium on the death penalty had not yet been translated into law. 
</p>
<p>92. Ghana expressed its satisfaction with the efforts deployed by Guyana to meet most 
</p>
<p>of the commitments made since the first UPR cycle, aimed at strengthening the 
</p>
<p>constitutional, legal and policy framework for the promotion and protection of human 
</p>
<p>rights. 
</p>
<p>93. Guatemala welcomed the nomination of the Ombudsman, as well as the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a national task force and the elaboration of a national action plan, both to 
</p>
<p>fight human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>94. India asked Guyana to share more details on its efforts to reduce poverty and hunger, 
</p>
<p>and expressed hope that the implementation of the national food and nutritional strategy 
</p>
<p>was being prioritized. 
</p>
<p>95. Indonesia commended Guyana for the achievements made in the area of poverty 
</p>
<p>reduction and the ratification of CRDP. It also acknowledged the adoption of the Persons 
</p>
<p>with Disabilities Act. 
</p>
<p>96. Sierra Leone highlighted the commendable efforts made by Guyana towards 
</p>
<p>progress in economic, social and cultural rights. It urged Guyana to consider including in its 
</p>
<p>Constitution provisions prohibiting discrimination of women, to tackle more vigorously the 
</p>
<p>issue of trafficking in women and girls, and to establish a moratorium on the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>97. The delegation of Guyana thanked countries that had acknowledged its efforts and 
</p>
<p>progress achieved and expressed thanks for recommendations made.  
</p>
<p>98. Regarding concerns by Ireland about under-five child mortality, the delegation 
</p>
<p>indicated that infant mortality in 1991 had been 120 per 1,000 and that in 2014 it had been 
</p>
<p>reduced to 17 per 1,000, which meant there was progress but work had to continue. 
</p>
<p>99. Regarding the abolition of the death penalty or the establishment of a moratorium, 
</p>
<p>raised by many delegations, Guyana had amended its law to commute some death sentences 
</p>
<p>to life imprisonment and had added the possibility of parole. The delegation affirmed that, 
</p>
<p>while it had not reached the point of abolishing the death penalty, discussions were 
</p>
<p>continuing. In addition, the Parliament had been prorogued and therefore the work of the 
</p>
<p>Parliamentary Special Select Committee had not been completed.  
</p>
<p>100. Three issues, namely, the abolition of the death penalty, the decriminalization of 
</p>
<p>same-sex relations between adult males and other LGBT matters, and corporal punishment 
</p>
<p>were to be considered by the Select Committee. The delegation underscored that compared 
</p>
<p>to 2010, in 2014 and 2015 there had been an increase in discussions on those issues, which 
</p>
<p>was a good sign. The society was very divided on the issues; it was sometimes a challenge 
</p>
<p>to talk to citizens about the death penalty when some countries in the region were seeking 
</p>
<p>to activate the death penalty because of the high rate of criminality. However, discussions 
</p>
<p>were continuing in Guyana.  
</p>
<p>101. Regarding the strengthening of the Police Complaints Authority, raised by Italy, it 
</p>
<p>had been decided that the Authority would establish its own investigative arm. The 
</p>
<p>delegation of Guyana recalled that in the past, the police had been responsible for 
</p>
<p>investigating; it could be concluded that if the police investigated the police, the required </p>


<p>impartiality would be lacking. Thus, the independent investigative arm would prove to be a 
</p>
<p>boost to the Police Complaints Authority. There was a need for more resources for the 
</p>
<p>Authority, which should be considered in the context of how the national economy was 
</p>
<p>doing; there had been increases in resources throughout the years.  
</p>
<p>102. As regards access to land for indigenous people, the delegation of Guyana noted that 
</p>
<p>some delegations had raised the issue of discrimination, including with respect to 
</p>
<p>Amerindian children. The delegation indicated that if there was discrimination as far as the 
</p>
<p>State was concerned, it was positive discrimination. Most Amerindian communities were 
</p>
<p>located in the vast interior, so the delivery of services was not only costly but also very 
</p>
<p>challenging. Road networks and telecommunication had been improved. In order to ensure 
</p>
<p>that children had access to education, secondary schools were being built with dormitories 
</p>
<p>to cater to a number of communities in those areas, fully funded by the State. In addition, a 
</p>
<p>State-funded scholarship programme was in place for hinterland children, and over 90 per 
</p>
<p>cent of hinterland children were Amerindians.  
</p>
<p>103. There were gaps that needed to be filled; thus, the Hinterland Education 
</p>
<p>Improvement programme had been established to ensure full access in the hinterland not 
</p>
<p>only to nursery and primary education, which was already covered, but also to secondary 
</p>
<p>education.  
</p>
<p>104. About 14 years ago there was just one Amerindian doctor; now, with the help of 
</p>
<p>Cuba, hundreds of doctors had been trained, including Amerindian doctors, many of whom 
</p>
<p>had attended secondary schools in their communities, showing a measure of progress.  
</p>
<p>105. Child protection was a work in progress. The delegation emphasized that the Child 
</p>
<p>Protection Agency was very active and that efforts would continue in that regard.  
</p>
<p>106. On discrimination against persons with disabilities, the delegation reported that 
</p>
<p>Guyana had not only passed a law on the subject but had also ratified CRPD. Necessary 
</p>
<p>measures were being taken in both public and private institutions, including banks. The 
</p>
<p>State was working with Cuba to establish in Guyana a centre for training persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, a project that would benefit not only Guyana but the entire Caribbean 
</p>
<p>community.  
</p>
<p>107. On the question of discrimination and violence against women, the delegation 
</p>
<p>expressed regret that it could not report any massive improvement. Efforts at the State level 
</p>
<p>on the matter would continue and would be intensified. The plans of action on domestic 
</p>
<p>violence and on sexual offences had been submitted and considered. The plan of action on 
</p>
<p>domestic violence was already in operation. That area required much research in addition to 
</p>
<p>the measures already put in place.  
</p>
<p>108. The delegation affirmed that, according to one school of thought, some men were 
</p>
<p>not reacting positively to the increased awareness by women of their rights and the 
</p>
<p>increased independence of women. Much work needed to be undertaken with men in that 
</p>
<p>regard. If in the past women had been subservient and had accepted whatever they were 
</p>
<p>told by their male counterparts, that had changed.  
</p>
<p>109. Guyana was working on parity in education at the tertiary level, where almost two 
</p>
<p>thirds of those attending university were women, a challenge for males both nationally and 
</p>
<p>in the entire Caribbean community. Regarding school drop-out rates, at the nursery and 
</p>
<p>primary levels more schools had to be built, because attendance was high; overall there had 
</p>
<p>been an increase in school attendance.  
</p>
<p>110. Regarding elections and the need for transparency, the per capita costs of the 
</p>
<p>elections held prior to the most recent ones had been ranked as the second highest in the 
</p>
<p>world, owing to the number of layers of transparency operating. Guyana had sought 
</p>
<p>observers from the Commonwealth, the Organization of American States, the Union of </p>


<p>South American Nations and CARICOM. Therefore, the delegation trusted that the next 
</p>
<p>elections would be transparent, once all the measures were put in place.  
</p>
<p>111. On judicial training, as it related to women&#8217;s rights, work had been carried out with 
</p>
<p>the police and prosecutors, and seven domestic violence units, in each of the police 
</p>
<p>divisions, had been established.  
</p>
<p>112. On trafficking of women and trafficking of persons in general, the delegation 
</p>
<p>asserted that a task force was already working on those issues. There was no evidence of 
</p>
<p>widespread trafficking, but work had been undertaken with several ministries.  
</p>
<p>113. Regarding reproductive health services, the delegation had noticed in one of the 
</p>
<p>reports prepared for the UPR that a complaint had been made about a case where 
</p>
<p>contraceptives were not provided to children of a certain age. The delegation said it would 
</p>
<p>look into the complaint. Additional resources had been provided regarding reproductive 
</p>
<p>health services.  
</p>
<p>114. On the matter of the eradication of poverty, the delegation mentioned the measures 
</p>
<p>outlined in its national report, and expressed its satisfaction that Guyana had been able to 
</p>
<p>reduce poverty, meet most of the Millennium Development Goals and improve nutrition. 
</p>
<p>115. The delegation underscored that Guyana would continue to give consideration to the 
</p>
<p>recommendations regarding various protocols and conventions, including the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to CEDAW and the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>116. On the intervention of the Netherlands, which referred to a political standstill, the 
</p>
<p>delegation clarified that, faced with a no-confidence motion, which if passed would have 
</p>
<p>immediately seen the country go to elections in three months, the President had decided to 
</p>
<p>prorogue the Parliament in order to preserve its life and invite the opposition to dialogue. 
</p>
<p>Prorogation could last only for six months. If elections were held and had the same results, 
</p>
<p>there would still be a need for dialogue. Given that the President wanted one last 
</p>
<p>opportunity to try to dialogue with the Opposition, the Parliament had been prorogued. The 
</p>
<p>offer of dialogue had not been accepted by the Opposition and the President had since 
</p>
<p>announced that elections would be held on 11 May.  
</p>
<p>117. Addressing the claim of the Netherlands that owing to that situation the debate on 
</p>
<p>the follow-up of the UPR recommendations could not continue, the delegation affirmed that 
</p>
<p>the Parliamentary Special Select Committee examining LGBT matters and the abolition of 
</p>
<p>the death penalty and corporal punishment was still functioning and had not concluded its 
</p>
<p>work at the time of prorogation. Consequently, those matters were not ready to be debated 
</p>
<p>in the National Assembly. The Government hoped that those issues would be taken back to 
</p>
<p>the National Assembly when it was reconvened.  
</p>
<p>118. The delegation affirmed it was not happy that the Juvenile Justice Bill had not been 
</p>
<p>presented to Parliament; that would be taken back to Parliament when it was reconvened.  
</p>
<p>119. Guyana was always open to having officials from the United Nations system visit 
</p>
<p>the country and to working with them.  
</p>
<p>120. Regarding issues of excessive use of force, mistreatment and extrajudicial killings, 
</p>
<p>the delegation said that it was not aware of any extrajudicial killings during the reporting 
</p>
<p>period, although there had been one in 2011. The national report included what Guyana had 
</p>
<p>been doing in terms of addressing reported excesses by the Guyana Police Force; efforts 
</p>
<p>would continue.  
</p>
<p>121. On comments by Norway on the credibility of the judiciary, the delegation asserted 
</p>
<p>that it could not state that the judiciary in Guyana was not credible. All branches of 
</p>
<p>Government had to be strengthened, including the judiciary.  </p>


<p>122. On consultation with indigenous peoples, the delegation stated that there were 
</p>
<p>several indigenous NGOs. However, the Government dealt more with the elected 
</p>
<p>representatives of the indigenous communities. All of the indigenous leaders met every year 
</p>
<p>at the National Toshaos Council, and every one of them had an opportunity to interact 
</p>
<p>directly with the President and the ministers. That was where a lot of the consultations with 
</p>
<p>indigenous leaders took place, and where indigenous peoples put forward their plans and 
</p>
<p>programmes, such as the community development plans that were presented for inclusion in 
</p>
<p>the national budget. The delegation considered that the consultation and involvement of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples in all matters of life, including politics, had never been as robust as it 
</p>
<p>was now. 
</p>
<p>123. On the issue raised by Romania regarding the Women and Gender Equality 
</p>
<p>Commission, the delegation affirmed that Guyana would continue to allocate the necessary 
</p>
<p>resources to the Commission, and that it was also looking for the support of international 
</p>
<p>partners. 
</p>
<p>124. Regarding a comprehensive national strategy to prevent various forms of violence 
</p>
<p>against children, the delegation reported that information had been provided in the national 
</p>
<p>report, but it understood that States had not seen the report earlier.  
</p>
<p>125. Regarding the legal services in the hinterland, Guyana had expanded those services 
</p>
<p>and had committed to continue to work on that issue. On the issue of housing, raised by 
</p>
<p>Singapore, the delegation said that housing was one of the flagship projects of Guyana. It 
</p>
<p>had increased tremendously, and the Government had learned much from what had been 
</p>
<p>done in Singapore.  
</p>
<p>126. On the issue of forced marriage raised by Slovenia, the delegation affirmed that in 
</p>
<p>Guyana no one could get married before the age of 16 unless his or her parents consented; 
</p>
<p>there had been no such requests that the delegation knew of. 
</p>
<p>127. With regard to ensuring that persons of African descent were able to participate in 
</p>
<p>and integrate into society, the delegation said that it was very difficult to have more than 30 
</p>
<p>per cent of the population not involved in the society; however, all of the different groups in 
</p>
<p>the society were represented in Government, Parliament and public bodies, which made 
</p>
<p>Guyanese proud. 
</p>
<p>128. Regarding the media, action taken by Guyana had been described in the report. It 
</p>
<p>supported self-regulation in the media because rights came with responsibilities.  
</p>
<p>129. The delegation concluded by thanking the delegations, and underscored that many 
</p>
<p>issues raised had been addressed in the report. 
</p>
