<body><p>GE.<footnote name="1">0. It is accepted that the geography of The Bahamas makes the country a major route 
for illegal migration, and places it in a position to be used as a transit and destination point 
for the trafficking of men, women, and children subjected to forced labour and sex 
trafficking. However, over the past two years, The Bahamas has made significant efforts to 
bring itself in compliance with acceptable standards as exhibited by the United States 2013 
Annual Trafficking in Persons Report in which The Bahamas was elevated from a Tier 2 
Watch List to Tier 2.    </footnote>4-04677  (E)

<p><b>  Report on Trafficking in Persons of the UN Special 
Rapporteur, Ms. Joy Ngozi Ezeilo 
</b>1. The Government of The Bahamas is pleased to provide comments to the report 
prepared on the visit to The Bahamas, from December 9-11, 2013, of Ms. Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, 
Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, United 
Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  The purpose of the visit was 
to examine the situation of human trafficking and to engage with representatives of the 
Government and civil society organizations, to discuss achievements and challenges in 
combating and preventing trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p>2. The comments to the Report relate to inaccuracies in fact or law that should be 
carefully considered prior to its submission for editing in accordance with the United 
Nations documentation requirements.

<p>11. With respect to the women from the Dominican Republic, who were interviewed by 
the Special Rapporteur, the report on the matter from the Immigration Department indicated 
that a joint operation was carried out by law enforcement (Immigration and Police) on a 
house in Grand Bahama where Dominicans were found.  There was, however, no evidence 
that law enforcement found these persons abandoned and blind folded in the house a few 
days after arrival.  The persons were also in possession of their passports and personal 
belongings. The report indicated the matter to be smuggling and not trafficking in persons.     
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 5  
</p>
<p>12. Until recent times, the Government&#8217;s focus was not on trafficking in persons, as 
major attention had to be given to the age old, immense problem of human smuggling. The 
thousands of migrants, who are smuggled into The Bahamas regularly from Haiti, make it 
almost impractical for the authorities to properly identify persons who may be trafficked 
among smuggled persons.  The first line officers receive training in the identification of 
victims of trafficking; and, there are protocols in place to assist with identification. 
</p>
<p>13. The form of trafficking in persons identified in The Bahamas is for sexual and 
labour exploitation.  Migrant workers are especially vulnerable to being trafficked, 
particularly among the Haitian population who arrive in The Bahamas, largely voluntarily, 
to work as domestic employees, labourers, and in agriculture.  The other large, vulnerable 
migrant worker communities are from China, Jamaica and the Philippines.  The groups 
especially vulnerable to sex trafficking in The Bahamas include foreign persons, many of 
whom are involved in prostitution or exotic dancing, and women.   
</p>
<p>14. Over the past two years, a number of separate incidences was investigated during 
operations conducted by law enforcement officers from the Department of immigration and 
the Royal Bahamas Police Force, at different times.   Of the many persons who were 
interviewed, it was determined that there was no evidence that they were victims of sex or 
labour trafficking or any other form of trafficking.  There were no suspected traffickers.  
They were all illegal migrants. 
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 6  
</p>
<p>15. The situation described in this paragraph typifies the literature on what can happen 
in a trafficking in persons situation. The Bahamas takes a victim-centred approach in 
dealing with trafficking in persons, as is promoted by the international organizations, which 
is focussed on the protection of the victim, regardless of nationality. 
</p>
<p>16. It is recognized by the Bahamian authorities that persons trafficked  may not want to 
reach out to them  due to their perceived status as illegal migrants; however, potential 
trafficked persons in The Bahamas are viewed as victims of crime rather than as criminals.  
This is seen as an important step in uncovering the trafficking networks and bringing the 
perpetrators to justice.  The provision is also in place for victims to be  
17. given temporary residency status that will enable them to obtain employment.  
</p>
<p>18. The rescued victims from Jamaica, interviewed by the Special Rapporteur, were 
trafficked by Jamaicans concerned with Bahamians, who recruited them from their 
communities of origin in Jamaica.  
</p>
<p>19. As indicated at paragraph 5 above, the smuggling of Haitians into The Bahamas is  </p>
<p>an age old problem.  They enter the country by boat, and through their employment 
situations, may become vulnerable to labour trafficking.  Dominicans are included in a new 
trend of migrants that are being smuggled into the country and are vulnerable to situations 
of trafficking in persons.  They arrive in the Bahamas mainly by air.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.10 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 7  
</p>
<p>20. <b>Line 12:</b> Change the word &#8216;drawn&#8217; to &#8216;drown&#8217;. 
</p>
<p>21. The terms of the visit of the Special Rapporteur to The Bahamas was to examine the 
situation of trafficking in persons from a human rights approach.  At paragraph 5 of the 
report, it is indicated that in The Bahamas there is little understanding of the difference 
between trafficking in persons and migrant smuggling. This paragraph (para. 7) however, 
details what happens during human smuggling operations rather than trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p>22.  Additionally, although some of the thousands of Haitians who are smuggled into 
The Bahamas on over-crowded, unseaworthy vessels may be lured to come; based upon 
interviews with these persons, the vast majority of them arrive of their own volition, as they 
believe that they can find a better life economically in The Bahamas.  Upon arrival, they are 
very quickly immersed into the legal and illegal Haitian communities, which are strong.  It 
becomes a revolving door, since as soon as these migrants are repatriated to their country, 
they return at the earliest opportunity; and no amount of persuasion by the local authorities 
can dissuade them from making the risky voyage.  
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 8 
</p>
<p>23. This paragraph is contradictory as it states both that &#8220;the absence of available data 
makes it hard to assess the phenomenon of domestic servitude in the country &#8230;.&#8221;; and, 
&#8220;undocumented migrants from Haiti are known to constitute the largest share of domestic 
workers&#8230;..&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>24. It will be noted that statistics provided by the Department of Immigration do not 
support the assertion that on the Island of Grand Bahama, persons of Haitian origin largely 
outnumber the Bahamian nationals.  
</p>
<p>25. This paragraph makes reference to &#8220;stateless Bahamian of Haitian decent&#8221;.  It is to 
be noted that there are no &#8220;stateless&#8221; Bahamians.  Persons of Haitian decent born in The 
Bahamas with neither parents as citizens, adopt the nationality of their parents and can 
obtain Haitian passports.    
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 9 
</p>
<p>26. The 2001 National Employment Act does provide for the protection of domestic 
workers; however, the Act does not provide for overtime compensation for those domestic 
workers that are live-in-housekeepers.  All other basic benefits such as, severance, vacation 
and notice payments are covered under the Act.   
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 10  
</p>
<p>27. The case indicated by the Ministry of Social Services and Community Development 
of the minor Haitian child was investigated by the police and, in consultation with 
prosecutors in the Specialized Trafficking in Persons Unit in the Office of the Attorney 
General and Ministry of Legal Affairs, was determined not to be a Trafficking in Persons 
case.  
</p>
<p>28. With respect to the discussions held by the Special Rapporteur with civil society 
interlocutors, it is to be noted that there were no government officials present.  It is also to 
be noted that the Government has neither evidence nor report to identify child sex tourism 
as a problem in The Bahamas.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.10 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>  Paragraph 11 
</p>
<p>29. Bahamian nationals are willing to engage in domestic jobs, but are seldom willing to 
be engaged as domestic live-in workers.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal, policy and institutional frameworks for combating trafficking in 
persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1.  Legal Framework 
</b></p>
<p><i>  International and Regional Framework 
</i></p>
<p>  Paragraph 12  
</p>
<p>30. The Government is currently reviewing the &#8220;International Convention on the 
Protection of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families as well as the Domestic 
Workers Convention (ILO 189)&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 13 
</p>
<p>31. The Government of The Bahamas does have established protocols for dealing with 
asylum seekers and refugees.  The Unit within the Department of Immigration with specific 
responsibility for these categories of migrants works closely with the Office of the Attorney 
General and Ministry of Legal Affairs on matters that require judicial remedies. 
32. The Constitution of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas provides for persons of 
foreign parents born in The Bahamas, including undocumented Haitian migrants, to apply 
for citizenship when they reach the age of 18 years.  With respect to children born of 
undocumented Haitian migrants, they are not at risk for statelessness as they adopt the 
nationality of their parents and can obtain Haitian passports.   
</p>
<p><i>  National Framework 
</i></p>
<p>  Paragraph 20 
</p>
<p>33. <b>Line 2:</b> The 2001 Employment Act does not set &#8216;limitation of working hours&#8217;; 
however, where an employee works in excess of the Standard hours of work (Section 8 (1) 
of the Employment Act) they are to be compensated overtime in accordance with the Act.  
As it relates to &#8216;inspectors not being able to inspect homes&#8217;, this is the International 
Standard and is not unique to The Bahamas.    
</p>
<p><i>  Immigration Policy 
</i></p>
<p>  Paragraph 22  
</p>
<p>34. At the time of the UN Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the Detention Centre had a 
capacity to hold 200 detainees and had a total of 133.  There were three (3) dormitories 
with two additional dormitories in the final stage of construction.  Each dormitory had a 
capacity to hold 70 persons with a sanitary room containing facilities for use by four (4) 
detainees at a time.   
</p>
<p>35. Additionally, at the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the Government was in 
the process of a repatriation exercise, therefore, all of the migrants earmarked for 
repatriation had been processed and temporarily detained for two to three (2-3) hours in a 
specific dormitory awaiting removal for repatriation. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.10 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 23  
</p>
<p>36. <b>Line 5:</b> The statistics provided by the Department of Immigration does not indicate 
that the majority of persons entering The Bahamas are Haitian children under the age of 18.   
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 25  
</p>
<p>37. As indicated at paragraph 4, the report from the Immigration Department indicated 
that a joint operation was carried out by law enforcement (Immigration and the Police) on a 
house in Grand Bahama where Dominicans were found; however, there is no evidence that 
law enforcement found them abandoned and blind folded in the house. 
</p>
<p><i>  Institutional Framework 
</i></p>
<p>  Paragraph 31  
</p>
<p>38. <b>Lines 7&#8211;11:</b> It is comprised of senior Government officials from the Ministries of 
National Security, Labour and National Insurance, Social Services and Community 
Development and Health  
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 32 
</p>
<p>39. <b>Lines 4&#8211;9:</b> Similar to the TIP Committee Labour and National Insurance, Social 
Services and Community Development........   
</p>
<p><b> C. Identification of trafficked persons 
</b></p>
<p>40. The information provided by the Department of Immigration in The Bahamas does 
not support the statistics from the IOM that a large majority of persons smuggled into The 
Bahamas are minors.   
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 41 
</p>
<p>41. There is no evidence that action was taken by the Special Rapporteur during her visit 
to ascertain the veracity of the allegations referred to as &#8220;alarming alleged practices&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>42. At the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur, no government official had been 
investigated, prosecuted and/or convicted for involvement in migrant smuggling operations.   
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 42  
</p>
<p>43. The suggestion in this paragraph that social workers should be on &#8220;immigration 
raids and marine border control operations&#8221;, appear not to take account of how 
governments operate.  In The Bahamas, Social Workers are not permitted to participate in  
matters such as raids or marine border control operations involving  national security.  
Unless there are changes, law enforcement officers will continue to be first line workers in 
these situations in identifying trafficking victims.   
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 44 
</p>
<p>44. <b>Lines 1&#8211;3:</b> The Trafficking in Persons Investigation Section and not the Victim Care 
Unit of Central Detective Unit  is mandated to provide  assistance for the immediate 
removal of victims from the environment of exploitation and transfer them to a safe 
location. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.10 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>  Paragraph 45  
</p>
<p>45. <b>Lines 1&#8211;2:</b> In accordance with the TIPA Section 20 (1), the Minister responsible for 
National Security in conjunction with the Minister responsible for Social Services shall 
develop a plan in consultation with non-governmental organizations and other 
representatives of civil society for the provision of appropriate services from governmental 
and non-governmental sources for victims of trafficking and dependent children 
accompanying the victims.    
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 46  
</p>
<p>46. At the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur, the victims were housed in long-
term housing facilities provided by the Government of The Bahamas pursuant to the TIPA 
Section 12 (2) and the Plan to Provide Assistance to Victims of Trafficking in Persons and 
their Dependent Children (Trafficking in Persons Assistance Plan. The NGOs mentioned 
such as the Links Safe House are only used to provide short-term shelter for potential 
victims.  As the shelter provided by the Links Safe House includes families with children, 
their policy is to assist with safe housing for victims of labour trafficking and not sex 
trafficking.  
</p>
<p>47. There was no attempt by the Special Rapporteur to visit safe houses other than the 
one visited, and this was due primarily to time constraints.    
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 47  
</p>
<p>48. The dedicated housing provided by the Government of The Bahamas for victims of 
trafficking in persons is not based on an ad hoc system, but is provided as outlined in the 
Government&#8217;s Trafficking in Persons Assistance Plan document.  It is to be noted that the 
Links Safe House provides 24 hour supervision at its facility; and, that victims of 
trafficking in persons receive counselling from the Government run Sandilands 
Rehabilitation Centre and the Crisis Centre.  
</p>
<p>49. The Government of The Bahamas provided two of the victims of trafficking in 
persons with Refugee Certificates that enable them to seek legal employment while in a 
temporary residency status.  If it is determined that victims would be resident in The 
Bahamas for a longer period of time, then they will be issued with a Work Permit, without 
charge, which is renewable annually.  
</p>
<p>50. All of the necessities of the trafficking in persons victims are provided for by the 
Government of The Bahamas. 
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 48 
</p>
<p>51. The Department of Social Services assisted three Jamaican females, who were 
trafficked, and two Dominicans who were potential victims but were not determined to be 
victims of trafficking. 
</p>
<p>52. The IOM provided support in repatriating two victims. 
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 49 
</p>
<p>53. The temporary residency permit provided for in the TIPA is not contingent on 
victims cooperation in judicial proceedings.   
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 51 
</p>
<p>54. The Royal Bahamas Police Force is responsible for investigating TIP cases.  There 
is an established unit at the Central Detective Unit to investigate these types of cases.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/37/Add.10 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>There is a Sexual Offences Unit at Central Detective Unit that is responsible for 
investigation cases of sexual assault.  However, the officers assigned to TIP cases are 
experienced in the investigation of sexual crimes and other major crimes. 
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 54 
</p>
<p>55. <b>Line 1:</b> The offences of trafficking are triable before the Supreme Court and the 
Magistrates Court. 
</p>
<p>56. <b>Lines 3&#8211;4:</b> Prosecutors in the Office of the Attorney General Ministry of Legal 
Affairs who specialize in the prosecution of sexual offence cases are also involved in the 
prosecution of trafficking related cases. 
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 56 
</p>
<p>57. <b>Lines 5&#8211;6:</b> In the case that was prosecuted in the Supreme Court, the two victims 
were made to prostitute themselves.  In the case that is being prosecuted in the Magistrates 
Court, the victim was made to dance in a night club and prostitute herself. 
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 61  
</p>
<p>58. <b>Lines 1&#8211;2:</b> The Government informed that at the time of the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur, two of the three victims were in The Bahamas.  The other was repatriated to 
the country of origin with the help of the IOM.   
</p>
<p>  Paragraph 63  
</p>
<p>59. The paragraph should be restated as follows: 
</p>
<p>60. Although there is no institutionalized compensation scheme, the Government 
informed that the two Dominican males, who were not identified as victims of trafficking in 
persons, were assisted in their return to their home country and provided with a small 
stipend from funds earmarked for victims of Trafficking in Persons before their 
repatriation.  There were no cases of labour exploitation in The Bahamas.
