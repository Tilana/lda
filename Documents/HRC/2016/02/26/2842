<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>all relevant resolutions on extreme poverty and human rights adopted by 
the General Assembly, including resolution 65/214 of 21 December 2010, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also </i>all previous resolutions adopted by the Subcommission for the 
promotion and protection of human rights, including resolution 2006/9 of 24 August 2006, 
in which the Subcommission welcomed and approved the draft guiding principles prepared 
by the ad hoc group of experts, and requested the Human Rights Council to study them with 
the view to adopting them and forwarding them to the General Assembly, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further </i>all relevant Human Rights Council resolutions, including 
resolution 15/19 of 30 September 2010, in which the Council invited the independent 
expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty to pursue further work on the 
draft guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights with a view to submitting a 
final draft of the revised guiding principles to the Council at its twenty-first session, in 
order to allow the Council to take a decision on the way forward with a view to the 
adoption, by 2012, of guiding principles on the rights of persons living in extreme poverty, 
and resolution 17/13 of 17 June 2011, in which the Council decided to extend the mandate 
of the mandate holder as a special rapporteur, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming </i>the submission of views and contributions of Member States and other 
relevant stakeholders on the draft guiding principles, including in accordance with Human 
Rights Council resolution 12/19 of 2 October 2009 and 15/19, and the holding of rounds of 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>consultations on this matter between 2001 and 2012, the most recent being the two-day 
consultation organized by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on 22 and 23 June 2011, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its appreciation</i> to the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and 
human rights for finalizing the draft guiding principles by integrating the views and 
contributions of Member States and other relevant stakeholders, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>the commitments made at relevant United Nations conferences and 
summits, including those made at the Millennium Summit, at which Heads of State and 
Government committed themselves to eradicate extreme poverty and to halve, by 2015, the 
proportion of the world&#8217;s people whose income is less than one dollar a day and of those 
</p>
<p>who suffer from hunger, and at the 2005 World Summit, and welcoming the conclusions of 
the summit on the Millennium Development Goals, held in New York from 20 to 22 
September 2010, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>that extreme poverty and social exclusion persist in all countries 
of the world, regardless of their economic, social and cultural situation, and that its extent 
and manifestations are particularly severe in developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging </i>the need to continue national and international efforts, including 
through international cooperation to eradicate extreme poverty, in particular in the 
framework of the post-2015 development agenda, and taking note in this regard of the 
contribution of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) and 
of its outcome document &#8220;The future we want&#8221;,1

important for all policies and programmes that specifically address the situation of people 
living in extreme poverty,

extreme poverty and human rights on the guiding principles on extreme poverty and human 
rights,<footnote name="2">A/HRC/21/39. </footnote> and welcomes the work of the Special Rapporteur;

agencies, funds and programmes, other intergovernmental organizations and national 
human rights institutions, as well as non-governmental organizations and non-State actors, 
including the private sector, to consider the guiding principles in the formulation and 
implementation of their policies and measures concerning persons affected by extreme 
poverty; </p>
<p>4.<i> Requests </i>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to disseminate the guiding principles, as appropriate; 
</p>
