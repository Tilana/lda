<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report contains my findings following an official visit to Saudi Arabia in 
February 2008.  
</p>
<p> The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is confronted with unprecedented challenges. Pressures for 
change, particularly in the past two decades, have resulted in modest reforms which have 
nonetheless had significant implications for women&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p> The voices, aspirations and demands of Saudi women are as diverse and multiple as are 
their life experiences. While there are those who express content and satisfaction with their lives, 
others contend that there are serious levels of discriminatory practices against women, which 
compromise their rights and dignity as full human beings and undermine the true values of their 
society. 
</p>
<p> A number of positive developments have taken place affecting the status of women, 
particularly in access to education, which has resulted in significant improvements in women&#8217;s 
literacy rates within a relatively short period of time. However, this progress has not been 
accompanied by a comparable increase in women&#8217;s participation in the labour force and they are 
largely excluded from decision-making processes. 
</p>
<p> Sex segregation and the practice of male guardianship pose important obstacles to 
women&#8217;s autonomy, legal capacity as adults, and ability to participate in the full range of 
activities available in society and in the workplace. 
</p>
<p> In recent years, violence against women has been recognized as a public policy issue. 
However, current judicial practices pertaining to divorce and child custody as well as women&#8217;s 
lack of autonomy and economic independence continue to limit their ability to escape from 
abusive marriages. Issues related to early/forced marriage and divorce are also gaining public 
attention, although there are few opportunities for redress due to lack of legal clarity and the 
discretionary power of judges on these matters. Violence against female domestic workers, who 
are amongst the most vulnerable, is not sufficiently recognized.  
</p>
<p> The report provides a number of recommendations with respect to: measures necessary to 
women&#8217;s empowerment and increased participation in the public sphere; the elimination of 
violence against women and girls; judicial and legal reforms; and measures to combat abuse of 
migrant workers. Recommendations are also made on ways in which Saudi Arabia can 
strengthen its cooperation with international human rights mechanisms.  </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, I carried out an official mission to Saudi Arabia 
from 4 to 13 February 2008. I visited Riyadh, Buridah (Al Qassim), Jeddah and Dammam. 
</p>
<p>2. During the course of my mission, I held consultations with the President and members of 
the Human Rights Commission, the Head of the Majlis al-Shura and officials from various 
ministries and public entities. I also met with academics, businesswomen, journalists, lawyers, 
human rights activists, women&#8217;s groups, representatives of United Nations agencies, the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference and the diplomatic community. I had the opportunity to 
visit various social protection centres where I spoke with women survivors of violence and 
domestic workers as well as detainees at the women&#8217;s prison in Riyadh.  
</p>
<p>3. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the victims of violence who agreed to 
share their personal experiences with me, as well as to the many inspirational men and women I 
met who are struggling for the betterment of their society against strong odds. I am also grateful 
to the Human Rights Commission for the excellent cooperation extended to me during the 
mission.  
</p>
<p>4. I look forward to continued dialogue with the Government and other stakeholders on the 
implementation of my recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  THE CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia<b>1</b> was founded in 1932 by Abd Al-Aziz bin Abd al-Rahman 
Al Saud (Ibn Saud). Today, it is confronted with unprecedented challenges from many fronts. 
Particularly over the past two decades, pressures for change have resulted in modest but 
noteworthy reforms, including increased engagement with the international human rights system. 
Such reforms, and their impact on women&#8217;s status, need to be assessed in light of the complex 
and fragile social, economic and political dynamics that shape the trajectory of the Saudi State 
and society. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Governance structure 
</b></p>
<p>6. The modern Saudi State emerged with the coming together of a number of tribal <i>amirs</i> 
under the paternal leadership of Abd Al-Aziz Al Saud. This process was supported by the 
politico-religious alliances of the Al Saud and Al Shaikh families and further reinforced by the 
exploitation of oil. The Wahhabi-Hanbali interpretation of Islamic law, which is said to be the 
most conservative, enjoys hegemony. From a predominantly rural society composed of loosely 
organized tribes, Saudi Arabia has become largely urbanized, with over three-fifths of the 
population living in major cities. 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The Arabian Peninsula is home to diverse cultures and peoples, including: the Hijaz on the 
</p>
<p>Red Sea coast with its cosmopolitan population; the Eastern province on the Gulf with its Shiite 
majority; the predominantly tribal Asir region in the south; and the Najd in the centre, the heart 
of Wahhabism and the seat of the Al Saud monarchy. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/6/Add.3 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>7. In 1992, the Basic Law of Governance, i.e., the Constitution (the Basic Law hereafter) and 
the Law on the Consultative Council (<i>Shura</i>)<b>2</b> were issued. The latter is a deliberative body with 
150 members restricted to men<b>3</b> 30 years of age and older who are appointed by the King. 
Together with the Council of Ministers, they retain the authority of enacting laws.<b>4</b> The King 
also appoints <i>amirs </i>mainly from the Al Saud family as provincial governors. 
</p>
<p>8. Article 1 of the Basic Law provides that &#8220;the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a sovereign Arab 
Islamic State with Islam as its religion; God&#8217;s Book and the Sunnah of his prophet, God&#8217;s 
prayers and peace be upon him, are its constitution&#8221;. Accordingly, the sharia (Islamic law) 
provides the basis of governance and characterizes the State as well as its relationship with its 
citizens. 
</p>
<p>9. Saudi Arabia has no political parties or trade unions and the establishment of 
non-governmental organizations is in its infancy. In 2005, nationwide elections were held for 
half the members of the 179 municipal councils, while the other half were appointed by the 
King. Women could not participate in these elections.<b>5</b> The weekly open meetings held in 
accordance with article 43 of the Basic Law, which provides that the King&#8217;s court and that of the 
Crown Prince shall be open for anyone with a complaint or a plea, allow for a degree of direct 
access to the Government. Women, however, rarely submit their pleas in person. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  International obligations 
</b></p>
<p>10. Saudi Arabia has ratified several of the core human rights instruments, including the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women.<b>6</b> Saudi Arabia made a general reservation to the latter 
Convention, whereby &#8220;in case of contradiction between any term of the Convention and the 
norms of Islamic Law, the Kingdom is not under the obligation to observe the contradictory 
terms of the Convention&#8221;. The language used in this reservation, which is similar to that made in 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  The creation of a consultative council was requested by both liberal circles and a group of 
</p>
<p><i>ulama</i>; the former calling for reforms, including with regard to women&#8217;s status, and the latter 
calling for restoration of sharia. See S. Al Torki, &#8220;The concept and practice of citizenship in 
Saudi Arabia&#8221;, S. Joseph (ed), <i>Gender and Citizenship in the Middle East</i>, Syracuse, 2000, 
Syracuse University Press, pp. 215-236.

</b>  Women may act as advisers. 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  See article 2, Basic Law, and article 3, Consultative Council Law. 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  Women were excluded from elections, presumably due to the absence of separate voting 
</p>
<p>booths.

</p>
<p>other treaties, does not clearly define the extent to which Saudi Arabia accepts its international 
obligations, although I was assured by officials that there was no contradiction in substance 
between the Convention and Islamic law. 
</p>
<p>11. According to article 26 of the Basic Law, the State protects human rights according to 
sharia. Article 70 provides that provisions of any international agreement approved by royal 
decree shall be valid and directly applicable in courts. Most of my interlocutors noted however, 
that in practice international instruments do not have precedence over national law and it is 
unclear whether they have ever been used in courts.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Socio-economic dynamics 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Basic Law (art. 9) states that the family (<i>usra</i>), represented by the elder male, is the 
core of Saudi society and the State strives to strengthen the bonds of the family (art. 10). Loyalty 
to the territorial State, as opposed to familial and tribal networks, has been on the rise in the past 
decades and there is a growing wealthy, educated and globally connected professional middle 
class. Nonetheless, despite these developments the traditional structures of power, identity and 
affiliation are maintained as the fundamental pillars of the society and the sensitive balance 
among them is manoeuvred cautiously. Consequently, reformists are ambivalent about moving 
too fast, particularly with regard to personal-status norms.  
</p>
<p>13. While the diversification of the economy in recent years has reduced dependency on oil,<b>7</b> 
Saudi Arabia continues to be characterized by its dependence on a large foreign workforce. 
Employment within the Saudi population has so far concentrated on high-skill occupations 
requiring technical or university qualifications - a &#8220;recipe for reliance on foreign labour at lower 
and middle levels&#8221;, noted the Government in its eighth development plan. According to a 2006 
study by the General Statistics Department, the number of non-Saudi workers in the Kingdom, 
mostly coming from Asia, was estimated at 8,024,885 (1,244,335 women), out of a total 
population of approximately 27 million.  
</p>
<p>14. The presence of such a large number of foreign workers, many of whom are in precarious 
employment situations, poses a number of challenges for Saudi Arabia. Aside from the obvious 
security and human rights concerns, the need to create opportunities for native entrants in the 
labour market, especially the young and women is particularly complex. In addition to managing 
a tight system of labour contracts and migrant control, measures for the &#8220;Saudization&#8221; of the 
economy have been initiated since the fourth national development plan, with quotas in private 
businesses set for Saudis, including for manual labour.8 Since then, the share of native labour in 
total employment increased to 44.9 per cent in 2002. Businesses, however, are said to be 
suffering from a lack of Saudi staff. The system of sex segregation, which limits women&#8217;s 
employment options, also accounts for the low rate of Saudis in the workforce. 
</p>
<p>

US$ 15,000.

<p>  A/HRC/11/6/Add.3

</p>
<p><b>D.  Sex segregation 
</b></p>
<p>15. Saudi Arabia is a sex-segregated society, a policy which is enforced in public institutions, 
private businesses, restaurants and caf&#233;s, and which shapes the architectural design of private 
homes. Discussions and meetings among men and women are conducted through video 
conferences or by phone, rather than face to face. Although the new Saudi Labour Code, 
amended in 2005, no longer includes a provision explicitly requiring sex segregation in the 
workplace, the fact that there has been no formal/public repeal or prohibition of segregation, 
leaves uncertainty as to its proper enforcement. 
</p>
<p>16. According to many businesswomen and officials, sex segregation is a primary obstacle to 
women&#8217;s ability to participate in the full range of activities and opportunities in the workplace 
and results in the duplication of tasks and resources. Until 2004, when the Ministry of Commerce 
and Industry abolished the requirement, women had to hire a male manager to run or establish 
companies that have dealings with men.  
</p>
<p>17. Some argue that sex segregation is not discriminatory in itself, but that problems arise due 
to the lack of private sections for women in government and business institutions. Royal Decree 
No. 120 (2003) outlines steps for expanding job opportunities for Saudi women, including an 
obligation for all government agencies providing services to women to establish women&#8217;s 
sections within a period not exceeding a year of the issuance of the decree. At the time of my 
visit, many institutions did not have functioning women&#8217;s units - there were for instance, no 
female police officers and just a few female staff within the Ministry of Interior. I was 
encouraged to learn that a women&#8217;s department was established by Royal Decree No. 8382/MB 
of October 2008 in the Ministry of Justice to supervise the women&#8217;s divisions of the courts and 
notary public offices. Also welcomed is the opening in 2008 of women&#8217;s sections of the Human 
Rights Commission in Riyadh and Mecca, with sections in other provinces also planned. 
</p>
<p>18. One notable exception to sex segregation is in the health sector, where medical schools are 
mixed and women and men generally work side by side in hospitals and health centres. Health 
professionals agree that the provision of one joint service, while observing societal sensitivities, 
such as for separate gynaecological care, allows for efficient use of resources and delivery of 
better quality services. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  WOMEN&#8217;S STATUS  
</b></p>
<p>19. Positive developments in the status of women have taken place in recent years. Yet, by and 
large, the &#8220;modern&#8221; practices concerning women in Saudi Arabia stand in contrast to not only 
the role women played during early Islam but also vis-&#224;-vis the laws and religious principles 
prevailing in the country. The contradictions in this regard are most apparent in the areas of 
women&#8217;s autonomy and participation in the public sphere. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.3 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Education 
</b></p>
<p>20. The most noteworthy progress has been in the field of education. Since the opening of 
schools for girls in 1956,<b>9</b> women&#8217;s literacy rates increased dramatically, although a gender gap 
remains. By 2006, 78.4 per cent of Saudi women aged 15 and above were literate, compared to 
88.6 per cent of men, while the literacy rate of youth (15 to 24) is estimated at 95.5 
and 97.7 per cent, respectively.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>21. Today, women enjoy free and nearly complete access to primary and secondary education. 
In 2004, a royal decree made primary education compulsory for all children between the ages of 
6 and 15. In remote areas, parents are provided with financial incentives to send their daughters 
to school and teachers with an additional allowance. There are now more schools for girls than 
for boys in the Kingdom.<b>11</b> From kindergarten to twelfth grade, 51.4 per cent of students are girls 
and 48.6 per cent are boys. In tertiary education, female graduates constitute 56.5 per cent of all 
students, and male graduates 43.5 per cent.<b>12</b> This increase in girls&#8217; years of education has had a 
positive impact on marriage patterns, as shown for instance by an increase in the age of first 
marriage and a decrease in polygamous practices.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>22. However, concerns have been raised that the overall aim of girls&#8217; education which was to 
prepare them for their &#8220;natural roles&#8221; as mothers and wives has not changed over the past 
40 years. Although stereotypes that were perpetuated in some textbooks have recently been 
removed,<b>14</b> at secondary and tertiary levels of education, girls specialize in humanities and arts 
rather than science and engineering courses. They also remain excluded from some fields of 
study - depending on the particular university - such as engineering, astrology, geology and, until 
recently, law. From 2000 to 2007, 12 universities opened in the Kingdom. This, coupled with a 
recent decision by the Higher Education Council to increase studies in physical sciences, may 
create additional opportunities for girls. 
</p>
<p>23. Sex-segregated education adversely impacts on the quality of education as the allocation of 
resources and access are said to be unequally distributed. Female faculty members have 
complained that women&#8217;s branches of universities are less equipped than those for boys and that 
the highest decision-making positions are occupied by men. 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  In 1956 two private schools for girls were opened in Jeddah, followed in 1960 with the first 
</p>
<p>state school in Buridah, which provoked much opposition. The King skilfully diffused the 
protests and created a popular demand for girls&#8217; education. 
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  See www.uis.unesco.org.

<p>  From primary education onwards, classes are segregated and female teachers teach girls, and 
male teachers teach boys.

</p>
<p>24. Nonetheless, the achievements in girls&#8217; education have been commendable. This however, 
has not been accompanied by a comparable increase in women&#8217;s participation in the labour 
force. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Employment 
</b></p>
<p>25. Women&#8217;s participation in the labour market, although it remains low, increased 
to 10.3 per cent in 2004 and is expected to reach 14.8 per cent in 2009.<b>15</b> The public sector is 
women&#8217;s prime employer, in particular the Ministry of Education with 83.4 per cent of its 
employees female in 2003, and the Ministry of Health, with 5.4 per cent of its employees. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>26. The State report to the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) contends 
that Saudi working women amount to 50 per cent of the number of male workers, although the 
source of this data is unclear.<b>16</b> NGO figures are much lower.<b>17</b> Women&#8217;s low participation in the 
workforce is attributed to the mismatch between educational outputs and employment 
opportunities, women&#8217;s lack of freedom of movement and restrictions emanating from the 
guardianship system. 
</p>
<p>27. Some professions, in particular the legal and judicial professions, are still beyond the reach 
of women.<b>18</b> Women with law degrees from abroad have been unable to open their own practice. 
Law courses are now offered to women in some universities, with the first graduates expected in 
2009. At the time of writing, there was no public plan to allow them to practise law once they 
graduate. 
</p>
<p>28. Women&#8217;s participation in the private sector is lower than in the public sector. 
Commercially registered firms owned by women accounted for about 4.7 per cent of all 
businesses registered at the Chambers of Commerce and Industry in 2004. However, the State 
report to the UPR noted that 20,000 private companies (21 per cent) were owned by women. 
Some measures have also been taken to increase the &#8220;Saudization&#8221; of female jobs and encourage 
women&#8217;s participation in and ownership of businesses.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>29. Article 149 of the Labour Law (2005) specifies that women &#8220;shall work in all fields 
suitable to their nature&#8221;, in accordance with sharia provisions. Criteria for women&#8217;s work, as set

</p>
<p><b>18
</b>  In some firms, women have been working as legal clerks or researchers without interacting

<b>19
</b></p>
<p>  The Labour Minister announced in April 2008 that Saudi women were allowed to work as 
maids in Saudi households should they wish to. See <i>Khaleej Times</i>,<b> </b>30 April 2008. </p>

</p>
<p>out in paragraph 2/A of Council of Labour Force, No. 1/19M/1405 (1987), are quite restrictive.<b>20</b> 
Such criteria have not been repealed, even though they seem to counteract several other 
regulations taken in recent years to encourage women&#8217;s employment, such as the inclusion in the 
Eighth Development Plan of a wide range of measures in this regard, the Council of Ministers 
Decision No. 120 (2004) on the expansion of employment opportunities for Saudi women, and 
Royal Decree No. 187 (2005) on the issuance of women&#8217;s work permits in private businesses. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Decision-making 
</b></p>
<p>30. In February 2009 a woman was appointed as a deputy minister and in April 2009 another 
was appointed as a university president for the first time in the country&#8217;s history. In June 2006, 
six women were also appointed to the Shura<i>,</i> albeit as &#8220;advisers&#8221; exclusively on women&#8217;s issues. 
These are most promising steps towards expanding the public space for women. However, 
women&#8217;s participation in decision-making remains limited. In many universities women are not 
represented in the governing bodies. Officials suggested that having women supervising men is 
not well accepted in society, although there are cases of women supervising men in medical 
schools/facilities. 
</p>
<p>31. The private sector may offer more potential for women to become autonomous and reach 
positions of power and authority. Women are already allowed to sit in chambers of commerce, 
although their participation remains low; the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce being the only 
chamber with women on its Board of Directors. Some businesswomen reported that chamber 
officials were generally against their standing for elections.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>32. It is interesting to note that public opinion in favour of women sharing decision-making 
power appears high. In a survey conducted in Jeddah, 84 per cent of women and 78 per cent of 
men interviewed replied positively to the question: &#8220;Do you believe that women can share 
decision-making with men on issues of national development?&#8221;<b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b>D.  Guardianship system 
</b></p>
<p>33. <i>Mahram</i>, or the legal guardianship of women by a male, is practised in varying degrees 
and encompasses major aspects of women&#8217;s lives. The system is said to emanate from social 
conventions, including the importance of protecting women, and from religious precepts on 
travel and marriage, although these requirements were arguably confined to particular situations.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>20
</b>  They are as follows: (a) need for the woman to work; (b) permission of her guardian; 
</p>
<p>(c) suitability of the work to a woman&#8217;s nature and not distracting with regard to her household 
and marital duties; (d) sex-segregated workplace; (e) women&#8217;s compliance with notions of 
dignity and modesty and Islamic dress code.

</p>
<p>34. While some women rationalize the system as necessary for their protection and express 
pride in being such &#8220;pampered Saudi women&#8221;,<b>23</b> others complain that the system is a denial of 
their intellectual capacities, moral values and legal capacity as adults. Guardianship indeed 
severely limits women&#8217;s autonomy, freedom of movement and the exercise of their legal 
capacity in relation to marriage, divorce, child custody, inheritance, and property 
ownership/control,<b>24</b> as well as decision-making in family matters, education and employment. 
In general, the guardianship system renders women&#8217;s legal position precarious. 
</p>
<p>35. Although guardianship is not regulated in law, there are some specific legal provisions 
requiring a guardian&#8217;s authorization or presence in order for a woman to access or benefit from 
some services. Marriage and its dissolution must be approved by a guardian to be considered 
legal. A woman wanting to travel or undergo an operation pertaining to sexual and reproductive 
matters needs her guardian&#8217;s approval.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>36. While, according to law, women have the right to undergo any other medical operation, 
open a business, perform financial transactions, own property, inherit, and choose their education 
without a male guardian&#8217;s approval or presence - in practice the exercise of such rights can be 
arbitrarily restricted depending on the practice adopted by a particular institution or the 
understanding of the individual in charge. Reportedly, in most business operations, and 
depending on the context, women generally need either the approval or presence of a male 
guardian/representative, or a power of attorney.<b>26</b>  
</p>
<p>37. Women&#8217;s lack of an identity card (ID) deepens their dependency on men. This is the case 
for instance, when they must appear before a court, are performing financial/administrative 
transactions, and in some situations even when a guardian is not strictly required. I have been 
told of fraudulent schemes whereby men, misrepresenting fully veiled women in court, are able 
to cheat them out of their property or inheritance. In 2001, despite opposition, photo ID for 
women was instituted - a major step forward in establishing women&#8217;s autonomy as legal persons. 
Some problems in its implementation are reported however, such as the requirement of the 
guardian&#8217;s approval to obtain one, and many women today still lack an ID card either because 
they lack their guardian&#8217;s approval or due to the woman&#8217;s reluctance to appear unveiled in the 
photograph.

<p><b>24
</b>  Although girls inherit half of what their brothers inherit, by law they enjoy ownership of their

their ability to manage and control their property.

<p>  Interestingly, a public survey showed that 65 per cent of women and 66 per cent of men 
interviewed were in favour of women practising business without a male guardian 
(Ipsos survey, 2007). </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/6/Add.3

</p>
<p>38. The guardianship system, by granting such power to men over women, is said to have 
condoned or allowed abuse of women and children.<b>27</b> Although nothing in the law prevents a 
woman from going to a police station, a health-care centre or a court to file a complaint, the 
practice varies. I was told of a number of cases where women were not able to file complaints 
because police or health-care professionals - or in some cases, the women themselves - believed 
they had to have an authorization from their guardian. On other occasions where a woman could 
not show an ID card or was fully covered, officials would insist on having a guardian present. 
Clearly, where the guardian or someone close to him is the perpetrator, the possibility of 
obtaining redress is low, if possible at all. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 
</b></p>
<p>39. In recent years, violence against women has increasingly been recognized as an issue 
deserving public attention and intervention, the media being particularly vocal about it. A 
number of initiatives have been taken by government institutions, in particular to address the 
issue of violence in the family, long a taboo in Saudi Arabia.<b>28</b> Within this context, issues related 
to early and forced marriage and divorce are also increasingly gaining public attention. 
Recognition of violence against domestic migrant workers, however, continues to be problematic 
among the populace as well as the authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Manifestations of violence against women 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Violence in the family 
</b></p>
<p>40. The extent of domestic violence in Saudi Arabia is difficult to assess because of 
constraints on reporting and the lack of data. From 2004 to 2006, the National Society for 
Human Rights (NSHR) received 713 cases of family violence and 600 pertaining to personal 
affairs.<b>29</b> A counselling centre in one of the major Saudi cities receives on average  
50 complaints of domestic violence and child abuse per month, and could take more, had  
they the human resources to do so. The Jeddah committee for social protection reported 
receiving over 250 family violence cases from January to May 2008.<b>30</b>  
</p>
<p>41. Many of my interlocutors believe that the actual number of victims of domestic violence is 
higher than the fragmentary figures reported. A national experts meeting held in May 2007 
raised concerns over the high prevalence of domestic violence in the Kingdom and 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>27
</b>  See, for example: Human Rights Watch, &#8220;Perpetual minors&#8221;, op. cit., p. 39. 
</p>
<p><b>28
</b>  A TV presenter, who was beaten by her husband in 2004, helped demystify the taboo around 
</p>
<p>domestic violence by going public. 
<b>29
</b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/6/Add.3

</p>
<p>recommended immediate action by the Government. A study<b>31</b> conducted in 2003-04 showed 
that 52.6 per cent of men interviewed abused their wife for &#8220;misconduct&#8221;; an act that 
52.7 per cent of the male respondents accept as &#8220;the appropriate way to deal with women&#8217;s 
misconduct&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>42. Husbands or ex-husbands, followed by close relatives (predominantly fathers and 
brothers), are the most common perpetrators of violence against women within the family. The 
NSHR received complaints concerning physical and psychological violence, sexual harassment, 
defamation and insults. Data from the National Programme for Family Safety shows that 
physical violence is the most common form of violence reported, which in 60 per cent of cases is 
caused by husbands, followed by brothers and fathers.  
</p>
<p>43. In addition, the Human Rights Commission and the NSHR have received complaints 
relating to abuse of power by husbands or other family members, such as: the denial of 
education, health or inheritance to wives and children; denying a wife the possibility to see her 
children; confiscating official documents such as identity cards in order to prevent women from 
travelling or accessing services; and the abandonment of wives and their children.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>44. There is also anecdotal evidence of neglect, abuse and violence against girls by family 
members. In 2006, there were around 1,300 girls in institutions for juveniles, many of whom are 
said to be there because they ran away from domestic abuse. Although the extent of such abuse 
cannot be determined due to the lack of data, Ayda&#8217;s story is illustrative:  
</p>
<p>My father is a retired military man and an alcoholic. He abused me since I was little. My 
mother died at the hospital because of beatings and burns. When my siblings and I accused 
our father of her death, he forced us to change our testimony. He hit me with chains and 
swords and raped me. I ran away from the house and lived on the street, where the <i>hay&#8217;at</i> 
found me and brought me to a shelter. But my father complained to the police I had run 
away and I spent one week in prison. My complaint about rape was rejected as the case 
focused on my running away. My father ultimately rejected me, so I could stay in the 
shelter with two of my sisters. I fear for my younger sister, who remains with our father. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Violence in the public sphere 
</b></p>
<p>45. Cases of rapes are not discussed openly and women and girls fear they will be judged by 
society should they report rape. Only rarely are rape cases brought to public and Government 
attention. While comprehensive data on rape cases is lacking, health professionals I talked 
to - often the first to be in contact with victims of rape - acknowledged that it is an emerging 
issue that would warrant more attention.

</p>
<p>46. The famous case of &#8220;the Qatif girl&#8221; highlights some of the difficulties in ensuring that 
victims of sexual violence receive adequate consideration and protection. In 2006, the 
19-year-old girl and her male companion were abducted and she was raped by seven Saudi men. 
Four of the men were sentenced to one to five-year prison terms and to flogging, ranging from 
80 to 1,000 lashes. The rape victim and her companion were sentenced to 90 lashes for the crime 
of <i>khelwa</i>, an offence under sharia law of being alone in private with an unrelated member of the 
opposite sex or &#8220;illegal mingling&#8221;. The sentence against the girl was later increased to 200 lashes 
and a six-month prison term. She was ultimately pardoned by the King, although he did not 
imply there had been any judicial misconduct. 
47. Saudi legislation does not specifically criminalize rape and no punishments for rape or 
other types of sexual violence are specifically defined, although judges could apparently issue a 
judgement based on the crime of &#8220;vice and corruption&#8221; as defined by Islamic law. Victims fear 
being judged and charged by society and the judiciary for having committed adultery should they 
complain about rape. Another issue is the lack of guidelines for health professionals, which 
could enable them to recognize rape cases and make proper referrals.  
</p>
<p>48. A source of &#8220;terror&#8221; for women on the street is the possibility of being apprehended by the 
Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (CPVPV), popularly known 
as <i>hay&#8217;at </i>or <i>mutawwa, </i>an authorized law enforcement agency responsible for maintaining 
morality in public places.<b>33</b> Reportedly some members of the CPVPV are responsible for serious 
abuses; harassing, threatening and arresting people who supposedly deviate from &#8220;religious 
norms&#8221;. According to my interlocutors, the CPVPV often makes quite liberal use of the offence 
of <i>khelwa</i>,<b>34</b> - the exact distinction between legal and illegal mingling of men and women 
seemingly left to the interpretation of the individual <i>mutawwa</i>.  
</p>
<p>49. Although members of the CPVPV are required to act in concert with the police and within 
certain limitations with respect to arrest and detention of people<b>35</b> - as underscored in the 
Punitive Procedures Act - they reportedly often act independently and without clear lines of 
accountability. For instance, charges against two Commission members for having molested a 
woman were dismissed in court on the grounds that the Commission had immunity.<b>36</b>

<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>33
</b>  The Commission carried out 400,000 arrests in 2005 for matters ranging from violations of 
</p>
<p>the dress code, to <i>khelwa</i>, failure to attend prayer, and alcohol or drug offences. 
<b>34
</b></p>
<p>  A telling incident occurred during my visit. A businesswoman from Jeddah was arrested 
while having coffee with her male colleague in a public cafe; she was subjected to humiliating 
and illegal treatment before being released the following day. See: &#8220;Saudi human rights

<p><b>3.  Forced marriage and divorce 
</b></p>
<p>50. Although the average age of first marriage has increased,<b>37</b> and while there is no precise 
data on the extent of child marriage, there is growing concern about this practice, which varies 
according to the socio-economic level of the family and local circumstances. Girls may be forced 
by their guardian to marry older men or men with mental disabilities for monetary or family 
considerations.<b>38</b> Recently, the marriage of an 8-year-old girl to a 58-year-old man by her father, 
who needed the advance dowry to solve his financial problems, provoked strong reactions 
among activists and in the national and international media. Her mother&#8217;s plea for a divorce was 
rejected by a court in Unayzah on the grounds that the case should wait until the girl reaches 
puberty. Recent government correspondence indicates that the court has now cancelled the 
marriage contract.  
</p>
<p>51. Forced marriages often place girls at risk of abuse and violence. A woman with whom I 
met was physically abused as a child by her brother, who forced her to marry a man when she 
was 14 years old, who also abused her physically. Thanks to the help of a social protection 
committee, she obtained a divorce after struggling for 10 years. Her four children were granted 
to her ex-husband.  
</p>
<p>52. No law determines the age of marriage and child marriage is not prohibited. The practice is 
based on sharia precepts, whereby maturity is associated with puberty, which could start as early 
as 9 for girls. The Grand Mufti Sheikh Abd al-Aziz Al-Sheikh, the head of the Council of Senior 
Religious Scholars, has recently been quoted in the media as saying that a 10 or 12-year-old girl 
is marriageable. Although the mufti&#8217;s pronouncements are respected, they are not binding on the 
Government. Following the debates around the ruling by the Unayzah court, the Human Rights 
Commission condemned the marriage of minor girls as an &#8220;inhumane violation&#8221; and called on all 
government agencies to adopt a clear position on child and forced marriages in order to end the 
practice, as it has &#8220;severe health consequences on the girl child&#8221; and her personal development.<b>39</b> 
In November 2008, the Shura approved a law officially defining the age of adulthood as 18, 
although whether this will also apply to the legal age for marriage is unknown.  
</p>
<p>53. Guardians also have the authority to dissolve marriages they deem unfit. The practice does 
not appear widespread, but has been highlighted nationally and internationally by the forcible 
divorce of Fatima Azzaz and Mansour Al-Timani. I have also received reports of 10 other 
attempts to annul marriages based on &#8220;tribal incompatibility&#8221;, which were brought to court after 
the Fatima and Mansour case. It appears that judicial proceedings have been blocked pending the 
resolution of the latter.

</p>
<p>54. Fatima and Mansour, who have two children, had been married for several years, with the 
approval of Fatima&#8217;s father. In 2005, after the father&#8217;s death, a court divorced the couple on 
grounds of &#8220;tribal incompatibility&#8221; upon the demand of Fatima&#8217;s half-brothers, who had become 
her guardians. The couple were arrested in 2006 for living together as an unmarried couple. 
Fatima was imprisoned for nine months, before being given shelter with her 2-year-old son in a 
government institution, where I visited her. Fatima refuses to leave the shelter until her family is 
reunited. Mansour lost his job and lives with the couple&#8217;s 5-year-old daughter with the help of 
concerned people. During my visit, I could witness first-hand the desperation of Fatima and 
Mansour. Although, I was assured by the Human Rights Commission that the couple would be 
reunited and the case had been submitted to the competent authorities, at the time of submitting 
the present report the case was still pending.  
</p>
<p>55. The decision of the judge to forcibly divorce Fatima and Mansour was reportedly based on 
his concern to avoid the &#8220;social tensions&#8221; that could arise due to the violation of tribal norms. 
Such judgements, however, are in clear violation of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s fundamental Islamic 
principles and with precepts of the Basic Law (arts. 9 and 10) which define the family as the 
foundation of Saudi society, and which the State is mandated to strengthen. The Fatima and 
Mansour case is a symbol of non-compliance with this law and illustrates both the arbitrary 
nature of the administration of justice and the extent to which the guardianship system can be 
abused.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Abuses against female migrant workers 
</b></p>
<p>56. Foreign female workers in Saudi Arabia work predominantly as maids and to some extent 
in the nursing sector. According to Government and NGO estimates, in early 2008, the number 
of women domestic workers ranged from 1 to 1.5 million.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>57. While most migrant workers come voluntarily to Saudi Arabia, some are allegedly 
trafficked for the purpose of forced labour or sexual exploitation.<b>41</b> Upon arrival, all 
migrants - contrary to the Council of Ministers&#8217; Decision 166 (2000) - have their passport and 
residency permit taken away from them, and some find themselves in slave-like conditions. 
Trafficking of children from countries such as Somalia or Chad for the purpose of sexual 
exploitation or forced labour and begging have also been reported. Government officials report 
however, that there are initiatives under way to prevent such crimes, and that a law on trafficking 
had been finalized and was being presented to the Shura Council.<b>42</b>

<p>  For instance, a woman who had been recruited in the Philippines to work as a beautician was 
forced to work as a maid. She was mistreated by her employer and suffered serious injuries while 
trying to escape. <i>Arab News</i>, 11 September 2008.

</p>
<p>58. While domestic workers comprise less than a quarter of the migrant workforce, embassies 
from labour-sending countries report that abuses against them account for the vast majority of 
complaints received. There is no law guaranteeing a minimum wage, although some 
labour-sending countries have started negotiating set wages with recruitment associations and the 
Saudi Government. Domestic workers, as other migrant workers, often face delays or denial of 
salary. Employers who do not pay their workers&#8217; wages on time are liable to a penalty and 
prohibition of recruitment for a period of one year,<b>43</b> although this regulation does not seem to be 
systematically applied.  
</p>
<p>59. Female domestic workers are among the most vulnerable to abuse. Direct testimonies, as 
well as embassy, NGO and media reports, confirm that these women are victims of physical, 
verbal and sexual abuse, are sometimes locked up in the house with no possibility to make or 
receive phone calls, or are prohibited from leaving the house at their will. Overwork and food 
deprivation are other abuses commonly reported.<b>44</b>  
</p>
<p>60. At the women&#8217;s prison in Riyadh, out of 1,200 inmates, most were foreign domestic 
workers from Asia and Africa, with the exception of two dozen Saudi nationals. They had been 
arrested and convicted either for &#8220;moral crimes&#8221; (adultery, sexual advances, <i>khelwa</i>) or for 
offences such as stealing, begging, carrying false documentation, or running away. Frequently, 
women had been picked up by the police or the CPVPV for seemingly innocuous acts, such as 
being on the street or speaking to someone in a supermarket.  
</p>
<p>61. An Indonesian inmate told me: &#8220;I worked four years as a maid. My sponsor took my 
passport and residency permit. He didn&#8217;t give me any salary. He abused me sexually during a 
week his wife was absent. He then rejected me and stopped my employment. I was living on the 
street when I was caught with the son of my employer by the religious police and sentenced to a 
[one] year and two month prison term and 200 lashes. The son was only sentenced to two 
months in prison and 100 lashes.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>62. The majority of women in the prison were in pretrial detention for exceedingly long 
durations of up to a year and a half. Some were still detained despite the fact that their sentence

</p>
<p><b>44
</b>  Data compiled by a labour-sending embassy based on voluntary reports on runaway maids 
</p>
<p>from June 2007 to February 2008 shows that maids ran away because of: 27 per cent, 
non-payment of salary; 15 per cent, harassment; 11 per cent, sick/unfit to work; 8 per cent, 
overwork; 7 per cent, physical abuse; 7 per cent, food deprivation; 6 per cent, sexual 
harassment/abuse; 5 per cent, kept beyond completion of two-year term; 5 per cent, deprived of 
residency; 4 per cent, deprived of communication with families or homesick; 5 per cent, other 
reasons. </p>

</p>
<p>had ended. Most of them complained they had not been informed about the judicial process, the 
exact reasons for their arrest, or their rights as the accused. There are also female migrants on 
death row, and concerns that due process rights have not been upheld in their cases.<b>45</b>  
</p>
<p>63. Foreign women, and particularly domestic workers, are disproportionately affected by 
Saudi Arabia&#8217;s strict sex segregation and restrictive practices towards women. They are isolated 
in private homes, vulnerable to abuse and lack access to redress. Prejudices against migrants, 
which are broadly shared across society, including by employers and officials, are compounding 
factors. The lack of a tracking system also reinforces the vulnerability of migrants, who arrive in 
groups of hundreds generally through recruitment agencies on &#8220;block visas&#8221;. Thus, neither the 
Saudi Government nor the sending country can verify where precisely those migrants go.  
</p>
<p>64. Moreover, the <i>kafala </i>(sponsorship) system increases the risks of exploitation and abuse 
since the employer bears responsibility for granting permission before a worker can enter 
Saudi Arabia, change employment or leave the country. Some have argued that, since employers 
bear the cost for the domestic workers&#8217; recruitment (generally 5,000 to 9,000 Riyals), they may 
develop a sense of ownership regarding their domestic workers and slip into abusive behaviour 
towards them. There have been documented cases of workers not being able to leave abusive 
situations or return home after completion of their contracts because their employer denied them 
permission.  
</p>
<p>65. The system was recently under review by the Ministry of Labour, with plans to transfer 
sponsorship authority from individual employers towards a few large recruitment agencies. This 
is a promising initiative provided that provisions for regulation and monitoring are included.

<p>66. An encouraging development in recent years has been the demystification of the taboo 
around violence against women, an issue which is now increasingly occupying the public 
discourse and agenda. 
</p>
<p>67. One of the most notable initiatives in responding to the problem is the National Programme 
for Family Safety (NPFS), which is administered within the National Guard Health Affairs, and 
aims to prevent violence through training, awareness-raising and the provision of services to 
victims. Since its creation, NPFS has been conducting training for social workers, police, 
forensic experts, and psychiatrists on the issue of child abuse. Child abuse is said to have 
provided a more acceptable entry point to discuss openly in society than violence against 
women. The demand has grown to such extent that NPFS is now on call 24 hours a day 
throughout the week to respond to complaints of child abuse.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>45
</b>  According to Amnesty International, from January 1985 to May 2008, out of a total 
</p>
<p>of 1,639 persons executed, 830 were foreign workers and 809 Saudi nationals (submission to 
Working Group on UPR, AI/SAU/UPR/SA/2009). See also concluding observations, 
CERD/C/62/CO/8; and report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions, A/HRC/8/3/Add.1. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/6/Add.3 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>68. NPFS has recently been expanding its work on domestic violence, offering training, health 
services, and assistance to women in filing complaints with the police and obtaining the required 
legal medical report. NPFS has also arranged for emergency shelter, longer-term accommodation 
in some cases, and foster parents for abused children.  
</p>
<p>69. Since January 2008, NPFS and the Ministry of Health have started setting up family 
protection centres in every hospital in the Kingdom, composed of trained staff to identify and 
address cases of abuse. At the time of my visit, a directive informing all hospitals about the plan 
to set up those centres had been sent and staff training had begun. There were also plans to 
establish a national registry of cases of violence against children and women, and reporting 
forms were being prepared to that end. 
</p>
<p>70. Since 2004, the Ministry for Social Affairs has also run social protection committees in all 
provinces, in which other relevant ministries are represented. They receive complaints of 
psychological and physical abuse from women and children, make recommendations to address 
them, and provide psychosocial and medical assistance. Representatives of the ministry 
explained that women in need of long-term housing could benefit from the ministry&#8217;s regular 
social-welfare programme. 
</p>
<p>71. Some of my interlocutors expressed concern that the performance and approach of social 
protection committees varied and the manner in which they dealt with family conflicts often 
discouraged women from escaping abusive relationships.<b>46</b> Officials underlined that the aim of 
the committees was to preserve family unity rather than impose untimely changes on society. 
While the intention is understandable, this should not come at the cost of women&#8217;s protection 
from abuse and redress. 
</p>
<p>72. Charity-based organizations, often sponsored by the royal family, also provide services for 
victims of violence. A few of these organizations have gone beyond the traditional model of 
charity, and offer more empowering programmes for women such as microcredit programmes, 
and literacy or professional training courses. They also conduct awareness-raising campaigns on 
family violence and liaise with relevant authorities to solve individual cases, including by 
supporting women in bringing their case to court. 
</p>
<p>73. Women&#8217;s access to justice should benefit from the judicial reforms announced in 2007 in 
Royal Decree No. M/78. These include the promulgation of new Statutes for the Judiciary and 
the Board of Grievances, and foresee, among other things, the establishment of personal status 
courts to deal with family issues.<b> </b>Furthermore, Royal Decree No. M/8382 (2008) approved a 
programme to implement the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women to establish specialized women&#8217;s departments in courts and 
notaries (which would include women supervisors), and to effectively respond to women&#8217;s 
complaints.<b>47</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>46
</b>  Some committees, such as in Jeddah, have a more comprehensive approach and extend 
</p>
<p>support for those women who wish to file a complaint.

</p>
<p><b>C.  Legislative and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Legal ambiguities and the administration of justice 
</b>74. The Saudi legal and judicial system is based on sharia law and its commentaries, and is 
mostly unwritten. In particular, there is no written law governing cases pertaining to personal 
and family issues, and there is no codified penal code. There is also no provision or code 
criminalizing violence against women, though laws have been developed on child abuse and 
domestic violence, both of which, I was informed, were recently submitted to the highest 
authority for approval. 
</p>
<p>75. The non-codification of laws leaves the interpretation and application of sharia to the 
competency of the courts and to a Council of Senior Religious Scholars, appointed by the King. 
In accordance with the Law of the Judiciary, judges are expected to be fully versed in Islamic 
law and jurisprudence (<i>Fikh</i>) and must hold a degree from a sharia college. There is an overall 
consensus that judges have significant discretionary power in adjudicating cases. Sentences can 
thus differ from court to court or even case to case. Reportedly, judges apply guidelines drawn 
from customs and traditions such as those practised by tribes in pre-Islamic periods, which often 
do not comply with obligations contained in the sharia or in international instruments ratified by 
Saudi Arabia. The forcible divorce of women such as Fatima Al-Timani<b>48</b> is a case in point. 
</p>
<p>76. The lack of legal clarity and the discretionary powers of judges are particularly 
problematic for the rights of women to a fair trial. There are reports of women being prevented 
from appearing or being heard in court, and evidentiary standards are said to discriminate against 
women, whose testimony is valued at half that of men&#8217;s, according to Islamic law. In view of 
these standards and the fact that women are not granted equal rights with respect to family 
matters, it is particularly difficult for women - and even more so for female foreign migrants - to 
prove domestic violence, rape or sexual assault.<b>49</b> 
</p>
<p>77. The Statues of the Judiciary of 1975<b>50</b> were not in compliance with the principles of 
independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers and failed to ensure consistency with 
respect to the review and monitoring of judicial practices and judgements.<b>51</b> The new Statutes of 
the Judiciary of 2007 transfer a number of functions previously entrusted to the Ministry of 
Justice to the Supreme Council of the Judiciary, which is now tasked to &#8220;review judgements and 
express an opinion on their jurisprudential substantiating grounds from the standpoint of ... their 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>48
</b>  See above, chap. III. A. 
</p>
<p><b>49
</b>  According to sharia, the accused must confess or four adult men must confirm fornication has 
</p>
<p>occurred. 
<b>50
</b></p>
<p>  According to the Law of the Judiciary (art. 71), Royal Decree No. M/64, &#8220;without prejudice to 
the impartiality of the judiciary and its independence in administering justice, the Minister of 
Justice shall have the right to supervise all courts and judges&#8221;. 
<b>51
</b></p>
<p>  Ibid., arts. 8 and 89. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/6/Add.3 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>compatibility with the aim of ensuring justice in light of changing conditions and 
circumstances&#8221;.<b>52</b> It is indeed crucial to ensure that the Supreme Court examines and controls 
judicial practices and principles, with a view to ensuring fairness and consistency in all matters 
related to the judiciary, including judicial judgements. I was also assured that a research centre is 
to be established within the Ministry of Justice, which will be staffed with specialists who will 
publish selected judicial judgements, after approval of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary.<b>53</b> 
78. Officials indicated that the trend was to codify judicial practices into law and rely less and 
less on outdated jurisprudence. Increased codification is welcomed, as new crimes and social 
problems require specific legal responses. A council of experts, tasked by the Council of 
Ministers with drafting laws, is currently working on codifying criminal provisions, though the 
expected time frame for this endeavour is unclear.<b>54</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Divorce and child custody 
</b></p>
<p>79. Judicial practices pertaining to divorce and child custody also impact on women&#8217;s ability 
to escape abusive marriages. According to the State report to the Committee on the Elimination 
of Discrimination against Women,<b>55</b> the law gives a woman the right to apply for separation &#8220;on 
grounds of hurt&#8221;, the unjustified absence of the husband, his imprisonment or his &#8220;refusal to 
support her adequately&#8221;. In practice, procedures for women to obtain a divorce are lengthy and 
may not bring a resolution, since women must thoroughly demonstrate grounds for divorce. A 
woman may also buy her way out of a marriage, if she can afford it. 
</p>
<p>80. By contrast, men are entitled to divorce without having to demonstrate particular grounds 
for a divorce. There is growing concern over increasing divorce rates - mostly decided by men. 
According to the Ministry of Social Affairs, the divorce rate in early 2008 was 30 per cent, 
although NGO and media reports indicate that it could be as high as 60 per cent. 
</p>
<p>81. Divorce on grounds of domestic violence is also difficult to obtain as judges are said to 
demand levels of evidence which are difficult, if not impossible, for women to provide.<b>56</b> In case 
of divorce, a Saudi woman may keep her children until they reach the age of 7 for girls and 9 for 
boys. Custody of children over these ages is generally awarded to the father or, if he is deceased, 
to his family. In rare cases where women may be granted physical custody, fathers retain legal 
custody. This means, for instance, that all transactions on behalf of the children require the 
father&#8217;s consent. Foreign women married to Saudi nationals also encounter significant 
discrimination in custody and divorce matters.

</p>
<p><b>3.  Protective framework for migrant domestic workers 
</b></p>
<p>82. Saudi Labour Law excludes foreign domestic workers (art. 7 (2)). They thus lack the legal 
protections guaranteed to other workers such as overtime pay or limits on working hours. 
Protective mechanisms and resources for domestic workers are generally weak and abuse against 
them is rarely reported. Penalties for forced labour under the Labour Law are limited to fines or 
bans on future hiring and, as such, are not a sufficient deterrent. More recently, the Government 
indicated that &#8220;the bill of law regulating the employment of domestic servants and the like&#8221; has 
been submitted by the Ministry of Labour to the Council of Ministers for review before 
adoption,<b>57</b> but at the time of finalizing this report, the bill had not been adopted. 
</p>
<p>83. Domestic workers who try to obtain redress face, in many instances, the threat of 
countercharges such as, adultery or other moral &#8220;misconduct&#8221;, theft, and sanctions for having left 
their employers, thereby violating immigration and contractual regulations.<b>58</b> Bringing a case to 
court may actually be counterproductive, especially in cases of sexual assault, which rarely result 
in convictions. Lengthy trials also deter migrants from bringing cases to court, as they cannot 
afford to wait in Saudi Arabia without work for very long. Migrants are thus generally advised 
by their embassies to settle for compensation rather than bringing a case to court. However, 
negotiations between employers and workers often result in unfair settlements for the latter. 
</p>
<p>84. The Ministry for Social Affairs operates a centre in Riyadh for domestic workers who 
require exit visas, identity documents, or who are in dispute with their employers. According to 
some sources, the shelter is overcrowded (typically housing 1,000 to 1,500 workers) and cannot 
cope with the demand. Domestic workers often wait for months without any news about their 
case. 
</p>
<p>85. Since July 2004, the Labour Ministry has had a Migrant Workers&#8217; Welfare Department.<b>59</b> 
It also manages over 30 labour offices throughout the Kingdom, whose tasks, according to the 
Labour Law, are to consider and settle labour disputes between employer and employee, and 
refer cases to labour commissions for the settlement of disputes. While the State&#8217;s report to the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review<b>60</b> affirms that domestic workers can apply to 
these commissions for redress, other sources note that, given the exclusion of domestic workers 
in the Labour Law, these workers cannot in practice benefit from the help of those offices and 
are instead systematically referred to the Ministry of Social Affairs.

</p>
<p>86. Some embassies manage their own safe houses for their runaway nationals, which are often 
of poor quality and overcrowded. One embassy that I visited received 15 runaway maids per day, 
making it difficult for the few embassy staff to handle the volume of complaints. They have few 
resources to support the legal and administrative actions that migrant workers might wish to 
undertake. They are also not equipped to help maids in other parts of the country besides Riyadh 
and Jeddah, where embassies and consulates do not exist. 
</p>
<p>87. Most labour-sending countries have not signed bilateral agreements with Saudi Arabia to 
regulate working conditions of domestic workers and mechanisms for redress. As a result, 
embassies generally use diplomatic means to negotiate the payment of salary or secure the 
release of a migrant from prison. Problematically, those labour-exporting countries are 
dependent on migrant remittances, which may make them hesitant to pursue better conditions for 
their nationals working in Saudi Arabia, for fear that quotas on their nationals will be reduced. 
&#8220;Our hands are tied&#8221;, as one embassy staff told me. 
</p>
<p>88. While I was told that no hospital or social protection committee would turn away a foreign 
worker asking for help, there are reports of migrants being refused access, and lacking basic 
information on these services. Moreover, according to embassy sources, since migrant&#8217;s health 
care is under the responsibility of his/her sponsor, they will have to pay for the health care if they 
are unaccompanied. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Absence of a women&#8217;s national machinery 
</b></p>
<p>89. No institution oversees and addresses issues pertaining to women and gender equality 
specifically. According to the State reports to CEDAW and UPR, Cabinet Decree 63 of 2003 
approved the creation of a Higher National Committee for Women&#8217;s Affairs. At the time of my 
visit, no such Committee existed, and no information to this effect has been received since then. 
</p>
<p>90. A national institution overseeing women&#8217;s issues could help coordinate the work of various 
bodies currently in charge of prevention of violence against women and protection of victims, 
including the implementation of the law on domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>91. A women&#8217;s machinery could also play an important role in the coordination and collection 
of data on violence against women, which is currently lacking. The Ministry of the Interior did 
not have any data disaggregated by sex, victim, perpetrator or type of abuse. The Ministry of 
Social Affairs has apparently started gathering statistics on reported cases of domestic violence 
(the first statistics were gathered for the year 2005-2006).<b>61</b> However, this information is neither 
collected nor recorded at a central level. 
</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The voices, aspirations and demands of Saudi women are as diverse and multiple as 
are their life experiences. Among the Saudi women I met, some have expressed 
contentment and satisfaction with their lives. Others have raised concerns of serious levels 
</b></p>

</p>
<p><b>of discriminatory practices against women that compromise their rights and dignity as 
human beings and undermine the true values of their society. And still others shared with 
me the discrimination and abuse they encountered, with few prospects for redress. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>This diversity is reflective of the prevailing constraints and opportunities available to 
women. In past years there have been significant developments in women&#8217;s status, notably 
in the area of education. Yet, women&#8217;s participation in the labour force in both the public 
and private sectors is lagging, although the latter seems to offer greater prospects for 
employment and self-actualization in the long term. Women&#8217;s role in decision-making 
positions is limited. The guardianship system and a policy of strict sex segregation are 
major factors preventing a greater participation of women in society and public life. 
</b>94. <b>Women&#8217;s lack of autonomy and economic independence, practices surrounding 
divorce and child custody, the absence of a law criminalizing violence against women, and 
inconsistencies in law enforcement and the administration of justice continue to prevent 
many women from escaping abusive environments. In this regard, the lack of written laws 
governing private life and discretionary court rulings constitute a major obstacle to 
women&#8217;s access to justice. Much remains to be done to ensure that women develop their 
full capacity, become equal partners in the betterment of their society, and that all women, 
including domestic migrant workers, enjoy a life free of abuse and discrimination. 
</b>95. <b>I would like to address the following recommendations in several areas to the 
Government of Saudi Arabia: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Women&#8217;s empowerment and public sphere participation: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Incorporate in law the principle of equality between women and men, and a 
definition of discrimination based on sex. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Establish an independent national machinery for the advancement of women, 
including with prerogatives to intervene in cases of violence against women. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Take measures, including through awareness-raising campaigns, to end the 
practice of guardianship and abolish existing legal provisions that require a 
guardian&#8217;s authorization, such as those pertaining to women&#8217;s travel or access to 
services or employment. Ensure public and private institutions, including health 
services, private businesses and the travel industry, are notified of the changes and 
monitor their actions in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Facilitate the procedure for women to obtain an identity card and raise awareness 
in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Establish the facilities and mechanisms for women&#8217;s equal participation in all 
public and private institutions, including law practices and the judiciary. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Take the necessary measures to enable women to exercise their right to vote and to 
stand for election in future elections. </b></p>
