<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 13 June 2013, the Human Rights Council adopted its resolution 23/9, in which it 
</p>
<p>requested the Advisory Committee to submit a research-based report to the Council, at its 
</p>
<p>twenty-sixth session being held in June 2014, on the issue of the negative impact of 
</p>
<p>corruption on the enjoyment of human rights, and to make recommendations on how the 
</p>
<p>Council and its subsidiary bodies should consider this issue. 
</p>
<p>2. During its eleventh session, on 16 August 2013, the Advisory Committee 
</p>
<p>established a drafting group for the present report, composed of Saeed Mohamed 
</p>
<p>Al Faihani, Laurence Boisson de Chazournes, Mario Luis Coriolano, Latif H&#252;seynov, 
</p>
<p>Alfred Ntunduguru Karokora, Obiora Chinedu Okafor, Katharina Pabel (Rapporteur), 
</p>
<p>Anantonia Reyes Prado, Dheerujlall Seetulsingh, Ahmer Bilal Soofi and Imeru Tamrat 
</p>
<p>Yigezu (Chair). 
</p>
<p>3. At the same session of the Advisory Committee, the drafting group developed a 
</p>
<p>questionnaire, in accordance with Council resolution 23/9, which was sent to different 
</p>
<p>stakeholders and had a deadline of 31 October 2013, which was later extended to 
</p>
<p>14 November 2013. A total of 73 responses were received: 37 from States, 16 from national 
</p>
<p>human rights institutions, 14 from non-governmental or civil society organizations, and six 
</p>
<p>from international or regional organizations or academic institutions. 
</p>
<p>4. During its twelfth session, which was held in February 2014, the Advisory 
</p>
<p>Committee and the drafting group discussed, both in public and in private, the &#8220;Preliminary 
</p>
<p>research-based report on the negative impact of corruption on the enjoyment of human 
</p>
<p>rights&#8221; (A/HRC/AC/12/CRP.3), which had been prepared in the intersessional period. 
</p>
<p>Further discussions were held during the thirteenth session of the Committee, in August 
</p>
<p>2014, on the basis of which the preliminary report was further elaborated. 
</p>
<p><b>II. What is corruption? 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Definition of corruption 
</b></p>
<p>5. To this day, there is no single, consistent and recognized definition of corruption, at 
</p>
<p>the international level. Remarkably, even the United Nations Convention against 
</p>
<p>Corruption1 does not provide a definition of corruption, even though the purpose of that 
</p>
<p>Convention is specifically to promote and strengthen measures to prevent and combat 
</p>
<p>corruption more efficiently and effectively, and to promote and support international 
</p>
<p>cooperation in the prevention of and fight against corruption.2 A common approach to the 
</p>
<p>notion of corruption is the definition proposed by Transparency International. According to 
</p>
<p>that definition, corruption is &#8220;the abuse of entrusted power for private gain&#8221;.3 This, 
</p>
<p>however, is a rather broad definition which encompasses a wide range of different 
</p>
<p>behaviours. In contrast to the provisions typically included in criminal law, which 
</p>
<p>determine specific offences, the above-mentioned definition is more open. At the same 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 The United Nations Convention against Corruption entered into force in 2005. Available from 
</p>
<p>http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNCAC/Publications/Convention/08-50026_E.pdf. 
</p>
<p> 2 See art. 1 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption. 
</p>
<p> 3 Transparency International is a non-governmental organization that works internationally to promote 
</p>
<p>&#8220;a world in which government, politics, business, civil society and the daily lives of people are free of 
</p>
<p>corruption&#8221;. See http://www.transparency.org/whatwedo. </p>


<p>time, a definition based on the three specific elements of &#8220;abuse&#8221;, &#8220;entrusted power&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;for private gain&#8221; may exclude some conducts that should also be characterized as 
</p>
<p>corruption. For example, the use (or abuse) of illegally claimed power can lead to 
</p>
<p>corruption. This rather broad definition can, therefore, nevertheless be too narrow in respect 
</p>
<p>of specific forms of misbehaviour that should also be regarded as corruption. 
</p>
<p>6. For the purposes of the present report, it is not absolutely necessary to develop a 
</p>
<p>clear-cut definition of corruption. In order to analyse the link between corruption and 
</p>
<p>impairment of the enjoyment of human rights, the result and impact of the conduct should 
</p>
<p>constitute the focus of interest. Moreover, the development of a definition of corruption was 
</p>
<p>not part of the Human Rights Council&#8217;s request to the Advisory Committee to prepare a 
</p>
<p>report on the negative impact of corruption on the enjoyment of human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Different categories of corruption 
</b></p>
<p>7. Even though there is no generally agreed definition of corruption, different forms of 
</p>
<p>corruption have been recognized. When looking at corruption from a human rights 
</p>
<p>perspective, it is interesting to differentiate between corruption by the State (corruption in 
</p>
<p>the public sector) and corruption by non-State entities (corruption in the private sector).4 
</p>
<p>Corruption in the public sector can occur in government, in administration, in the 
</p>
<p>legislature and in the judiciary.5 In those contexts, the State is clearly accountable for any 
</p>
<p>violation of human rights resulting from the conduct of persons acting in their public 
</p>
<p>capacity. 
</p>
<p>8. Non-State actors play a crucial role in the proliferation of corruption in many 
</p>
<p>countries. Companies can engage in acts of corruption by bribing State actors or other non-
</p>
<p>State actors (commercial bribery) or by receiving bribes. The non-State actors themselves 
</p>
<p>are responsible for any act of corruption that they are involved in. They are bound by 
</p>
<p>criminal and civil law and must bear all legal consequences. A number of private sector 
</p>
<p>organizations and initiatives exist that are dedicated to the fight against corruption in 
</p>
<p>business. Among these, the United Nations Global Compact6 is an important initiative that 
</p>
<p>provides a principle-based framework for businesses in order to tackle corruption.7 
</p>
<p>9. The State has a duty to protect against any adverse human rights impacts arising 
</p>
<p>from acts of corruption by non-State actors, including corruption by the private sector. The 
</p>
<p>duty of States to protect against human rights abuses by third parties obliges States to take 
</p>
<p>effective regulatory or other measures to prevent such acts by third parties, to investigate 
</p>
<p>violations that occur, to prosecute the perpetrators as appropriate, and to provide redress for 
</p>
<p>victims. Examples of efforts that have been undertaken in that regard include measures to 
</p>
<p>ensure transparency and equality in public procurement, such as public procurement 
</p>
<p>schemes in different countries, or, at the international level, the World Trade Organization 
</p>
<p>agreement on government procurement.8 Furthermore, strategies to repatriate funds of illicit 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>2009), p. 4 et seq.

</p>

<p> </p>


<p>origin can be another measure to counter the negative impact of corruption on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights, as such funds can be generated by corruption (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/25/52). 
</p>
<p>10. Corruption not only occurs at the national level, but at the international level too, 
</p>
<p>notably in international organizations, including international non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, and in transnational corporations. In the case of international organizations, 
</p>
<p>each organization is responsible for its conduct and, especially, for any resulting violation 
</p>
<p>of human rights. It is more difficult to establish the responsibility of specific States for 
</p>
<p>corruption occurring within transnational corporations. On the one hand, each State is 
</p>
<p>responsible for fulfilling its human rights obligations, and therefore must fight corruption 
</p>
<p>committed by transnational corporations operating on its territory. On the other hand, it is 
</p>
<p>quite clear that in order to fight corruption in transnational corporations adequately and 
</p>
<p>effectively, there is a need for transnational and international efforts. The Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations &#8220;Protect, 
</p>
<p>Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework,9 which constitute an authoritative global framework for 
</p>
<p>managing risks to human rights arising from business activities, does not explicitly draw a 
</p>
<p>link between business, human rights and corruption. Rather, the Guiding Principles imply 
</p>
<p>that States have duties to ensure that corruption does not interfere with their obligations to 
</p>
<p>protect against corporate-related human rights abuses. For their part, business enterprises 
</p>
<p>have a responsibility to refrain from involvement in any corrupt activity that may impinge 
</p>
<p>on the enjoyment of human rights. Consequently, the human rights&#8211;based approach to 
</p>
<p>countering corruption established in the present report can help to fight corruption in 
</p>
<p>national businesses and transnational enterprises. 
</p>
<p><b> III. In what respect does corruption have a negative impact on 
the enjoyment of human rights? 
</b></p>
<p>11. A link between human rights and corruption can be established in two different 
</p>
<p>ways: 
</p>
<p>(a) A violation of human rights may occur as a result of a corrupt act; 
</p>
<p>(b) Anti-corruption measures could violate human rights.  
</p>
<p>12. Although it is important not to forget the second aspect (the violation of human 
</p>
<p>rights through anti-corruption measures), especially if instruments of criminal prosecution 
</p>
<p>are applied in combating corruption, the present report, in line with the request of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council, focuses on the first of the above-mentioned aspects of corruption. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>Available at http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/rev-gpr-94_01_e.pdf (accessed 15 October 
</p>
<p>2014). 
</p>
<p> 9 The Guiding Principles were developed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the 
</p>
<p>issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises (see the annex to 
</p>
<p>the Special Representative&#8217;s final report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/17/31)) and were 
</p>
<p>endorsed by the Council in its resolution 17/4 of 16 June 2011. </p>


<p>13. As a result of developments over the past years, it has been established that there is a 
</p>
<p>clear linkage between the negative impact of corruption and impairment of the enjoyment 
</p>
<p>of human rights. For example, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights (OHCHR) stated in November 2013: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;In recent years, United Nations and regional organizations have increasingly 
</p>
<p>recognized the negative impacts of corruption on the enjoyment of human rights.&#8221;10 
</p>
<p>14. An important step in that direction was the United Nations conference on anti-
</p>
<p>corruption measures, good governance and human rights, which was organized pursuant to 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/68 and was held in Warsaw on 8 and 
</p>
<p>9 November 2006 (see A/HRC/4/71). One session at that conference highlighted the 
</p>
<p>adverse effect of corruption on human rights and aimed to identify the role of anti-
</p>
<p>corruption measures in protecting human rights and creating an environment conducive to 
</p>
<p>the promotion of those rights. 
</p>
<p>15. Earlier, in its resolution 2003/2 of 13 August 2003, the Sub-Commission on the 
</p>
<p>Promotion and Protection of Human Rights had established a mandate for a special 
</p>
<p>rapporteur on corruption and its impact on the full enjoyment of human rights, in particular 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights. That mandate was subsequently endorsed by the 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights in its decision 2004/106. The Sub-Commission appointed 
</p>
<p>Christy Mbonu as the Special Rapporteur, who was tasked with preparing a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>study on corruption and its impact on the full enjoyment of human rights, in particular 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights, based on her working paper (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2003/18) 
</p>
<p>and the opinions expressed during the debate on the issue at the fifty-fifth session of the 
</p>
<p>Sub-Commission. Also in resolution 2003/2, the Sub-Commission requested the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur to submit a preliminary report to the Sub-Commission at its fifty-sixth session, 
</p>
<p>a progress report at its fifty-seventh session and a final report at its fifty-eighth session. 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur endeavoured to establish in the working paper 
</p>
<p>(E/CN.4/Sub.2/2003/18), the preliminary report (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2004/23) and the first and 
</p>
<p>second progress reports (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2005/18 and A/HRC/11/CRP.1) that the enjoyment 
</p>
<p>of both sets of rights, be they economic, social and cultural, or civil and political, were 
</p>
<p>seriously undermined by the phenomenon of corruption. She pointed out in what respect 
</p>
<p>human rights were affected by corruption. The conclusions and recommendations of the 
</p>
<p>first progress report were endorsed by the Sub-Commission in its resolution 2005/16. 
</p>
<p>17. As corruption manifests itself in many ways and occurs in a multitude of contexts, it 
</p>
<p>is nearly impossible to identify all of the human rights that can be violated by corruption. 
</p>
<p>To give some examples: if there is corruption in the education sector, the right to education 
</p>
<p>can be violated. If there is corruption in the judiciary, the right of access to courts and the 
</p>
<p>right to a fair trial can be violated. If there is corruption in the health sector or the social 
</p>
<p>welfare sector, the right to access to medical service or the right to food can be violated 
</p>
<p>(among others). Moreover, the principle of non-discrimination can be affected if a person 
</p>
<p>has to bribe someone in order to get favourable treatment or access to a public service. It is 
</p>
<p>difficult to find a human right that could not be violated by corruption. 
</p>
<p>18. This view is supported by many of the responses to the questionnaire, by different 
</p>
<p>stakeholders. The responses make it clear that corruption has a negative impact on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights. They mention a wide range of human rights that can be 
</p>
<p>violated by corruption. These include economic and social rights, such as the right to work, 
</p>
<p>the right to food, the right to housing, the right to health, the right to education, and the 
</p>
<p>right to public services; the right to development; the principle of non-discrimination; and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 10 OHCHR, <i>The Human Rights Case Against Corruption</i> (Geneva, 2013), p. 4. </p>


<p>civil and political rights, such as the right to a fair trial and the right to public participation. 
</p>
<p>This overview illustrates the above-mentioned thesis that nearly every human right can be 
</p>
<p>affected by corruption; this point is highlighted in the submission by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>19. Judicial corruption is a very concrete example that illustrates the negative impact of 
</p>
<p>corruption on the enjoyment of human rights. While corruption in all areas threatens the 
</p>
<p>rule of law, democracy, and human rights, in the case of judicial corruption the right of 
</p>
<p>access to the court and the right to a fair trial by an independent, impartial and competent 
</p>
<p>tribunal is directly affected.11 
</p>
<p>20. As States have different kinds of obligations resulting from their human rights 
</p>
<p>commitments, it is useful to classify the possible violations of human rights caused by 
</p>
<p>corruption according to the different obligations imposed on States: 
</p>
<p>(a) Firstly, corruption can affect individuals (individual negative impact). As has 
</p>
<p>been shown before, there is often a direct violation of the human rights of the individual 
</p>
<p>who is affected by corruption. Depending on the context in which corruption occurs, a wide 
</p>
<p>range of different human rights can be violated. Corruption frequently results in 
</p>
<p>discriminatory access to public services.12 The impact on an individual can also be the 
</p>
<p>result of an indirect effect from corruption. For example, if public authorities illegally allow 
</p>
<p>the deforestation of land in return for a bribe, the right to food, the right to housing and the 
</p>
<p>right to health of the people living in the area concerned may be violated; 
</p>
<p>(b) Secondly, corruption can affect specific, identifiable groups of individuals 
</p>
<p>(collective negative impact). This category includes the effects of corruption that not only 
</p>
<p>affect individuals but also impact upon groups of individuals. For example, corruption can 
</p>
<p>exclude the poor from access to goods and services offered by the administration, or from 
</p>
<p>access to justice. Or, coming back to the example given above, illegal deforestation may 
</p>
<p>affect specific ethnic minorities or indigenous peoples living in the areas concerned. It can 
</p>
<p>be concluded that vulnerable groups such as women, children, persons with disabilities, the 
</p>
<p>elderly, the poor, indigenous people or people belonging to minorities are particularly 
</p>
<p>affected by corruption. This is especially true in relation to access to public services and 
</p>
<p>welfare, which is often of tremendous importance for people belonging to the above-
</p>
<p>mentioned groups. In her opening statement made on 13 March 2013 at the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council&#8217;s panel discussion on the negative impact of corruption on the enjoyment of human 
</p>
<p>rights, the former High Commissioner for Human Rights referred, as an example of the 
</p>
<p>negative impact of corruption on the enjoyment of human rights, to vulnerable groups&#8217; 
</p>
<p>access to justice being undermined.13 Sometimes, corruption is only one element of a 
</p>
<p>human rights violation or one factor aggravating an already existing human rights violation 
</p>
<p>concerning specific groups. For example, if the right to education of certain vulnerable 
</p>
<p>groups is already violated as a result of discriminatory access requirements, the demand by 
</p>
<p>an official for payment of a bribe compounds the human rights violation. Another example 
</p>
<p>is persons deprived of their liberty, who can be victims of corruption, and at the same time, 
</p>
<p>of inhuman or degrading treatment;14

</p>
<p>Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, CAT/C/52/2, para. 83 et seq. </p>


<p>(c) Thirdly, corruption can concern society at large (general negative impact). 
</p>
<p>This means that, in addition to the effect that corruption has on individuals or groups, there 
</p>
<p>is also a negative impact upon society at large, whether this is in a national or an 
</p>
<p>international sense. There are two main aspects that are frequently mentioned in discussions 
</p>
<p>of the negative impact of corruption on human rights.15 The first aspect relates to the 
</p>
<p>financial and economic resources that are affected by corruption. Corrupt practices divert 
</p>
<p>funds from development and therefore imply a reallocation of funds that may interfere with 
</p>
<p>the effective enforcement of human rights, especially for vulnerable people. Corruption 
</p>
<p>reduces the resources available for the progressive realization of economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights (and therefore undermines States&#8217; obligations under article 2 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights). The second aspect relates 
</p>
<p>to the realization of democracy and to implementation of the rule of law. If the authorities 
</p>
<p>of a State are pervaded by corruption, the people&#8217;s confidence in the government, and 
</p>
<p>eventually in the democratic order and the rule of law, is undermined. 
</p>
<p>21. For the purposes of the present report, it is of minor importance whether a single act 
</p>
<p>of corruption leads to a violation of human rights in a strictly judicial sense. The meaning 
</p>
<p>of the term &#8220;negative impact on human rights&#8221; is much broader than &#8220;violation of human 
</p>
<p>rights&#8221;. While a court dealing with possible violations of human rights has to consider 
</p>
<p>whether a specific human right has been violated, measures against corruption can take into 
</p>
<p>account different types of negative impact from corruption. 
</p>
<p>22. Corruption has a negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights of all those 
</p>
<p>affected by it. But its negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights by vulnerable 
</p>
<p>persons is compounded. Persons belonging to minorities, indigenous peoples, migrant 
</p>
<p>workers, persons with disabilities, refugees, prisoners, women, children and those living in 
</p>
<p>poverty are often the first to suffer from the impact of corruption.16 This underscores the 
</p>
<p>obligation of every State to protect the human rights of people belonging to those groups in 
</p>
<p>order to prevent any human rights violation caused by corruption. 
</p>
<p>23. Another approach to classifying types of corruption is to differentiate between active 
</p>
<p>and passive corruption. This distinction is discussed, for example, in the commentaries on 
</p>
<p>the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business 
</p>
<p>Transactions, which is sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
</p>
<p>Development (OECD).17 Active corruption means spending money or providing other 
</p>
<p>benefits to achieve undue advantages, whereas passive corruption refers to the receipt of 
</p>
<p>money or other benefits as an undue advantage. The distinction between offering bribes and 
</p>
<p>taking bribes is very clear. Nevertheless, it is doubtful whether this distinction is helpful 
</p>
<p>from a human rights perspective. The focus of the present report is on the negative impact 
</p>
<p>of corruption on the enjoyment of human rights, and therefore it has a victim-oriented 
</p>
<p>approach. In cases of corruption, it can be difficult to determine whether the victim has 
</p>
<p>taken part in the corrupt act actively or passively. It is even possible that the victim has 
</p>
<p>stood outside the corrupt agreements. For example, where people are forced to pay for 
</p>
<p>access to public services, those who pay bribes are active in corruption but they are also 
</p>
<p>victims. For that reason, the OECD anti-bribery convention does not use the term &#8220;active 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 15 These aspects are also discussed in the OHCHR submission to the questionnaire.

<p>bribery&#8221;, in order to avoid it being misunderstood as implying that the briber has taken the 
</p>
<p>initiative and the recipient is a passive victim. It is more useful to determine which party is 
</p>
<p>the victim in a corrupt setting. In many cases, this can be determined by examining the 
</p>
<p>distribution of power between the parties to the corrupt agreement. Typically, the less 
</p>
<p>powerful or even oppressed party will be the victim. This is reflected in the distinction 
</p>
<p>between &#8220;petty corruption&#8221;, which takes the form of a low-ranking public official taking a 
</p>
<p>bribe for doing something that is already required by law or for not doing something that is 
</p>
<p>prohibited by law, and &#8220;grand corruption&#8221;, which is carried out by high-level officials who 
</p>
<p>seek payment for exercising their discretionary powers.18 
</p>
<p><b> IV. What is the value in linking corruption with its negative 
impact on the enjoyment of human rights? 
</b></p>
<p>24. Corruption is mainly dealt with from a criminal perspective.19 Anti-corruption 
</p>
<p>measures &#8212; in the national and the international contexts &#8212; primarily concentrate on 
</p>
<p>prosecution of the related criminal offences. International anti-corruption treaties encourage 
</p>
<p>or even oblige States parties to take steps within their legal order to criminalize certain 
</p>
<p>kinds of behaviour defined as corruption. However, discussing the negative impact of 
</p>
<p>corruption on the enjoyment of human rights should not be seen as jeopardizing any effort 
</p>
<p>to combat corruption by means of the criminal law. Corruption is a crime. Impunity in cases 
</p>
<p>of corruption must end. In that sense, a human rights perspective to combating corruption 
</p>
<p>and its effects is complementary to the criminal law approach. 
</p>
<p>25. However, the United Nations Convention against Corruption and regional 
</p>
<p>conventions against corruption include preventive measures (e.g. accountability, 
</p>
<p>transparency, and access to public information) that States parties are obliged to take. 
</p>
<p>Without disregarding those efforts, anti-corruption measures are focused mainly on the 
</p>
<p>consideration of criminal offences, the necessary sanctions, and international cooperation in 
</p>
<p>prosecution. The situating of anti-corruption measures within the criminal law narrows the 
</p>
<p>focus to the perpetrators. The purpose of criminal proceedings is &#8212; broadly speaking &#8212; to 
</p>
<p>determine the person responsible for the offence. Focusing criminal proceedings on the 
</p>
<p>perpetrator can lead to a loss of focus on the victim of the corruption. The position of those 
</p>
<p>affected by corruption is not very strong in criminal proceedings. Furthermore, the criminal 
</p>
<p>approach does not offer ways of addressing the structural problems caused by corruption. It 
</p>
<p>is concentrated, by its very nature, on a single offence, and typically cannot address the 
</p>
<p>collective and general effects of corruption referred to in the present report. 
</p>
<p>26. Corruption can also be combated by applying remedies from private law. This 
</p>
<p>approach is quite common among States. In international law, the Civil Law Convention on 
</p>
<p>Corruption, which was adopted by the Council of Europe in 1999,20 deals, inter alia, with 
</p>
<p>compensation for damage, liability, the validity of contracts and the protection of 
</p>
<p>employees, and therefore focuses on the consequences of corruption in private law. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the United Nations Convention against Corruption21 requires each State party 
</p>
<p>to take measures to address consequences of corruption, for example considering corruption 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 18 See, for example, the statement by Nihal Jayawickrama in the report on the United Nations 
</p>
<p>conference on anti-corruption, good governance and human rights, A/HRC/4/71, p. 8. 
</p>

</p>
<p>the <i>Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law</i>, Armin von Bogdandy and R&#252;diger Wolfrum, eds., 
</p>
<p>vol. 17, pp. 197&#8211;219 (200) (Brill and Nijhoff, 2013). 
</p>
<p> 20 Civil Law Convention against Corruption, ETS No. 174.  
</p>
<p> 21 Adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 58/4 of 31 October 2003. </p>


<p>a relevant factor in legal proceedings to annul or rescind a contract, or to withdraw a 
</p>
<p>concession (article 34). Article 35 obliges States parties to take measures to ensure that 
</p>
<p>entities or persons who have suffered damage as a result of an act of corruption have the 
</p>
<p>right to initiate legal proceedings against those responsible for that damage in order to 
</p>
<p>obtain compensation. One distinction between the criminal law approach and the private 
</p>
<p>law approach in the fight against corruption is that the latter addresses the impact of 
</p>
<p>corruption on the person concerned and aims to provide redress in the form of 
</p>
<p>compensation. 
</p>
<p>27. A human rights perspective on the impact of corruption can add an approach that 
</p>
<p>moves the victims to the centre of the fight against corruption. It does so by highlighting the 
</p>
<p>negative impacts that corruption brings to the individual concerned, to groups of individuals 
</p>
<p>typically affected by corruption (which are very often marginalized groups), and to society 
</p>
<p>at large. Analysing the link between corruption and impairment of the enjoyment of human 
</p>
<p>rights may contribute to a better understanding of the effects of corruption &#8212; notably, its 
</p>
<p>human dimension and social implications &#8212; and can be an important step towards making 
</p>
<p>corruption a public issue. In that way, the social impact of corruption is made visible; this 
</p>
<p>generates awareness in society about the consequences of this scourge and creates new 
</p>
<p>alliances in the fight against corruption. 
</p>
<p>28. Moreover, applying a human rights perspective to acts of corruption by State and 
</p>
<p>non-State actors reveals that the State bears the ultimate responsibility for such acts. This 
</p>
<p>responsibility means that the State must abstain from engaging in any form of corruption in 
</p>
<p>order to avoid violating human rights. Moreover, the State is responsible for reacting to the 
</p>
<p>negative impact of corruption in order to fulfil its human rights obligations, and in that 
</p>
<p>connection, criminal prosecution is one of the instruments for combating corruption. 
</p>
<p>Criminal prosecution is not, however, an effective tool for remedying the negative 
</p>
<p>consequences of corruption for the individual, for specific groups or for society in general, 
</p>
<p>while from a human rights perspective, States are required not only to prosecute such 
</p>
<p>crimes, but also to take measures to address the negative impact of corruption. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>by looking at corruption from a human rights perspective, the need for preventive measures 
</p>
<p>becomes even more apparent. By integrating a human rights perspective into anti-
</p>
<p>corruption strategies, the implementation of preventive policies relating to matters such as 
</p>
<p>transparency, affidavits, laws on access to public information, and external controls, 
</p>
<p>becomes an obligation. 
</p>
<p>29. Corruption can lead to a human rights violation directly or indirectly. Corruption 
</p>
<p>may directly constitute a violation of a human right when a corrupt act is deliberately used 
</p>
<p>as a means to violate a right, or when a State acts in a way that prevents individuals from 
</p>
<p>enjoying that right or fails to act in a way that ensures that individuals can enjoy that right. 
</p>
<p>In other situations, corruption is an essential factor contributing to a chain of events that 
</p>
<p>eventually leads to the violation of a human right. In such a case, the right is violated by an 
</p>
<p>act that derives from a corrupt act and the act of corruption is a necessary condition for the 
</p>
<p>violation. Such a situation will arise, for example, if public officials allow the illegal 
</p>
<p>importation of toxic waste from other countries in return for a bribe, and that waste is 
</p>
<p>placed in, or close to, a residential area. The rights to life and health of residents of that area 
</p>
<p>would be violated, with the violation caused indirectly as a result of the bribery. Another 
</p>
<p>example is the situation of prisoners who are forced to bribe prison guards in order to avoid 
</p>
<p>ill-treatment or to ensure good conditions of detention. This kind of corruption affects a 
</p>
<p>whole group indirectly. As the Committee against Torture pointed out in a recent report: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Linking anti-corruption and human rights frameworks in practice requires an </p>


<p>understanding of how the cycle of corruption facilitates, perpetuates and institutionalizes 
</p>
<p>human rights violations<i>.</i>&#8221;22 
</p>
<p>30. From a more substantive perspective, there are parallels between the main anti-
</p>
<p>corruption principles (such as participation, transparency and access to information, and 
</p>
<p>accountability) and the scope of human rights (such as freedom of expression and freedom 
</p>
<p>of the media, access to information, and the principle of non-discrimination).23 Therefore, 
</p>
<p>strengthening the enjoyment of human rights in general, and of specific civil or political 
</p>
<p>rights and the principle of non-discrimination in particular, is a valuable instrument in 
</p>
<p>combating corruption. Whereas combating corruption through criminal law and private law 
</p>
<p>means taking repressive and remedial measures, the promotion and strengthening of human 
</p>
<p>rights is a preventative anti-corruption measure.  
</p>
<p>31. The need to integrate preventative measures into efforts against corruption has been 
</p>
<p>clearly emphasized. Furthermore, promoting and strengthening human rights may &#8212; in the 
</p>
<p>long term &#8212; contribute to a well-informed and emancipated civil society that is more and 
</p>
<p>more able to reject corruption in all forms and circumstances. According to OHCHR: &#8220;An 
</p>
<p>efficient anti-corruption strategy must be informed by key human rights principles. An 
</p>
<p>independent judiciary, freedom of the press, freedom of expression, access to information, 
</p>
<p>transparency in the political system and accountability are essential both for successful anti-
</p>
<p>corruption strategies and for the enjoyment of human rights.&#8221;24  
</p>
<p>32. The linkage between anti-corruption measures and human rights can also promote 
</p>
<p>access to human rights mechanisms to combat corruption. A wide range of mechanisms 
</p>
<p>exists for monitoring compliance with human rights at the national, regional and 
</p>
<p>international levels. By drawing a link between acts of corruption and violations of human 
</p>
<p>rights, new opportunities for litigation or monitoring can be identified.
25
</p>
<p> This approach is 
</p>
<p>fully in line with article 34 of the United Nations Convention against Corruption. 
</p>
<p>According to that provision, each State party must take measures to address the 
</p>
<p>consequences of corruption. If a violation of human rights can be determined as a 
</p>
<p>consequence of corruption, the State is obliged to ensure that appropriate measures are 
</p>
<p>undertaken. 
</p>
<p>33. Combining strategies for fighting corruption and for promoting human rights can 
</p>
<p>bolster both objectives. On the one hand, human rights can form a part of an anti-corruption 
</p>
<p>strategy via the use of human rights mechanisms. On the other hand, fighting corruption is, 
</p>
<p>in itself, a way of preventing human rights violations. By promoting the necessary elements 
</p>
<p>of good governance (such as civil and political rights, transparency, and accountability), 
</p>
<p>human rights and anti-corruption efforts can be mutually reinforcing.26 For example, the 
</p>
<p>ability to promote and protect civil and political rights rests upon the ability to effectively 
</p>
<p>combat political and judicial corruption (and vice versa). Transparency and access to 
</p>
<p>information empower individuals to make informed decisions &#8212; from exercising their 
</p>
<p>voting rights, to monitoring how State expenditures are spent. At the same time, creating 
</p>
<p>such openness limits opportunities for abuses by politicians, the police and judges. 
</p>
<p>Businesses are thus provided with incentives to minimize their involvement in corruption.

<p>When accountability mechanisms are weak or non-existent, it becomes easy for corruption 
</p>
<p>and for human rights violations to occur.27 
</p>
<p>34. It must be stressed that the human rights approach is not meant to be the exclusive 
</p>
<p>way to tackle corruption. Highlighting the connection between human rights and corruption 
</p>
<p>does not mean to jeopardize the prosecution of people found guilty of criminal offences 
</p>
<p>because of acts of corruption or their liability under private law. The purpose of examining 
</p>
<p>this connection is to identify additional avenues for developing strategies against 
</p>
<p>corruption. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Are there experiences of integrating a human rights 
perspective into the fight against corruption? 
</b></p>
<p>35. The responses to the questionnaires received from States, national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders have 
</p>
<p>permitted an analysis of whether, at the national level, there have been any experiences of 
</p>
<p>integrating a human rights perspective into the fight against corruption.  
</p>
<p>36. The responses highlight the different institutional approaches to dealing with 
</p>
<p>corruption. In a number of States, independent agencies have been tasked with 
</p>
<p>counteracting corruption. Other States, in their replies, make reference to agencies or 
</p>
<p>departments of the government that were assigned similar responsibilities. The 
</p>
<p>organizational structure of such agencies or specialized institutions varies from State to 
</p>
<p>State. In some States, NGOs are an important instrument in combating corruption. In 
</p>
<p>addition, inspection bodies (e.g. supreme audit institutions) play an important role; some of 
</p>
<p>these bodies expressed their interest in exploring human rights&#8211;based approaches, and work 
</p>
<p>collaboratively with civil society and human rights organizations. Other States mention 
</p>
<p>criminal prosecution or human rights institutions as the main instruments used in their fight 
</p>
<p>against corruption. 
</p>
<p>37. With regard to the integration of a human rights perspective into strategies to combat 
</p>
<p>corruption via cooperation between anti-corruption institutions and human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions, the responses from States to the questionnaire reflect a multifaceted situation. 
</p>
<p>Some of the responses indicate that there is either no cooperation or no effective 
</p>
<p>cooperation. Often, there is no formal cooperation, but rather informal cooperation, via, for 
</p>
<p>example, meetings, workshops, lectures, common training sessions, or exchanges of 
</p>
<p>information. Inter-institutional working groups are a more formal means of cooperation 
</p>
<p>mentioned in the responses. Some States indicate that cooperation between the institutions 
</p>
<p>concerned exists on a case-by-case basis. To summarize, many States emphasized the need 
</p>
<p>for, and the importance of, cooperation between the anti-corruption institutions and the 
</p>
<p>human rights institutions, while specifying that such cooperation is at present informal and 
</p>
<p>ad hoc in nature. These findings are also reflected in the responses to the questionnaire 
</p>
<p>from national human rights institutions and some NGOs. 
</p>
<p>38. With regard to NGOs&#8217; responses to the questionnaire, it is noteworthy that some 
</p>
<p>NGOs quote examples of cooperation between anti-corruption institutions and human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions. However, no information is provided about the ways in which that cooperation 
</p>
<p>takes place. The need for and importance of such cooperation is stressed in some responses. 
</p>
<p>39. In that regard, the response from the Council of Europe should be highlighted. It 
</p>
<p>provides an illustrative example of integrating a human rights perspective into strategies to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 27 See Sharon Eicher, <i>Corruption in International Business</i>, p. 8 et seq. </p>


<p>combat corruption. As examples, the Council of Europe listed its Civil Law Convention on 
</p>
<p>Corruption (mentioned earlier), and the establishment of the Groupe d&#8217;<i>&#201;tats contre la 
</i></p>
<p><i>corruption</i>, which invited the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights to share 
</p>
<p>his views on the possible impact of corruption on the effectiveness of human rights. In his 
</p>
<p>view, the protection of victims of corruption, and the protection of persons who report 
</p>
<p>suspicions of corruption, should be seen as important tools in promoting both human rights 
</p>
<p>and ethical behaviour.28 
</p>
<p>40. From a more substantive (rather than an organizational) angle, it can be established 
</p>
<p>from the answers to the questionnaire by States and other stakeholders that human rights 
</p>
<p>play an important role in anti-corruption strategies. What is emphasized by some 
</p>
<p>respondents is the importance of a well-informed and participatory society in order to 
</p>
<p>combat corruption. This outcome would be further strengthened by human rights education, 
</p>
<p>which can raise awareness of corruption. 
</p>
<p>41. Many of the respondents to the questionnaire state that it is essential to highlight the 
</p>
<p>significance of the human rights perspective in the fight against corruption, and to integrate 
</p>
<p>that perspective into anti-corruption policies. With regard to the question on the role of 
</p>
<p>United Nations human rights bodies and mechanisms, many stakeholders suggest that 
</p>
<p>measures be taken that are aimed at awareness-raising and education. More concretely, the 
</p>
<p>relevant United Nations bodies are invited, in the responses to the questionnaire, to develop 
</p>
<p>and present examples of good practices of combining anti-corruption measures with human 
</p>
<p>rights. Furthermore, they are asked to prepare information and suggestions: to cite an 
</p>
<p>example, they are asked to develop specific guidelines and strategic plans on how to 
</p>
<p>integrate human rights into anti-corruption strategies. The answers to the questionnaire 
</p>
<p>indicate that this substantive input should be shared by means of international conferences, 
</p>
<p>seminars and trainings organized by the United Nations in cooperation with States. The 
</p>
<p>importance of adequate information and of the training of national experts on this issue is 
</p>
<p>also highlighted in the responses to the questionnaire. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. </b>Corruption and human rights: the &#8220;non<b>-</b>victims&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>42. When analysing the connection between corruption and human rights, the main 
</p>
<p>focus is on the possible negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights for the victims 
</p>
<p>of the corrupt act. That focus is the main advantage of carrying out such an analysis. The 
</p>
<p>human rights of other actors involved should not, however, be disregarded. While the 
</p>
<p>present report focuses mainly on the negative impact of corruption on the victims, a brief 
</p>
<p>look at other persons involved is necessary. 
</p>
<p>43. Persons suspected of having committed a criminal offence relating to corrupt 
</p>
<p>behaviour have rights as part of the criminal proceedings being taken against them. Even if 
</p>
<p>effective criminal prosecution is an important tool against corruption, the rights of accused 
</p>
<p>individuals must be guaranteed. 
</p>
<p>44. Human rights defenders &#8212; persons who individually or together with others strive 
</p>
<p>for the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms &#8212; are often 
</p>
<p>subjects of harassment, intimidation, threats, arbitrary arrest and attacks. This also includes 
</p>
<p>persons who denounce and fight corruption. According to the Declaration on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Defenders, States have a duty to protect human rights defenders against violence, threats, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 28 See Groupe d&#8217;<i>&#201;tats contre la corruption</i>, Twelfth general activity report (2011), document GRECO

<p>retaliation, discrimination or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of their legitimate 
</p>
<p>activities in promoting and protecting human rights. 
</p>
<p>45. Journalists reporting on cases of corruption or promoting human rights as part of 
</p>
<p>their work play a crucial role in the dissemination of information, in awareness-raising, and 
</p>
<p>in the realization of human rights and the fight against corruption. They often discover 
</p>
<p>grievances and bring them to the attention of the public. The information that they provide 
</p>
<p>is an essential precondition for transparency and responsibility. In its established case law, 
</p>
<p>the European Court of Human Rights has emphasized the function of journalists as a 
</p>
<p>&#8220;public watchdog&#8221;.29 Journalists frequently come under pressure because of their reporting. 
</p>
<p>They may be prosecuted, defamed, harassed or even attacked. States are obliged to 
</p>
<p>guarantee freedom of expression but also any other human rights that may be violated by 
</p>
<p>means of threats or attacks against journalists. 
</p>
<p>46. Whistle-blowers&#8217; actions lead to the public disclosure of grievances in 
</p>
<p>administrations or enterprises, and can contribute to the process of discovering and 
</p>
<p>combating grievances in the institutions concerned. Whistle-blowing can be a valuable 
</p>
<p>element in the fight against corruption in both public and private entities. Although a 
</p>
<p>number of elements need to be examined about the behaviour of whistle-blowers,30 they can 
</p>
<p>play an important role as insiders who bring incriminating facts to the knowledge of the 
</p>
<p>public. The State is under an obligation to guarantee the right to freedom of expression also 
</p>
<p>to whistle-blowers. This is reflected in the recommendation of the Council of Europe 
</p>
<p>Committee of Ministers on the protection of whistle-blowers, which was adopted on 30 
</p>
<p>April 2014.31 The Committee of Ministers recommends that member States have in place a 
</p>
<p>normative, institutional and judicial framework to protect individuals who, in the context of 
</p>
<p>their work-based relationship, report or disclose information on threats or harm to the 
</p>
<p>public interest. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Recommendations by the Advisory Committee 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b>In its resolution, the Human Rights Council requested the Advisory Committee 
</b></p>
<p><b>to make recommendations on how the Council and its subsidiary bodies should 
</b></p>
<p><b>consider the issue of the negative impact of corruption on the enjoyment of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights. The resulting report makes substantive as well as procedural 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>It is largely accepted that there is a need to link anti-corruption measures with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the realization and protection of human rights. What is missing at this stage, however, 
</b></p>
<p><b>is strategies to translate the substantive linkage into concrete measures. It seems 
</b></p>
<p><b>difficult to develop such strategies or concrete measures in an abstract manner. It 
</b></p>
<p><b>seems more useful to identify good and best practices, from which to derive more 
</b></p>
<p><b>general guidelines. Such best practices and guidelines would have to be communicated 
</b></p>
<p><b>to national experts in an appropriate manner. Information-sharing, discussion and 
</b></p>
<p><b>training could be considered, as ways of communicating with national experts. One

<p> 31 Council of Europe, recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the 
</p>
<p>protection of whistle-blowers, CM/Rec(2014)7, adopted on 30 April 2014.  </p>


<p><b>anti-corruption agencies, drawing on the experience of OHCHR and the Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights Council with strengthening national human rights institutions.32 
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>In order to identify the above-mentioned best practices and to develop 
</b></p>
<p><b>guidelines, a comprehensive study could be conducted by the competent bodies of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council. The study should aim at the development of concrete 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures on how to establish the linkage between anti-corruption measures and a 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights</b>&#8211;<b>based approach in practice. Three different perspectives could be 
</b></p>
<p><b>considered in the study: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) How can anti-corruption institutions improve their work by integrating 
</b></p>
<p><b>a human rights approach (e.g. the negative impact of corruption on the enjoyment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights)? 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) How can human rights institutions expand the scope of their work by 
</b></p>
<p><b>considering corruption as a reason for violations of human rights? 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) How can the work of anti-corruption institutions and human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions be interlinked, from the substantive, structural and organizational points 
</b></p>
<p><b>of view? 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>Moreover, the study should aim at finding criteria to establish whether an act 
</b></p>
<p><b>of corruption leads to a human rights violation, and, contrariwise, whether a human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights violation leads to corruption. A list of attributes and indicators could be 
</b></p>
<p><b>established as a basis for mainstreaming the issues in both fields and could contribute 
</b></p>
<p><b>to rendering the connection between corruption and human rights operational. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Equally importantly, the study should cover the protection of anti-corruption 
</b></p>
<p><b>activists, whistle-blowers and journalists reporting on corruption. In that regard, one 
</b></p>
<p><b>possible approach could be to reinforce protection of the above-mentioned persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>under the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.33  
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>Preventive measures are the most effective means of countering corruption and 
</b></p>
<p><b>of avoiding its negative impact on the enjoyment of human rights. Therefore, 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevention at every level </b>&#8212;<b> national, regional and international </b>&#8212;<b> should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthened. Prevention requires awareness-raising, information-sharing, education, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the training of all stakeholders involved. Furthermore, sharing of best practices 
</b></p>
<p><b>and guidelines, as mentioned above, can be a core element of preventive measures. 
</b></p>
<p><b>One key aspect of preventive measures is to address, explicitly, the needs of vulnerable 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups, who may be the very first victims of corruption and human rights violations. 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>The Advisory Committee recommends using the special procedures of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council to integrate a human rights perspective into anti-corruption 
</b></p>
<p><b>strategies. Within the framework of the United Nations human rights bodies, a special 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures mandate (thematic mandate) could be established to examine, monitor, 
</b></p>
<p><b>advise on and report on major phenomena of human rights violations. Such a 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandate can be given to an individual </b>&#8212;<b> i.e. to a special rapporteur or an 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent expert </b>&#8212;<b> or to a working group of experts (composed of five members). 
</b></p>
<p><b>With regard to the issue of assessing the violation of human rights caused by 
</b></p>
<p><b>corruption, it is appropriate to establish either an independent expert or a working 
</b></p>
<p><b>group. The mandate holders would be able to receive information about (possible) 
</b></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>on 12 August 2014, during the Committee&#8217;s thirteenth session. Available from

<p><b>violations of human rights caused by acts of corruption. In that way, they would be 
</b></p>
<p><b>able to have an overview of human rights violations occurring as a result of 
</b></p>
<p><b>corruption. The impact of corruption on specific human rights could be analysed, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>gaps in protection could be identified, including the question of compensation for 
</b></p>
<p><b>damage.34 On the basis of this, new strategies that strengthen synergies between anti-
</b></p>
<p><b>corruption and human rights measures could be developed in the Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council and its competent bodies. Alongside the establishment of a specific mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the thematic issue of the negative impact of corruption on the enjoyment of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights, every thematic and country mandate should consider paying attention to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>linkage between corruption and human rights.35 Given the wide range and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>complexity of the issue, it may be appropriate to establish a five-person working 
</b></p>
<p><b>group. 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>Moreover, it is recommended that examination of the issue of corruption as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>possible cause for human rights violations be integrated into the universal periodic 
</b></p>
<p><b>review. According to Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 and the provisions on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>universal periodic review mechanism, the universal periodic review process provides 
</b></p>
<p><b>the opportunity for each State to provide information about actions it has taken to 
</b></p>
<p><b>fulfil its human rights obligations and to improve its human rights situation. In the 
</b></p>
<p><b>universal periodic review process, particular attention could be given to the question 
</b></p>
<p><b>of whether, and to what extent, human rights violations in various States are 
</b></p>
<p><b>consequences of corruption. Furthermore, actions against corruption, as means of 
</b></p>
<p><b>improving the general enjoyment of human rights, could be included in the universal 
</b></p>
<p><b>periodic review.36 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>Also, in the framework of the complaints procedure of the Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council, specific attention should be paid to possible violations of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>caused by corruption. The Working Group on Communications and the Working 
</b></p>
<p><b>Group on Situations, which are the competent bodies to examine communications, 
</b></p>
<p><b>should bear in mind the negative impact of corruption on the enjoyment of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights. Any connection with acts of corruption or corrupt behaviour as causes of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>alleged human rights violations should be indicated in the course of the examination 
</b></p>
<p><b>of a communication. Also in this respect, a catalogue of criteria (as mentioned in para. 
</b></p>
<p><b>50) may be helpful. 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>There is a strong need for United Nations bodies and organizations to enter into 
</b></p>
<p><b>dialogue with each other and with other international organizations dealing with anti-
</b></p>
<p><b>corruption strategies. This inter-institutional approach should include, in particular, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, as the guardian of the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention against Corruption. It is of utmost importance that all the institutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>involved have a good knowledge of each other, that they share all information, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>that they establish linkages between the measures that they take. The mutual 
</b></p>
<p><b>consideration and integration aims at building a network in order to act more 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectively in an anti-corruption alliance.
