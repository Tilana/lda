<p><b>  The following document represents the views and comments of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government of Italy in respect of the Report of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the human rights of migrants, drafted following a visit from 2 to 6 
</b></p>
<p><b>December 2014. 
</b></p>
<p>Proposed amendments to the report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of 
</p>
<p>migrants by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Inter-ministerial 
</p>
<p>Committee of Human Rights of the Italian Government. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background on Italy and migration: a brief overview 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Para. 8: 
</b></p>
<p>Italy received over 170,000 arrivals in 2014, most of whom were rescued at sea 
</p>
<p>by the Italian navy operation Mare Nostrum beside the Italian Coast guard SAR 
</p>
<p>activity outside Italian Search and Rescue Region (SRR).  
</p>
<p><b> III. Normative and institutional framework on migration and 
border management 
</b></p>
<p><b> IV. Border Management 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Rescue at sea 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Para. 42 Italian Coast Guard: 
</b></p>
<p>Lybia does not have SAR capacity. Malta and Greece have limited SAR capacity in Central 
</p>
<p>Mediterranean area and do not assume responsibility for coordinating SAR operations 
</p>
<p>outside their SRR as Italy is normally the first RCC to receive distress calls by migrants. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, Italy is coordinating SAR for the entire Central Mediterranean, outside its 
</p>
<p>Search and Rescue Region (SRR), covering an area of about 600.000 km2 in front of Lybia, 
</p>
<p>where there is no competent RCC or actual SAR organization. 
</p>
<p>Although they feel committed to their rescue work, the Italian Coast Guard (also managing 
</p>
<p>IMRCC) also have their capacity limitations when coordinating SAR operations far away 
</p>
<p>from Italian SRR. That implies also the impossibility to relieve easily the merchant vessels 
</p>
<p>in the area of the burden of their SAR obligations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Para. 43 Mare Nostrum: 
</b></p>
<p>Italy launched a naval SAR operation called <i>Mare Nostrum, </i>beside the Italian Coast guard 
</p>
<p>SAR activity outside the Italian Search and Rescue Region (SRR)<i>.</i> [see II.8] 
</p>
<p>The Italian Navy employed an average of five of its ships and their air units also for SAR 
</p>
<p>operations in cooperation with IMRCC (Italian Coast Guard). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Para. 44: 
</b></p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur noted the extraordinary efforts of <i>Mare Nostrum</i>, which managed 
</p>
<p>to rescue over 170.000 persons.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Para. 46 Merchant vessels 
</b></p>
<p>Private vessels are heavily engaged in cooperating in SAR operations according with the 
</p>
<p>international laws, by their own or at the request of the competent RCC. In 2014, almost 
</p>
<p>900 merchant vessels were involved in SAR operations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Cooperation with FRONTEX 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Para. 47: 
</b></p>
<p>The management of Italy&#8217;s external borders is further supported by the EU border agency 
</p>
<p>FRONTEX. FRONTEX works with Border Police, <i>Guardia di Finanza</i>, Carabinieri, 
</p>
<p>supported also at sea by Navy and Italian Coast Guard, to combat irregular migration, 
</p>
<p>migrant smuggling and migration related crimes. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Regional processes 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Para 55-57: 
</b></p>
<p>Italy is strongly committed in implementing the Khartoum Process (KP), a new political 
</p>
<p>dialogue on migration with the countries of the Horn and  Eastern Africa, as well as the 
</p>
<p>main Mediterranean transit countries, thus gathering countries of origin, transit and 
</p>
<p>destination along the migratory route from the Horn of Africa to Europe. The parties are the 
</p>
<p>EU member States, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, 
</p>
<p>Sudan, Tunisia, the European and African Union Commissions. The KP was launched with 
</p>
<p>a Ministerial Conference held in Rome on November 28, 2014 and adopted a Political 
</p>
<p>Declaration listing the main goals of the Process such as: better organizing legal migration 
</p>
<p>and fostering well-managed mobility, including intra and inter-regional labor mobility; 
</p>
<p>assisting in improving national capacity building in migration management in all its 
</p>
<p>components  and addressing irregular migration, including through cooperation on return, 
</p>
<p>in particular voluntary return, and readmission, preventing and combating trafficking in 
</p>
<p>human beings and smuggling of migrants; maximizing the development impact of 
</p>
<p>migration and mobility through concrete initiatives; promoting cooperation on protection 
</p>
<p>and its principles for refugees and asylum seekers in accordance with relevant international 
</p>
<p>conventions, and in particular the 1951 UN Geneva Convention. 
</p>
<p>The KP aims at identifying and implementing concrete projects. In the first phase, activities 
</p>
<p>should concentrate on addressing trafficking in human beings, as well as smuggling of 
</p>
<p>migrants. In the medium term, the activities of the KP could expand to other issues, in line 
</p>
<p>with the priorities of the EU's Global Approach on Migration and Mobility (namely, legal 
</p>
<p>migration, irregular migration, migration and development and international protection). It 
</p>
<p>was also agreed the importance of an African ownership of the Process and the willing to 
</p>
<p>carry out concrete projects financed through EU funds with the participation of 
</p>
<p>international organizations such as UNHCR, IOM, and UNODC. </p>

<p><b> VI Cross cutting concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Labour exploitation 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Para. 107-108: 
</b></p>
<p>The Italian Ministry of  Labour and Social Policies is active in fighting against the illegal 
</p>
<p>exploitation of non EU workers lacking valid residence permits as well as the phenomenon 
</p>
<p>of <i>caporalato </i>(illegal hiring of farm workers for very low wages through an agent), aiming 
</p>
<p>also at countering  fiscal evasion, at safeguarding safety at work and at contrasting their 
</p>
<p>illegal recruiting and employment. In all circumstances full enjoyment of rights is granted 
</p>
<p>to foreign/non EU workers. 
</p>
<p>Illegal migrants are a particularly vulnerable category of workers, because they are afraid to 
</p>
<p>be repatriated if their illegal status is discovered. For this reason they often accept very poor 
</p>
<p>remuneration and bad working conditions, not acceptable by regular workers. 
</p>
<p>Illicit actions concerning irregular employment and job exploitation emerge above all 
</p>
<p>within traditionally &#8220;crucial&#8221; sectors such as textiles and seasonal work in the agricultural 
</p>
<p>field, also including the above mentioned <i>capolarato</i> phenomenon. They are monitored by 
</p>
<p>regional and provincial Labour Inspection Directorates. Central Authorities target 
</p>
<p>inspection activities according to a geographical and sectoral approach. 
</p>
<p>With specific reference to the outcomes of the surveillance activity carried out in 2014 by 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Labour, on a total of 140,173 companies inspected, 53% (74,745) were not 
</p>
<p>in compliance with the law. The total amount of off-the-book workers was 73,508, of 
</p>
<p>whom 1,018 non-EU workers lacking residence permit [mainly in Tuscany (32), Campania 
</p>
<p>(165), Lombardy (143) and Emilia-Romagna Regions (110) ]. 
</p>
<p>In the building sector 26,998 cases were found in violation of safety rules and laws in force. 
</p>
<p>6,838 companies were obliged to suspend their activity. 5,618 resumed activity after 
</p>
<p>complying  with the law. 
</p>
<p>The same work opportunities are ensured for migrant workers as for Italian workers. 
</p>
<p>Moreover one of the functions of regional and provincial Labour Inspection Directorates is 
</p>
<p>to report to the competent Public Security Forces the presence of irregular workers. The set 
</p>
<p>of rules now in force in Italy provides for the prohibition for employers to recruit non-EU 
</p>
<p>citizens lacking residence permits, imposing stricter sanctions to fight informal and 
</p>
<p>irregular employment. 
</p>
<p>Law Decree No. 145 dated 23 December 2013, converted, with amendments, by Act No. 9 
</p>
<p>dated 21 February 2014, provides for a fine from 1.950 to 5.600 Euros for each employed 
</p>
<p>worker, complemented by 195 Euros for each day of informal work. Furthermore if the 
</p>
<p>worker lacks a residence permit (and also if the permit has been revoked, annulled or has 
</p>
<p>elapsed), Legislative Decree No. 286/1998 and Legislative Decree No. 109/2014 provide 
</p>
<p>for specific criminal sanctions for the employer (detention from 6 months to 3 years and a 
</p>
<p>fine of 5.000 Euros for each employed worker), and an increase of the sanctions from 1/3 to 
</p>
<p>1/2 if the informal workers number more than three, or/and are minors, or/and are 
</p>
<p>particularly exploited. 
</p>
<p>Moreover the employer has to pay the repatriation cost of the illegal worker. If the worker 
</p>
<p>was victim of particularly severe exploitation, he/she may obtain a special stay permit, 
</p>
<p>provided he/she denounces the employee and cooperates in the criminal investigations. 
</p>
<p>In the field of underground economy, the action of the Guardia di Finanza is aimed at 
</p>
<p>targeting all aspects of illegality linked to the phenomenon of undeclared work - such as tax </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/36/Add.6 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>and social contributions evasion, exploitation of illegal immigrants, social security fraud, 
</p>
<p>manufacture and trade of products bearing counterfeit brands - and is focused on all labour-
</p>
<p>intensive sectors. 
</p>
<p>The activities of the Guardia di Finanza are aimed not only at recovering evaded taxes and 
</p>
<p>contributions, but also at targeting assets and properties amassed by exploiting irregular 
</p>
<p>workers. 
</p>
<p>In 2014 the Guardia di Finanza discovered a total of 25.305 irregular labourers, including 
</p>
<p>13.369 illegal workers and 11.936 unreported - of which 5.536 women. 3175 irregular 
</p>
<p>workers and 2518 illegal workers were immigrants from non EU - countries. 
</p>
<p>5.082 employers were reported for employing irregular labour. 
</p>
<p>The investigations conducted by the Guardia the Finanza have identified the following 
</p>
<p>business sectors as those prevalently affected by the phenomenon of unreported 
</p>
<p>employment: the tourism and public businesses (60%),  services sector (22%), the building 
</p>
<p>industry (11%), agriculture (5%) and transportation (2%). 
</p>
<p>Finally Act No. 148/2011 amended the Criminal Code by inserting Art. 603-bis providing 
</p>
<p>for a new sanction for the employers acting illegally as intermediaries and exploiting non 
</p>
<p>EU workers, consisting of detention from 5 to 8 years plus a fine of 1.000 to 2.000 Euros 
</p>
<p>for each employed worker. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> F. Cross-cutting concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Develop and implement a national integration programme for all.  
</b></p>
<p>UNAR is developing the Action Plan against Racism, Racial Discrimination, 
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, for 2015-2017. The Plan fully takes into account 
</p>
<p>relevant international and national instruments, such as the Italian Constitution, especially 
</p>
<p>Art.3, Legislative Decree No. 215/2003 (in accordance with Directive 2000/43/CE), 
</p>
<p>Legislative Decree 216/2003 (in accordance with Directive 2000/78/CE), and Art.43 of Act 
</p>
<p>No. 40/1998, concerning discrimination on the grounds of &#8220;race&#8221;, skin colour, descent, 
</p>
<p>national or ethnic origin, personal and religious belief, and language. In terms of scope, the 
</p>
<p>Plan will consider both foreign citizens who live in Italy and Italian citizens of foreign 
</p>
<p>origin, including those belonging to religious and ethnic and linguistic minorities. The Plan 
</p>
<p>includes eight thematic areas/priorities, including matters of concern, actions, and 
</p>
<p>objectives to be achieved also through affirmative actions in line with the legislation in 
</p>
<p>force: Work and employment; Housing; Education; Health; Contacts with Public 
</p>
<p>Administration; Law enforcement; Sport; Media and communication. </p>

</p>
<p><b> G. Recommendations to the European Union 
</b></p>
<p>156. Ensure the full implementation of responsibility sharing between EUMS in the 
management of its external borders, including SAR operations. In particular take into full 
</p>
<p>account the geographical position of Italy that renders its coastlines particularly exposed to 
</p>
<p>migration flows. This should include operational contributions to enhance SAR operations 
</p>
<p>outside EUMS SRRs and permitting migrants the freedom of movement within the EU and 
</p>
<p>the attribution of EU support funds to the country where migrants establish themselves as 
</p>
<p>either asylum seekers.
