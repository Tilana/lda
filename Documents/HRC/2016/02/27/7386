<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 19/10, the Human Rights Council decided to appoint an 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a 
</p>
<p>safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment. The present report is his third annual 
</p>
<p>report to the Council, and the final report of the three-year mandate established by 
</p>
<p>resolution 19/10.  
</p>
<p>2. One aspect of the mandate has been to study the human rights obligations relating to 
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment. In March 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert presented to the Council the results of his study of human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations relating to the environment (A/HRC/25/53). On the basis of an extensive review 
</p>
<p>of sources in human rights and environmental law, he described procedural obligations 
</p>
<p>(including duties of States to assess environmental impacts on human rights and to make 
</p>
<p>environmental information public, to facilitate participation in environmental decision-
</p>
<p>making, and to provide access to effective remedies), substantive obligations (including 
</p>
<p>duties of States to adopt legal and institutional frameworks that protect against 
</p>
<p>environmental harm that interferes with the enjoyment of human rights, including harm 
</p>
<p>caused by private actors), and obligations concerning those who may be particularly 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to environmental harm (including women, children and indigenous peoples).  
</p>
<p>3. In the past year, the principal focus of the Independent Expert has been on a second 
</p>
<p>aspect of the mandate: to identify, promote and exchange views on best practices relating to 
</p>
<p>the use of human rights obligations and commitments to inform, support and strengthen 
</p>
<p>environmental policymaking, especially in the area of environmental protection, and, in that 
</p>
<p>regard, to prepare a compendium of best practices. The previous annual report describes the 
</p>
<p>minimum obligations relating to the environment that human rights law places on all States; 
</p>
<p>this report examines practices of national Governments, subnational Governments, 
</p>
<p>international organizations, civil society organizations, corporations and others that employ 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations relating to the environment in ways that go beyond the minimum 
</p>
<p>standards. 
</p>
<p>4. At the outset, the Independent Expert reiterates his preference for the term &#8220;good 
</p>
<p>practices&#8221; rather than &#8220;best practices&#8221; because, in many situations, it is not possible to 
</p>
<p>identify a single &#8220;best&#8221; practice. In this regard, he agrees with other mandate holders, 
</p>
<p>including the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/10/6, para. 34). 
</p>
<p>5. On the basis of nine regional consultations and expert meetings, two country visits 
</p>
<p>and dozens of responses to questionnaires sent to States, civil society organizations and 
</p>
<p>others, and with the vital assistance of the United Nations Environment Programme 
</p>
<p>(UNEP) and other partners, the Independent Expert has compiled more than 100 good 
</p>
<p>practices in the use of human rights obligations relating to the environment. Section II of 
</p>
<p>this report describes the process by which the practices were identified. Section III 
</p>
<p>describes the practices themselves, organizing them into nine categories corresponding to 
</p>
<p>the obligations identified in last year&#8217;s mapping report (A/HRC/25/53). Section IV provides 
</p>
<p>conclusions and recommendations for further work. 
</p>
<p>6. The Independent Expert also carried out other activities related to the mandate in 
</p>
<p>2014. In his March 2014 presentation to the Council, he stated that he would look at two 
</p>
<p>thematic issues in particular: the problems facing environmental human rights defenders, 
</p>
<p>and the relationship between climate change and human rights. 
</p>
<p>7. In 2014, he participated in three meetings on environmental human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>In March, he took part in a meeting hosted by the Universal Rights Group in Geneva, which </p>


<p>brought together environmental defenders from Africa and Europe. The following month, 
</p>
<p>he spoke at a three-day conference in Washington, D.C., which honoured the memory of 
</p>
<p>the Brazilian activist Chico Mendes 25 years after his death, and which addressed current 
</p>
<p>issues facing environmental defenders, particularly in Latin America. In May, he 
</p>
<p>participated in a three-day meeting in Bangkok organized by the Swedish International 
</p>
<p>Development Agency, which focused on issues facing defenders in South-East Asia. He 
</p>
<p>then hosted a meeting in Bangkok that brought together experts from throughout Asia to 
</p>
<p>identify challenges and good practices in the protection of environmental defenders.1 
</p>
<p>8. With respect to climate change, the Independent Expert co-hosted with the 
</p>
<p>Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Foundation an expert meeting in Chamonix on 15 and 16 July 
</p>
<p>2014, followed by a consultation with Governments and other stakeholders in Geneva on 
</p>
<p>17 July. He published a special report on climate change and human rights, which compiled 
</p>
<p>all of the statements on human rights obligations relating to climate change made in the 
</p>
<p>reports that are part of his mapping project.2
 
On 17 October 2014, he and 26 other special 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs and independent experts issued a joint statement calling on the State parties to 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to ensure full coherence 
</p>
<p>between their human rights obligations and their efforts to address climate change. In 
</p>
<p>December, he attended the twentieth Conference of the Parties to the Framework 
</p>
<p>Convention in Lima and spoke at two side events there.  
</p>
<p>9. From 20 to 24 October 2014, the Independent Expert carried out a mission to France 
</p>
<p>to examine its experience with the use of human rights obligations in the context of 
</p>
<p>environmental policy (A/HRC/28/61/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>10. In 2014, the Independent Expert also supported the efforts of others working to 
</p>
<p>integrate human rights and environmental protection. For example, he gave long-distance 
</p>
<p>presentations to a workshop on human rights, environment and climate change organized 
</p>
<p>by the Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights of the Association of Southeast 
</p>
<p>Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Yangon, Myanmar, from 13 to 15 September, and on 6 
</p>
<p>November to a meeting of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean negotiating a 
</p>
<p>regional agreement on implementation of Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration on 
</p>
<p>Environment and Development. Other presentations included statements to conferences 
</p>
<p>hosted by the University of the Andes in Colombia, on 17 March, and by the University of 
</p>
<p>Oslo, on 9 September. 
</p>
<p><b> II. The process of compiling good practices 
</b></p>
<p>11. The process of identifying, promoting and exchanging views on good practices in 
</p>
<p>the use of human rights obligations in environmental policymaking began early in the 
</p>
<p>mandate. The Independent Expert and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights (OHCHR) worked closely with UNEP to develop an interagency 
</p>
<p>programme to identify and disseminate information about good practices. The assistance of 
</p>
<p>UNEP throughout the mandate has been crucial to its success.  
</p>
<p>12. Together, the Independent Expert and UNEP identified criteria to guide the 
</p>
<p>identification of good practices. They defined the term &#8220;practice&#8221; broadly to include 
</p>
<p>legislation, policies, case law, administrative practices, and projects, as well as practices 
</p>
<p>that go beyond established legal obligations relating to the environment. Practices can be 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 The report of the meeting is available at http://ieenvironment.org/consultations/. 
</p>
<p> 2 The report is at http://ieenvironment.org/2014/08/08/report-on-climate-change-and-human-rights/.  </p>


<p>implemented by a wide range of actors, including all levels of government, civil society, the 
</p>
<p>private sector, communities and individuals.  
</p>
<p>13. To be a &#8220;good&#8221; practice, the practice should integrate human rights and 
</p>
<p>environmental standards, including through the application of human rights norms to 
</p>
<p>environmental decision-making and implementation or the use of environmental measures 
</p>
<p>to define, implement and (preferably) exceed minimum standards set by human rights 
</p>
<p>norms. The practice should be exemplary from the perspectives of human rights and of 
</p>
<p>environmental protection, and there should be evidence that the practice is achieving or 
</p>
<p>working towards achieving its desired objectives and outcomes. 
</p>
<p>14. The two principal sources for identifying good practices were consultations hosted 
</p>
<p>by the Independent Expert and UNEP, as well as other partners, and a questionnaire 
</p>
<p>seeking good practices that was sent to Governments, international organizations, civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations, and other interested stakeholders. In addition, the Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>identified good practices in his visits to Costa Rica and France. Finally, he sought good 
</p>
<p>practices through additional contacts and research.  
</p>
<p>15. The consultations took place in every region. Each consultation focused on 
</p>
<p>identifying good practices, as well as clarifying legal obligations and challenges, in one 
</p>
<p>thematic area. Consultations took place in Nairobi in February 2013 on procedural 
</p>
<p>obligations, in Geneva in June 2013 on substantive obligations, in Panama City in July 
</p>
<p>2013 on obligations relating to vulnerable groups, in Copenhagen in October 2013 on 
</p>
<p>international institutions, in Johannesburg in January 2014 on constitutional environmental 
</p>
<p>rights, in Bangkok in May 2014 on environmental human rights defenders, and in 
</p>
<p>Chamonix/Geneva in July 2014 on climate change. 
</p>
<p>16. The largest conference, which represented the culmination of the process, was at 
</p>
<p>Yale University from 5 to 7 September 2014. It was hosted by Yale and the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Institute for Training and Research, with assistance from a number of other partners, 
</p>
<p>including UNEP and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). It brought 
</p>
<p>together more than 150 scholars and policy experts, and more than 100 papers were 
</p>
<p>presented on issues concerning the relationship between human rights and environmental 
</p>
<p>protection.3  
</p>
<p>17. The Independent Expert sent out the questionnaire in the spring and summer of 
</p>
<p>2014. It was also made available publicly, and it was sent throughout 2014 to anyone who 
</p>
<p>requested a copy. More than 70 responses were received.  
</p>
<p>18. As a result of the consultations, country visits, responses to the questionnaire, and 
</p>
<p>other contacts, the Independent Expert heard the views of a very wide spectrum of 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, including Governments, international bodies, national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions, civil society organizations, corporations and academic scholars, on the use of 
</p>
<p>good practices in the use of human rights obligations relating to the environment. 
</p>
<p>19. In the second half of 2014, these practices were reviewed, summarized and 
</p>
<p>compiled. For each practice, a one-page summary was prepared that includes the name of 
</p>
<p>the practice, its implementing actors and location, a brief description of the practice, and 
</p>
<p>links to websites where further information about the practice may be found. In some cases, 
</p>
<p>it was possible to supplement the material provided by the submitters, but because the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert had only limited capacity to verify the information provided in the 
</p>
<p>submissions, many of the summaries primarily depend on the descriptions of the practices 
</p>
<p>provided by the submitters.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 The papers and other information about the conference are at http://conference.unitar.org/yale2014/. </p>


<p>20. The compilation of good practices will be available at the official website of the 
</p>
<p>mandate holder (available through www.ohchr.org) and on the personal website of the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert (http://ieenvironment.org). Although the compilation is only in English 
</p>
<p>at the moment, the Independent Expert hopes to find resources to have the practices 
</p>
<p>translated into the other official languages of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>21. The compilation will also be available on a website created for it 
</p>
<p>(environmentalrightsdatabase.org).  The website will facilitate searching for good practices 
</p>
<p>with key words and will allow the addition of more good practices in the future.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Good practices in the use of human rights obligations relating 
to the environment  
</b></p>
<p>22. The following description of good practices in the use of human rights obligations in 
</p>
<p>relation to environmental protection is organized into nine categories: (a) procedural 
</p>
<p>obligations generally; (b) the obligation to make environmental information public; (c) the 
</p>
<p>obligation to facilitate public participation in environmental decision-making; (d) the 
</p>
<p>obligation to protect the rights of expression and association; (e) the obligation to provide 
</p>
<p>access to legal remedies; (f) substantive obligations; (g) obligations relating to non-State 
</p>
<p>actors; (h) obligations relating to transboundary harm; and (i) obligations relating to those 
</p>
<p>in vulnerable situations. Practices that fall into more than one category were placed in the 
</p>
<p>category that seemed most relevant. 
</p>
<p>23. Because of space limitations, this report describes the practices only briefly. A fuller 
</p>
<p>description of each practice is available at the websites noted above. 
</p>
<p>24. The Independent Expert is well aware that there are many more good practices in 
</p>
<p>this field than those that this project has identified. The practices included here should be 
</p>
<p>taken as illustrative, rather than exhaustive, of the many innovative and exemplary efforts 
</p>
<p>being made to bring a human rights perspective to environmental protection.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Procedural obligations  
</b></p>
<p>25. Human rights law imposes procedural obligations on States in relation to 
</p>
<p>environmental protection, including duties: (a) to assess environmental impacts and make 
</p>
<p>environmental information public; (b) to facilitate public participation in environmental 
</p>
<p>decision-making, including by protecting the rights of expression and association; and (c) to 
</p>
<p>provide access to remedies for harm (A/HRC/25/53, para. 29). These obligations also have 
</p>
<p>support in international environmental instruments, particularly Principle 10 of the Rio 
</p>
<p>Declaration, which provides that &#8220;each individual shall have appropriate access to 
</p>
<p>information concerning the environment that is held by public authorities&#8221; and &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>opportunity to participate in decision-making processes&#8221;, and that &#8220;effective access to 
</p>
<p>judicial and administrative proceedings, including redress and remedy, shall be provided.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>26. The following sections of this report describe good practices in the use of each of 
</p>
<p>these procedural obligations. This section describes several practices that are relevant to the 
</p>
<p>full range of procedural obligations.   
</p>
<p>27. One such practice was the adoption in 2010 by the UNEP Governing Council of the 
</p>
<p>Bali Guidelines for the Development of National Legislation on Access to Information, 
</p>
<p>Public Participation and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, 26 voluntary </p>


<p>guidelines that assist States to implement their commitments to Principle 10.4 UNEP is 
</p>
<p>preparing a comprehensive guide for the implementation of the Bali Guidelines, which will 
</p>
<p>be published in 2015.  
</p>
<p>28. Another good practice is the implementation of these procedural obligations through 
</p>
<p>regional agreements. In 1998, the States members of the United Nations Economic 
</p>
<p>Commission for Europe adopted the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public 
</p>
<p>Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, which 
</p>
<p>states that:  
</p>
<p>to contribute to the protection of the right of every person of present and future 
</p>
<p>generations to live in an environment adequate to his or her health and well-being, 
</p>
<p>each Party shall guarantee the rights of access to information, public participation in 
</p>
<p>decision-making, and access to justice in environmental matters in accordance with 
</p>
<p>provisions of this Convention (art. 1).  
</p>
<p>The Convention sets out detailed requirements for the implementation of each of these 
</p>
<p>access rights. As of January 2015, the Convention has 47 Parties, which include virtually all 
</p>
<p>of the States in Europe as well as a number of States in Central Asia. 
</p>
<p>29. To facilitate the implementation of the Convention, the Organization for Security 
</p>
<p>and Co-operation in Europe maintains a network of Aarhus Centres, including in Albania, 
</p>
<p>Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Montenegro, Serbia and 
</p>
<p>Tajikistan. The Centres disseminate environmental information, carry out educational and 
</p>
<p>training projects, and provide venues where the public can discuss environmental concerns. 
</p>
<p>For example, the Khujand Aarhus Centre in northern Tajikistan conducted a campaign in 
</p>
<p>the town of Taboshar to raise its residents&#8217; awareness of the health risks associated with a 
</p>
<p>nearby abandoned uranium mine.  
</p>
<p>30. Nineteen States in Latin America and the Caribbean, with the assistance of the 
</p>
<p>Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, decided in November 2014 to 
</p>
<p>begin negotiation of a new regional agreement that would implement the access rights set 
</p>
<p>out in Principle 10, with a view to completing the negotiation by December 2016. Together 
</p>
<p>with the Aarhus Convention, this initiative will provide invaluable models to other regions 
</p>
<p>considering similar agreements. 
</p>
<p>31. Civil society organizations have also engaged in exemplary practices designed to 
</p>
<p>facilitate the exercise of procedural rights to information, participation and remedy. One of 
</p>
<p>the most notable is The Access Initiative (TAI), a global network of more than 150 civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations that work together to promote procedural rights. TAI has developed a 
</p>
<p>toolkit that helps civil society to assess environmental governance in their countries and to 
</p>
<p>identify opportunities to make positive changes. Together with the World Resources 
</p>
<p>Institute, TAI is also developing an Environmental Democracy Index, which will measure 
</p>
<p>country-specific realization of the three procedural rights according to indicators based on 
</p>
<p>the Bali Guidelines. The Index should be available in 2015.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Obligation to make environmental information public 
</b></p>
<p>32. Human rights bodies have made clear that to protect human rights from 
</p>
<p>environmental harm, States should provide access to environmental information 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/53, para. 31). Many States have adopted laws providing for such access. For 
</p>
<p>example, Chile has enacted a law that includes a detailed statement of the right of everyone 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 UNEP Governing Council Dec. SS.XI/5 (26 February 2010). </p>


<p>to have access to environmental information in the possession of the Government, and that 
</p>
<p>provides for administrative and judicial review of alleged violations. The Czech Republic 
</p>
<p>has adopted a law that allows individuals to request access to different types of information 
</p>
<p>through multiple means, and that requires the Government to provide the information as 
</p>
<p>quickly as possible and at the latest within 30 days of the request. Any decision to deny 
</p>
<p>requested information is subject to administrative and judicial review.  
</p>
<p>33. Some States have undertaken innovative approaches to obtaining environmental 
</p>
<p>information. For example, El Salvador operates an Environmental Observatory that 
</p>
<p>systematically monitors potential environmental threats based on observations by a network 
</p>
<p>of local observers. The Observatory provides early warning of natural disasters, including 
</p>
<p>hurricanes and earthquakes, so that responses can minimize their effects on life and 
</p>
<p>property.  
</p>
<p>34. Another good practice is the publication of annual reports on the state of the 
</p>
<p>environment. Examples include reports by the Czech Republic that evaluate the state of the 
</p>
<p>Czech environment based on 36 indicators, reports by South Africa focusing on 
</p>
<p>enforcement activities, and reports by Spain that were recently redesigned to facilitate their 
</p>
<p>viewing by electronic means, including on mobile devices.  
</p>
<p>35. Some of the most innovative practices in respect of environmental information 
</p>
<p>concern education and awareness-raising. For example, Algeria includes environmental 
</p>
<p>education as one of the key topics of its national plan of action for environment and 
</p>
<p>sustainable development. It has designed and implemented educational tools for different 
</p>
<p>levels of schools, as well as organizing seminars and workshops to train teachers. Ghana 
</p>
<p>has instituted the AKOBEN programme to assess the performance of mining and 
</p>
<p>manufacturing operations through a five-colour rating scheme that is easily understood by 
</p>
<p>the public. Costa Rica&#8217;s Certificate of Sustainable Tourism programme assigns companies 
</p>
<p>in the tourism industry a &#8220;sustainability level&#8221; rating, which provides information to 
</p>
<p>consumers about the degree to which businesses comply with or exceed environmental 
</p>
<p>standards.  
</p>
<p>36. Another good practice in this area is to raise awareness at the international level of 
</p>
<p>the relationship between human rights and environmental protection. UNEP has taken 
</p>
<p>several important initiatives in this respect. In addition to organizing the consultations with 
</p>
<p>the Independent Expert described above, it has published reports on human rights and the 
</p>
<p>environment, including a joint report with OHCHR to the Rio+20 UN Conference on 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Development in 2012 and a compendium of resources on human rights and the 
</p>
<p>environment in 2014. 
</p>
<p>37. At the regional level, in October 2013, the Asia-Europe Meeting convened more 
</p>
<p>than 130 government officials, academics, and civil society representatives from 48 Asian 
</p>
<p>and European countries to discuss the challenges presented by environmental harm to the 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights. In September 2014, the ASEAN Intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights organized a workshop on human rights, environment and 
</p>
<p>climate change in Yangon, Myanmar, to discuss the linkages between environmental 
</p>
<p>sustainability and human rights in light of the inclusion of the right to a safe, clean and 
</p>
<p>sustainable environment in the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration adopted in 2012.  
</p>
<p>38. Civil society organizations have also engaged in good practices in education. For 
</p>
<p>example, in Uganda, the National Association of Professional Environmentalists conducts a 
</p>
<p>Sustainability School Programme that builds the capacity of local communities to seek 
</p>
<p>transparency and accountability of oil companies and Governments on environmental 
</p>
<p>matters.  
</p>
<p>39. States have adopted a wide variety of online tools that provide good practices in 
</p>
<p>facilitating access to environmental information. The Czech Republic has created the </p>


<p>Integrated Pollution Register (www.irz.cz), a publicly accessible electronic database that 
</p>
<p>documents environmental releases of 93 substances from domestic facilities. Serbia&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Ecoregister (www.ekoregistar.sepa.gov.rs/en) is a public online database that includes more 
</p>
<p>than 5,000 documents, including educational materials, statistical data on environmental 
</p>
<p>information, environmental impact assessments, and monitoring plans for private 
</p>
<p>companies. Search options allow users to find relevant information by geography, 
</p>
<p>institution or document type, among other criteria. Users can also suggest new institutions 
</p>
<p>and documents for consideration. Other tools are more focused. The South African 
</p>
<p>Department of Environmental Affairs has created the South African Waste Information 
</p>
<p>Centre (http://sawic.environment.gov.za), a website that provides information about waste 
</p>
<p>management. A particularly creative approach to web-based information is Finland&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Tarkkailija, or &#8220;Observer&#8221; (www.etarkkailija.fi), which allows users to identify themes and 
</p>
<p>locations that they would like to monitor. Tarkkailija then collects information from more 
</p>
<p>than 400 websites and informs the users whenever new information relevant to their criteria 
</p>
<p>becomes available.  
</p>
<p>40. Examples of good practices can also be found at the subnational level. Ontario, 
</p>
<p>Canada, has a web-based Environmental Registry (www.ebr.gov.on.ca) that allows the 
</p>
<p>public to access a wide spectrum of environmental information, including public notices of 
</p>
<p>environmental matters proposed by the Government and guidelines for commenting on the 
</p>
<p>proposals. 
</p>
<p>41. There are also good practices in the use of online tools at the regional level. The 
</p>
<p>Aarhus Clearinghouse (http://aarhusclearinghouse.unece.org) is an easy-to-use website that 
</p>
<p>disseminates information on good practices in the implementation of the Aarhus 
</p>
<p>Convention. The Commission for Environmental Cooperation, a regional organization 
</p>
<p>created by Canada, Mexico and the United States of America, compiles and disseminates 
</p>
<p>information on pollutant releases and transfers throughout North America through its 
</p>
<p>Taking Stock report and website (www.cec.org/takingstock). The website allows users to 
</p>
<p>obtain and analyse information based on location, type of pollutant and other criteria. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Obligation to facilitate public participation in environmental decision-
</b></p>
<p><b>making  
</b></p>
<p>42. Human rights bodies have made clear that States have a duty to facilitate public 
</p>
<p>participation in environmental decision-making. This obligation flows from the rights of 
</p>
<p>individuals to participate in the government of their country and in the conduct of public 
</p>
<p>affairs, and is also necessary to safeguard a broad range of rights from environmental 
</p>
<p>harm(A/HRC/23/55, para. 36).  
</p>
<p>43. A large number of States have adopted exemplary statutes providing for public 
</p>
<p>participation in the development of environmental laws. For example, Chile&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Environmental Framework Law provides that the Ministry of Environment should 
</p>
<p>encourage and facilitate public participation in the formulation of policies, plans and 
</p>
<p>environmental standards. To give effect to this provision, the Ministry created a website 
</p>
<p>called e-PAC (http://epac.mma.gob.cl/Pages/Home/index.aspx), which allows citizens to 
</p>
<p>provide comments on every proposed rule or regulation. Greece launched the Open 
</p>
<p>Governance Project in 2009, which requires that draft regulations be made available online 
</p>
<p>for public consultation. Similarly, national agencies in the United States of America must 
</p>
<p>publish notices of proposed rulemaking, and the public has an opportunity to submit written 
</p>
<p>comments that the agencies must take into account. 
</p>
<p>44. In addition, many States have adopted statutes requiring public participation in 
</p>
<p>environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedures. For example, India amended its EIA </p>


<p>law in 2006 to require a public consultation period once a draft EIA is prepared. The law in 
</p>
<p>Trinidad and Tobago provides the public with the opportunity to submit comments on an 
</p>
<p>EIA for at least 30 days after notice for comment is advertised. In the United States, 
</p>
<p>agencies must provide public notice of hearings related to EIAs, and the public may provide 
</p>
<p>comments and seek judicial review of EIA decisions.  
</p>
<p>45. Some States have taken additional steps to promote informed participation by those 
</p>
<p>most affected by environmental harms. Antigua and Barbuda based its Sustainable Island 
</p>
<p>Resource Management Zoning Plan on extensive stakeholder consultation. In 2009, the 
</p>
<p>Government of Finland implemented the Action Programme on eServices and eDemocracy, 
</p>
<p>which was designed to develop new tools for citizen participation in land-use planning. One 
</p>
<p>aspect of the programme is Harava, an interactive map-based application used by local 
</p>
<p>governments to collect feedback from citizens, including by marking on an online map 
</p>
<p>where they believe a new protected area should be located. Another programme, called 
</p>
<p>Alvari, has been adopted at the subnational level in Finland by the city of Tampere. It 
</p>
<p>created public advisory groups that have participated in more than 350 planning-related 
</p>
<p>decisions since 2007.  
</p>
<p>46. Mexico has established consultative councils for sustainable development, which 
</p>
<p>can provide forums for designing and evaluating public policies on environmental issues, as 
</p>
<p>well as helping to reach consensus among interested parties in environmental decision-
</p>
<p>making. Currently, Mexico has a national council and six regional councils, each of which 
</p>
<p>is composed of representatives of civil society organizations, academia, the corporate sector 
</p>
<p>and government agencies. In the United States of America, the Environmental Protection 
</p>
<p>Agency has established &#8220;community advisory groups&#8221; to provide a public forum for local 
</p>
<p>community members to express their concerns relating to the clean-up of hazardous waste 
</p>
<p>sites, and to provide the Agency with community preferences for site remediation.  
</p>
<p>47. Civil society organizations can also play an important role in facilitating public 
</p>
<p>participation. In Mongolia, the Asia Foundation has worked with government agencies, 
</p>
<p>citizens and corporations to create Local Multi-Stakeholder Councils (LMSCs) composed 
</p>
<p>of representatives of mining companies, local governments and communities. The objective 
</p>
<p>of the LMSCs is to ensure a balanced ecosystem and responsible resource use through 
</p>
<p>active participation of many stakeholders. As of 2013, the project had facilitated the 
</p>
<p>establishment of 31 LMSCs. In a number of African countries, Namati, a non-profit 
</p>
<p>organization, has trained &#8220;community paralegals&#8221; to empower individuals and communities 
</p>
<p>to protect their lands and national resources.  For example, in Myanmar, Namati and a local 
</p>
<p>partner organization have trained more than 30 paralegals to help families to register and 
</p>
<p>protect their land rights.  
</p>
<p>48. At the regional level, a good example of facilitating public participation is the Joint 
</p>
<p>Public Advisory Committee (JPAC) to the North American Commission for Environmental 
</p>
<p>Cooperation. The JPAC is composed of 15 citizens, five from each country in North 
</p>
<p>America, who come together to advise the Commission. The JPAC holds meetings and 
</p>
<p>workshops throughout the year in different locations within the three countries.  Decisions 
</p>
<p>of the JPAC and records from its meetings are available on the Commission&#8217;s website 
</p>
<p>(www.cec.org). 
</p>
<p>49. An often overlooked aspect of the obligation to facilitate public participation is the 
</p>
<p>value of assessing the effectiveness of different approaches to such participation. In 
</p>
<p>Mexico, the environmental agency has created an index (the Indice de Participacion 
</p>
<p>Ciudadan del Sector Ambiental, or IPC) that evaluates citizen participation in various 
</p>
<p>institutions relating to environmental decision-making, on the basis of indicators in four 
</p>
<p>main categories: public participation; transparency; inclusion and equality; and citizen 
</p>
<p>complaints. The agency published the first IPC in 2010, and subsequent IPCs have used the 
</p>
<p>2010 report as a baseline in order to assess whether public participation is improving.  </p>


<p><b> D. Obligation to protect the rights of expression and association  
</b></p>
<p>50. The rights of freedom of expression and association are of special importance for 
</p>
<p>public participation in environmental decision-making. States have obligations not only to 
</p>
<p>refrain from violating the rights of free expression and association directly, but also to 
</p>
<p>protect the life, liberty and security of individuals exercising those rights, including when 
</p>
<p>they are exercising their rights in connection with environmental concerns (A/HRC/25/53, 
</p>
<p>para. 40). 
</p>
<p>51. States need to do more to protect environmental human rights defenders from 
</p>
<p>harassment, interference and even death. In 2014, Global Witness reported that between the 
</p>
<p>beginning of 2002 and the end of 2013, 908 people in 35 countries were killed because of 
</p>
<p>their work defending environmental and land rights.5 Even worse, the threats appear to be 
</p>
<p>increasing; Global Witness reported that three times as many defenders were killed in 2012 
</p>
<p>as in 2002.  
</p>
<p>52. There is an urgent need for good practices in the protection of environmental human 
</p>
<p>rights defenders. A number of international institutions and civil society organizations (but 
</p>
<p>not, unfortunately, States) have provided examples of such practices.  
</p>
<p>53. At the regional level, a good practice has been the clarification of legal obligations 
</p>
<p>and the issuance of precautionary measures. In its judgment of 3 April 2009 in <i>Kawas 
</i></p>
<p><i>Fern&#225;ndez </i>v.<i> Honduras</i>, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights held, inter alia, that a 
</p>
<p>State&#8217;s failure to protect the life of an environmental human rights defender and to 
</p>
<p>adequately investigate her death violated her rights to life and to freedom of association. 
</p>
<p>The Court required that the State compensate her relatives and take other steps to publicize 
</p>
<p>the work of environmental defenders.
 
In addition, the Inter-American Commission on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights often issues precautionary measures to protect environmental defenders. 
</p>
<p>54. Notable good practices adopted by civil society organizations include the following: 
</p>
<p>&#61623; The F&#233;d&#233;ration Internationale des Droits de l'Homme (FIDH) and  L&#8217;Organisation 
</p>
<p>Mondiale Contre la Torture (OMCT) have created an Observatory for the Protection 
</p>
<p>of Human Rights Defenders, which provides emergency protection to human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders in the field (including urgent interventions, international missions and 
</p>
<p>material assistance), cooperates with national and international protection 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, and mobilizes the international community and the media to protect 
</p>
<p>defenders.  
</p>
<p>&#61623; FORUM-ASIA provides urgent assistance and protection to human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>at risk, including by providing relocation support, medical assistance and legal aid.  
</p>
<p>&#61623; Protection International has developed training manuals for human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>and disseminated the information to hundreds of defenders through training 
</p>
<p>sessions.  
</p>
<p>&#61623; The Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide (ELAW), a network of 300 public 
</p>
<p>interest advocates from 70 countries, provides legal and scientific support to grass-
</p>
<p>roots environmental lawyers working in their home countries. 
</p>
<p>&#61623; Front Line Defenders issues identification cards to human rights defenders so that 
</p>
<p>they have an easy-to-use tool to show that they are internationally recognized.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 Global Witness, <i>Deadly Environment: The Dramatic Rise in Killings of Environmental and Land 
</i></p>
<p><i>Defenders</i>, April 2014, available at http://www.globalwitness.org/deadlyenvironment/.  </p>


<p>&#61623; The Women&#8217;s Human Rights Defenders International Coalition, a network of 28 
</p>
<p>organizations, provides many support services, including maintaining an online 
</p>
<p>directory of organizations that can assist defenders.  
</p>
<p>&#61623; The Goldman Environmental Prize amplifies the voices of selected grassroots 
</p>
<p>environmentalists by providing them international recognition and financial support.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Obligation to provide access to legal remedies  
</b></p>
<p>55. Human rights agreements have established that States have an obligation to provide 
</p>
<p>for an effective remedy for violations of protected rights, and human rights bodies have 
</p>
<p>applied that principle to human rights whose enjoyment is infringed by environmental harm 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/53, para. 41).  
</p>
<p>56. States have adopted a wide range of good practices in the provision of access to 
</p>
<p>effective remedies for environmental harm, from dedicated environmental tribunals, to 
</p>
<p>procedural rules that facilitate access to courts by environmental plaintiffs, to the 
</p>
<p>increasingly important roles of national human rights institutions, ombudspersons and 
</p>
<p>regional tribunals.  
</p>
<p>57. A number of States have found that one way to ensure that environmental claims are 
</p>
<p>heard by courts with relevant expertise is to establish dedicated environmental courts. The 
</p>
<p>Land and Environment Court of New South Wales, Australia, which was created in 1980, 
</p>
<p>can claim to be the first specialist environmental superior court in the world. The court has 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction over a wide variety of issues, including appeals from environmental permits, 
</p>
<p>Aboriginal land claim cases, criminal proceedings for offences against planning or 
</p>
<p>environmental laws, and mining issues. Other examples of dedicated tribunals with 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction to hear a broad spectrum of environmental claims include Costa Rica&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Environmental Administrative Tribunal, established in 1995, and India&#8217;s National Green 
</p>
<p>Tribunals, established in 2011.  
</p>
<p>58. In most States, environmental cases continue to be heard by courts with general 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction. There are too many instances of such courts deciding environmental disputes 
</p>
<p>through the application of human rights norms to cite them all, but some examples are 
</p>
<p>provided in the next section, on good practices in the use of substantive obligations.  
</p>
<p>59. However, it is important to note here some good practices taken by States to 
</p>
<p>facilitate access to courts by environmental plaintiffs. The Land and Environment Court of 
</p>
<p>New South Wales, for instance, which is located in Sydney, has assisted individuals who 
</p>
<p>live in rural areas within its jurisdiction by allowing cases to be filed in more than 150 local 
</p>
<p>courthouses or through the Internet, and by conducting preliminary hearings by telephone 
</p>
<p>and final hearings at the site of the dispute. It also has a comprehensive website that 
</p>
<p>provides information on how individuals can represent themselves before the court. In the 
</p>
<p>Philippines, the Supreme Court has adopted rules of procedure for environmental cases that 
</p>
<p>allow plaintiffs to bring cases on behalf of others, including minors and future generations. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Costa Rica has broadened 
</p>
<p>standing by allowing individuals to bring actions on behalf of the public interest, including 
</p>
<p>in the interest of environmental protection. Moreover, any person may file a case regarding 
</p>
<p>a constitutional right in Costa Rica without an attorney, with no filing fees, in any language, 
</p>
<p>at any time, and in any form, including handwritten filings. 
</p>
<p>60. The Philippine rules of procedure also address &#8220;strategic lawsuits against public 
</p>
<p>participation&#8221; (SLAPP) suits &#8211; that is, countersuits by defendants against environmental 
</p>
<p>plaintiffs, which are designed to discourage them from seeking legal remedies. The 
</p>
<p>Philippine rules allow affected plaintiffs to call possible SLAPP suits to the attention of the </p>


<p>court, which may then shift the burden to the defendant to demonstrate that the suit is not a 
</p>
<p>SLAPP suit. If the court dismisses the SLAPP suit, it may award damages and attorneys&#8217; 
</p>
<p>fees to the environmental plaintiff.  
</p>
<p>61. Ireland has facilitated access to environmental remedies by departing from its 
</p>
<p>normal rule, according to which the winning party is entitled to recover its legal costs from 
</p>
<p>the losing party. This rule can have a chilling effect on environmental plaintiffs that have 
</p>
<p>few resources. Under an act adopted in 2011, plaintiffs bear only their own costs in actions 
</p>
<p>to ensure compliance with environmental requirements, but they may be entitled to recover 
</p>
<p>their costs from defendants if they win. 
</p>
<p>62. In the United States of America, many national environmental statutes allow 
</p>
<p>members of the public to initiate lawsuits against alleged violators. Although the cases are 
</p>
<p>often called &#8220;citizen suits&#8221;, the plaintiffs need not be citizens. The statutes authorize courts 
</p>
<p>to order compliance with the law on the basis of citizen suits, and although the plaintiffs are 
</p>
<p>not authorized to recover damages, they may receive attorneys&#8217; fees.  
</p>
<p>63. Another good practice in connection with the obligation to provide effective 
</p>
<p>remedies for environmental harm is building the relevant expertise of the judiciary. An 
</p>
<p>example in this respect is the series of judicial symposiums on environmental decision-
</p>
<p>making, the rule of law and environmental justice that have been hosted by the Asian 
</p>
<p>Development Bank since 2010. A key outcome of these meetings has been the creation of 
</p>
<p>the Asian Judges Network on Environment, which facilitates the sharing of information and 
</p>
<p>experience among senior judges in countries belonging to ASEAN and the South Asian 
</p>
<p>Association for Regional Cooperation. The Network has its own website 
</p>
<p>(www.asianjudges.org), which provides a database of national environmental laws as well 
</p>
<p>as information on upcoming events. 
</p>
<p>64. The Organization of American States programme on judicial facilitators, which it 
</p>
<p>has developed in cooperation with various States (including Argentina, Costa Rica, El 
</p>
<p>Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and Paraguay), is another good 
</p>
<p>practice in the provision of effective remedies. Judicial facilitators are nominated by local 
</p>
<p>communities and appointed by judges under whose supervision they work. After they have 
</p>
<p>received training, they can undertake a number of functions, including providing technical 
</p>
<p>assistance to individuals in the preparation of claims, providing mediation between parties, 
</p>
<p>and assisting in the assessment of damages.  
</p>
<p>65. Yet another good practice in this area is the use of national human rights institutions 
</p>
<p>to address environmental issues. For example, the Kenyan national commission on human 
</p>
<p>rights has increasingly focused on environmental concerns, including by investigating 
</p>
<p>forced evictions in a protected area, and human rights violations and environmental 
</p>
<p>degradation occurring at salt manufacturing companies. In Mexico, the national human 
</p>
<p>rights commission made a number of recommendations concerning environmental 
</p>
<p>protection even before the Mexican Constitution was amended in 2012 to include a right to 
</p>
<p>a healthy environment. In Thailand, the subcommittee on civil and political rights of the 
</p>
<p>national human rights commission found in 2012 that the commission had jurisdiction to 
</p>
<p>examine alleged human rights violations in a sugar cane plantation in Cambodia owned 
</p>
<p>indirectly by a Thai company.  
</p>
<p>66. The Malaysian national human rights commission (SUHAKAM) has used &#8220;national 
</p>
<p>inquiries&#8221; to examine systemic human rights issues. An important recent example of its use 
</p>
<p>of the national inquiry process in the environmental context was the National Inquiry into 
</p>
<p>the Land Rights of Indigenous Peoples, undertaken to investigate violations related to the 
</p>
<p>land rights of indigenous peoples in Malaysia. Between 2002 and 2010, SUHAKAM 
</p>
<p>received numerous complaints from indigenous peoples, including allegations of 
</p>
<p>encroachment and/or dispossession of land, and of delays in processing requests for </p>


<p>indigenous titles. SUHAKAM decided to address the root causes of the issues 
</p>
<p>comprehensively by taking cognizance of the experiences of indigenous peoples throughout 
</p>
<p>the country. Its National Inquiry resulted in a final report published in April 2013, with 
</p>
<p>detailed findings and 18 recommendations.  
</p>
<p>67. Some States have officials dedicated to protecting constitutional rights, which 
</p>
<p>provide another avenue for ensuring access to remedies for environmental harm. For 
</p>
<p>example, Brazil&#8217;s Ministerio Publico, or public prosecutor, has broad powers to enforce 
</p>
<p>constitutional rights, including the constitutional right to an ecologically balanced 
</p>
<p>environment. The Ministerio Publico has been very active in promoting environmental 
</p>
<p>protection, bringing more than 4,000 environmental cases in the state of Sao Paulo alone. 
</p>
<p>68. A number of States have ombudspersons who have taken an active role in 
</p>
<p>environmental protection. For example, much of the work of the Costa Rican 
</p>
<p>ombudsperson in recent years has concerned environmental issues. In 2011, about 10 per 
</p>
<p>cent of the more than 3,000 cases received by the office of the ombudsperson concerned the 
</p>
<p>right to a healthy environment. Similarly, since 2013, the Croatian ombudsperson has 
</p>
<p>received 20 complaints relating to environmental protection and another 19 relating to noise 
</p>
<p>pollution. In Portugal, the office of the ombudsperson has also acted on complaints relating 
</p>
<p>to environmental protection, as well as acting on its own initiative, including with respect to 
</p>
<p>illegal construction in a national park.  
</p>
<p>69. A pathbreaking development was the establishment in 2007 of Hungary&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>ombudsperson for future generations. The ombudsperson has the authority to initiate or 
</p>
<p>participate in investigations upon receiving complaints, to submit petitions to the 
</p>
<p>constitutional court, and to initiate intervention in public administrative court cases 
</p>
<p>regarding environmental protection.  
</p>
<p>70. At the regional level, human rights commissions and courts have been in the 
</p>
<p>forefront of bringing human rights norms to bear on environmental issues. The African 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the Court of Justice of the Economic 
</p>
<p>Community of West African States, the European Court of Human Rights, the Inter-
</p>
<p>American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>have all considered complaints of human rights violations involving environmental harm, 
</p>
<p>and together are developing a detailed jurisprudence on environmental human rights law.  
</p>
<p>71. Another good practice is the inclusion in regional environmental agreements of 
</p>
<p>procedures that allow members of the public to raise claims for independent investigation 
</p>
<p>and reporting. For example, the Submissions on Enforcement Matters process established 
</p>
<p>by the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation allows a resident of any 
</p>
<p>of the three North American countries to file a claim that one of the States is failing to 
</p>
<p>enforce its domestic environmental law. Although the Commission cannot issue binding 
</p>
<p>decisions, its secretariat can investigate the claim and issue a public report. This practice 
</p>
<p>has also been adopted in some bilateral and regional trade agreements between the United 
</p>
<p>States of America and other countries. Similarly, the Aarhus Convention establishes a 
</p>
<p>Compliance Committee with the authority to review the compliance of parties with their 
</p>
<p>obligations under the Convention, including on the basis of communications by members of 
</p>
<p>the public. The Committee can issue reports and make non-binding recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Substantive obligations 
</b></p>
<p>72. In addition to the procedural obligations described above, States have substantive 
</p>
<p>obligations to adopt and implement legal frameworks to protect against environmental harm 
</p>
<p>that may interfere with the enjoyment of human rights (A/HRC/25/53, para. 46). In an 
</p>
<p>important sense, all environmental laws that set stringent standards for air quality, water </p>


<p>quality, toxic releases and/or other environmental matters are good practices for the 
</p>
<p>protection of the many human rights that depend on a healthy environment. However, this 
</p>
<p>section focuses on practices that link strong environmental standards more explicitly to 
</p>
<p>human rights. 
</p>
<p>73. Perhaps the most important example in this category is the proliferation of 
</p>
<p>constitutional rights to a healthy environment. More than 90 national constitutions now 
</p>
<p>recognize some form of this right. (Many other constitutions include references to the 
</p>
<p>importance of environmental protection.) About two-thirds of these constitutional rights 
</p>
<p>refer to health, and another one-quarter refer to an ecologically balanced environment. 
</p>
<p>Alternative formulations include rights to a clean, safe, favourable or wholesome 
</p>
<p>environment.  
</p>
<p>74. Experts have identified many potential benefits of adopting a constitutional 
</p>
<p>environmental right, including that the recognition of such rights can lead to the enactment 
</p>
<p>of stronger environmental laws, provide a safety net to protect against gaps in statutory 
</p>
<p>environmental laws, raise the profile and importance of environmental protection as 
</p>
<p>compared to competing interests such as economic development, and create opportunities 
</p>
<p>for better access to justice and accountability.6 
</p>
<p>75. Both country visits undertaken by the Independent Expert were to States with strong 
</p>
<p>records of enforcement of constitutional environmental rights, as the separate reports on 
</p>
<p>Costa Rica and France describe in more detail. Judicial decisions in many other countries 
</p>
<p>have also interpreted constitutional environmental rights to require substantive 
</p>
<p>environmental protections. Notable examples include decisions by the Supreme Courts of 
</p>
<p>Argentina and the Philippines.7  
</p>
<p>76. In some States, courts have interpreted other constitutional rights to incorporate 
</p>
<p>environmental protections. A leader in this regard has been the Supreme Court of India, 
</p>
<p>which has interpreted the right to life in the Indian Constitution as applying to 
</p>
<p>environmental threats.8
 
The Supreme Court of Pakistan has taken a similar approach.9
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>77. Constitutional environmental rights can lead to actions by actors other than courts 
</p>
<p>and government agencies. In 2014, the Finnish Ministry of the Environment encouraged all 
</p>
<p>interested actors, including communities, corporations and individuals, to make 
</p>
<p>commitments towards greater sustainability, in accordance with the Finnish Constitution, 
</p>
<p>which states that &#8220;nature and its biodiversity, the environment and the national heritage are 
</p>
<p>the responsibility of everyone&#8221;. The Ministry provided guidance on how commitments can 
</p>
<p>be developed and registered online, as well as examples and indicators for monitoring 
</p>
<p>implementation. 
</p>
<p>78. Of course, whether or not States have adopted a constitutional right to a healthy 
</p>
<p>environment, they can and should adopt strong environmental laws. A good practice 
</p>
<p>relating to such laws is their regular review and strengthening, including through the 
</p>
<p>

<p>incorporation and protection of rights. A recent example was the adoption by China of a 
</p>
<p>new framework Environmental Protection Law, which entered into force in January 2015. 
</p>
<p>Among other things, the law sets out the right of citizens, legal persons and other 
</p>
<p>organizations to obtain environmental information, and requires environmental regulators at 
</p>
<p>all levels to disclose environmental information and improve public participation 
</p>
<p>procedures. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Obligations relating to non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p>79. The Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, endorsed by the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council in its resolution 17/4, make clear that States are required to &#8220;protect against 
</p>
<p>human rights abuse within their territory and/or jurisdiction by third parties, including 
</p>
<p>business enterprises&#8221;, including by &#8220;taking appropriate steps to prevent, investigate, punish 
</p>
<p>and redress such abuse through effective policies, legislation, regulations and adjudication&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/17/31, principle 1). The Guiding Principles also state that corporations themselves 
</p>
<p>have a responsibility to respect human rights. The duty to protect and the responsibility to 
</p>
<p>respect extend to human rights abuses caused by pollution or other environmental harm 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/53, para. 60).  
</p>
<p>80. A good practice of States is to commit to support the implementation of the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles, including with respect to activities that may affect the environment. In response 
</p>
<p>to an invitation by the European Commission, European Union member States have 
</p>
<p>submitted plans for national implementation of the Principles. For example, at the request 
</p>
<p>of the Government, the Danish Council on Corporate Social Responsibility produced 
</p>
<p>guidelines to help companies meet international social and environmental requirements in 
</p>
<p>their supply chain. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has 
</p>
<p>committed to implement the Principles by, inter alia, ensuring that agreements facilitating 
</p>
<p>overseas investment do not undermine the host country&#8217;s ability to impose the same 
</p>
<p>environmental and social regulations on foreign investors as it does on domestic firms. 
</p>
<p>81. Another good practice is the preparation of &#8220;sustainability reports&#8221;, which describe 
</p>
<p>the economic, environmental and social impacts caused by companies&#8217; everyday activities. 
</p>
<p>The Global Reporting Initiative, an international non-profit organization that promotes the 
</p>
<p>use of sustainability reporting, has developed comprehensive guidelines for preparing 
</p>
<p>sustainability reports that provide a framework for measuring and reporting sustainability-
</p>
<p>related impact and performance, including through indicators relating to the protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights and the environment. It also hosts a sustainability disclosure database where 
</p>
<p>organizations can publish their reports.  
</p>
<p>82. Individual companies have also reported good practices. For example, Asia Pulp 
</p>
<p>Paper Group (APP), one of the world&#8217;s largest pulp and paper companies, adopted a Forest 
</p>
<p>Conservation Policy in 2013 that provides that where &#8220;new plantations are proposed, APP 
</p>
<p>will respect the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities&#8221;, including recognition 
</p>
<p>of customary land rights, constructive dialogue with stakeholders and responsible handling 
</p>
<p>of complaints. APP has developed an online &#8220;monitoring dashboard&#8221; to allow interested 
</p>
<p>parties to follow progress of the policy.  
</p>
<p>83. The Coca-Cola Company has adopted a human rights policy that commits it to 
</p>
<p>identify, prevent and mitigate the human rights impacts of its business activities, and its 
</p>
<p>contracts with its suppliers require, among other things, that they comply with all applicable 
</p>
<p>environmental laws. It regularly undertakes independent human rights assessments of its 
</p>
<p>suppliers. Similarly, Patagonia, a manufacturer of outdoor clothing and equipment, has 
</p>
<p>been conducting environmental and social audits of its suppliers since 2008. The audits can 
</p>
<p>result in the termination of contracts with companies that do not meet its standards. 
</p>
<p>Patagonia also gives 1 per cent of its annual profits to environmental groups and activists </p>


<p>throughout the world, and reports that in 2014, it donated some $6.6 million to 770 
</p>
<p>environmental groups.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Obligations relating to transboundary environmental harm  
</b></p>
<p>84. Many grave threats to the enjoyment of human rights are due to transboundary 
</p>
<p>environmental harm. Although the precise nature of States&#8217; human rights obligations in this 
</p>
<p>respect is not always clear, there is a strong trend towards encouraging States to take 
</p>
<p>actions to protect against transboundary harm to human rights caused by actions under their 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction or control. Moreover, it is clear that States have an obligation of international 
</p>
<p>cooperation with respect to human rights, which is of particular relevance to global 
</p>
<p>environmental threats such as climate change (A/HRC/25/53, paras. 64, 67).  
</p>
<p>85. In light of the lack of complete clarity in human rights law with regard to 
</p>
<p>transboundary environmental harm, a particularly important good practice is the legal 
</p>
<p>recognition by a State of the rights of individuals who reside outside its territory but who 
</p>
<p>may suffer environmental harm from actions arising within its territory. One example is 
</p>
<p>transboundary environmental impact assessment (EIA) that allows for the participation of 
</p>
<p>the affected public on both sides of the border. The chief international agreement is the 
</p>
<p>Espoo Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context, 
</p>
<p>which sets out detailed requirements for transboundary EIA. As of January 2015, it has 45 
</p>
<p>parties, including most States in Europe. The Convention provides that the party where a 
</p>
<p>covered activity is located must give the public of the affected State an opportunity to 
</p>
<p>participate in the EIA process that is equivalent to the opportunity provided to the public of 
</p>
<p>the State of origin.  
</p>
<p>86. An innovative example of the consideration of transboundary effects beyond the 
</p>
<p>requirements of the Espoo Convention is the effort by the Federated States of Micronesia to 
</p>
<p>participate in the EIA of a proposed expansion of a coal-fired power plant in the Czech 
</p>
<p>Republic, in order to draw attention to the effects of the plant on global climate change, 
</p>
<p>which particularly threatens the inhabitants of Micronesia. In 2011, the Czech Ministry of 
</p>
<p>the Environment issued an impact statement that recognized the Federated States of 
</p>
<p>Micronesia as an &#8220;affected state&#8221;, and that required the owner of the plant to provide a 
</p>
<p>compensation plan that would offset 5 million tons of carbon dioxide and thus mitigate the 
</p>
<p>environmental impact of the project.  
</p>
<p>87. States have also taken creative steps to enable victims of transboundary 
</p>
<p>environmental harm to have access to courts in the jurisdiction where the harm originates. 
</p>
<p>An early example is the 1976 Nordic Environmental Protection Convention, which requires 
</p>
<p>each of its parties (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden) to provide reciprocal access to 
</p>
<p>domestic legal remedies for transboundary environmental harm, allowing foreign residents 
</p>
<p>to pursue whatever remedies in the country of origin that that country would provide to its 
</p>
<p>own residents. An alternative basis for such reciprocal access is exemplified by a model 
</p>
<p>statute adopted by a liaison committee of the Canadian and the U.S. conferences on 
</p>
<p>uniform provincial and state laws. Similarly to the Nordic Convention, the model law 
</p>
<p>provides that &#8220;a person who suffers, or is threatened with, injury to his person or property 
</p>
<p>in a reciprocating jurisdiction caused by pollution originating, or that may originate, in this 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction has the same rights to relief with respect to the injury or threatened injury . . . as 
</p>
<p>if the injury or threatened injury occurred in this jurisdiction.&#8221; The model law has been 
</p>
<p>enacted by seven U.S. states and four Canadian provinces.  
</p>
<p>88. Climate change may be the most challenging international environmental threat to 
</p>
<p>human rights. A number of Governments provide examples of good practices in the use of 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations relating to climate change. In 2012, the Scottish Parliament 
</p>
<p>became the first legislative body in the world to explicitly recognize and support the </p>


<p>concept of climate justice, and in the same year, the Government of Scotland launched a &#163;3 
</p>
<p>million Climate Justice Fund to support the development of water adaptation projects in 
</p>
<p>Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zambia. At the end of 2013, the Government launched a 
</p>
<p>second &#163;3 million Climate Justice Fund. According to the Government, the second round of 
</p>
<p>funding should &#8220;address specific climate justice principles through a human-rights based 
</p>
<p>approach: approaches which empower vulnerable groups in decision-making and access to 
</p>
<p>resources and realizing their rights &#8211; through inclusion, equality, transparency, 
</p>
<p>participation, and information &#8211; and so delivering climate resilience, strengthening civic 
</p>
<p>society, alleviating poverty, and benefiting the wider environment.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>89. Also in 2013, Guatemala adopted a climate change framework law that has several 
</p>
<p>important elements relating to human rights, including provisions that the Government 
</p>
<p>facilitate broad public participation in designing and carrying out climate change actions. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, the Jordanian Ministry of the Environment published a national climate change 
</p>
<p>policy in 2013 that integrates a human rights approach to climate change mitigation and 
</p>
<p>adaptation. The policy lists as a short-term objective that the &#8220;interests of vulnerable 
</p>
<p>groups, with emphasis on the poor, youth and gender are adequately addressed in mitigation 
</p>
<p>and adaptation policies and strategies.&#8221; The policy also provides for a campaign to increase 
</p>
<p>public awareness and facilitate public consultation.  
</p>
<p>90. Two other States provide good practices in ensuring that efforts to abate or adapt to 
</p>
<p>climate change respect the rights of indigenous and tribal peoples. The Reducing Emissions 
</p>
<p>from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) programme, which was initiated by 
</p>
<p>the sixteenth Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate 
</p>
<p>Change, creates incentives for developing countries to reduce emissions from deforestation 
</p>
<p>and forest degradation, including through forest conservation and sustainable management. 
</p>
<p>To avoid conflicts and to protect the rights of indigenous peoples in forests that might be 
</p>
<p>subject to REDD+ projects, Suriname created the REDD+ Assistants Programme, in which 
</p>
<p>representatives selected by their own communities are trained by the Government to 
</p>
<p>understand REDD+ and to help involve indigenous and tribal peoples in the REDD+ 
</p>
<p>decision-making process. 
</p>
<p>91. In Australia, the National Indigenous Climate Change project is a forum established 
</p>
<p>in 2008 by indigenous leaders to facilitate dialogue between corporate representatives, 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples and other experts about climate change and participation in carbon 
</p>
<p>markets. According to the project&#8217;s webpage (www.indigenousclimatechange.com.au), the 
</p>
<p>project, &#8220;(along with other organizations and alliances representing Indigenous 
</p>
<p>perspectives) has worked to identify mutual opportunities with representatives of Corporate 
</p>
<p>Australia and to have issues such as land tenure, native title and cultural and moral rights 
</p>
<p>addressed by Government in the formulation of an emissions trading scheme.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>92. International cooperation can be found not only at the level of national 
</p>
<p>Governments, but also between local municipalities. A good practice in this respect is the 
</p>
<p>partnership between the cities of Mwanza, Tanzania, and Tampere, Finland. Since 2002, the 
</p>
<p>cities have partnered in various environmental activities, sharing knowledge and 
</p>
<p>experiences. The results include an afforestation programme, the demarcation of village 
</p>
<p>woodlands, and environmental management training seminars.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Obligations relating to members of groups in vulnerable situations 
</b></p>
<p>93. The human rights obligations relating to the environment include a general 
</p>
<p>obligation of non-discrimination in the application of environmental law and policy. As 
</p>
<p>described by the Independent Expert in his mapping report, States have additional 
</p>
<p>obligations with respect to those who may be particularly vulnerable to environmental </p>


<p>harm, including women, children, minorities and those living in poverty, as well as 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples (A/HRC/25/53, paras. 69-78).  
</p>
<p>94. For example, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
</p>
<p>has emphasized that States should ensure that public participation in environmental 
</p>
<p>decision-making, including with respect to climate policy, includes the concerns and 
</p>
<p>participation of women. The Feminist Participatory Action Research programme of the 
</p>
<p>Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development is a good practice in empowering 
</p>
<p>women to participate in policy debates over climate change. Together with local partner 
</p>
<p>organizations, the Asia Pacific Forum helps women in rural, indigenous and urban poor 
</p>
<p>communities to document their own experiences by setting their own research agenda, 
</p>
<p>conducting the research themselves and advocating for change as a result. For example, 
</p>
<p>after conducting its own research, a community in the Philippines passed a resolution to 
</p>
<p>prevent the use of destructive fishing practices and now requires individuals to adhere to 
</p>
<p>strict fishing and hunting schedules.  
</p>
<p>95. The rights of children are often overlooked in setting environmental policies. The 
</p>
<p>United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) is partnering with countries to try to reduce the 
</p>
<p>effects of climate change and environmental degradation on children&#8217;s rights, and to 
</p>
<p>&#8220;identify and enhance opportunities to advance the rights of children which arise from 
</p>
<p>global and local attention on climate change and environmental degradation.&#8221; In Burundi, 
</p>
<p>for example, UNICEF is implementing Project Lumi&#232;re, which enables community groups 
</p>
<p>to purchase bicycle pedal-powered generators and LED lights that can provide light for a 
</p>
<p>household for up to 10 days. Access to energy protects child health and safety by reducing 
</p>
<p>harmful emissions from the burning of kerosene and firewood in homes, and by providing 
</p>
<p>light at night for children to study.  
</p>
<p>96. In the United States of America, an Executive Order issued in 1994 by the President 
</p>
<p>provides a basis for continuing attention to the environmental and human health effects of 
</p>
<p>actions by the national Government on members of minority and low-income groups, as 
</p>
<p>well as on indigenous peoples, with the goal of achieving &#8220;environmental justice&#8221; for all 
</p>
<p>communities. The Executive Order requires agencies of the Government to address any 
</p>
<p>potentially adverse human health or environmental effects of their activities on members of 
</p>
<p>minority or low-income populations. Each major agency has a working group on 
</p>
<p>environmental justice, which provides guidance for that agency and coordination with other 
</p>
<p>agencies. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has developed Environmental 
</p>
<p>Justice Access Plans that set out measurable commitments. By engaging with 
</p>
<p>environmental justice advocates and communities through community research and open 
</p>
<p>dialogue, the Agency strives to ensure public participation in integrating environmental 
</p>
<p>justice into day-to-day work and decision-making. 
</p>
<p>97. A number of international instruments and human rights bodies have detailed the 
</p>
<p>obligations of States with respect to indigenous peoples, whose rights are particularly 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to environmental harm. Among other duties, States should recognize the rights 
</p>
<p>of indigenous peoples with respect to the territory that they have traditionally occupied, 
</p>
<p>including the natural resources on which they rely, facilitate the participation of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples in decisions that concern them, guarantee that the indigenous community affected 
</p>
<p>receives a reasonable benefit from any such development, and provide access to remedies, 
</p>
<p>including compensation, for harm caused by the activities (A/HRC/25/53, para. 78).  
</p>
<p>98. Many good practices were presented in relation to indigenous rights. At the regional 
</p>
<p>level, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has done a great deal to clarify the 
</p>
<p>obligations of States relating to indigenous and tribal peoples&#8217; rights in the territory that </p>


<p>they have traditionally occupied.10 At the national level, a number of courts have also issued 
</p>
<p>decisions clarifying the rights of tribal peoples. For example, the Supreme Court of Mexico 
</p>
<p>decided in 2013 that the Government had not adequately consulted with the Yaqui tribe 
</p>
<p>with respect to construction of an aqueduct, and that the authorization of the project must 
</p>
<p>wait until after consultation takes place. Also in 2013, the Supreme Court of India 
</p>
<p>requested the state of Odisha to consult with tribal assemblies in accordance with the Indian 
</p>
<p>Forest Rights Act, which recognizes a broad range of customary forest rights of tribal 
</p>
<p>peoples and traditional forest dwellers, in connection with an application to clear a forest 
</p>
<p>area to mine for bauxite. After the tribal assemblies rejected the proposal, the Minister for 
</p>
<p>the Environment and Forests turned down the application. 
</p>
<p>99. Another type of good practice is legislative action that recognizes the legal rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous representatives in natural resources. After many years of legal uncertainty about 
</p>
<p>the management and use of natural resources in the county of Finnmark, the ancestral land 
</p>
<p>and home of the Sami people, in 2005 the Norwegian Parliament adopted the Finnmark Act 
</p>
<p>through a process of consultation with the Sami Parliament. The Act transferred ownership 
</p>
<p>of the land to a new entity governed by a board half of whose members are appointed by 
</p>
<p>the Sami Parliament, and created a special court to decide disputes concerning land rights.  
</p>
<p>100. Indigenous organizations have engaged in good practices to protect indigenous 
</p>
<p>rights and promote the sustainable use of resources, including in connection with protected 
</p>
<p>areas. For example, the Commission on Environmental, Economic and Social Policy of the 
</p>
<p>International Union for Conservation of Nature, the Forest Peoples Programme and other 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations help local communities to assess and redress situations 
</p>
<p>where they believe that they have been negatively affected by the designation or 
</p>
<p>management of a protected area.  
</p>
<p>101. An example of a good practice in the management of protected areas is provided by 
</p>
<p>the Sarstoon Temash Institute for Indigenous Management (SATIIM), a community-based 
</p>
<p>indigenous environmental organization that co-manages, together with the Forest 
</p>
<p>Department of Belize, the Sarstoon Temash National Park on lands traditionally used by 
</p>
<p>indigenous Garifuna and Maya communities. With the assistance of SATIIM, in 2008 the 
</p>
<p>communities of Conejo and Santa Teresa prepared forest sustainable management plans, 
</p>
<p>which identify the timber and other resources that each community can harvest based on 
</p>
<p>ecological surveys, and which include mitigation measures for any possible adverse effects 
</p>
<p>on the environment.  
</p>
<p>102. Another good practice is raising the awareness of indigenous communities of their 
</p>
<p>rights. Natural Justice, a civil society organization based in South Africa, assists local 
</p>
<p>communities and indigenous groups to prepare &#8220;community protocols&#8221; that set out their 
</p>
<p>understanding of their customary, national and international rights relating to their land and 
</p>
<p>natural resources. Each community develops its own protocols in a format that is most 
</p>
<p>meaningful to that community. Protocols can be written documents, and can also take the 
</p>
<p>form of visual art, theatre or music.  
</p>

<p><b>good practices should not obscure the work that remains to be done to ensure that

<p>106.<b> Many areas require further attention in this respect. The Independent Expert

<p><b>continues to emphasize the importance of two areas in particular: the importance of

<p><b>clarifying and implementing human rights obligations relating to transboundary
