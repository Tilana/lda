statelessness and protection of stateless persons No. 106 (LVII) - 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> of the endorsement by the General Assembly, in its resolution 41/70 of

ethnicity, race, religion or language,

statelessness, and in this regard expressing concern at various forms of discrimination against

</p>

Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and the Convention relating to the Status of

been arbitrarily deprived of their nationality;
