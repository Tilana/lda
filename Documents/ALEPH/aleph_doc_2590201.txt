Table Of Contents
Note 1.    Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statements and notes to the interim condensed consolidated
financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items and
items which are nonrecurring, necessary to present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Hecla Mining Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (“we” or
“our” or “us”).  See Note 4 and Note 13 for information on adjustments which are
nonrecurring contained in the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial
statements and related footnotes as set forth in our annual report filed on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015, as it may be amended from time to time.
The results of operations for the periods presented may not be indicative of those which
may be expected for a full year.  The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
in audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to those rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures are
adequate for the information not to be misleading.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period and the disclosures of contingent liabilities.  Accordingly,
ultimate results could differ materially from those estimates.
Note 2.    Investments and Restricted Cash
Investments
Our current investments, which are classified as "available for sale" and consist of bonds
having maturities of greater than 90 days, had a fair value and cost basis of $15.1 million at
June 30, 2016. We held no such investments as of December 31, 2015.
At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of our non-current investments was
$4.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively.  Our non-current investments consist of
marketable equity securities which are carried at fair value, and are primarily classified as
“available-for-sale.”  The cost basis of our non-current investments was approximately
$3.2 million and $4.0 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. During
the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, we recognized impairment charges against current
earnings of $1.0 million and $2.8 million, respectively, as we determined the impairments to
be other-than-temporary.
Restricted Cash and Investments
Various laws, permits, and covenants require that funds be in place for certain
environmental and reclamation obligations and other potential liabilities.  We had a current
restricted cash balance of $3.9 million as of June 30, 2016 representing funds deposited in
escrow to be applied towards a potential settlement of environmental matters for the South
Dakota and Colorado Superfund sites related to CoCa Mines, Inc. (see Note 4 for more
information). Our non-current restricted investments are used primarily for reclamation
funding or for funding surety bonds, and were $1.0 million at each of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. Non-current restricted investments primarily represent investments in
money market funds and certificates of deposit.

As of June 30, 2016, we have a net deferred tax asset in the U.S. of $33.5 million, a net
deferred tax liability in Canada of $128.4 million, and a net deferred tax asset in Mexico of
$9.3 million, for a consolidated worldwide net deferred tax liability of $85.6 million. Our
ability to utilize our deferred tax assets depends on future taxable income generated from
operations. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balances of the valuation
allowances on our deferred tax assets were $110 million and $116 million, respectively,
primarily for net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of the deferred
tax asset considered recoverable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates
of future taxable income are reduced.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, there was a change in judgment about the
realizability of our deferred tax assets in Mexico. Based on revised projections of future
taxable income, tax net operating losses are now projected to be fully utilized. The
valuation allowance in Mexico decreased to $1.3 million based on this change in judgment.
The current income tax provisions for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
vary from the amounts that would have resulted from applying the statutory income tax
rate to pre-tax income due primarily to the effects of percentage depletion for all periods
presented and the impact of taxation in foreign jurisdictions.
Note 4.    Commitments, Contingencies and Obligations
General
We follow the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards
Codification ("ASC") guidance in determining our accruals and disclosures with respect to
loss contingencies, and evaluate such accruals and contingencies for each reporting
period. Accordingly, estimated losses from loss contingencies are accrued by a charge to
income when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates
that it is probable that a liability could be incurred and the amount of the loss can be
reasonably estimated. Legal expenses associated with the contingency are expensed as
incurred. If a loss contingency is not probable or reasonably estimable, disclosure of the
loss contingency is made in the financial statements when it is at least reasonably
possible that a material loss could be incurred.

Emerald Mining & Leasing, LLC (“EML”) and certain other parties with respect to a land
package in the Creede Mining District of Colorado that is adjacent to other land held by
Rio. Rio holds a 70% interest in the joint venture. In connection with the joint venture, we
are required to guarantee certain environmental remediation-related obligations of EML to
a third party up to a maximum liability to us of $2.5 million. As of June 30, 2016, we have
not been required to make any payments pursuant to the guaranty. We may be required to
make payments in the future, limited to the $2.5 million maximum liability, should EML fail
to meet its obligations to the third party. However, to the extent that any payments are
made by us under the guaranty, EML, in addition to other parties, has jointly and severally
agreed to reimburse and indemnify us for any such payments. We have not recorded a
liability relating to the guaranty as of June 30, 2016.
Lucky Friday Water Permit Matters
Over the last several years, the Lucky Friday unit has experienced several regulatory
issues relating to its water discharge permits and water management more generally. In
December 2013, the EPA issued to Hecla Limited a notice of violation (“2013 NOV”)
alleging certain storm water reporting violations under Lucky Friday’s Clean Water Act
Multi-Sector General Stormwater Permit for Industrial Activities. The alleged violations
were resolved. The 2013 NOV also contained a request for information under Section 308
of the Clean Water Act directing Hecla Limited to undertake a comprehensive groundwater
investigation of Lucky Friday’s tailings pond no. 3 to evaluate whether the pond is causing
the discharge of pollutants via seepage to groundwater that is discharging to surface
water.
We completed the investigation mandated by the EPA and submitted a draft report to the
agency in December 2015. We are waiting for the EPA’s response, and until such time as
the process is complete, we cannot predict what the impact of the investigation will be.
Hecla Limited strives to maintain its water discharges at the Lucky Friday unit in full
compliance with its permits and applicable laws, however, we cannot provide assurance
that in the future it will be able to fully comply with the permit limits and other regulatory
requirements regarding water management.
Johnny M Mine Area near San Mateo, McKinley County, New Mexico
In May 2011, the EPA made a formal request to Hecla Mining Company for information
regarding the Johnny M Mine Area near San Mateo, McKinley County, New Mexico, and
asserted that Hecla Mining Company may be responsible under CERCLA for
environmental remediation and past costs the EPA has incurred at the site. Mining at the
Johnny M was conducted for a limited period of time by a predecessor of our subsidiary,
Hecla Limited. In August 2012, Hecla Limited and the EPA entered into a Settlement
Agreement and Administrative Order on Consent for Removal Action (“Consent Order”),
pursuant to which Hecla Limited agreed to pay (i) $1.1 million to the EPA for its past
response costs at the site and (ii) any future response costs at the site under the Consent
Order, in exchange for a covenant not to sue by the EPA. Hecla Limited paid the
approximately $1.1 million to the EPA for its past response costs and in December 2014,
submitted to EPA the Engineering Evaluation and Cost Analysis (“EE/CA”) for the site.
The EE/CA evaluates three alternative response actions: 1) no action, 2) off-site disposal,
and 3) on-site disposal. The range in estimated costs of these alternatives is $0 to $221
million. In the EE/CA, Hecla Limited recommended that EPA approve on-site disposal,
which is currently estimated to cost $5.6 million, on the basis that it is the most appropriate
response action under CERCLA. In June 2015, the EPA approved the EE/CA, with a few
minor conditions. The EPA still needs to publish the EE/CA for public notice and
comment, and the agency will not make a final decision on the appropriate response
action until the public comment process is complete. It is anticipated that Hecla Limited will
implement the response action selected by the EPA pursuant to an amendment to the
Consent Order or a new order. Based on the foregoing, we believe it is probable that Hecla
Limited will incur a liability for remediation at the site, and our best estimate of that liability
as of the date of this report is $5.6 million, and we have accrued that amount. There can be
no assurance that Hecla Limited’s liability will not be more than $5.6 million, or that its
ultimate liability will not have a material adverse effect on Hecla Limited’s or our results of
operations or financial position.
In August 2016, we learned that an individual filed a lawsuit against Hecla Limited
and certain affiliates in state court in New Mexico alleging personal injury claims arising
from alleged exposure to contaminants as a result of allegedly living on land adjacent to
the Johnny M mine site.  We do not yet have enough information to conclude if Hecla
Limited has any liability or to estimate any loss that it may incur.

Carpenter Snow Creek Site, Cascade County, Montana
In July 2010, the EPA made a formal request to Hecla Mining Company for information
regarding the Carpenter Snow Creek Superfund Site located in Cascade County, Montana.
The Carpenter Snow Creek Site is located in a historic mining district, and in the early
1980s Hecla Limited leased 6 mining claims and performed limited exploration activities at
the site. Hecla Limited terminated the mining lease in 1988.
In June 2011, the EPA informed Hecla Limited that it believes Hecla Limited, among several
other viable companies, may be liable for cleanup of the site or for costs incurred by the
EPA in cleaning up the site. The EPA stated in the June 2011 letter that it has incurred
approximately $4.5 million in response costs and estimated that total remediation costs
may exceed $100 million. Hecla Limited cannot with reasonable certainty estimate the
amount or range of liability, if any, relating to this matter because of, among other reasons,
the lack of information concerning the site.
South Dakota and Colorado Superfund Sites Related to CoCa Mines, Inc.
In 1991, Hecla Limited acquired all of the outstanding common stock of CoCa Mines, Inc.
(“CoCa”).  CoCa is alleged to have held prior property interests and undertaken
exploration activities at the Gilt Edge Mine Superfund site in Lawrence County, South
Dakota, and to have been engaged in exploration and mining activities at or near the
Nelson Tunnel/Commodore Waste Rock Pile Superfund site in Creede, Colorado.  The
United States and the State of South Dakota have alleged that CoCa, along with other
parties, is a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) under CERCLA at the Gilt Edge site.  In
addition, the United States and the State of Colorado have alleged that CoCa is a PRP at
the Nelson Tunnel/Commodore site. The United States, South Dakota and Colorado base
their claims of liability on allegations of CoCa’s historical relationship to each site, and that
CoCa has succeeded to the liabilities of one or more predecessor entities that may have
held certain property interests at the sites or undertaken certain activities.
The United States alleges that it has, to date, incurred $118 million, plus interest, in
response costs at the Gilt Edge site. At the Nelson Tunnel/Commodore site, the EPA
alleges that it has, to date, incurred $10 million, plus interest, in response costs.
As a result of ongoing settlement discussions, Consent Decrees were lodged with the
United States District Court in Colorado on April 14, 2016, that would settle the Nelson
Tunnel/Commodore Waste Rock Pile Superfund site matter, and in South Dakota on April
15, 2016, that would settle the Gilt Edge Superfund site matter.  The Consent Decrees
resolve CoCa’s alleged liabilities for past and future response costs with respect to each
site, and include combined net payments in the aggregate of $9.9 million by CoCa.  With
respect to Gilt Edge, the proposed financial terms require that CoCa pay $3.9 million, as
well as up to $700,000 in any proceeds from a lawsuit CoCa has filed against an
uncooperative insurer.  The remainder of the settlement amount ($6.4 million) would be
paid by insurance companies and another PRP.  With respect to the Nelson Tunnel site,
the proposed financial terms require that CoCa pay $6 million.
As a result, in the second quarter of 2015 we accrued $9.9 million by recording a liability
for the total amount that would be paid by CoCa and an asset for the estimated amount
that would be recovered by CoCa from insurers and the other party to the Gilt Edge
settlement.
The Consent Decrees were published in the Federal Register on April 26, 2016, which
began a 30-day public comment period for each Consent Decree.  No comments were
received and the United States has sought Court approval and entry of each Consent
Decree. The Court entered the Nelson Tunnel/Commodore Waste Rock Pile Consent
Decree on June 15, 2016, and CoCa is required to pay $6 million by August 12, 2016. The
Court has not yet entered the Gilt Edge Consent Decree. If the Court does enter the Gilt
Edge Consent Decree, then CoCa will be obligated to pay $3.9 million within 60 days , and
at that point CoCa will have resolved the claims of (i) the United States and the State of
South Dakota with respect to the Gilt Edge site, and (ii) the United States and the State of
Colorado with respect to the Nelson Tunnel site, in each case under CERCLA and certain
relevant state statutes, for all past and future response costs at each site.
There can be no assurance that the Gilt Edge Consent Decree will be entered by the Court
and become final and binding.  Accordingly, in the event that matter is not settled, our
accrual could materially change.

Senior Notes
On April 12, 2013, we completed an offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of
6.875% Senior Notes due 2021. The net proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes
were used to partially fund the acquisition of Aurizon Mines Ltd. ("Aurizon") and for
general corporate purposes, including expenses related to the Aurizon acquisition. In
2014, we completed additional issuances of our Senior Notes in the aggregate principal
amount of $6.5 million, which were contributed to one of our pension plans to satisfy the
funding requirement for 2014. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable on May 1 and
November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2013. See Note 9 for more
information.
Other Commitments
Our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2016 included approximately $1.2 million for
various costs. In addition, our open purchase orders at June 30, 2016 included
approximately $1.1 million, $1.9 million and $7.2 million, respectively, for various capital
items at the Lucky Friday, Casa Berardi and Greens Creek units, and approximately $0.6
million, $1.2 million, and $2.8 million, respectively, for various non-capital costs at the
Lucky Friday, Casa Berardi and Greens Creek units. We also have total commitments of
approximately $15.4 million relating to scheduled payments on capital leases, including
interest, primarily for equipment at our Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and Casa Berardi units
(see Note 9 for more information). As part of our ongoing business and operations, we are
required to provide surety bonds, bank letters of credit, and restricted deposits for various
purposes, including financial support for environmental reclamation obligations and
workers compensation programs. As of June 30, 2016, we had surety bonds totaling
$111.2 million in place as financial support for future reclamation and closure costs, self
insurance, and employee benefit plans. We also held a $6.5 million restricted deposit at
June 30, 2016 as financial support for reclamation of the Troy mine acquired as part of the
acquisition of Revett Mining Company, Inc.. The obligations associated with these
instruments are generally related to performance requirements that we address through
ongoing operations. As the requirements are met, the beneficiary of the associated
instruments cancels or returns the instrument to the issuing entity. Certain of these
instruments are associated with operating sites with long-lived assets and will remain
outstanding until closure of the sites. We believe we are in compliance with all applicable
bonding requirements and will be able to satisfy future bonding requirements as they
arise.
Other Contingencies
On April 12, 2013, the family of Larry Marek, an employee of Hecla Limited who was fatally
injured in an April 2011 accident, filed a lawsuit against us and certain of our officers and
employees seeking damages for, among other claims, wrongful death and infliction of
emotional distress. No dollar amount of damages is specified in the complaint, which was
filed in state court in Idaho (Kootenai County District Court). On April 21, 2015, the judge
hearing the case granted Hecla’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case.
The plaintiffs have appealed the decision to the Idaho Supreme Court. We cannot predict
the outcome of this matter, however, we believe the case is without merit and are
vigorously defending this lawsuit.
On December 11, 2013, four employees of Hecla Limited who were injured in a December
2011 rock burst filed a lawsuit against us and certain of our employees seeking damages
for, among other claims, intentional and willful injury and infliction of emotional distress.
The plaintiffs seek damages in excess of $1,000,000, as claimed in the complaint, which
was filed in state court in Idaho (Kootenai County District Court). On August 28, 2015, the
judge hearing the case granted Hecla’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the
case. The plaintiffs have appealed the decision to the Idaho Supreme Court. We cannot
predict the outcome of this matter, however, we believe the case is without merit and
intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit.
We also have certain other contingencies resulting from litigation, claims, EPA
investigations, and other commitments and are subject to a variety of environmental and
safety laws and regulations incident to the ordinary course of business. We currently
expect that the resolution of such contingencies will not materially affect our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. However, in the future, there may be changes
to these contingencies, and additional contingencies may occur as well, any of which
might result in an accrual or a change in the estimated accruals recorded by us, and there
can be no assurance that their ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect
on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 5.    Income (Loss) Per Common Share
We are authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.25 par value per
share. At June 30, 2016, there were 388,800,542 shares of our common stock issued and
3,733,742 shares issued and held in treasury, for a net of 385,066,800 shares outstanding.
For the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, all outstanding options,
restricted share units, and warrants were excluded from the computation of diluted loss
per share, as our reported net losses for those periods would cause their conversion and
exercise to have no effect on the calculation of loss per share. For the three-month and
six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, 3,515,356 restricted stock units that are unvested
or vested in the current period are included in the calculation of diluted income per share.
There were no options outstanding as of June 30, 2016.
Note 6.    Business Segments
We are currently organized and managed in four reporting segments: the Greens Creek
unit, the Lucky Friday unit, the Casa Berardi unit, and the San Sebastian unit. The San
Sebastian unit, a historic operating property for Hecla, resumed commercial production in
the fourth quarter of 2015 and was added as a new reporting segment in 2015.

Note 8.    Shareholders’ Equity
Stock-based Compensation Plans
We periodically grant restricted stock unit awards and/or shares of common stock to our
employees and directors. We measure compensation cost for restricted stock units and
stock grants at the closing price of our stock at the time of grant. Restricted stock unit
grants vest after a specified period with compensation cost amortized over that period.
Although we have no current plans to issue stock options, we may do so in the future.

Table Of Contents
In March 2016, the Board of Directors granted 2,335,196 shares of common stock to
employees for payment of annual and long-term incentive compensation for the period
ended December 31, 2015. The shares were distributed in March 2016, and $5.5 million in
expense related to the stock awards was recognized in the periods prior to March 31,
2016.
In June 2016, the Board of Directors granted the following restricted stock unit awards to
employees:
•
•
952,612 restricted stock units, with one third of those vesting in June 2017, one third vesting in
June 2018, and one third vesting in June 2019;
87,493 restricted stock units, with one half of those vesting in June 2017 and one half vesting in
June 2018; and
•43,187 restricted stock units that vest in June 2017.
The $1.8 million in expense related to the unit awards discussed above vesting in 2017 will
be recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve months following the date of the
award. The $1.6 million in expense related to the unit awards discussed above vesting in
2018 will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the twenty-four months following the
date of the award. The $1.4 million in expense related to the unit awards discussed above
vesting in 2019 will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the thirty-six month period
following the date of the award.
In the second quarter of 2016, a total of 185,353 shares of common stock were granted to
nonemployee directors. We granted a total of 48,246 shares of common stock to
nonemployee directors in the second quarter of 2015.
Stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock unit grants to employees and
shares issued to nonemployee directors recorded in the first six months of 2016 totaled
$3.5 million, compared to $2.3 million in the same period last year.
In connection with the vesting of restricted stock units and other stock grants, employees
have in the past, at their election and when permitted by us, chosen to satisfy their
minimum tax withholding obligations through net share settlement, pursuant to which the
Company withholds the number of shares necessary to satisfy such withholding
obligations.  As a result, in the first six months of 2016 we withheld 997,678 shares valued
at approximately $3.4 million, or approximately $3.40 per share. In the first six months of
2015 we withheld 284,243 shares valued at approximately $0.9 million, or approximately
$3.31 per share.
Common Stock Dividends
In September 2011 and February 2012, our Board of Directors adopted a common stock
dividend policy that has two components: (1) a dividend that links the amount of dividends
on our common stock to our average quarterly realized silver price in the preceding
quarter, and (2) a minimum annual dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock, in each
case, payable quarterly, when and if declared. For illustrative purposes only, the table
below summarizes potential per share dividend amounts at different quarterly average
realized price levels according to the first component of the policy:

On August 3, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a common stock dividend, pursuant to
the minimum annual dividend component of the policy described above, of $0.0025 per
share, for a total dividend of $1.0 million payable in September 2016. Because the average
realized silver price for the second quarter of 2016 was $17.26 per ounce, below the
minimum threshold of $30 according to the policy, no silver-price-linked component was
declared or paid. The declaration and payment of common stock dividends is at the sole
discretion of our Board of Directors.
At-The-Market Equity Distribution Agreement
Pursuant to an equity distribution agreement dated February 23, 2016, we may issue and
sell shares of our common stock from time to time through ordinary broker transactions
having an aggregate offering price of up to $75 million, with the net proceeds available for
general corporate purposes. The terms of sales transactions under the agreement,
including trading day(s), number of shares sold in the aggregate, number of shares sold
per trading day, and the floor selling price per share, are proposed by us to the sales
agent. Whether or not we engage in sales from time to time may depend on a variety of
factors, including share price, our cash resources, customary black-out restrictions, and
whether we have any material inside information. The agreement can be terminated by us
at any time. The shares issued under the equity distribution agreement are registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to our shelf registration statement
on Form S-3, which was filed with the SEC on February 23, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, we
had sold 2,780,087 shares under the agreement for total proceeds of approximately $8.1
million, net of commissions and fees of approximately $166 thousand. Of those amounts,
2,042,812 shares were sold in the second quarter of 2016 for total proceeds of
approximately $6.1 million, net of commissions and fees of approximately $124 thousand.
Common Stock Repurchase Program
On May 8, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase
program.  Under the program, we are authorized to repurchase up to 20 million shares of
our outstanding common stock from time to time in open market or privately negotiated
transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions and other factors.  The
repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued by us at any time.
Whether or not we engage in repurchases from time to time may depend on a variety of
factors, including not only price and cash resources, but customary black-out restrictions,
whether we have any material inside information, limitations on share repurchases or cash
usage that may be imposed by our credit agreement or in connection with issuances of
securities, alternative uses for cash, applicable law, and other investment opportunities
from time to time. As of June 30, 2016, 934,100 shares have been purchased at an average
price of $3.99 per share, leaving 19.1 million shares that may yet be purchased under the
program. The closing price of our common stock at August 2, 2016, was $6.55 per share.
Warrants
At December 31, 2015, we had 2,249,550 warrants outstanding, with each warrant
exercisable for 0.1622 of a share of our common stock at an exercise price of $6.17 per
share. All of the warrants expired in March 2016, and there were no warrants outstanding
as of June 30, 2016.
Note 9.    Senior Notes, Credit Facilities, Note Payable and Capital Leases
Senior Notes
On April 12, 2013, we completed an offering of $500 million in aggregate principal amount
of our Senior Notes due May 1, 2021 in a private placement conducted pursuant to Rule
144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and in 2014, an
additional $6.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes were issued to one
of our pension plans. The Senior Notes were subsequently exchanged for substantially
identical Senior Notes registered with the SEC. The Senior Notes are governed by the
Indenture, dated as of April 12, 2013, as amended (the "Indenture"), among Hecla Mining
Company ("Hecla") and certain of our subsidiaries and The Bank of New York Mellon
Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The net proceeds from the initial offering of the Senior
Notes ($490 million) were used to partially fund the acquisition of Aurizon and for general
corporate purposes, including expenses related to the Aurizon acquisition.

Table Of Contents
The Senior Notes are recorded net of a 2% initial purchaser discount totaling $10 million at
the time of the April 2013 issuance and having an unamortized balance of $6.1 million as of
June 30, 2016. The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.875% per year from the date of
original issuance or from the most recent payment date on which interest has been paid or
provided for.  Interest on the Senior Notes is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each
year, commencing November 1, 2013. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, interest expense related to the Senior Notes and amortization of the initial purchaser
discount and fees related to the issuance of the Senior Notes, net of $7.9 million and $6.6
million, respectively, in capitalized interest, totaled $10.2 million and $11.6 million,
respectively.
The Senior Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our
subsidiaries (the "Guarantors").   The Senior Notes and the guarantees are, respectively,
Hecla's and the Guarantors' general senior unsecured obligations and are subordinated to
all of Hecla's and the Guarantors' existing and future secured debt to the extent of the
assets securing that secured debt.  In addition, the Senior Notes are effectively
subordinated to all of the liabilities of Hecla's subsidiaries that are not guaranteeing the
Senior Notes, to the extent of the assets of those subsidiaries.
The Senior Notes became redeemable in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time
after May 1, 2016, on the redemption dates and at the redemption prices specified in the
Indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption.
Upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Indenture), each holder of
Senior Notes will have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of such holder's
Senior Notes pursuant to a change of control offer (as defined in the Indenture), at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date of purchase, subject to the rights of holders of the Senior Notes
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date.
Credit Facilities
In May 2016, we entered into a $100 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a
three year term. The credit facility is collateralized by the shares of common stock held in
our material domestic subsidiaries and by our joint venture interests in the Greens Creek
mine, all of our rights and interests in the joint venture agreement, and all of our rights and
interests in the assets of the joint venture.  This credit facility replaced our previous $100
million credit facility which had the same terms of collateral as described above. Below is
information on the interest rates, standby fee, and financial covenant terms under our
current credit facility:

Table Of Contents
We are also able to obtain letters of credit under the facility, and for any such letters we are
required to pay a participation fee of between 2.25% and 3.25% based on our total leverage
ratio, as well as a fronting fee to each issuing bank of 0.20% annually on the average daily
dollar amount of any outstanding letters of credit. There were $2.6 million in letters of credit
outstanding as of June 30, 2016.
We believe we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement and no
amounts were outstanding as of June 30, 2016.  We have not drawn funds on the current
revolving credit facility as of the filing date of this report.
Capital Leases
We have entered into various lease agreements, primarily for equipment at our Greens
Creek, Lucky Friday, and Casa Berardi units, which we have determined to be capital
leases.  At June 30, 2016, the total liability balance associated with capital leases, including
certain purchase option amounts, was $15.1 million, with $7.8 million of the liability
classified as current and the remaining $7.3 million classified as non-current. At
December 31, 2015, the total liability balance associated with capital leases was $17.6
million, with $8.7 million of the liability classified as current and $8.8 million classified as
non-current. The total obligation for future minimum lease payments was $15.4 million at
June 30, 2016, with $0.7 million attributed to interest.

Note 10.    Developments in Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09
Revenue Recognition, replacing guidance currently codified in Subtopic 605-10 Revenue
Recognition-Overall with various SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins providing interpretive
guidance. The guidance establishes a new five step principle-based framework in an effort
to significantly enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities,
industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-14 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective
Date. ASU No. 2015-14 defers the effective date of the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 to
annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are in the
process of evaluating this guidance and our method of adoption.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03 Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic
835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The update requires debt
issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet
as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being
presented as an asset. Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability
and the effective interest rate. The update requires retrospective application and
represents a change in accounting principle. The update is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2015. ASU No. 2015-03 has not had a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.
16
Table Of Contents
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11 Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the
Measurement of Inventory. The update provides for inventory to be measured at the lower
of cost and net realizable value, and is effective for the fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of implementing this
update on our consolidated financial statements.
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16 Simplifying the Accounting for
Measurement-Period Adjustments (Topic 805) which eliminates the requirement for an
acquirer to retrospectively adjust the financial statements for measurement-period
adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination is consummated. These
changes become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and as such
they are not expected to have a material impact on prior periods.
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17 Income Taxes - Balance Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740). The update is designed to reduce complexity
of reporting deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and non-current
amounts in a statement of financial position. The FASB has proposed the presentation of
deferred income taxes, changes to deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-
current in the statement of financial position. The update is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU No. 2015-17 is not expected to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements. Our current deferred tax asset balance at
June 30, 2016 was $18.4 million.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01 Financial Instruments - Overall
(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities. The update makes several modifications to Subtopic 825-10, including the
elimination of the available-for-sale classification of equity investments, and requires
equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be measured at fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in net income. The update is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance
on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases (Subtopic 842), which will require
lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and
obligations created by most leases. The update is effective for annual and interim
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the
impact of the guidance on our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic
718). The objective of the update is to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-
based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences and financial
statement classification. The update is effective for annual and interim reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance
on our consolidated financial statements.
Note 11.    Derivative Instruments
Foreign Currency
Our wholly-owned subsidiary owning the Casa Berardi mine is a U.S. dollar ("USD")-
functional entity which routinely incurs expenses denominated in Canadian dollars
("CAD"), and such expenses expose us to exchange rate fluctuations between the USD
and CAD. In April 2016, we initiated a program to manage our exposure to fluctuations in
the exchange rate between the USD and CAD and the impact on our future operating
costs denominated in CAD. The program utilizes forward contracts to sell CAD, and each
contract is designated as a cash flow hedge. As of June 30, 2016, we have 70 forward
contracts outstanding to sell CAD$175 million having a notational amount of US$135.9
million. These contracts represent between 20% and 44% of our forecasted cash operating
costs at Casa Berardi from 2017 through 2020 and have USD-to-CAD exchange rates
ranging between 1.2787 and 1.3031. Our risk management policy provides for up to 75% of
our forecasted CAD-denominated operating costs for five years into the future to be
hedged under such programs, and for potential additional programs to manage other
foreign currency-related exposure areas.
17
Table Of Contents
As of June 30, 2016, we recorded the following balances for the fair value of the contracts:
•a non-current asset of $0.5 million, which is included in other non-current assets;
 •a current liability of $0.1 million, which is included in other current liabilities, and
 •a non-current liability of $0.4 million, which is included in other non-current liabilities.
Net unrealized gains of approximately $46,000 related to the effective portion of the
hedges were included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of June 30, 2016.
Unrealized gains and losses will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive
loss to current earnings as the underlying operating expenses are recognized. We
estimate approximately $0.1 million in net unrealized losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive income as of June 30, 2016 would be reclassified to current earnings in
the next twelve months. Net unrealized losses of approximately $6,000 related to
ineffectiveness of the hedges were included in current earnings for the six months ended
June 30, 2016.
Metals Prices
At times, we may use commodity forward sales commitments, commodity swap contracts
and commodity put and call option contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuation in the
prices of certain metals which we produce. Contract positions are designed to ensure that
we will receive a defined minimum price for certain quantities of our production, thereby
partially offsetting our exposure to fluctuations in the market. These instruments do,
however, expose us to (i) credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties for
contracts in which the contract price exceeds the spot price of a commodity and (ii) price
risk to the extent that the spot price exceeds the contract price for quantities of our
production covered under contract positions.
We are currently using financially-settled forward contracts to manage the exposure to
changes in prices of silver, gold, zinc and lead contained in our concentrate shipments
between the time of shipment and final settlement. In addition, at times we use financially-
settled forward contracts to manage the exposure to changes in prices of zinc and lead
(but not silver and gold) contained in our forecasted future concentrate shipments;
however, there were no open contracts related to this latter program as of June 30, 2016 or
December 31, 2015. These contracts are not designated as hedges and are marked-to-
market through earnings each period.  At June 30, 2016, we recorded a current liability of
$3.4 million on the contracts utilized to manage exposure to prices of metals in our
concentrate shipments, which is included in other current liabilities.
We recognized a $11.8 million net loss during the first six months of 2016 on the contracts
utilized to manage exposure to prices of metals in our concentrate shipments, which is
included in sales of products.  The net loss recognized on the contracts offsets gains
related to price adjustments on our provisional concentrate sales due to changes to silver,
gold, lead and zinc prices between the time of sale and final settlement.
The following tables summarize the quantities of metals committed under forward sales
contracts at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

Our concentrate sales are based on a provisional sales price containing an embedded
derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes.
The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward price at
the time of the sale. The embedded derivative, which relates to the change in price
between sale and settlement, does not qualify for hedge accounting; therefore, it is
adjusted to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement.
Credit-risk-related Contingent Features
We have agreements with certain counterparties that contain a provision whereby we
could be declared in default on our derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying
indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to our default on the indebtedness. As of
June 30, 2016, we have not posted any collateral related to these agreements. The fair
value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes
any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was $3.9 million as
of June 30, 2016. If we had breached any of these provisions at June 30, 2016, we could
have been required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their termination
value of $3.8 million.

Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds and are valued at
cost, which approximates fair value, and a small portion consists of municipal bonds
having maturities of less than 90 days, which are recorded at fair value.
Current available-for-sale securities consist of municipal and corporate bonds having
maturities of more than 90 days, which are recorded at fair value.
Current and non-current restricted cash balances consist primarily of certificates of
deposit, U.S. Treasury securities, and other deposits and are valued at cost, which
approximates fair value.
Our non-current available for sale securities consist of marketable equity securities of
companies in the mining industry which are valued using quoted market prices for each
security.
Trade accounts receivable include amounts due to us for shipments of concentrates, doré
and precipitate sold to customers.  Revenues and the corresponding accounts receivable
for sales of metals products are recorded when title and risk of loss transfer to the
customer (generally at the time of loading on truck or ship).  Sales of concentrates are
recorded using estimated forward prices for the anticipated month of settlement applied to
our estimate of payable metal quantities contained in each shipment.  Sales are recorded
net of estimated treatment and refining charges, which are also impacted by changes in
metals prices and quantities of contained metals.  We estimate the prices at which sales of
our concentrates will be settled due to the time elapsed between shipment and final
settlement with the customer.  Receivables for previously recorded concentrate sales are
adjusted to reflect estimated forward metals prices at the end of each period until final
settlement by the customer.  We obtain the forward metals prices used each period from a
pricing service.  Changes in metal prices between shipment and final settlement result in
changes to revenues previously recorded upon shipment.  The embedded derivative
contained in our concentrate sales is adjusted to fair market value through earnings each
period prior to final settlement.
We use financially-settled forward contracts to manage exposure to changes in the
exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and Canadian Dollar, and the impact on Canadian
Dollar-denominated operating costs incurred at our Casa Berardi Unit (see Note 11 for
more information). These contracts qualify for hedge accounting, with unrealized gains
and losses related to the effective portion of the contracts included in accumulated other
comprehensive loss, and unrealized gains and losses related to the ineffective portion of
the contracts included in earnings each period. The fair value of each contract represents
the present value of the difference between the forward exchange rate for the contract
settlement period as of the measurement date and the contract settlement exchange rate.
We use financially-settled forward contracts to manage the exposure to changes in prices
of silver, gold, zinc and lead contained in our concentrate shipments that have not
reached final settlement.  We also use financially-settled forward contracts to manage the
exposure to changes in prices of zinc and lead contained in our forecasted future
concentrate shipments (see Note 11 for more information).  These contracts do not qualify
for hedge accounting, and are marked-to-market through earnings each period.  The fair
value of each contract represents the present value of the difference between the forward
metal price for the contract settlement period as of the measurement date and the contract
settlement metal price.
Our Senior Notes issued in April 2013, which were recorded at their carrying value of
$500.4 million, net of unamortized initial purchaser discount at June 30, 2016, had a fair
value of $492.6 million at June 30, 2016. Quoted market prices, which we consider to be
Level 1 inputs, are utilized to estimate fair values of the Senior Notes. See Note 9 for more
information.

Note 13.    Acquisitions
Proposed Acquisition of Mines Management, Inc.
On May 23, 2016, we and Mines Management, Inc. ("Mines Management") entered into a
merger agreement pursuant to which we would acquire all of the issued and outstanding
common stock of Mines Management. Mines Management holds 100% ownership of the
Montanore project in Northwest Montana, a significant undeveloped silver and copper
deposit located approximately ten miles from our Rock Creek project. In the proposed
merger, each outstanding common share of Mines Management would be exchanged for
0.2218 of a share of our common stock, which had an estimated value of $0.94 per Mines
Management common share based on the closing price of Hecla's common stock of $4.24
per share on May 20, 2016, the last full trading day before the merger agreement was
entered into. The actual value of consideration transferred will be based on the market
price of Hecla's common stock on the date the merger is consummated. Based on the
closing price of Hecla stock of $6.55 per share on August 2, 2016, total consideration
would be $59.1 million. A 10% change in the price per share of Hecla stock from its closing
price on August 2, 2016 would result in a $5.9 million change in the amount of
consideration transferred in the merger. Estimated consideration is based on us
issuing approximately 9,030,010 shares of our common stock to Mines Management
shareholders in the merger. All consideration given to Mines Management stockholders
will be in newly issued Hecla stock. The proposed merger is subject to approval by Mine
Management's stockholders. No assurance can be given as to whether the merger will be
approved and consummated.
In May 2016, we entered into a term loan and security agreement with Mines Management
pursuant to which we agreed to provide one or more secured loans to Mines Management
in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2.3 million. The loans bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to LIBOR plus 5% and will be due and payable the earlier of September 30,
2016, the date the merger is consummated, or the date of other specified events. The loans
are secured by substantially all of the assets of Mines Management. The balance of the
note as of June 30, 2016 was $1.4 million.
Takeover Bid of Dolly Varden Silver Corporation
On June 27, 2016, we announced a takeover bid for all of the outstanding shares of Dolly
Varden Silver Corporation ("Dolly Varden") not owned by us and our affiliates for cash of
CAD$0.69 per share. Dolly Varden owns 100% of the Dolly Varden historic silver property
in Northwestern British Columbia, Canada. Our wholly owned subsidiary owns 2,620,291
Dolly Varden shares and warrants to purchase 1,250,000 Dolly Varden shares,
representing approximately 19.8% of Dolly Varden's shares outstanding on a partially
diluted basis. Based on Dolly Varden's outstanding shares and options and warrants to
acquire Dolly Varden shares, and excluding shares and warrants held by us and our
affiliates, total consideration would be approximately CAD$13.6 million. In late July 2016,
we withdrew the bid due to the failure of a required condition precedent to its
consummation.
Note 14.    Guarantor Subsidiaries
Presented below are Hecla’s unaudited interim condensed consolidating financial
statements as required by Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, resulting from the guarantees by certain of Hecla's subsidiaries (the
"Guarantors") of the Senior Notes (see Note 9 for more information). The Guarantors
consist of the following of Hecla's 100%-owned subsidiaries: Hecla Limited; Silver Hunter
Mining Company; Rio Grande Silver, Inc.; Hecla MC Subsidiary, LLC; Hecla Silver Valley,
Inc.; Burke Trading, Inc.; Hecla Montana, Inc.; Revett Silver Company; RC Resources, Inc.;
Troy Mine Inc.; Revett Exploration, Inc.; Revett Holdings, Inc.; Hecla Alaska LLC; Hecla
Greens Creek Mining Company; Hecla Admiralty Company; and Hecla Juneau Mining
Company. We completed the initial offering of the Senior Notes on April 12, 2013, and a
related exchange offer for virtually identical notes registered with the SEC on January 3,
2014.
The unaudited interim condensed consolidating financial statements below have been
prepared from our financial information on the same basis of accounting as the unaudited
interim consolidated financial statements set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.
Investments in the subsidiaries are accounted for under the equity method. Accordingly,
the entries necessary to consolidate Hecla, the Guarantors, and Non-Guarantors are
reflected in the intercompany eliminations column. In the course of preparing consolidated
financial statements, we eliminate the effects of various transactions conducted between
Hecla and its subsidiaries and among the subsidiaries. While valid at an individual
subsidiary level, such activities are eliminated in consolidation because, when taken as a
whole, they do not represent business activity with third-party customers, vendors, and
other parties. Examples of such eliminations include the following:
Investments in subsidiaries. The acquisition of a company results in an investment in debt or
equity capital on the records of the parent company and a contribution to debt or equity capital
on the records of the subsidiary. Such investments and capital contributions are eliminated in
consolidation.

Capital contributions. Certain of Hecla's subsidiaries do not generate cash flow, either at all or

•
Capital contributions. Certain of Hecla's subsidiaries do not generate cash flow, either at all or
sufficient to meet their capital needs, and their cash requirements are routinely met with inter-
company advances from their parent companies. On an annual basis, when not otherwise
intended as debt, the boards of directors of such parent companies declare contributions of
capital to their subsidiary companies, which increase the parents' investment and the
subsidiaries' additional paid-in capital. In consolidation, investments in subsidiaries and related
additional paid-in capital are eliminated.
Debt. Inter-company debt agreements have been established between certain of Hecla's
subsidiaries and their parents. The related debt liability and receivable balances, accrued
interest expense (if any) and income activity (if any), and payments of principal and accrued
interest amounts (if any) by the subsidiary companies to their parents are eliminated in
consolidation.
Dividends. Certain of Hecla's subsidiaries which generate cash flow routinely provide cash to
their parent companies through inter-company transfers. On an annual basis, the boards of
directors of such subsidiary companies declare dividends to their parent companies, which
reduces the subsidiaries' retained earnings and increases the parents' dividend income. In
consolidation, such activity is eliminated.
Deferred taxes. Our ability to realize deferred tax assets and liabilities is considered on a
consolidated basis for subsidiaries within the United States, with all subsidiaries' estimated
future taxable income contributing to the ability to realize all such assets and liabilities.
However, when Hecla's subsidiaries are viewed independently, we use the separate return
method to assess the realizability of each subsidiary's deferred tax assets and whether a
valuation allowance is required against such deferred tax assets. In some instances, a parent
company or subsidiary may possess deferred tax assets whose realization depends on the
future taxable incomes of other subsidiaries on a consolidated-return basis, but would not be
considered realizable if such parent or subsidiary filed on a separate stand-alone basis. In such
a situation, a valuation allowance is assessed on that subsidiary's deferred tax assets, with the
resulting adjustment reported in the eliminations column of the guarantor and parent's financial
statements, as is the case in the unaudited interim financial statements set forth below. The
separate return method can result in significant eliminations of deferred tax assets and liabilities
and related income tax provisions and benefits. Non-current deferred tax asset balances are
included in other non-current assets on the consolidating balance sheets and make up a large
portion of that item, particularly for the guarantor balances.

Table Of Contents
Separate financial statements of the Guarantors are not presented because the
guarantees by the Guarantors are joint and several and full and unconditional, except for
certain customary release provisions, including: (1) the sale or disposal of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Guarantor; (2) the sale or other disposition of the
capital stock of the Guarantor; (3) the Guarantor is designated as an unrestricted entity in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the indenture; (4) Hecla ceases to be a
borrower as defined in the indenture; and (5) upon legal or covenant defeasance or
satisfaction and discharge of the indenture.
Effective December 31, 2015, Hecla Limited (our wholly owned subsidiary) sold 100% of its
ownership of Hecla Alaska LLC (its wholly owned subsidiary) to Hecla Mining Company
for consideration totaling approximately $240.8 million.  The consideration consisted of
satisfaction of inter-company debt between Hecla Limited and Hecla Mining Company and
an obligation by Hecla Mining Company, under certain circumstances, to fund a limited
amount of the capital requirements of Hecla Limited for up to five years.  Hecla Alaska LLC
owns a 29.7331% interest in the joint venture which owns the Greens Creek mine.

Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
Certain statements contained in this Form 10-Q, including in Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk, are intended to be covered by the safe harbor
provided for under Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Our forward-looking statements
include our current expectations and projections about future results, performance,
results of litigation, prospects and opportunities, including reserves and other
mineralization. We have tried to identify these forward-looking statements by using words
such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “feel,” “plan,” “estimate,”
“project,” “forecast” and similar expressions.  These forward-looking statements are
based on information currently available to us and are expressed in good faith and
believed to have a reasonable basis.  However, our forward-looking statements are subject
to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results,
performance, prospects or opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or
implied by, these forward-looking statements.
These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, those set forth
under Part I, Item 1A – Business – Risk Factors in our annual report filed on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015, as updated in Part II, Item 1A – Risk Factors in this
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016. Given these risks and
uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking
statements.  All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to
Hecla Mining Company or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their
entirety by these cautionary statements.  Except as required by federal securities laws, we
do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise.
Overview
Hecla Mining Company and our subsidiaries have provided precious and base metals to
the U.S. and worldwide since 1891. We discover, acquire, develop, and produce silver,
gold, lead and zinc.
29
Table Of Contents
We produce lead, zinc and bulk concentrates, which we sell to custom smelters and
brokers, and unrefined precipitate and bullion bars (doré) containing gold and silver,
which are further refined before sale to precious metals traders.  We are organized and
managed into four segments that encompass our operating and development
units:  Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, Casa Berardi, and San Sebastian. The map below
shows the locations of our operating units and our exploration and pre-development
projects, as well as our corporate offices located in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and Vancouver,
British Columbia.
Our current business strategy is to focus our financial and human resources in the
following areas:
•
•
•
•
•operating our properties safely, in an environmentally responsible manner, and cost-effectively;
continue optimizing and improving operations at our Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, Casa Berardi,
and San Sebastian units;
expanding our proven and probable reserves and production capacity at our operating
properties;
conducting our business with financial stewardship to preserve our financial position in varying
metals price environments;
advance permitting of the Rock Creek project, which we acquired as part of the merger with
Revett Mining Company, Inc. ("Revett") in June 2015 as discussed further below;
maintaining and investing in exploration and pre-development projects in the vicinities of six
mining districts and projects we believe to be under-explored and under-invested: North Idaho's
Silver Valley in the historic Coeur d'Alene Mining District; our Greens Creek unit on Alaska's
Admiralty Island located near Juneau; the silver-producing district near Durango, Mexico; the
Abitibi region of northwestern Quebec, Canada; the Rock Creek project in northwestern
Montana; and the Creede district of Southwestern Colorado; and
continuing to seek opportunities to acquire and invest in mining properties and companies,
including our recently-proposed merger with Mines Management discussed further below.

Table Of Contents
A number of key factors may impact the execution of our strategy, including regulatory
issues and metals prices. Metals prices can be very volatile. As discussed in the Critical
Accounting Estimates section below, metals prices are influenced by a number of factors
beyond our control. Average market prices of silver, zinc and lead in the first six months of
2016 were lower than their levels from the comparable period last year, with average prices
for gold higher in 2016, as illustrated by the table in Results of Operations below. While we
believe current global economic and industrial trends could result in continued demand
for the metals we produce, prices have been volatile and there can be no assurance that
current prices will continue.
The total principal amount of our Senior Notes due May 1, 2021 is $506.5 million and the
Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.875% per year. The net proceeds from the Senior
Notes were primarily used for the acquisition of Aurizon in June 2013 (see Note 9 of Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)). As discussed in the
Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, we believe that we will be able to
meet the obligations associated with the acquisition of Aurizon and additional debt;
however, a number of factors could impact our ability to meet the debt obligations and
fund our other projects.
On June 15, 2015, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding
common stock of Revett. The acquired entities hold 100% ownership of two properties in
northwestern Montana: the Troy Mine, which we are in the process of reclaiming, and the
Rock Creek project, a significant undeveloped silver and copper deposit. In the
acquisition, we paid cash of $0.9 million and each outstanding common share of Revett
was exchanged for 0.1622 of a share of our common stock, for total consideration of
approximately $20.1 million based on the closing price of Hecla stock of $3.06 per share
on June 15, 2015. Development of Rock Creek has been challenged by conservation
groups at various times, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the
permitting required to develop Rock Creek.
On May 23, 2016, we and Mines Management entered into a merger agreement pursuant to
which we would acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Mines
Management. Mines Management holds 100% ownership of the Montanore project in
Northwest Montana, a significant undeveloped silver and copper deposit located
approximately ten miles from our Rock Creek project. In the proposed merger, each
outstanding common share of Mines Management would be exchanged for 0.2218 of a
share of our common stock, for total consideration of approximately $59.1 million based
on the closing price of Hecla stock of $6.55 per share on August 2, 2016. The proposed
merger is subject to approval by Mine Management's stockholders. No assurance can be
given as to whether the merger will be approved and consummated. See Item 1A - Risk
Factors for information on potential risks relating to the merger and to us following the
merger if it is consummated.
As further discussed in the Lucky Friday Segment section below, we are in the process of
constructing an internal shaft at the Lucky Friday mine (“#4 Shaft”), which, we believe, will
significantly increase production and extend the life of the mine.  The #4 Shaft project will
involve significant additional capital costs leading up to its expected completion date in
the fourth quarter of 2016. We believe that our current capital resources will allow us to
complete the #4 Shaft project.
During the third quarter of 2015, we made a development decision to mine near surface,
high grade portions of silver and gold deposits at our San Sebastian project in Mexico,
and ore production commenced in the fourth quarter of 2015.  See the San Sebastian
Segment section below for more information. As a result, we believe that we will generate
positive cash flows at San Sebastian over the approximate two year period following the
start of production.  However, our ability to generate positive cash flows at San Sebastian
may be impacted by changes in estimated costs, precious metals prices, or other factors,
and there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and operate San Sebastian
as anticipated.
We strive to achieve excellent mine safety and health performance. We seek to implement
this goal by: training employees in safe work practices; establishing, following and
improving safety standards; investigating accidents, incidents and losses to avoid
recurrence; involving employees in the establishment of safety standards; and
participating in the National Mining Association's CORESafety program. We attempt to
implement reasonable best practices with respect to mine safety and emergency
preparedness. We work with the Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA") to
address issues outlined in its investigations and inspections and continue to evaluate our
safety practices.

Another challenge for us is the risk associated with environmental litigation and ongoing
reclamation activities. As described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our annual report
filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Note 4 of Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited), it is possible that our estimate
of these liabilities (and our ability to estimate liabilities in general) may change in the future,
affecting our strategic plans.  We are involved in various environmental legal matters with
no assurance that the estimate of our environmental liabilities, liquidity needs, or strategic
plans will not be significantly impacted as a result of these matters or new matters that may
arise. We strive to ensure that our activities are conducted in compliance with applicable
laws and regulations and attempt to resolve environmental litigation on as favorable terms
as possible.

For the second quarter and first six months of 2016, we recorded income applicable to
common stockholders of $24.0 million ($0.06 per basic common share) and $23.2 million
($0.06 per basic common share), respectively, compared to losses applicable to common
shareholders of $26.8 million ($0.07 per basic common share) and $14.4 million ($0.04 per
basic common share) for the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively.
The following factors contributed to the results for the second quarter and first six months
of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015:
•
•
•
Gross profit increased at our San Sebastian, Casa Berardi and Lucky Friday units by $26.5
million, $13.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively, for the second quarter of 2016, and by $42.5
million, $15.6 million and $3.8 million, respectively, for the first six months of 2016 compared to
the same periods in 2015. Gross profit at our Greens Creek unit was also higher in the second
quarter of 2016 compared to 2015 by $4.6 million, but was lower by $2.0 million in the first half
of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. See The Greens Creek Segment, The Lucky
Friday Segment, The Casa Berardi Segment, and The San Sebastian Segment sections below.
An $8.7 million charge to provision for closed operations and environmental matters in the
second quarter of 2015 for potentially resolving the exposure to liability at the Gilt Edge and
Nelson Tunnel/Commodore sites, with no comparable charge impacting the results for the
second quarter and first six months of 2016. See Note 4 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements (Unaudited) for more information.
Exploration and pre-development costs were lower by $2.3 million and $4.1 million for the
second quarter and first half of 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. In
2016, we have continued exploration work at our Greens Creek unit, on our land package near
Durango, Mexico, and at the Casa Berardi mine and other projects on our land package in
Quebec, Canada. "Pre-development expense" is defined as costs incurred in the exploration
stage that may ultimately benefit production, such as underground ramp development, which
are expensed due to the lack of proven and probable reserves.

Acquisition costs related to the proposed merger with Mines Management and the subsequently
abandoned takeover bid for Dolly Varden of $0.4 million recognized during the second quarter
and first six months of 2016 compared to costs for the acquisition of Revett, completed on June
15, 2015, of $2.1 million recognized during the same periods of 2015.
Net foreign exchange losses in the second quarter of 2016 of $1.9 million and $10.1 million in
the first half of 2016 versus a net loss of $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2015 and a net
gain of $10.4 million in the first half of 2015. As discussed in Note 11 of Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited), in April 2016 we initiated a hedging program to
manage our exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and
Canadian dollar and the impact on our future operating costs at our Casa Berardi unit.
No net activity on base metal derivative contracts for the second quarter and first half of 2016
compared to a loss of $0.9 million and gain of $4.9 million for the same periods in 2015.
Higher average realized prices for silver and gold for the second quarter of 2016 compared to
the same period in 2015, while average prices for lead and zinc were lower in the 2016 period.
In the first half of 2016, average realized prices for silver, lead and zinc were lower than in the
comparable period of 2015. However, average realized prices for gold for the first half of 2016
were higher compared to the same period of 2015. These price variances are illustrated in the

Average realized prices can differ from average market prices primarily because
concentrate sales are generally recorded as revenues at the time of shipment at forward
prices for the estimated month of settlement, which differ from average market prices.  Due
to the time elapsed between shipment of concentrates and final settlement with the
customers, we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be
settled.  Previously recorded sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices each
period through final settlement.  For the second quarter and first six months of 2016, we
recorded net positive price adjustments to provisional settlements of $1.0 million and $1.5
million, respectively, compared to net negative price adjustments to provisional
settlements of $0.6 million and positive price adjustments of $1.5 million in the second
quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively. The price adjustments related to silver,
gold, zinc and lead contained in our concentrate shipments were largely offset by gains
and losses on forward contracts for those metals for each period (see Note 11 of Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for more information).  The
gains and losses on these contracts are included in revenues and impact the realized
prices for silver, gold, lead and zinc.  Realized prices are calculated by dividing gross
revenues for each metal (which include the price adjustments and gains and losses on the
forward contracts discussed above) by the payable quantities of each metal included in
concentrate and doré shipped during the period.

General and administrative expense was higher by $2.1 million and $3.6 million in the second
quarter and first half of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 due primarily to increased
incentive compensation.
Income tax provisions of $11.5 million and $13.2 million for the three- and six-month periods
ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to an income tax benefit of $0.1 million and $1.3
million provision for the same periods in 2015. The higher provisions are primarily the result of
higher net income before taxes, partially offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance on
deferred tax assets in Mexico in the second quarter of 2016. See the Corporate Matters section
below for more information.

A reconciliation of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion
and amortization, the most comparable GAAP measure, to this non-GAAP measure can be
found below in Reconciliation of Costs of Sales and Other Direct Production Costs and
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (GAAP) to Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits
and Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP).
The $4.6 million increase in gross profit during the second quarter of 2016, compared to
the same period in 2015, was primarily due to higher silver production as a result of higher
ore grades and tonnage and improved mill recoveries, and the timing of shipments. The
$2.0 million decrease in gross profit for the first six months of 2016 was primarily the result
of lower average prices for silver, zinc, and lead, impacting sales by approximately $10.4
million, partially offset by increased ore production, higher silver grades, and improved
recoveries.In addition, gross profit at Greens Creek was affected by positive price
adjustments to revenues of $0.8 million and $1.3 million for the second quarter and first six
months of 2016, respectively, compared to negative price adjustments of $0.4 million and
positive price adjustments of $1.6 million for the second quarter and first six months of
2015, respectively. Price adjustments to revenues result from changes in metals prices
between transfer of title of concentrates to buyers and final settlements during the period.
The price adjustments related to silver, gold, zinc and lead contained in concentrate
shipments were net of gains and losses on forward contracts for those metals for each
period. The price adjustments and gains and losses on forward contracts discussed
above are included in sales.

Mining costs per ton decreased by 4% in the first quarter and by 6% in first six months of
2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily as a result of less expensed
development and higher milled tons, partially offset by higher expensed diamond drilling.
Milling costs per ton increased 1% in the second quarter and 4% for the first six months of
2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. The increase in milling costs is due to higher
maintenance and reagent costs, and higher labor costs.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was 10% and 5% less in the second
quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015,
due primarily to the effect on units-of-production depreciation of weaker silver prices
relative to base metal prices.

The increase in Cash Costs, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce for the second
quarter and first six months was the result of lower by-product credits, partially offset by
higher silver production.
Mining and milling costs decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2016
compared to 2015 on a per-ounce basis, despite milling costs increasing on a per-ton
basis as discussed above, due primarily to higher silver production resulting from
improved silver grades and recovery.
Other cash costs per ounce for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 were lower
compared to 2015 due to the effect of higher silver production and decreased labor costs.
Treatment costs were lower in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 compared
to 2015 as a result of higher silver production and improved payment terms from smelters.
Treatment charges for the first six months of 2016 were also impacted by lower silver
prices, as treatment costs include the value of silver not payable to us through the
smelting process. The silver not payable to us is either recovered by the smelters through
further processing or ultimately not recovered and included in the smelters' waste
material.
By-product credits per ounce were lower in the second quarter and first six months of
2016 compared to 2015 due to lower gold production, lower zinc and lead prices and
higher silver production due to increased silver ore grades and recovery.
The difference between what we report as "production" and "payable metal quantities
sold" is attributable to the difference between the quantities of metals contained in the
concentrates we produce versus the portion of those metals actually payable by our
customers according to the terms of the contracts. Differences can also arise from
inventory changes incidental to shipping schedules, or variances in ore grades which
impact the amount of metals contained in concentrates produced and sold. The difference
in payable quantities sold for 2016 compared to 2015 is due mainly to timing of
concentrate shipments.
While revenue from zinc, lead and gold by-products is significant, we believe that
identification of silver as the primary product of the Greens Creek unit is appropriate
because:
•
•
silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is
expected to do so in the future;
we have historically presented Greens Creek as a producer primarily of silver, based on the
original analysis that justified putting the project into production, and believe that consistency in
disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and
production from year to year;
•metallurgical treatment maximizes silver recovery;
•
•
the Greens Creek deposit is a massive sulfide deposit containing an unusually high proportion
of silver; and
in most of its working areas, Greens Creek utilizes selective mining methods in which silver is
the metal targeted for highest recovery.
Likewise, we believe the identification of gold, lead and zinc as by-product credits is
appropriate because of their lower economic value compared to silver and due to the fact
that silver is the primary product we intend to produce. In addition, we do not receive
sufficient revenue from any single by-product metal to warrant classification of such as a
co-product.
36
Table Of Contents
We periodically review our revenues to ensure that reporting of primary products and by-
products is appropriate.  Because we consider zinc, lead and gold to be by-products of
our silver production, the values of these metals offset operating costs within our
calculations of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce.

Gross profit increased by $4.6 million and $3.8 million in the second quarter and first six
months of 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily due to
increased metal production due to improved ore grades.
Mining and milling cost per ton were higher by 2% and 22%, respectively, in the second
quarter and by 8% and 18%, respectively, in the first half of 2016 compared to the same

The decrease in Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce in the second
quarter and first half of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 was the result of
higher silver production, partially offset by higher labor costs and lower by-product credits
due to lower lead and zinc prices.
Similar to the Greens Creek segment, the difference between what we report as
“production” and “payable metal quantities sold” is due essentially to the difference
between the quantities of metals contained in the concentrates we produce versus the
portion of those metals actually paid for by our customers according to the terms of our
sales contracts.
While value from lead and zinc is significant, we believe that identification of silver as the
primary product of the Lucky Friday unit is appropriate because:
•
silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is
expected to do so in the future;
•the Lucky Friday unit is situated in a mining district long associated with silver production; and
 •the Lucky Friday unit generally utilizes selective mining methods to target silver production.
Likewise, we believe the identification of lead and zinc as by-product credits is appropriate
because of their lower economic value compared to silver and due to the fact that silver is
the primary product we intend to produce. In addition, we do not receive sufficient revenue
from any single by-product metal to warrant classification of such as a co-product.
38
Table Of Contents
We periodically review our revenues to ensure that reporting of primary products and by-
products is appropriate.  Because we consider zinc and lead to be by-products of our
silver production, the values of these metals offset operating costs within our calculations
of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce.
The #4 Shaft project, an internal shaft at the Lucky Friday mine, is expected to provide
deeper access which should in turn extend the mine's operational life and expand silver
production.  We commenced engineering and construction activities on the #4 Shaft in late
2008, and our Board of Directors gave its final approval of the project in August
2011.  Excavation of the shaft to its final depth at the 8600 foot level has been completed,
and remaining work includes equipping the shaft with steel sets, guides, skip loading
facilities and electrical infrastructure. Construction of the #4 Shaft as currently designed is
expected to cost approximately $225 million (the bulk of which has already been incurred),
and we expect the shaft to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2016.  We believe that our
current capital resources will allow us to complete the project.
Many of the employees at our Lucky Friday unit are represented by a union. The most
recent collective bargaining agreement with the union expired on April 30, 2016, and
negotiations on a new agreement are ongoing.
See Note 4 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for
contingencies related to various accidents and other events occurring at the Lucky Friday
mine in prior periods.

Gross profit increased by $13.3 million and $15.6 million for the second quarter and first
half of 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods of the prior year. The increase is
primarily due to higher gold production due to higher ore grades, recoveries, and gold
prices. The higher gold production for the first half of 2016 was also a result of higher ore
throughput compared to the first half of 2015.
Mining costs per ton for the second quarter and first half of 2016 were 5% and 11% lower
than the same periods of last year due primarily to higher ore production. Foreign
exchange differences also contributed to the lower costs by approximately $4.00 per ton
and $7.00 per ton for the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively,
compared to the same periods in 2015, as the U.S. dollar has been stronger relative to the
Canadian dollar in 2016 compared to 2015.
Milling unit costs increased by 5% and decreased by 5% in the second quarter and first
half of 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015, mainly due to variances
in ore production and foreign exchange differences as noted above.

The decrease in Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce for the 2016 periods
compared to 2015 was primarily the result of higher gold production, which impacted
costs by approximately $218 per ounce and $198 per ounce, respectively, and foreign
exchange differences, which impacted costs by approximate $38 per ounce and $64 per
ounce, respectively. These factors were partially offset by higher costs on a Canadian
dollar basis.

The difference between what we report as "production" and "payable metal quantities
sold" is mainly attributable to inventory changes incidental to the timing of sales of refined
metals and shipping schedules.
We believe the identification of silver as a by-product credit is appropriate at Casa Berardi
because of its lower economic value compared to gold and due to the fact that gold is the
primary product we intend to produce there. In addition, we do not receive sufficient
revenue from silver at Casa Berardi to warrant classification of such as a co-product.
Because we consider silver to be a by-product of our gold production at Casa Berardi, the
value of silver offsets operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost, After By-
product Credits, per Gold Ounce.
In 2015, we made the decision to develop the East Mine Crown Pillar ("EMCP") project, a
new open pit mine at Casa Berardi. Processing of ore from the EMCP pit began in July
2016. The EMCP pit is expected to contribute approximately 5,000 ounces of gold in 2016
and between 20,000 and 30,000 ounces of gold production for each of the approximately
five years remaining on the project.
The San Sebastian Segment
In the third quarter of 2015, we made the development decision to mine near-surface, high-
grade portions of silver and gold deposits from shallow open pits at our San Sebastian
unit in Mexico. We previously produced silver and gold from underground mines at San
Sebastian from 2001 to 2005. A Preliminary Economic Assessment was completed, and
development of the pits and mine production commenced in the fourth quarter of 2015. Mill
production started in December 2015 with the ore processed at a leased mill. The first
sales for the property came in early 2016 and included production from both December
2015 and first quarter 2016.

We believe the identification of gold as a by-product credit is appropriate at San Sebastian

warrant classification of such as a co-product. Because we consider gold to be a by-
product of our silver production at San Sebastian, the value of gold offsets operating
costs within our calculations of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce. In
addition to the impact of the by-product credits from gold, Cash Cost, After By-product
Credits, per Silver Ounce at San Sebastian is lower compared to our other operations due
to the orebody being near surface and having higher precious metal grades, resulting in a
lower Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce.

Corporate Matters
Employee Benefit Plans
Our defined benefit pension plans, while affording a significant benefit to our employees,
also represent a significant liability to us. The liability recorded for the funded status of our
plans was $48.3 million and $46.9 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively. We contributed approximately $2.6 million in shares of our common stock
and cash to our defined benefit plans in February 2016, and $6.1 million in shares of our
common stock in July 2016, with no additional contributions anticipated in 2016. While the
economic variables which will determine future funding requirements are uncertain, we
expect contributions to continue to be required in future years under current plan
provisions, and we periodically examine the plans for affordability and competitiveness.
See Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for
more information.
Income Taxes
Each reporting period we assess our deferred tax assets utilizing long-range forecasts to
provide reasonable assurance that they will be realized through future earnings.  We
continue to have a net deferred tax asset in the U.S. and Mexico, and a net deferred tax
liability in Canada.
Our U.S. net deferred tax asset at June 30, 2016 totaled $33.5 million, or 1% of total assets,
a decrease of $9.4 million from the $42.9 million net deferred tax asset at December 31,
2015. The largest component of the deferred tax asset is deferred foreign exchange
losses. The next largest component is net operating loss carryforwards. In 2015, we
determined that we are indefinite Alternative Minimum taxpayers, resulting in additional
valuation allowance primarily related to forecasted utilization of regular net operating loss
carryforwards and the effect of re-measuring temporary deferred tax assets using a tax
rate of 20% which differed from the previous rate of 35%. At June 30, 2016, we retained a
valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets of $106.0 million, primarily for net
operating loss carryforwards.
Our net Canadian deferred tax liability at June 30, 2016 was $128.4 million, an increase of
$8.1 million from the $120.3 million net deferred tax liability at December 31, 2015. The
increase is due to strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during
the period, resulting in a higher U.S. dollar value for the liability. The deferred tax liability is
the result of the acquisition of Aurizon completed on June 1, 2013, and is primarily related
to the excess of the fair market value of the assets acquired over the tax bases of those
assets for Canadian tax reporting, with the majority of that value allocated to mineral
resources and reserves.
Our net Mexican deferred tax asset at June 30, 2016, was $9.3 million, a decrease of $2.4
million from the $11.7 million net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2015. The deferred tax
asset is the realized portion of net operating loss carryforwards supported by forecasted
income from operations at San Sebastian. At June 30, 2016, we recognized additional
deferred tax assets in Mexico due to increased expected utilization of net operating losses
as a result of San Sebastian’s operating activities. A $4.0 million valuation allowance
remains on deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions.
Reconciliation of Cost of Sales and Other Direct Production Costs and Depreciation,
Depletion and Amortization (GAAP) to Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and Cash
Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP)
The tables below present reconciliations between the GAAP measure of cost of sales and
other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization to the non-
GAAP measures of Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits, per Ounce and Cash Cost,
After By-product Credits, per Ounce for our operations at the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday,
San Sebastian and Casa Berardi units for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30,
2016 and 2015. Commercial production began at the San Sebastian unit late in 2015, and
as a result there is no comparative data for the three- and six-month periods ended
June 30, 2015.

Table Of Contents
Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce is an important operating statistic that we
utilize to measure each mine's operating performance. It also allows us to benchmark the
performance of each of our mines versus those of our competitors. As a primary silver
mining company, we also use the statistic on an aggregate basis - aggregating the Greens
Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian mines - to compare our performance with that of
other primary silver mining companies. With regard to Casa Berardi, we use Cash Cost,
After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce to compare its performance with other gold
mines. Similarly, the statistic is useful in identifying acquisition and investment
opportunities as it provides a common tool for measuring the financial performance of
other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and operating characteristics.
Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits, per Ounce includes all direct and indirect operating
cash costs related directly to the physical activities of producing metals, including mining,
processing and other plant costs, third-party refining expense, on-site general and
administrative costs, royalties and mining production taxes. By-product credits include
revenues earned from all metals other than the primary metal produced at each unit. Cash
Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce provides management and investors an
indication of operating cash flow, after consideration of the average price, received from
production. We also use this measurement for the comparative monitoring of performance
of our mining operations period-to-period from a cash flow perspective. Cash Cost, After
By-product Credits, per Ounce is a measure developed by precious metals companies
(including the Silver Institute) in an effort to provide a uniform standard for comparison
purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that our reporting of this non-GAAP
measure is the same as that reported by other mining companies.
The Casa Berardi section below reports Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold
Ounce for the production of gold, its primary product, and by-product revenues earned
from silver, which is a by-product at Casa Berardi. Only costs and ounces produced
relating to units with the same primary product are combined to represent Cash Cost, After
By-product Credits, per Ounce. Thus, the gold produced at our Casa Berardi unit is not
included as a by-product credit when calculating Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per
Silver Ounce for the total of Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian, our combined
silver properties.

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $11.6 million in the first six months of 2016, as
discussed below, while current marketable debt securities increased by $15.1 million
(discussed below) and non-current marketable equity securities increased by $3.0 million
(see Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for
more information).
As discussed in Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited), on April 12, 2013, we completed an offering of Senior Notes in the total
principal amount of US$500 million, and our Senior Notes have a total principal balance of
$506.5 million as of June 30, 2016. The Senior Notes are due May 1, 2021 and bear interest
at a rate of 6.875% per year from the date of original issuance or from the most recent
payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for.  Interest on the Senior Notes
is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2013.
In the third quarter of 2015, we made a development decision to mine near surface, high
grade portions of the silver and gold deposits at our San Sebastian project in Mexico and
commenced ore production at the end of 2015.  As a result, San Sebastian has generated
positive cash flows in the first half of 2016, and we anticipate it will continue to do so for
the rest of 2016 and a portion of 2017.  However, our estimate of costs could change, and
our ability to generate cash flow at San Sebastian could be impacted by changes in
precious metals prices or other factors, and there can be no assurance that we will be able
to develop and operate San Sebastian as anticipated.
In June 2015, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of
Revett for total consideration of $20.1 million, consisting of $0.9 million in cash and $19.1
million in our common stock. As a result of the acquisition, we anticipate incurring costs
over the next three to four years totaling approximately $18.8 million for reclamation of the
Troy mine. We expect to recover approximately $16.0 million of these costs through an
insurance policy held by the Revett subsidiary owning the Troy mine, and this amount is
recorded as an asset as of June 30, 2016. However, there can be no assurance that we will
be successful in obtaining reimbursement for such costs as anticipated.
As discussed in Note 4 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited), we believe that it is probable that CoCa, our wholly-owned subsidiary, will
incur a settlement liability for response costs at the Gilt Edge and Nelson
Tunnel/Commodore sites, which we currently estimate to be $9.9 million after payments
from insurance proceeds and another party to the settlement. In the first quarter of 2016,
we deposited $3.9 million into an escrow account which would be applied towards the
potential settlement. The deposit is reported as current restricted cash on our condensed
consolidated balance sheet (unaudited). However, there can be no assurance the
settlement will be finalized as outlined above or occur at all.
As discussed in Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited), in February 2016 we entered into an equity distribution agreement under
which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time having an
aggregate offering price of up to $75 million, with the net proceeds available for general
corporate purposes. Whether or not we engage in sales from time to time may depend on a
variety of factors, including share price, our cash resources, customary black-out
restrictions, and whether we have any material inside information, and the agreement can
be terminated by us at any time. As of June 30, 2016, we had sold 2,780,087 shares
through the at-the-market program for total net proceeds of $8.1 million.
Pursuant to our common stock dividend policy described in Note 8 of Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited), our Board of Directors
declared and paid dividends on common stock totaling $1.9 million in the first half of both
2016 and 2015. On August 3, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a dividend on common
stock totaling $1.0 million payable in September 2016. Our dividend policy has a silver-
price-linked component which ties the amount of declared common stock dividends to our
realized silver price for the preceding quarter. Another component of our common stock
dividend policy anticipates paying an annual minimum dividend. The declaration and
payment of dividends on common stock is at the sole discretion of our board of directors,
and there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare and pay common stock
dividends in the future.

Table Of Contents
On May 8, 2012, we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase
program.  Under the program, we are authorized to repurchase up to 20 million shares of
our outstanding common stock from time to time in open market or privately negotiated
transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions and other factors.  The
repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued by us at any time.
Whether or not we engage in repurchases from time to time may depend on a variety of
factors, including not only price and cash resources, but customary black-out restrictions,
whether we have any material inside information, limitations on share repurchases or cash
usage that may be imposed by our credit agreement or in connection with issuances of
securities, alternative uses for cash, applicable law, and other investment opportunities
from time to time. As of June 30, 2016, 934,100 shares have been purchased in prior
periods at an average price of $3.99 per share, leaving 19.1 million shares that may yet be
purchased under the program. The closing price of our common stock at August 2, 2016,
was $6.55 per share.
We may defer some capital investment and/or exploration and pre-development activities,
engage in asset sales or secure additional capital if necessary to maintain liquidity. We
also may pursue additional acquisition opportunities, which could require additional
equity issuances or financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will be
available to us.
As a result of our current cash balances, the performance of our current and expected
operations, current metals prices, proceeds from potential at-the-market sales of common
stock, and full availability of our $100 million revolving credit facility, we believe our cash,
cash equivalents, investments, projected cash from operations, and availability of
financing (including equity issuances), if needed, will be adequate to meet our obligations
and other potential cash requirements during the next 12 months. Our obligations and
other uses of cash may include, but are not limited to: debt service obligations related to
the Senior Notes, capital outlays for the #4 Shaft project and other capital expenditures,
potential acquisitions of other mining companies or properties, regulatory matters,
litigation, potential repurchases of our common stock under the program described
above, and payment of dividends on common stock, if declared by our board of
directors.  We currently estimate that a total of approximately $150 million will be spent on
capital expenditures, primarily for equipment, infrastructure, and development at our
mines, in 2016.  We also estimate that exploration and pre-development expenditures will
total approximately $19 million in 2016. However, capital, exploration, and pre-development
expenditures may change based upon our financial position, metals prices, and other
considerations. Our ability to fund the activities described above will depend on our
operating performance, metals prices, our ability to estimate costs, sources of liquidity
available to us, and other factors. A sustained downturn in metals prices or significant
increase in operational or capital costs, other uses of cash, or other factors beyond our
control could impact our plans.

$ 52.2
Cash provided by operating activities in the first half of 2016 increased by $33.9 million
compared to the same period in 2015 due to higher income, as adjusted for non-cash
items. The higher income is primarily due to gross profit generated at San Sebastian in the
first half of 2016 following commencement of production there in December 2015 and
improved metals production at Casa Berardi and Lucky Friday, partially offset by lower
silver and base metals prices. Working capital and other operating asset and liability
changes resulted in a net cash flow decrease of $25.8 million in the first six months of 2016
compared to a net decrease in cash flows of $0.8 million in the 2015 period.   The $25.0
million variance in working capital changes is primarily attributed to higher accounts
receivable and inventory balances due primarily to the timing of shipments at Greens
Creek.

During the first half of 2016, we invested $77.0 million in capital expenditures, not including
$1.6 million in non-cash capital lease additions, an increase of $18.7 million compared to
the same period in 2015 due to increased costs at the Casa Berardi unit for equipment
additions and construction of the new East Mine Crown Pillar open pit.  In the first half of
2016, we purchased bonds having maturities of greater than 90 days having a cost basis
of $16.1 million, and bonds valued at $0.8 million matured during the first half of 2016. We
purchased marketable equity securities having a cost basis of $0.9 million during the first
half of 2015. We recognized a cash outflow for the acquisition of Revett, net of cash
acquired, of $0.8 million during the first half of 2015. We incurred increases in restricted
cash of $3.9 million during the first half of 2016, as discussed above.

During the first six months of both 2016 and 2015, we paid cash dividends on our common
stock totaling $1.9 million, and cash dividends of $0.3 million on our Series B Preferred
Stock. We acquired treasury shares for $3.4 million and $0.9 million in the first half of 2016
and 2015, respectively, resulting from our employees' elections to satisfy their tax
withholding obligations related to incentive compensation paid in stock through net share
settlement. See Note 8 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business.  Substantially all lease
agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time.  Some lease
agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased
property.  Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal
options and if we entered into additional operating lease arrangements.

We sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and
provide certain post-retirement benefits for qualifying retired employees, along with a
supplemental executive retirement plan. These amounts represent our estimate of the future
funding requirements for these plans.  See Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements (Unaudited) for more information.

On April 12, 2013, we completed an offering of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of
our Senior Notes due May 1, 2021. The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.875% per
year from the date of original issuance or from the most recent payment date to which interest
has been paid or provided for.  Interest on the Senior Notes is payable on May 1 and
November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2013. Since the initial offering, we have
issued an additional $6.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes to fund
obligations under our defined benefit pension plan. See Note 7 and Note 9 of Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for more information.
We record liabilities for costs associated with mine closure, reclamation of land and other
environmental matters.  At June 30, 2016, our liabilities for these matters totaled $97.1
million. Future expenditures related to closure, reclamation and environmental
expenditures at our sites are difficult to estimate, although we anticipate we will incur
expenditures relating to these obligations over the next 30 years. For additional
information relating to our environmental obligations, see Note 4 of Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited).
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At June 30, 2016, we had no existing off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under
SEC regulations, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. As described in Note 1 of the annual report, we are required to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of
assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Our estimates are based on our experience and
our interpretation of economic, political, regulatory, and other factors that affect our
business prospects. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates.
We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are related to future metals prices;
obligations for environmental, reclamation, and closure matters; mineral reserves; and
accounting for business combinations, as they require us to make assumptions that were
highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates were made and changes in them are
reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Management has discussed the
development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee
of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures
presented below. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that
require estimation, but are not deemed to be critical. However, changes in estimates used
in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.

Table Of Contents
Future Metals Prices
Metals prices are key components in estimates that determine the valuation of some of our
significant assets and liabilities, including properties, plants and equipment, deferred tax
assets, and certain accounts receivable. Metals prices are also an important component in
the estimation of reserves.  As shown under Item 1A. – Risk Factors in our annual report
filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, metals prices have historically
been volatile. Silver demand arises from investment demand, particularly in exchange-
traded funds, industrial demand, and consumer demand. Gold demand arises primarily
from investment and consumer demand.  Investment demand for silver and gold is
influenced by various factors, including:  the value of the U.S. Dollar and other currencies,
changing U.S. budget deficits, widening availability of exchange-traded funds, interest rate
levels, the health of credit markets, and inflationary expectations.  Uncertainty concerning
Britain's exit from the European Union and a global economic recovery, including recent
uncertainty in China, could result in continued investment demand for precious
metals.  Industrial demand for silver is closely linked to world Gross Domestic Product
growth and industrial fabrication levels, as it is difficult to substitute for silver in industrial
fabrication.  Consumer demand is driven significantly by demand for jewelry and similar
retail products. We believe that long-term industrial and economic trends, including
urbanization and growth of the middle class in countries such as China and India, will
result in continued consumer demand for silver and gold and industrial demand for
silver.  However, China has recently experienced a lower rate of economic growth which is
ongoing and could continue in the near term. There can be no assurance whether these
trends will continue or how they will impact prices of the metals we produce. In the past, we
have recorded impairments to our asset carrying value because of low prices, and we can
offer no assurance that prices will either remain at their current levels or increase.
Processes supporting valuation of our assets and liabilities that are most significantly
affected by prices include analysis of asset carrying values, depreciation, reserves, and
deferred income taxes. On at least an annual basis - and more frequently if circumstances
warrant - we examine our depreciation rates, reserve estimates, and the valuation
allowances on our deferred tax assets. We examine the carrying values of our assets as
changes in facts and circumstances warrant.  In our evaluation of carrying values and
deferred taxes, we apply several pricing views to our forecasting model, including current
prices, analyst price estimates, forward-curve prices, and historical prices (see Mineral
Reserves, below, regarding prices used for reserve estimates). Using applicable
accounting guidance and our view of metals markets, we use the probability-weighted
average of the various methods to determine whether the values of our assets are fairly
stated, and to determine the level of valuation allowances, if any, on our deferred tax
assets.  In addition, estimates of future metals prices are used in the valuation of certain
assets in the determination of the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions (see
Business Combinations below).
Sales of concentrates sold directly to customers are recorded as revenues when title and
risk of loss transfer to the customer (generally at the time of shipment) at estimated
forward metals prices for the estimated month of settlement. Due to the time elapsed
between the time of shipment of concentrates to the customer and final settlement with the
customer, we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled.
Previously recorded sales and trade accounts receivable are adjusted to estimated
settlement metals prices until final settlement by the customer. Changes in metals prices
between shipment and final settlement result in changes to revenues and accounts
receivable previously recorded upon shipment.  As a result, our trade accounts receivable
balances related to concentrate sales are subject to changes in metals prices until final
settlement occurs.  For more information, see part N. Revenue Recognition of Note 1 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015.
We utilize financially-settled forward contracts to manage our exposure to changes in
prices for silver, gold, zinc and lead.  See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk - Commodity-Price Risk Management below for more information on
our contract programs.  These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and are
therefore marked-to-market through earnings each period.  Changes in silver, gold, zinc
and lead prices between the dates that the contracts are entered into and their settlements
will result in changes to the fair value asset or liability associated with the contracts, with a
corresponding gain or loss recognized in earnings.

Table Of Contents
Obligations for Environmental, Reclamation and Closure Matters
Accrued reclamation and closure costs can represent a significant and variable liability on
our balance sheet. We have estimated our liabilities under appropriate accounting
guidance, and on at least an annual basis - and more frequently if warranted - management
reviews our liabilities with our Audit Committee. However, the ranges of liability could
exceed the liabilities recognized. If substantial damages were awarded, claims were
settled, or remediation costs incurred in excess of our accruals, our financial results or
condition could be materially adversely affected.
Mineral Reserves
Critical estimates are inherent in the process of determining our reserves. Our reserves are
affected largely by our assessment of future metals prices, as well as by engineering and
geological estimates of ore grade, accessibility and production cost. Metals prices are
estimated at long-term averages, as described in Item 2. — Property Descriptions in our
annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our assessment
of reserves occurs at least annually, and periodically utilizes external audits.
Reserves are a key component in the valuation of our properties, plants and equipment.
Reserve estimates are used in determining appropriate rates of units-of-production
depreciation, with net book value of many assets depreciated over remaining estimated
reserves. Reserves are also a key component in forecasts, with which we compare future
cash flows to current asset values in an effort to ensure that carrying values are reported
appropriately. Our forecasts are also used in determining the level of valuation allowances
on our deferred tax assets. Reserves also play a key role in the valuation of certain assets
in the determination of the purchase price allocations for acquisitions (see Business
Combinations below).  Reserves are a culmination of many estimates and are not
guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of metals or that we will do so at a
profitable level.
Business Combinations
We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at
the acquisition date.  The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires
management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to
long-lived assets, including estimates of future metals prices and mineral reserves, as
discussed above.  In some cases, we use third-party appraisers to determine the fair
values and lives of property and other identifiable assets. In addition, costs related to
business combinations are included in earnings as incurred, and our financial results for
periods in which business combinations are pursued could be adversely affected as a
result.
Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward-looking
statements that involve risk and uncertainties, as well as summarizes the financial
instruments held by us at June 30, 2016, which are sensitive to changes in commodity
prices and foreign exchange rates and are not held for trading purposes.  Actual results
could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.  In the
normal course of business, we also face risks that are either non-financial or non-
quantifiable (see Item 1A. – Risk Factors of our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015, as updated in Part II, Item 1A – Risk Factors in this
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016).

Table Of Contents
Provisional Sales
Sales of all metals products sold directly to customers, including by-product metals, are
recorded as revenues when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer (generally at the
time of shipment) at forward prices for the estimated month of settlement. Due to the time
elapsed between shipment to the customer and the final settlement with the customer we
must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled. Previously recorded
sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices until final settlement by the
customer.  Changes in metals prices between shipment and final settlement will result in
changes to revenues previously recorded upon shipment.  Metals prices can and often do
fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control (see Item 1A –
Risk Factors – A substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material
adverse effect on us in our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015).  At June 30, 2016, metals contained in concentrates and exposed to
future price changes totaled approximately 1.6 million ounces of silver, 5,464 ounces of
gold, 10,605 tons of zinc, and 4,759 tons of lead.  If the price for each metal were to change
by 10%, the change in the total value of the concentrates sold would be approximately $6.5
million.  However, as discussed in Commodity-Price Risk Management below, we utilize a
program designed and intended to mitigate the risk of negative price adjustments with
limited mark-to-market financially-settled forward contracts for our silver, gold, zinc and
lead sales.
Commodity-Price Risk Management
At times, we may use commodity forward sales commitments, commodity swap contracts
and commodity put and call option contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuation in the
prices of certain metals which we produce. Contract positions are designed to ensure that
we will receive a defined minimum price for certain quantities of our production, thereby
partially offsetting our exposure to fluctuations in the market. These instruments do,
however, expose us to (i) credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties for
contracts in which the contract price exceeds the spot price of a commodity and (ii) price
risk to the extent that the spot price exceeds the contract price for quantities of our
production covered under contract positions.
We are currently using financially-settled forward contracts to manage the exposure to
changes in prices of silver, gold, zinc and lead contained in our concentrate shipments
between the time of shipment and final settlement. In addition, at times we use financially-
settled forward contracts to manage the exposure to changes in prices of zinc and lead
(but not silver and gold) contained in our forecasted future concentrate shipments;
however, there were no open contracts related to this program as of June 30, 2016 or
December 31, 2015.  These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked-
to-market through earnings each period.  At June 30, 2016, we recorded a current liability
of $3.4 million on the contracts utilized to manage exposure to prices of metals in our
concentrate shipments, which is included in other current liabilities.
We recognized an $11.8 million net loss during the first half of 2016 on the contracts
utilized to manage exposure to prices of metals in our concentrate shipments, which is
included in sales of products.  The net loss recognized on the contracts offsets gains
related to price adjustments on our provisional concentrate sales due to changes to silver,
gold, lead and zinc prices between the time of sale and final settlement.
The following tables summarize the quantities of metals committed under forward sales
contracts at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

Our concentrate sales are based on a provisional sales price containing an embedded
derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes.
The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward price at
the time of the sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge
accounting, is marked-to-market through earnings each period prior to final settlement.
Foreign Currency
We operate or have mining interests in Canada and Mexico, which exposes us to risks
associated with fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies involved, particularly
between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar. We have determined that the functional
currency for our Canadian operations is the U.S. dollar. As such, foreign exchange gains
and losses associated with the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities from
Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars are recorded to earnings each period. For the first half of
2016, we recognized a net foreign exchange loss of $10.1 million. Foreign currency
exchange rates are influenced by a number of factors beyond our control. A 10% change
in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar from the rate at June 30,
2016 would have resulted in a change of approximately $13.9 million in our net foreign
exchange gain or loss.
In April 2016, we initiated a program to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the
exchange rate between the USD and CAD and the impact on our future operating costs
denominated in CAD. The program utilizes forward contracts to sell CAD, and each
contract is designated as a cash flow hedge. As of June 30, 2016, we have 70 forward
contracts outstanding to sell CAD$175 million having a notational amount of US$135.9
million. These contracts represent between 20% and 44% of our forecasted cash operating
costs at Casa Berardi from 2017 through 2020 and have USD-to-CAD exchange rates
ranging from between 1.2787 and 1.3031. Our risk management policy provides for up to
75% of our forecasted CAD-denominated operating costs for five years into the future to
be hedged under such programs, and for potential additional programs to manage other
foreign currency-related exposure areas.
As of June 30, 2016, we recorded the following balances for the fair value of the contracts:
•a non-current asset of $0.5 million, which is included in other non-current assets;
 •a current liability of $0.1 million, which is included in other current liabilities, and
 •a non-current liability of $0.4 million, which is included in other non-current liabilities.
Net unrealized gains of approximately $46,000 related to the effective portion of the
hedges were included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of June 30, 2016.
Unrealized gains and losses will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive
loss to current earnings as the underlying operating expenses are recognized. We
estimate approximately $0.1 million in net unrealized losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive income as of June 30, 2016 would be reclassified to current earnings in
the next twelve months. Net unrealized losses of approximately $6,000 related to
ineffectiveness of the hedges were included in current earnings for the six months ended
June 30, 2016.

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures
An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer
(“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as defined by Securities Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) as of the
end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, including controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us is
accumulated and communicated to our management (including our CEO and CFO), were
effective as of June 30, 2016, in assuring them in a timely manner that material information
required to be disclosed in this report has been properly recorded, processed,
summarized and reported. There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control systems, no matter how well designed and operated, have inherent
limitations. Therefore, even a system which is determined to be effective cannot provide
absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected or prevented. Our systems
of internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation.
Part II - Other Information
Item 1.    Legal Proceedings
For information concerning legal proceedings, refer to Note 4 of Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited), which is incorporated by reference into
this Item 1.
Item 1A.    Risk Factors
Item 1A - Risk Factors of our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 sets forth information relating to important risks and uncertainties that
could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating
results.  Those risk factors continue to be relevant to an understanding of our business,
financial condition and operating results. Additional risk factors have been added in this
Form 10-Q to provide updated information, as set forth below.
On May 23, 2016, we and Mines Management, Inc. ("Mines Management") entered into a
merger agreement pursuant to which we would acquire all of the issued and outstanding
common stock of Mines Management. See Note 13 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements (Unaudited) for more information. The proposed merger is subject to
approval by Mines Management's stockholders. The information below includes additional
risk factors related to the potential acquisition.
Risk Factors Relating to the Merger
The merger with Mines Management may not be completed on the terms or timeline
currently contemplated or at all. Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact
our stock price and future business and financial results.
The completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement is subject to
certain conditions, including (1) approval and adoption by Mines Management
stockholders, (2) the effectiveness of certain filings with the SEC, (3) the absence of certain
legal impediments and (4) other customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance
the merger will be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.
We have expended and will continue to expend a significant amount of time and resources
on the merger, and a failure to consummate the merger as currently contemplated, or at all,
could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
57
Table Of Contents
If the merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we
will be subject to several risks, including the following:
•
having to pay substantial other costs and expenses relating to the proposed transaction, such
as legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing, printing and mailing fees and integration costs that
have already been incurred and will continue to be incurred until closing;
•
the focus of our management on the merger instead of on pursuing other opportunities that
could be beneficial to us; and
•
the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price
reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed;
in each case, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of having the merger
completed. In addition, if the merger is not completed, we may experience negative
reactions from the financial markets and from our employees and other stakeholders. We
could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to
perform our obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger is not completed, we
cannot assure our stockholders that these risks will not materialize and will not materially
affect our business, financial results and stock price.
The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in either
our or Mines Management’s stock price.
Upon the closing of the merger, each share of Mines Management common stock (other
than shares owned by Mines Management or us, which will be cancelled) will be converted
into the right to receive 0.2218 of a share of our common stock, with cash paid in lieu of
fractional shares. This exchange ratio was fixed in the merger agreement and will not be
adjusted for changes in the market price of either our common stock or Mines
Management common stock. Changes in the price of our common stock prior to the
merger will affect the market value that Mines Management stockholders will receive on the
date of the merger. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors (many of
which are beyond the control of us or Mines Management), including, without limitation,
the following:
•changes in our or Mines Management’s businesses, operations, performance and prospects;
•
changes in market assessments of the business, operations and prospects of us or Mines
Management;
•
investor behavior and strategies, including market assessments of the likelihood that the merger
will be completed;
•
interest rates, metals prices, general market and economic conditions and other factors
generally affecting the price of our and Mines Management’s common stock; and
•
federal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the
businesses in which we and Mines Management operate.
The price of our common stock at the closing of the merger may vary from its price on the
date the merger agreement was executed, on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus
and on the date of the special meeting of Mines Management. As a result, the market value
represented by the exchange ratio will also vary.
Any delay in completing the merger may reduce or eliminate the expected benefits from
the merger.
In addition to the required Mines Management stockholder approval and adoption, the
merger is subject to a number of other conditions beyond our and Mines Management’s
control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. We
and Mines Management cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be
satisfied. Furthermore, obtaining the required approval and adoption could delay the
completion of the merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any
delay in completing the merger could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits
that we expect to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected time
frame.
58
Table Of Contents
The merger will involve substantial costs.
We and Mines Management have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial
costs and expenses relating directly to the transaction, including fees and expenses
payable to legal, accounting and financial advisors and other professional fees relating to
the transaction, insurance premium costs, fees and costs relating to regulatory filings and
notices, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing costs and other transaction-related costs,
fees and expenses.
In connection with the announcement of the merger agreement, putative class action
lawsuits have been filed and are pending as of the date hereof, seeking, among other
things, to enjoin the merger, and an adverse ruling in any of these lawsuits may prevent
the merger from being effective or from becoming effective within the expected time frame.
While Mines Management’s and our respective directors and management teams believe
that the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to defend vigorously
against these allegations, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these, or any
similar future lawsuits, including the costs associated with defending these claims or any
other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation or settlement of these
claims. If any plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction with respect to the merger,
such an injunction may prevent the completion of the merger on the agreed upon terms, in
the expected time frame or altogether. Whether or not the plaintiffs’ claims are successful,
this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and
resources, which could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Risk Factors Relating to Us Following the Merger
We will incur transaction and integration costs in connection with the merger.
We and Mines Management expect to incur transaction fees and other costs related to the
merger. In addition to transaction costs related to the merger, we will incur integration
costs following the completion of the merger as we integrate the Mines Management
business with that of ours.
After completion of the merger, we may fail to realize anticipated benefits.
The success of the merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated
benefits from the acquisition of Mines Management, in particular its Montanore project.
Even if the Montanore project receives all of its necessary permits and successfully
resolves the current and any future litigation related to its permitting and development,
there is no assurance that it will be successfully developed or operated, including, among
other reasons, because financing necessary to develop the project may be unavailable.
Thus, if we are not able to successfully integrate Mines Management into our operations
within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be
realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.
After completion of the merger, Mines Management may experience negative
developments or outcomes in any of its pending litigation matters.
Mines Management is a party to several lawsuits which may impact its ability to access,
develop or operate the Montanore project. Mines Management is currently involved in
three different lawsuits each of which involves potential defects in title or limiting Mines
Management’s access to the properties comprising the Montanore project. In addition,
Mines Management has intervened in three lawsuits challenging environmental permits
granted to the Montanore project. Should a development or outcome from one of these or
any other lawsuit limit Mines Management’s ability to access, develop or operate the
Montanore project, then we would likely be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from
the acquisition of Mines Management.

Table Of Contents
The market price of our common stock following the merger may decline as a result of the
merger.
The market price of our common stock following the merger may decline as a result of the
merger for a number of reasons, including the unsuccessful integration of Mines
Management and our business, our failure to achieve the perceived benefits of the merger,
including financial results, difficulties in the Montanore permitting process or declines in
the mining industry, the market prices of silver and gold or copper, our business or the
economy as a whole. These factors are, to some extent, beyond our control.
