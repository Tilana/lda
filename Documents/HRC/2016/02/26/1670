<p><b>  25/&#8230;  Right of the Palestinian people to self-determination 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, in 
particular the provisions of Articles 1 and 55 thereof, which affirm the right of peoples to 
self-determination, and reaffirming the need for the scrupulous respect of the principle of 
refraining in international relations from the threat or use of force, as specified in the 
Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and 
Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, adopted 
by the General Assembly in its resolution 2625 (XXV) of 24 October 1970, 
 <i>Guided</i> <i>also</i> by the provisions of article 1 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, which affirm that all peoples have the right to self-determination, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> <i>further</i> by the International Covenants on Human Rights, the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial 
Countries and Peoples and by the provisions of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
Action, adopted on 25 June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights,1 and in 
particular Part I, paragraphs 2 and 3, relating to the right of self-determination of all peoples 
and especially those subject to foreign occupation, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p> <i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolutions 181 A and B (II) of 29 November 1947 and 
194 (III) of 11 December 1948, as well as all other resolutions that confirm and define the 
inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, particularly their right to self-determination, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967, 338 
(1973) of 22 October 1973, 1397 (2002) of 12 March 2002 and 1402 (2002) of 30 March 
2002, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note</i> of General Assembly resolution 67/19 of 29 November 2012, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the conclusion of the International Court of Justice, in its advisory opinion 
of 9 July 2004, that the construction of the wall by Israel, the occupying Power, in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, along with measures previously 
taken, severely impedes the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> the resolutions adopted in this regard by the Commission on Human 
Rights, the last of which was resolution 2005/1 of 7 April 2005, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination in accordance 
with the provisions of the Charter, relevant United Nations resolutions and declarations, 
and the provisions of international covenants and instruments relating to the right to self-
determination as an international principle and as a right of all peoples in the world, and 
emphasizing that this jus cogens norm of international law is a basic prerequisite for 
achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the region of the Middle East, 
 <i>Affirming</i> the applicability of the principle of permanent sovereignty over natural 
resources to the Palestinian situation as an integral component of the right to self-
determination, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> the decision of the General Assembly, in its resolution 68/12 of 26 
November 2013, to proclaim 2014 the International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian 
People, and reaffirming that the United Nations will continue to be engaged on the question 
of Palestine until the question is resolved in all its aspects in accordance with international 
law, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the inalienable, permanent and unqualified right of the Palestinian 
people to self-determination, including their right to live in freedom, justice and dignity, 
and to establish their sovereign, independent, democratic and viable contiguous State; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also reaffirms</i> its support for the solution of two States, Palestine and Israel, 
living side by side in peace and security; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Stresses</i> the need for respect for and preservation of the territorial unity, 
contiguity and integrity of all of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East 
Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 4.  <i>Confirms</i> that the right of the Palestinian people to permanent sovereignty 
over their natural wealth and resources must be used in the interest of their national 
development, the well-being of the Palestinian people and as part of the realization of their 
right to self-determination; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Urges</i> all Member States and relevant bodies of the United Nations system to 
support and assist the Palestinian people in the early realization of their right to self-
determination; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Decides</i> to continue the consideration of this question at its twenty-eighth 
session.
