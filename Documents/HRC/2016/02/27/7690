<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In his final presentation to the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 would like to 
underscore the importance of this mandate as providing an independent witness to the 
evolving effects of the continuing occupation of Palestine by Israel. This exposure is 
centred upon the presentation of information received on the persistence of severe 
violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Bearing 
witness provides a record of violations by Israel and its defiant attitude, and challenges the 
United Nations to take steps to ensure compliance. It should be remembered that the 
suffering of the people of Palestine is inseparably linked to the partition arrangements 
initially proposed by the United Nations in 1947, and which were never implemented or 
revised in a manner that takes full account of the rights of the Palestinian people, above all 
their inalienable right of self-determination. 
</p>
<p>2. It was unfortunate that Israel refused even minimal cooperation with this mandate to 
the extent of allowing the Special Rapporteur to have access to occupied Palestine during 
the past six years or of responding to several urgent appeals addressing specific situations 
of immediate concern that fell within the purview of the mandate. This Special Rapporteur 
was expelled in December 2008 when attempting to enter Israel to carry out a mission of 
the mandate to visit occupied Palestine, and detained overnight in unpleasant prison 
conditions. Such humiliating non-cooperation represents a breach of the legal duty of States 
Members of the United Nations to facilitate all official undertakings of the organization. 
Although it has been possible to gain information needed to report on the situation 
confronting Palestinians living under occupation, non-cooperation deprives the mandate of 
direct interaction, including the receipt of testimony bearing on international law grievances 
from representatives of the Palestinian people. It is to be hoped that the next Special 
Rapporteur to be appointed will receive sufficient backing from the Human Rights Council 
to induce cooperation from Israel and better protection against defamatory attacks by some 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) than was the experience of the current mandate 
holder. 
</p>
<p>3. <i>International Law.</i> An abiding theme of the reports of the Special Rapporteur during 
the past six years has been the consistent failure of Israel to comply with clear legal 
standards embodied in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons 
in Time of War (Fourth Geneva Convention) and elsewhere in international humanitarian 
law and international human rights law. This pattern, as will be detailed below, is flagrant 
in relation to the wall, settlements, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, water and land 
resources, and the human rights of Palestinians living under occupation. Also relevant is the 
failure of the United Nations to ensure implementation of the recommendations as to 
international law contained in two high-profile Human Rights Council reports of 2009 and 
2013, respectively those of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict 
(A/HRC/12/48) and of the fact-finding mission to investigate the human rights implications 
of the Israeli settlements (A/HRC/22/63). To the extent such a pattern is tolerated, it 
undermines respect for international law. 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Palestine</i>. In the light of the General Assembly&#8217;s recognition of Palestine as a non-
member observer State in Assembly resolution 67/19 of 29 November 2012, it seems 
appropriate to refer to territory under Israeli occupation as &#8220;Palestine&#8221; rather than as 
&#8220;Occupied Palestinian Territories&#8221;. Such a shift in language also emphasizes the 
inadequacy of the international law framework available to address a condition of 
prolonged occupation that has now extended for more than 45 years. Special steps and 
procedures need to be adopted that will confer rights and establish the rule of law. To </p>


<p>sustain indefinitely an oppressive occupation containing many punitive elements also seems 
designed to encourage residents to leave Palestine, which is consistent with the apparent 
annexationist, colonialist and ethnic-cleansing goals of Israel, especially in relation to the 
West Bank, including East Jerusalem. 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Corporate responsibility</i>. Recent reports have underscored the potential implications 
for corporations and financial institutions that engage with and profit from Israeli 
settlements. The establishment and continued development of settlements is in violation of 
article 49(6) of the Fourth Geneva Convention, an assessment reinforced by the 
International Court of Justice in its advisory opinion of 2004 on the wall. Such an initiative 
has tried at all times to proceed cooperatively with the economic actors involved, and has 
acknowledged instances of compliance with international law and relevant United Nations 
guidelines and the encouraging recent indication of governmental and European Union 
reinforcement of these emergent obligations. This trend also converges with and reinforces 
the social mobilization of civil society in a variety of initiatives, especially the growing 
boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign. 
</p>
<p>6. <i>&#8220;Legitimacy war&#8221;</i>. In the pursuit of Palestinian rights under circumstances of 
prolonged occupation, there is increasing reason to believe that despite the authority of 
international law and the expressed will of States Members of the United Nations, the 
situation is essentially frozen, if not regressing. In addition, Palestinians seem increasingly 
disillusioned with armed resistance and with traditional intergovernmental diplomacy. 
Palestinian hopes for the realization of their fundamental rights have now shifted to 
engagement in a &#8220;legitimacy war&#8221;, which involves a worldwide struggle to gain control 
over the debate about legal entitlements and moral proprieties in the conflict supported by a 
global solidarity movement that has begun to sway public  opinion. The United Nations has 
a crucial role to play in this process by lending support to Palestinian claims of rights and 
providing assessments of associated grievances resulting from the violation by Israel of 
international humanitarian law and international human rights principles and standards.  
</p>
<p>7. <i>Language</i>. The Special Rapporteur believes that the language used to consider 
Palestinian grievances relating to international humanitarian law and international human 
rights law in Palestine needs to reflect everyday realities, and not remain beholden to 
technical wording and euphemisms that mask human suffering resulting from violations. It 
seems therefore appropriate to describe such unlawful impositions on the people resident in 
the West Bank by reference to &#8220;annexation&#8221; and &#8220;colonial ambitions&#8221; rather than 
&#8220;occupation&#8221;. Whether these impositions constitute &#8220;apartheid&#8221; is discussed in more detail 
below. Such clarifications at the level of language reinforce the contention that it is a matter 
of urgency to pursue more concerted efforts within United Nations venues to implement the 
rights of the Palestinian people. 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Emergency in Gaza</i>. Developments in the region, combined with an unlawful 
blockade maintained since mid-2007, has created a serious emergency situation in the Gaza 
Strip that threatens the entire population. From the perspective of international law, as 
argued in prior reports (A/HRC/20/32), Gaza remains &#8220;occupied&#8221;, despite the 
implementation by Israel of its &#8220;disengagement&#8221; plan in 2005, due to the control of borders, 
airspace and coastal waters, and periodic military incursions. The present situation is dire, 
as massive infrastructural failures cause daily hardship for the population, who are also at 
risk of epidemics. At the time of writing, with insufficient quantities of fuel reaching Gaza, 
electricity is available only for short periods, making it impossible for hospitals to provide 
proper treatment for seriously ill patients suffering from cancer and kidney ailments. The 
situation is aggravated by persisting tensions between the Palestinian Authority and the 
governing authorities in Gaza, and by the breakdown of cooperation along the border with 
Egypt. Egyptian security concerns in Sinai have led to greater restrictions at the Rafah 
crossing, and to the destruction of the tunnel complex in southern Gaza that had eased some </p>


<p>of the difficulties caused by the blockade. Some countries, notably Turkey and Qatar, have 
responded to this situation by providing emergency relief, but much more assistance is 
required, including pressure upon Israel to end the unlawful blockade. 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Urgency</i>. The stark reality is that the beleaguered occupied people of Gaza, over half 
of whom are children, are not receiving the protection to which they are entitled under 
international humanitarian law, which imposes an overall duty on the occupying Power to 
act in such a manner as to protect the civilian population from harm. Given the failure of 
Israel to live up to these obligations as set forth in the Fourth Geneva Convention, the 
United Nations and international society generally is challenged to take urgent action. The 
principles embedded in the concept of the responsibility to protect would seem to have a 
special applicability to the emergency conditions currently existing in Gaza that are being 
brought to the attention of the world by graphic pictures of sewage in the streets; 
widespread flooding; seasonal cold, including snow; and children entrapped by these 
conditions.  
</p>
<p><b> II. The wall and the 2004 advisory opinion 
</b>10. July 2014 will mark 10 years since the International Court of Justice gave its near 
unanimous advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the construction of a wall in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory (A/ES-10/273 and Corr.1). The refusal of Israel to 
implement this assessment of international law by the highest judicial body in the United 
Nations is cause for serious concern. 
</p>
<p>11. The question put to the Court by the General Assembly bears repeating: &#8220;What are 
the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel, the 
occupying Power, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including in and around East 
Jerusalem, &#8230;, considering the rules and principles of international law, including the 
Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, and relevant Security Council and General Assembly 
resolutions?&#8221;1 The International Court of Justice was unequivocal in its reply. In summary, 
it concluded that the construction of the wall in occupied Palestine, including East 
Jerusalem, and its associated regime, was contrary to international law. The crucial point is 
that it would not have been unlawful for Israel to build a security wall on an established 
international border, but to encroach unilaterally on territory occupied in 1967 was a 
flagrant violation of international law. The Court stated that Israel had a continuing duty to 
comply with its international obligations in this regard. It found that Israel was obliged to 
end the illegal situation, cease construction and dismantle the wall in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, and to make reparations for all damage caused as a result of the wall 
(A/ES-10/273 and Corr.1, para. 145).  
</p><p>12. In addition to the conclusions addressing the obligations of Israel, the Court stated 
that all States are obliged not to recognize the illegal situation arising from the wall, and 
that States parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention were obliged to ensure compliance by 
Israel with that Convention. Finally, the Court suggested that the United Nations, and 
especially the General Assembly and the Security Council, should consider further action to 
overcome this illegal situation resulting from the construction of the wall and its associated 
regime (ibid., para. 163 (3)(D) and (E)).  
13. In clear defiance of international law, Israel has continued construction of the wall 
and maintains on its website a map of 30 April 2006 showing its revised route.2 At the time

<p>of the advisory opinion, the Secretary-General estimated that approximately 180 km of the 
wall had been completed (A/ES-10/273 and Corr.1, para. 82). Since that time, parts of the 
wall have been re-routed.3 In 2013, the Secretary-General reported that approximately 62 
per cent of the wall had been completed (A/68/502, para. 22). A further 10 per cent was 
under construction, and construction of the remaining 28 per cent of the planned route had 
not yet commenced. Upon completion, the wall is expected to run approximately 708 km. 
</p>
<p>14. About 85 per cent of the planned route of the wall lies within the West Bank, and 
will cut off and isolate 9.4 per cent of the West Bank territory, including East Jerusalem 
and so-called No-Man&#8217;s Land.4 Palestinian communities affected by the wall experience 
varying degrees of isolation and restrictions on their freedom of movement. The seam 
zone&#8217;s5 associated permit regime requires Palestinians to continually apply for temporary 
permits to allow them to reside in their home area and carry on aspects of their lives that 
require entering or exiting the seam zone. In order to have access to farming land beyond 
Israeli-controlled access gates, leave and return for work, have access to education, health 
and other services, visit family and friends or arrange for visits to those communities for 
non-resident Palestinians, prior permission by Israeli authorities is necessary. This permit 
procedure imposes daily hardships on many Palestinians.6 
</p>
<p>15. The Ministry of Defense states that &#8220;the Security Fence does not annex territories to 
the State of Israel, nor will it change the status of the residents of these areas&#8221;.7 Israel 
maintains that the purpose of the wall is to ensure security and protect Israeli citizens from 
terrorist attacks. In 2011, the Israeli High Court of Justice supported this reasoning 
regarding security in rejecting NGO petitions which claimed that the permit regime was 
aimed at expropriating and annexing Palestinian land and which argued that its exclusive 
application to Palestinians, and not, for example, to settlers in the zone, was discriminatory 
and comparable to the Pass Laws of apartheid-era South Africa.8 However, the High 
Court&#8217;s assertion does not overcome the conclusion by the International Court of Justice 
that the grave infringements of the rights of Palestinians caused by the wall in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory were not necessary to satisfy legitimate Israeli security requirements 
(A/ES-10/273 and Corr.1, para. 136). 
</p><p>16. If protection of Israeli citizens were indeed the only reason for the wall and the 
associated regime, it begs the question of why Israel continues to support the expansion of 
illegal settlements in the West Bank, thus moving an increasing number of Israeli citizens 
into the very area from which it says the risk emanates. That continued settlement on West 
Bank land, including East Jerusalem, cut off by the wall seems to be creating a fait 
accompli amounting to de facto annexation, is a grave concern raised by the Human Rights 
Council, which has demanded that Israel comply with the advisory opinion (Council 
resolution 22/26).  
17. For Palestinian residents isolated from the rest of the West Bank by the wall, and 
living under the permit regime and other restrictions, the issue is not only about status, but

<p>also about how life is made untenable, inducing more and more Palestinians to abandon 
their land and leave. By way of illustration, for years, the village of Nabi Samuel reportedly 
attempted to improve the village school. The village&#8217;s location in the seam zone 
complicates access to outside education. The United Nations Under-Secretary-General for 
Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator stated on her 2011 visit to the 
village: &#8220;I am horrified by the way the Barrier affects Palestinians. It divides communities 
and inhibits the provision of services. I visited a one-room school with no windows and 
very few facilities, which can&#8217;t be improved because the planning rules don&#8217;t allow it. This 
is unacceptable.&#8221;9 In September 2013, the village succeeded in installing a container on the 
school ground to serve as an additional classroom. However, the school is now in danger of 
losing one of its two rooms for lack of a building permit.10 These acutely burdensome living 
conditions lead to the displacement of long-term residents. In 2012, the Village Council 
noted that over the past decade at least 10 families have left the village, which counts some 
260 residents.11 
</p>
<p>18. Another case in point is the approximately 25 houses making up the village of 
Al-Numan. It is also encircled by the wall, with its only access through an Israeli 
checkpoint, and restricted from unlicensed building activity, effectively preventing families 
and the population of the village from growing, as housing needs cannot be met.12 
Consequently, the villagers have seen their own number fall while observing the 
neighbouring illegal Har Homa settlement&#8217;s steady growth in occupied territory. In 2006 
Al-Haq published a case study on the indirect forcible transfer taking place in Al-Numan.13 
These are but two concrete examples of the obstacles communities face daily. In 2012, the 
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that approximately 7,500 
Palestinians still lived in the seam zone,14 down from an estimated 10,000 people in 2003.15 
Upon completion of the wall, an estimated 25,000 Palestinians would be located in the 
seam zone, a figure which does not include the Palestinian population in East Jerusalem.16 
</p>
<p>19. Regular demonstrations against the wall and its associated regime staged in affected 
villages are often violently suppressed.17 A website for the village of Bil&#8217;in, a farming 
community, describes its struggle thus: &#8220;[Bil&#8217;in] is fighting to safeguard its land, its olive 
trees, its resources &#8230; its liberty&#8230; Supported by Israeli and international activists, Bil&#8217;in 
residents peacefully demonstrate every Friday in front of the <b>&#8216;</b>work-site of shame&#8217;. And 
every Friday the Israeli army responds with both physical and psychological violence.&#8221;18 
</p>
<p>20. The impact of the wall on people&#8217;s lives is reflected in the progress report of the 
Board of the United Nations Register of Damage Caused by the Construction of the Wall in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory (see A/ES-10/599). As at June 2013, 36,803 claim forms

<p>for registration of damage had been received and, of the almost 9,000 claims decided, all 
but 576 claims were found to meet the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the register. 
Claimants may submit claims under categories of losses including: agriculture; commercial; 
residential; employment; access to services; and public resources.19 
</p>
<p>21. In his first report to the General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur recommended 
seeking the assistance of the Security Council for the implementation of the advisory 
opinion (A/63/326, para. 51(b)). In the face of the unequivocal opinion of the International 
Court of Justice, and of General Assembly resolution ES-10/15, in which the Assembly 
called on Israel to comply with the advisory opinion, Israel has defiantly acted as if 
international law and international judicial authority has no bearing on its policies and 
behaviour. With the tenth anniversary of the advisory opinion approaching, it is time again 
to examine what legitimate action by the international community can be taken to achieve 
compliance with international law, as set out by the International Court of Justice. It is often 
supposed that because the legal findings of the Court were embedded in an &#8220;advisory 
opinion&#8221; it has no bearing on the status of the legal obligations of Israel. This is incorrect. 
An advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice is as determinative with respect to 
the authority of international law as a judgement in a dispute between two or more States, 
but unlike such a judgement between States that can be directly enforced by reliance on 
Article 94 of the Charter of the United Nations, an advisory opinion cannot be so 
implemented. However, this difference does not weaken the obligation of Israel to act in 
accordance with this authoritative determination of international legal obligations, and its 
failure to do so puts it in breach of international law and responsible for the cumulative 
harm inflicted on the Palestinian people. It is past time for the United Nations to take action 
that seeks to protect the rights of the Palestinian people bearing on the sanctity of their 
territory and its relation to the underlying right of self-determination. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Israeli settlements and the fragmentation of occupied Palestine  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Facts on the ground  
</b></p>
<p>22. The hallmark of Israel&#8217;s 46-year prolonged annexing occupation of Palestine has 
been the determined pursuit by Israel of settlement construction and expansion in the West 
Bank, including East Jerusalem, in defiance of its international law obligations (A/68/513, 
paras. 4&#8211;5). This was clearly reflected in the findings of the international fact-finding 
mission on the implications of Israeli settlements (A/HRC/22/63). Throughout the past six 
years, the Special Rapporteur has periodically reported on the expansion of settlements and 
outposts20 in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem (in breach of Israel&#8217;s own 
commitment to freeze settlement expansion, including natural growth under the 2003 
Quartet road map), and the impact of associated policies and practices on the human rights 
of Palestinians living in the occupied territory.21 While the pro-settlement camp claims that 
&#8220;settlements aren&#8217;t the problem&#8221;,22 this view stands in sharp contrast to the facts on the 
ground. 
</p>
<p>23. Increasing fragmentation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, by way of a 
combination of policies and practices including, but not limited to: the wall; the creation of

<p>seam zones; checkpoints; zoning and planning restrictions; demolition of homes and forced 
evictions (particularly of Bedouin communities in Area C); revocation of residency rights; 
the designation of vast tracts of land in the West Bank as closed military zones or natural 
reserves; and the expropriation of land for settler agriculture or industrial zones, may 
irreversibly disrupt the contiguity of the West Bank, undermining a just and sustainable 
two-State solution.23 
</p>
<p>24. Peace Now, an Israeli NGO, called attention to &#8220;Bibi&#8217;s settlements boom&#8221; in 2013, 
reporting that tenders had been published for 3,472 new units in settlements, and that plans 
had been promoted for 8,943 new settlement units in the eight months since the Netanyahu 
Government took office in March 2013.24 Despite a brief and limited 10-month moratorium 
on settlement construction in 2010 during the last round of unsuccessful peace talks (which 
also demonstrated the ability of Israel to halt settlement activity if desired), Israel issued 
tenders for the construction of 5,302 housing units in the West Bank, including East 
Jerusalem, during the period from March 2009 to January 2013.25 
</p>
<p>25. The timing of announcements regarding settlement expansion has also been 
provocative, with the two most recent announcements coinciding with the first and second 
round of Palestinian prisoner releases by Israel in the context of the renewed peace 
negotiations that began in August 2013. The passage of time under the status quo has not 
been a neutral factor for Palestinians, as more &#8220;facts on the ground&#8221; are created daily, 
strengthening the position of Israel in its preferred mode of power-based negotiations (as 
opposed to negotiations based on rights and international law). Despite protestations over 
settlement activity by the United Nations, and notably also by the United States of 
America26 and the European Union,  Israel continues to use State power and resources to 
promote its defiant settlement policies. The Secretary-General has described Israel as 
playing a leading role in the construction and expansion of settlements (A/68/513, para. 3).  
</p><p>26. This latter factor is important to note if the removal of existing settlements were to 
occur as part of a peace agreement. Approximately half of all settlements in the West Bank 
can be classified by type as either &#8220;quality of life&#8221;, or a mixture of &#8220;quality of 
life/ideological&#8221;, which tend to be inhabited by predominately secular or mixed settler 
populations.27  Israel might be able to re-incentivize economic settlers, who were persuaded 
to move to the West Bank settlements through various government benefits and incentives, 
to re-settle to the west of the pre-1967 borders of Israel. However, it would have a more 
difficult time removing the more religious settlers who live in approximately 70 settlements 
across the West Bank, all the more so as population growth in the settlements 
(approximately 2.8 per cent) continues to outstrip population growth in Israel.28 It also 
remains to be seen whether an emergent settler unity precludes implementing a future peace 
agreement based on inducing economic settlers to return to Israel. Certainly, it may be 
anticipated that ideological settlers would do their best to prevent such a division and the 
implementation of such an agreement.

 Palestinian Centre for Human Rights submission to Special Rapporteur, 22 November 2013. </p>


<p>27. A small minority within the ideologically motivated settlers has been responsible for 
most of the violence committed against Palestinian men, women and children and against 
their homes and properties. In the first 10 months of 2013, 361 incidents of settler violence 
were reported, including 87 resulting in the injury of Palestinians (compared to a total of 
366 incidents in 2012).29 Most of these incidents occurred in the Nablus, Ramallah and 
Hebron governorates. Settler violence is reinforced by a lack of accountability and the 
related failure of Israeli law enforcement forces to protect vulnerable Palestinian 
communities (A/68/513, paras. 42-52).  
</p><p>28. Housing demolitions and displacement of Palestinian communities also kept up with 
the settlement boom in 2013. From January to October 2013, 533 Palestinian homes and 
livelihood structures were demolished, including 205 residential structures, displacing 969 
people, including 441 children. International donor-funded structures, paid for by taxpayers 
around the world, were not spared from demolition, and 96 donor-funded structures, 
including residential, livestock-related and water and sanitation facilities in the West Bank 
were demolished by Israeli authorities.  
</p>
<p>29. Herding communities living in small villages in Area C have been particularly 
vulnerable to these Israeli practices. In 2013, the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights twice spoke out against the demolition of at least three Bedouin and herder 
communities in the northern Jordan Valley.30 Violations by Israel of international law 
extend to actively preventing the provision of urgent humanitarian assistance from the 
international community to the affected Palestinian communities.31 
</p>
<p><b>  The future of outposts 
</b></p>
<p>30. In July 2012, the Government-appointed committee to examine the state of 
construction in the West Bank,  chaired by Supreme Court Justice (Ret.) Edmund Levy (the 
Levy Committee), issued its report on the legal status of Israeli settlements in the West 
Bank and, in particular, set forth recommended steps to regularize the construction of 
&#8220;illegal settlements&#8221; (outposts) in the West Bank (currently numbering over 100). It 
concluded that the international laws of occupation, including the Fourth Geneva 
Convention, did not apply to Israel&#8217;s unique situation in Judea and Samaria (the name given 
the West Bank in internal Israeli discourse and signalling a claimed biblical attachment), 
and that Israelis had the legal right to settle in the West Bank despite the international 
consensus.  
</p>
<p>31. The conclusions of the Levy Committee not only reflected disregard of international 
law but also set forth a quasi-legal retroactive endorsement of outposts, formally 
unauthorized under Israeli law. In fact, the Committee determined that existing outposts 
were &#8220;carried out with the knowledge, encouragement and tacit agreement of the most 
senior political level, government ministers and the Prime Minister, and therefore such 
conduct is to be seen as implied agreement&#8221;.32 A previous report of 2005 by Talia Sasson, a 
former Chief State Prosecutor, concerning the illegal outposts had not gone so far as to 
implicate the senior-most political echelon of the country, but had found the World Zionist 
Organization (fully funded from the State Treasury), the Ministry of Construction and 
Housing, the Civil Administration in Judea and Samaria, and the Assistant to the Defense 
Minister complicit in the establishment of new unauthorized outposts, and exposed an

<p>unelected bureaucracy in charge of creating new outposts without political authorization or 
oversight.33  
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur notes that while Sasson&#8217;s report labelled the outposts as 
illegal under Israeli law and recommended their dismantlement, developments on the 
ground since then have shown that successive Israeli Governments preferred to follow the 
approach endorsed post facto by the Levy Committee. Of 1,708 units constructed in West 
Bank settlements in the first half of 2013, 180 units were located in outposts (see 
A/HRC/25/38). In May 2013, Israel announced plans to legalize four outposts in the West 
Bank (in other words to recognize them as official settlements).34 While the Netanyahu 
Government never adopted the Levy report, the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice 
Committee is expected to debate the report early in December 2013, indicating that it is 
being taken seriously at the highest levels in Israel.35  
</p>
<p><b>  &#8220;Demographic balance&#8221; in East Jerusalem  
</b>33. The status of East Jerusalem remains one of the most contentious issues to be 
resolved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is worth recalling that in its resolution 
478 (1980), the Security Council affirmed that the Basic Law of Israel proclaiming 
Jerusalem, including the annexed area, as the capital of Israel constitutes a violation of 
international law and does not affect the application of the Fourth Geneva Convention in 
Palestine, including East Jerusalem.  
</p>
<p>34. For Palestinians living in East Jerusalem, their situation would not be as precarious 
if, despite the illegality of annexation, they were treated equally and afforded access to 
quality education, health care and housing. Instead, Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are 
regarded as &#8220;permanent residents&#8221; and subject to a gradual and bureaucratic process of 
ethnic cleansing.36 This has consisted of revocation of residency permits, demolitions of 
residential structures built without Israeli permits (often virtually impossible to obtain),37 
and forced evictions of Palestinian families, in violation of the basic right to adequate 
housing, enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>35. A 2013 report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development on the 
Palestinian economy in East Jerusalem detailed Israeli policies that have impeded the 
natural growth of the Palestinian economy. It also noted that Palestinians are made to pay 
high municipal taxes in return for poor services and disproportionately low public 
expenditure in East Jerusalem.38 This has been particularly evident with respect to 
education, characterized by a shortage of classrooms, a high overall dropout rate of 13 per 
cent among Palestinian schools in East Jerusalem, and a general neglect of the Arab 
schooling system in comparison to their Jewish counterparts literally metres away in 
West Jerusalem.39 
</p>
<p>36. The situation in East Jerusalem today is a microcosm of the fragmentation of 
territory taking place across the West Bank. Israel actively seeks to undermine the 
Palestinian presence to serve its goal of preserving a Jewish majority in East Jerusalem.

<p>This has been a policy of Israel for decades, acknowledged by the Jerusalem Municipality, 
to maintain a demographic balance of approximately 70 per cent Jewish to 30 per cent 
Palestinian in Jerusalem.40 
</p>
<p>37. Since 1996, an estimated 11,023 Jerusalem Palestinians have lost their resident 
status and right to live in occupied East Jerusalem.41 During the period 2004&#8211;2013, 492 
housing units were demolished in East Jerusalem, displacing 1,943 Palestinians. These 
figures account only for officially demolished housing units and do not include homes 
demolished by some owners after receiving a demolition order to avoid perverse heavy 
municipal penalties and demolition costs associated with the destruction of their own 
homes.42  
</p>
<p>38. The most problematic plan advanced in East Jerusalem in recent years has been the 
expansion of settlements and infrastructure around Har Homa, Gilo and Givat Hamatos, as 
well as the E1 settlement bloc to the east, which threatens to cut off East Jerusalem from 
the rest of the West Bank.43 Eventual peace depends crucially on ensuring that Palestinian 
rights in East Jerusalem are not further jeopardized. 
</p>
<p><b>  Corporate complicity in international crimes  
</b></p>
<p>39. Over the past two years, the Special Rapporteur focused attention on companies 
involved in business and financial activities related to the Israeli settlement enterprise as 
well as the possibility of corporate complicity in international crimes related to Israeli 
settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.44 
</p>
<p>40. The effort to focus on business activities in the settlements was made, in part, to 
bring a measure of accountability with respect to the emergent human rights obligations of 
companies in conformity with international law and the Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s intention was not only to provide a sound legal 
basis upon which to assess the complicity of businesses in international crimes related to 
the settlements, but also to clearly set out the risks and associated costs in terms of 
reputation, as well as the potential legal consequences of doing business in the settlements.  
</p>
<p>41. The responses received from some of the 13 companies analysed in an earlier report 
(A/67/379) were mixed. Nonetheless, there have been a number of recent developments in 
relation to the involvement of other businesses involved in the settlements to indicate that 
public pressure and media attention does bring some ethical dividends, and has encouraged 
Governments to be more vigilant.  
</p>
<p>42. Some positive developments in this regard include Royal HaskoningDHV, a Dutch 
company, which announced in September 2013 its decision to terminate a contract with the 
Jerusalem Municipality to build a wastewater treatment plant in East Jerusalem.45 In 
December, Vitens, a Dutch water utility company, decided to cut its ties with Mekorot, the 
Israeli national water company, citing concerns in relation to the adherence of international 
laws.46 Earlier, in August 2013, the Swedish-Norwegian bank Nordea excluded Cemex, one 
of the companies taken up in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s earlier report, from its investment

<p>portfolio, due to its extraction of non-renewable natural resources from occupied 
Palestine.47 Such examples should lead the way for more countries and companies to follow 
suit, as well as alerting Governments to their responsibility to urge companies subject to 
their authority to act in accordance with international law.  
</p>
<p>43. While due diligence on the part of businesses is an inherent aspect of corporate 
responsibility, Governments also have the obligation, as noted by the fact-finding mission 
on settlements, to take measures to ensure that they do not recognize an unlawful situation 
arising from the illegal activities of Israel.48 In this regard, the European Union guidelines 
which establish that all agreements between Israel and the European Union for grants, 
prizes and financial instruments funded by the European Union must now unequivocally 
and explicitly indicate their inapplicability to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 
represents a step in the right direction.  
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur is also encouraged by the recent issuance by the 
Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of guidelines for 
businesses, which for the first time outline the risks of trading with Israeli settlements, and 
specifically warn of the legal and economic risks stemming from the fact that the Israeli 
settlements, according to international law, are built on occupied land and are not 
recognized as a legitimate part of the territory of Israel.49  
</p>
<p><b>  Trade with the settlements 
</b></p>
<p>45. The diligence shown by the European Union and some of its Member States 
regarding the responsibility of businesses operating in occupied Palestine naturally leads to 
the following question: Are the same human rights standards applied by countries when it 
comes to trade relations with the settlements? If the statements issued by the European 
Union and the United States protesting the expansion of settlements reiterate their illegality 
and illegitimacy, then steps should be taken to ensure that related actions also reflect a 
genuine commitment to human rights and respect for international law, for example by 
ceasing trade with the settlements starting with a ban on imports of settlement produce.  
</p>
<p>46. While produce originating in the Israeli settlements is not entitled to benefit from 
preferential tariff treatment under the European Union-Israel Association Agreement, fresh 
agricultural produce exported from the settlements &#8212; but falsely labelled as &#8220;made in 
Israel&#8221; &#8212; can still be found on many supermarket shelves across the European Union due 
to the voluntary nature of labelling requirements. Considering the fact that the European 
Union remains one of the most important trading partners for the settlements, with annual 
exports worth $300 million, a ban on settlement produce would have a significant impact. It 
should also not be forgotten that trade with settlements is linked to the violation of human 
rights with respect to Palestinian communities denied access to fertile agricultural land, 
water and other natural resources.  
</p>
<p>47. So long as illegal settlements are supported through trade, statements protesting the 
expansion of settlements from the main trading partners of Israel will have little resonance 
on the ground, and third party States will continue to be associated with the violation of 
human rights in occupied Palestine.

<p><b> IV. The Gaza Strip 
</b>48. In the space of six years since this Special Rapporteur assumed this mandate, the 
population of the Gaza Strip has lived through two major Israeli military operations (Cast 
Lead from December 2008 to January 2009 and Pillar of Defence in November 2012), and 
endured Israel&#8217;s illegal blockade (in place since June 2007). Both conflicts inflicted 
disproportionate casualties and devastation on the Palestinian civilian population. This has 
been well documented by the United Nations.50 
</p>
<p>49. Since June 2013, the humanitarian situation in Gaza has worsened. In recent months, 
the destruction by the Egyptian authorities of most underground tunnels, which although 
problematic had been a lifeline to the residents, has had a particularly serious impact on the 
availability of fuel at affordable prices in Gaza. This has led to severe power shortages, 
resulting in shutdowns of sewage treatment facilities, and disruptions to specialized health 
services, such as kidney dialysis, operating theatres, blood banks, intensive care units and 
incubators, putting the lives of vulnerable patients in Gaza at risk.51 The frequent closures 
of the Rafah crossing in recent months have generally prevented access to affordable health 
care in Egypt, which remains essential given the limitations of the Gaza health system.  
</p>
<p>50. The most egregious violations of human rights committed by Israel have been in its 
enforcement, using excessive force, of arbitrary access to restricted areas at sea and on land, 
profoundly affecting the lives of Palestinian fishermen and agricultural farmers and 
households dependent upon them. The more pervasive forms of human rights violations 
also linked to the blockade have been well documented by the Secretary-General 
(A/68/502), and include inter alia, severe restrictions on movement into and out of Gaza 
from Israel and adverse impacts on the rights of Palestinians in Gaza to education, health 
and work. In addition, severe export restrictions (and limitations on imports) undermine the 
potential of the Gaza economy, and accentuate the impoverished conditions that prevail in 
Gaza.52 The recent refusal of Israel to allow exports from Gaza to the West Bank, despite a 
Dutch donation of a container security scanner, is emblematic of the denial of the right to 
development in Gaza, and undercuts claims by Israel that its actions are taken to serve 
genuine security concerns.53  
</p>
<p><b> V. The question of apartheid and segregation 
</b></p>
<p>51. In 2011, the Special Rapporteur reiterated the call made by his predecessor in 2007, 
for a referral to the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion on the question of 
whether &#8220;elements of the [Israeli] occupation constitute forms of colonialism and 
apartheid&#8221;.54 More precisely, he recommended that the Court be asked to assess the 
allegations that the prolonged occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem possess 
elements of &#8220;colonialism&#8221;, &#8220;apartheid&#8221; and &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; inconsistent with 
international humanitarian law in circumstances of belligerent occupation and unlawful 
abridgement of the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.55 Since no advisory 
opinion has been sought following the aforementioned reports of successive Special 
Rapporteurs, in the present report the Special Rapporteur assumes part of the task of

<p>analysing whether allegations of apartheid in occupied Palestine are well founded. He 
discusses Israeli policies and practices through the lens of the international prohibition of 
ethnic discrimination, segregation and apartheid.  
</p>
<p><b>  Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>52. Apartheid is prohibited under international law, and Israel, as a State and an 
occupying Power, is bound by this prohibition. Under Protocol I additional to the Geneva 
Conventions, which is declaratory of international law and therefore widely regarded as 
universally binding, &#8220;practices of &#8216;apartheid&#8217; and other inhuman and degrading practices 
involving outrages upon personal dignity, based on racial discrimination&#8221; are included as 
grave breaches.56 Further, the International Law Commission has noted that Governments at 
the United Nations Conference on the Law of Treaties (1968) generally agreed that the 
prohibitions constituting peremptory norms included apartheid.57 In addition, article 3 of the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
provides that &#8220;States Parties particularly condemn racial segregation and <i>apartheid</i> and 
undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of this nature in territories under 
their jurisdiction&#8221;.58 At the second universal periodic review of Israel in October 2013, 
South Africa recommended that Israel &#8220;prohibit policies and practices of racial segregation 
that disproportionately affect the Palestinian population in the OPT&#8221; (A/HRC/25/15, para. 
136.202). 
53. Apartheid involves the domination of one racial group over another, and some may 
argue that neither Israeli Jews nor Palestinians constitute racial groups per se. However, 
article 1 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, in its definition of racial discrimination, makes it clear that race is in fact 
not the sole factor, but that racial discrimination may be based on &#8220;any distinction, 
exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic 
origin&#8221;. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has stressed that under 
the definition in article 1 &#8220;the Convention relates to all persons who belong to different 
races, national or ethnic groups or to indigenous peoples&#8221;.59 
</p>
<p>54. The International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of 
Apartheid, in article 2, provides a detailed definition of the crime of apartheid, providing 
that it &#8220;shall include similar policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination 
as practised in southern Africa&#8221;, and applies to &#8220;inhuman acts committed for the purpose of 
establishing and maintaining domination by one racial group of persons over any other 
racial group of persons and systematically oppressing them&#8221;. The Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court echoes these core elements (art. 7, para. 2(h)) and further 
specifies that for such acts to constitute &#8220;crimes against humanity&#8221; they must be 
&#8220;committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian 
population, with knowledge of the attack&#8221; (art. 7, para. 1). Without prejudice to any 
possible differences in the elements of apartheid as an international crime and an 
internationally wrongful act, apartheid will be treated as a single concept for the purpose of 
the present report, which will be framed around the inhuman acts laid out in article 2(a)&#8211;(f)

(i) murder; (ii) serious bodily and mental harm, infringement of freedom, and torture, and 
(iii) arbitrary arrest and illegal imprisonment. With respect to article 2(a)(i), continuing 
excessive use of force by Israeli security forces (ISF) and a lack of accountability for 
violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law is well-
documented by successive United Nations resolutions and reports.61 Palestinians are killed 
as a result of regular Israeli military incursions into occupied Palestine; lethal use of force 
against demonstrators; official endorsement of targeted killings; and large-scale military 
operations.62 
</p>
<p>56. According to B&#8217;Tselem, between 1987 and 2000 just under 1,400 Palestinians were 
killed by ISF.63 After the year 2000, deaths of Palestinians caused by ISF accelerated, with 
more than 6,700 deaths, as at October 2013.64 Of this number, over 3,100 were civilians not 
involved in hostilities. B&#8217;Tselem&#8217;s statistics show that during Israel&#8217;s &#8220;Cast Lead&#8221; 
operation in Gaza, of the 344 children reportedly killed, 318 did not take part in hostilities. 
During the same operation, of the 110 Palestinian women recorded as killed, two were 
police officers and the remaining 108 did not take part in the hostilities. During operation 
&#8220;Pillar of Defence&#8221;, approximately 100 Palestinian civilians, a third of whom were 
children, were reportedly killed as a result of ISF actions (A/HRC/22/35/Add.1, para. 6). 
</p><p>57. Additional deaths were caused by the ISF policy of targeted killing, which resulted 
in the killing of 369 Palestinians during the period September 2000&#8211;December 2013. 
Moreover, on average, for every person killed as a target of ISF, one or two other persons 
have been killed in any given operation. Thus, during the same period, 453 Palestinians 
who were not targets were also killed.65 
</p>
<p>58. Individual accounts by former soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), published 
by the Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence, bear witness to Israeli policy in respect to the 
occupied people: &#8220; &#8216;Prevention of terror&#8217; is the stamp of approval granted to any offensive 
IDF action in the Territories, obscuring the distinction between the use of force against 
terrorists and the use of force against civilians. In this way, the IDF is able to justify actions 
that intimidate and oppress the Palestinian population overall.&#8221;66 
</p>
<p>59. Under a simple interpretation, the term murder, as referred to in the International 
Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, signifies the 
unlawful taking of life. Therefore, the taking of lives &#8212; outside the limited circumstances 
in which international humanitarian law and international human rights law do not 
absolutely prohibit this &#8212; potentially constitutes an element of apartheid, in the context of 
a systematic and institutional regime in which these unlawful killings form part of acts 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>60
 Israel is not a party to the Convention and it is debated whether it was intended to apply exclusively 
</p>
<p>to South Africa. Nonetheless, it continues to inform the prohibition of apartheid in international law.

<p>carried out in order to maintain dominance over Palestinians. The relatively high proportion 
of civilian casualties caused by ISF in occupied Palestine is notable in this respect.  
</p>
<p>60. In regard to article 2(a)(ii) and (iii), detention by Israel of Palestinians is closely 
linked to the occurrence of torture and ill-treatment. According to the Prisoner Support and 
Human Rights Association, Addameer, in September 2013, there were some 5,000 
Palestinian political prisoners, including 137 administrative detainees.67 Many detainees are 
transferred to prisons in Israel, in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention (art. 76).68  
</p><p>61. In 2012, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination urged Israel to 
end administrative detention, which is discriminatory and constitutes arbitrary detention 
under international human rights law (CERD/C/ISR/CO/14-16, para. 27). Similar 
recommendations were made by a number of States during the most recent universal 
periodic review of Israel (A/HRC/25/15). The Committee further recommended that Israel 
ensure equal access to justice for all persons living in territories under its effective control, 
noting that Jewish settlers in occupied Palestine are subject to a civil law regime, while a 
military regime applies to Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.  
</p>
<p>62. Despite the absolute prohibition of torture,69 Palestinians detained by Israel continue 
to be subjected to torture and ill-treatment (A/68/379).70 Methods of torture and ill-
treatment reportedly include: sleep deprivation; excessive use of handcuffs; beatings; verbal 
abuse; stress positions; solitary confinement; humiliation; and threats of killing, sexual 
assault and house demolitions, against the detainee or his or her family.71  
</p>
<p>63. In 1999 the Israeli High Court said that using certain methods of physical pressure 
for the purpose of &#8220;breaking&#8221; a detainee are unlawful and that interrogation methods must 
be fair and reasonable, and respectful of human dignity.72 While representing an important 
recognition of the illegality of certain methods of torture employed against Palestinian 
detainees, the decision failed to outlaw torture by allowing the &#8220;ticking bomb&#8221; or 
&#8220;necessity&#8221; defence. According to Addameer, &#8220;necessity&#8221; is used by interrogators as a 
blanket defence with little to no accountability.73 The Public Committee against Torture in 
Israel reported that of 701 formal complaints of torture submitted between 2001 and 2010, 
none resulted in a criminal investigation.74 
</p>
<p>64. Palestinian children are not exempt. In 2013, UNICEF concluded that 
&#8220;Ill-treatment &#8230; appears to be widespread, systematic and institutionalized&#8221;75 in the case of 
Palestinian children held in the Israeli military detention system. Israeli authorities seem to 
have taken some limited steps towards meeting the UNICEF recommendations,76 including 
by piloting test summons in two West Bank areas instead of conducting frightening night 
arrests of children.77 While this is clearly a needed development, it also shows just how

<p>basic the denial and lack of protection of Palestinian children&#8217;s rights is under the Israeli 
military legal regime. By comparison, Israeli settler children in conflict with the law are 
subject to regular Israeli law. According to Defence for Children International, as at 
October 2013, 159 Palestinian children were in Israeli military detention.78 On average, 
around 700 children are detained and prosecuted per year, most commonly on charges of 
throwing stones.79 
</p>
<p>65. The regular denial by Israel of the right to life and liberty of significant numbers of 
Palestinians is reflected in its policies, laws and practices in occupied Palestine. 
</p>
<p>66. Article 2(b) refers to the imposition of living conditions calculated to cause a 
group&#8217;s physical destruction in whole or in part. It seems unlikely that the policies, laws 
and practices of Israel can be said to have as their aim the physical destruction of the 
occupied people.80 
</p>
<p>67. Article 2(c) concerns measures calculated to prevent participation in the political, 
social, economic and cultural life of the country and the full development of a racial group, 
including and especially by denying them their rights to work, to education, to leave and to 
return to their country, to nationality, and to freedoms of movement and residence, opinion 
and expression, and peaceful assembly and association.  
</p>
<p>68. Violations of many of these rights have already been touched on in preceding 
sections. For instance the violations by Israel of the rights to work, education, freedom of 
movement and residence, and freedom of expression and assembly have been illustrated in 
the context of discussing the wall and its associated regime, and policies and laws related to 
the development of settlements, including in East Jerusalem. The rights to work, to freedom 
of movement, and to leave and return to one&#8217;s country, are particularly relevant to Gaza. In 
the West Bank, the denial of rights to Palestinians is made possible by the existence of 
parallel legal systems operating in the same territory: one set of civil and criminal laws for 
Israeli settlers and another for Palestinian Arabs, subject to Israeli military orders, as well 
as other laws. While the Israeli High Court of Justice formally exercises judicial oversight 
of the Israeli administration in occupied Palestine, according to NGOs, case law illustrates a 
trend whereby major policy decisions of government, e.g. relating to the wall and 
settlements, tend to be immune from judicial intervention, and that human rights and 
protection under international humanitarian law have not been adequately upheld by the 
High Court in its rulings.81 The creation of Israeli legal zones for settlers and the resulting 
segregation was noted in the 2013 report by the independent fact-finding mission on 
settlements (A/HRC/22/63). The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in 
2012 expressed that it was &#8220;extremely concerned&#8221; at policies and practices amounting to de 
facto segregation and that it was &#8220;particularly appalled at the hermetic character of the 
separation of the two groups&#8221; (CERD/C/ISR/CO/14-16, para. 24). 
</p><p>69. It is clear that Israeli measures, in the form of policies, laws and practices, have the 
effect of preventing Palestinians from full participation in the political, social, economic 
and cultural life of Palestine and arguably also prevent their full development in both the 
West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

 The United Nations has questioned whether Gaza will be a liveable place in 2020 (&#8220;<i>Gaza in 2020: A 
</i></p>
<p><i>Liveable Place</i>?&#8221; 2012). Considering the situation in Gaza, the Russell Tribunal found that Israeli 
policies aimed at causing displacement of Palestinians, rather than their physical destruction.

<p>70. Article 2(d) refers to measures designed to divide the population along racial lines 
including by the creation of separate reserves and ghettos for the members of a racial group 
or groups, and the expropriation of landed property. The expropriation of Palestinian land is 
an obvious part of the expansion of settlements and of the construction of the wall. The 
fragmentation of Palestinian land and creation of separate reserves and enclaves, including 
the plans threatening to cut off East Jerusalem from the rest of the West bank, is well 
documented (A/HRC/22/63). The final conclusions of the Russell Tribunal on Palestine 
state: &#8220;Israel has through its laws and practices divided the Israeli Jewish and Palestinian 
populations and allocated them different physical spaces, with varying levels and quality of 
infrastructure, services and access to resources. The end result is wholesale territorial 
fragmentation and a series of separate reserves and enclaves, with the two groups largely 
segregated. The Tribunal heard evidence to the effect that such a policy is formally 
described in Israel as <i>hafrada</i>, Hebrew for &#8216;separation&#8217; &#8221;.82 The Special Rapporteur has 
previously drawn attention to the dual system of roads in the West Bank, as a clear example 
of segregation, where Palestinians are largely relegated to alternative roads and forced to 
take long detours (A/HRC/16/72, paras. 20&#8211;22). 
71. It seems incontestable that Israeli measures do divide the population of the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory along racial lines, create separate reserves for Palestinians and 
expropriate their land. 
</p>
<p>72. Article 2(e) refers to exploitation of labour. There exist historical reports83 as well as 
current campaigns and reports84 which address poor working conditions of Palestinian 
citizens working in Israel or in settlements. However, it is noted that there has been a sharp 
drop in Israeli use of Palestinian workers since the 1990s, especially as it is now impossible 
for Gazans to work in Israel and since in the West Bank the construction of the wall has 
further diminished the number of Palestinians working in Israel or for Israeli employers.85 
</p>
<p>73. Article 2(f) concerns persecution of those who oppose apartheid. This provision 
potentially relates to a wide range of human rights violations against Palestinians in the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, who as a people desire self-determination and oppose the 
segregation, restrictions and discriminatory regime imposed by Israel on them. In this 
sense, the punitive response often meted out to those who demonstrate against the wall and 
its associated regime, or more generally oppose Israeli violations of human rights, arguably 
fall under this provision.  
</p>
<p>74. An individual case in point concerns the Palestinian human rights defender Issa 
Amro, who is a founder of the NGOs Youth Against Settlements and Hebron Defenders. In 
2012, Mr. Amro was arrested and detained 20 times without charge.86 At the time of 
writing, he had been detained multiple times in 2013 and had been hospitalized, allegedly 
following a beating by ISF while in detention. In August 2013, a number of special 
rapporteurs, including this Special Rapporteur, expressed deep concern at the alleged 
ongoing judicial harassment, intimidation and abusive treatment of him. According to the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders: &#8220;This is an unacceptable 
campaign of harassment, intimidation and reprisals against Mr. Amro, and other human

<p>rights defenders who peacefully advocate for the rights of Palestinians in the West Bank, 
including by cooperating with [United Nations] human rights bodies.&#8221;87 
</p><p>75. An example of an Israeli citizen, belonging to the Druze minority, who has 
reportedly been imprisoned for his conscientious objection to serving in the Israeli army is 
Omar Saad. In an open letter to the Prime Minister and Minister of Defense he explained: &#8220;I 
couldn&#8217;t imagine myself wearing military uniform and participating in the suppression of 
my Palestinian people&#8221;. He asked: &#8220;How can I be a soldier standing at Qalandia checkpoint 
or any other checkpoint, after I experienced the injustices at these checkpoints? How can I 
prevent someone from Ramallah to visit his city, Jerusalem? How can I guard the apartheid 
wall? How can I be a jailer to my own people while I know that the majority of prisoners 
are freedom prisoners and seekers of rights and freedom?&#8221;88 
</p>
<p>76. It is strongly arguable that those who oppose Israeli measures amounting to 
apartheid risk persecution because of their opposition. 
</p>
<p><b>  Systematic oppression 
</b></p>
<p>77. None of the human rights violations discussed in the context of possibly constituting 
&#8220;inhuman acts&#8221; for the purpose of the International Convention on the Suppression and 
Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid or the Rome Statute can be said to be isolated 
events. Rather, their commission reflects systematic and discriminatory Israeli policies, 
laws and practices, which determine where in the occupied land Palestinians may or may 
not travel, live and work. Laws and policies have also institutionalized just how lightly a 
civilian Palestinian life may be weighed, when placed on the scales against claims of 
overarching security concerns, contrasting with the legal protection of the Israeli 
constitutional system given to unlawful Israeli settlers. The combined effect of the 
measures designed to ensure security for Israeli citizens, to facilitate and expand 
settlements, and, it would appear, to annex land, is <i>hafrada</i>, discrimination and systematic 
oppression of, and domination over, the Palestinian people.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Concluding remarks 
</b>78. Through prolonged occupation, with practices and policies which appear to 
constitute apartheid and segregation, ongoing expansion of settlements, and continual 
construction of the wall arguably amounting to de facto annexation of parts of the occupied 
Palestinian territory, the denial by Israel of the right to self-determination of the Palestinian 
people is evident. The Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally 
Wrongful Acts provide guidance as to the consequences of serious breaches of peremptory 
norms under international law. In this respect there is authority89 to suggest that the 
following prohibitions have attained the status of peremptory norms: aggression through 
military occupation and imposition of military blockades on ports and coasts,90 racial 
discrimination and apartheid, and torture. In addition, the right to self-determination itself 
has been recognized as a peremptory norm which applies <i>erga omnes</i>.91 
</p>
<p>79. Under article 40, paragraph 2, of the Draft Articles, for breaches of peremptory 
norms to be &#8220;serious&#8221; they must &#8220;involve a gross or systematic failure of the responsible

<p>State to fulfil the obligation&#8221;. Without prejudice to an authoritative determination of 
whether the breaches of the discussed peremptory norms qualify as &#8220;serious&#8221;, it is noted 
that the violations discussed in the context of the prolonged occupation appear deliberate, 
organized, institutionalized and longstanding. In the commentary, the International Law 
Commission considers it likely that competent international organizations, including the 
Security Council and the General Assembly will address such serious breaches. The 
implications for Member States for serious breaches of this nature include an obligation to 
cooperate to bring an end to breaches, and an obligation not to recognize or maintain the 
illegal situation.92 
</p>
<p>80. Finally, from the point of view of international criminal law, with the General 
Assembly&#8217;s recognition of Palestinian statehood, the opportunity for Palestine to accept the 
jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court is now clear. While a declaration was 
lodged by the Palestinian Minister of Justice in 2009 purporting to accept its jurisdiction 
&#8220;for acts committed on the territory of Palestine since 1 July 2002&#8221;,93 it seems the Court&#8217;s 
decision of 3 April 2012 on the question of jurisdiction94 had the effect of closing the 
preliminary examination.95 An acceptance of jurisdiction would potentially bring a measure 
of accountability for key individuals, and address violations related to the crime of 
apartheid and other issues flowing from the more than 400 communications on crimes 
allegedly committed in Palestine, received by the Office of the Prosecutor of the 
International Criminal Court since 2009.96

<p><b> VII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>In this, his final report, the Special Rapporteur takes the opportunity to 
reiterate some past recommendations and add several new ones, namely that:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Palestinian legal rights, including the right of self-determination, be fully 
respected and implemented in attempts to reach a peaceful and just resolution of the 
conflict between these two peoples; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The General Assembly request the International Court of Justice to issue 
an advisory opinion on the legal status of the prolonged occupation of Palestine, as 
aggravated by prohibited transfers of large numbers of persons from the occupying 
Power and the imposition of a dual and discriminatory administrative and legal 
system in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and further assess allegations that 
the prolonged occupation possesses legally unacceptable characteristics of 
&#8220;colonialism&#8221;, &#8220;apartheid&#8221; and &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221;; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The Human Rights Council appoint an expert group to propose a special 
protocol to the Fourth Geneva Convention with the specific purpose of proposing a 
legal regime for any occupation that lasts for more than five years;

<p><b>(d) The international community comprehensively investigate the business 
activities of companies and financial institutions registered in their own respective 
countries, which profit from the settlements of Israel and other unlawful Israeli 
activities, and take appropriate action to end such practices and ensure appropriate 
reparation for affected Palestinians. Member States should consider imposing a ban 
on imports of settlement produce;

<p><b>(e) Future investigations consider whether other foreign corporate 
connections with unlawful occupation policies additional to settlements (e.g. 
separation wall, Gaza blockade, house demolitions, excessive use of force) should not 
be also deemed &#8220;problematic&#8221; under international law, and treated in a manner 
analogous to the recommendations pertaining to settlements;

<p><b>(f) The Government of Israel cease expanding and creating settlements in 
occupied Palestine, start dismantling existing settlements and returning its citizens to 
the Israeli side of the Green Line, provide appropriate reparations for the damage due 
to settlement and related activity since 1967, and act diligently to protect Palestinians 
living under Israeli occupation from settler violence;

Israel to cooperate with the normal functioning of the United Nations by way of the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories 
occupied since 1967,</b>97<b> and to the protection of Special Rapporteurs from defamatory
