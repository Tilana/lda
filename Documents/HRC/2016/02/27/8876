<p><b>  Note by the Secretary-General 
</b></p>

<p><b>2</b> GE.09-17429 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Submission of the report 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present note was prepared in accordance with the arrangements approved by the 
Human Rights Council in its decision 2/102. It presents updated information on the 
activities of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, and in particular on 
the recommendations adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Fund at its thirty-first 
session, held in Geneva from 19 to 23 October 2009. The United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights approved the recommendations on behalf of the 
Secretary-General. The present note will be complemented by the report of the Secretary-
General on the activities of the Fund, to be submitted to the General Assembly at its sixty-
fifth session, detailing the outcomes of the thirty-first and thirty-second sessions of the 
Board of Trustees. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Mandate of the Fund 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Fund receives voluntary contributions from Governments, non-governmental 
organizations and individuals. In accordance with the practice established by its Board of 
Trustees in 1982, the Fund provides grants to non-governmental organizations that submit 
projects involving medical, psychological, social, financial, legal and humanitarian or other 
forms of assistance to torture victims and their relatives. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Board of Trustees 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Secretary-General administers the Fund through the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) with the advice of the Board of 
Trustees, composed of five members acting in a personal capacity and appointed by the 
Secretary-General with due regard to equitable geographical distribution and in 
consultation with their Governments. In October 2008, the Secretary-General reappointed 
Krassimir Kanev (Bulgaria), Savitri Goonesekere (Sri Lanka), Joseph Oloka-Onyango 
(Uganda) and Derrick Pounder (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) for 
a final period of three years, and appointed Mercedes Doretti (Argentina) for a three-year 
term, renewable once.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Admissibility criteria 
</b></p>
<p>4. Project admissibility criteria are outlined in the guidelines of the Fund. They require 
a project to be presented by a non-governmental organization. The beneficiaries must be 
direct victims of torture and/or direct family members. Priority is given to projects 
providing direct assistance to torture victims, which could consist in medical or 
psychological assistance, help with social or financial reintegration through vocational 
training for victims, legal assistance for victims or members of their families seeking 
redress or for processing asylum-seekers&#8217; claims. Depending on the funds available, the 
Fund may finance projects to organize training programmes, seminars or conferences to 
allow health-care professionals or other service providers to exchange best practices. Grant 
requests for projects involving investigation, research, studies, publications or similar 
activities are not, however, admissible. The Fund may also provide emergency assistance to 
individuals in countries where no project is receiving support. This type of request is 
examined according to a specific procedure outlined in the guidelines.  </p>

<p>5. The table below shows the contributions received from 1 January to 24 November

</p>
<p><b>Total pledges 8 347 887.24
</b></p>
<p>6. The amount available for distribution to projects was calculated after deducting 
programme support costs, operating cash reserve and expenditure for non-grant activities 
from the total amount of funds made available in the form of contributions received 
between the twenty-ninth session of the Board of Trustees, held in October 2008, and the 
thirty-first session of the Board, held in October 2009, and the operating cash reserve of the 
previous cycle.  
</p>
<p>7. In accordance with United Nations financial regulations, programme support costs 
will be charged to the Trust Fund at the rate of 13 per cent of total annual expenditure. In 
addition, the United Nations requires that an operating cash reserve of 15 per cent of annual 
estimated expenditure be maintained to cover exchange rate fluctuation, any shortfalls and 
to meet final expenditure, including any liquidating liabilities. The operating cash reserve 
will be left unallotted and carried forward from year to year, until required. Expenditure for 
non-grant activities include travel expenditure for Board members, expenditure for 
monitoring and evaluation of projects by United Nations staff and technical assistance for 
the further development of the grant management system.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations adopted by the Board  
</b></p>
<p>8. At its thirty-first session, the Board reviewed information prepared by its secretariat 
concerning 240 projects, including the analysis of narrative, financial and audit reports on 
the use of grants paid in previous years. It considered requests for new grants amounting to 
$18,370,674 for more than 170 ongoing and 30 new projects, as well as for 15 training 
sessions and seminars to be implemented in 2010. 
</p>
<p>9. The Board of Trustees made recommendations for grants for the period from 
January to December 2010 for over 200 projects in more than 70 countries, for a total 
amount of $11,809,050, after deduction of the programme support cost and the operating 
cash reserve. The High Commissioner approved the recommendations on 3 November 2009 
on behalf of the Secretary-General. 
</p>
<p>10. The Board recommended that $9,864,350 be paid in January 2010 and $1,944,700 
be disbursed after its thirty-second session in February 2010, upon receipt of satisfactory 
information by applicants. In addition, the Board decided to set aside $250,000 for 
emergency and intersessional requests for 2010, in particular for projects located in priority 
regions (Africa, Central Asia and Asia) identified by OHCHR field presences. 
</p><p>11. In accordance with recommendation 3 of the Office of Internal Oversight Services in 
its report on the evaluation of the Fund (E/CN.4/2005/55, para. 76), the Board continued its 
practice of financing training and seminars, thus allowing health professionals, social 
workers, lawyers and other service providers to exchange experiences and develop new 
strategies to address the needs of torture victims. The Board recommended an allocation of 
$276,100 to 15 organizations for training sessions to be organized in 13 countries in 2010. 
12. Further information on the activities of the Fund, including detailed information on, 
inter alia, the distribution of grants by region, policy decisions, meetings of the Board with 
Member States and relevant actors in the field of assistance to victims of torture, will be 
available after the thirty-second session of the Board, to be held from 1 to 3 February 2010.  </p>


<p>GE.09-17429 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Financial situation of the Fund and estimated needs for 2011 
</b>13. Since 2006, the Board has progressively increased the amount awarded in grants to 
projects worldwide. This has been possible because the income used during the period 
2006&#8211;2010 has included both the yearly voluntary contributions and unallocated amounts 
carried over from previous years. These amounts resulted from more efficient management 
of the Fund, including the change in cycle, closer monitoring of grantees and stricter 
reporting requirements. The Board decided to use the carry-overs to increase the level of 
funding to projects, particularly in priority regions. 
14. At its thirty-first session, the Board carefully examined the financial situation of the 
Fund of recent years. For 2011, Board expects that, in order for it to continue to meet 
requests from grantees at current levels, it will be faced with a shortfall of some $3 million. 
Should contributions for 2011 remain at their current level, the Board may need, as a last 
resort, to implement a reduction of 20 per cent in grants to be awarded as of 2011. 
</p>
<p>15. On the basis of the requests received for 2010, it is expected that approximately $19 
million will be requested by organizations for 2011.  
</p>
