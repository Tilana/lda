<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration of Complementary Standards submits 
</p>
<p>the present report pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 3/103 and resolutions 6/21 
</p>
<p>and 10/30. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the session  
</b></p>
<p>2. The Ad Hoc Committee held its sixth session from 7 to 17 October 2014. During the 
</p>
<p>session, the Committee held 15 meetings. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Attendance 
</b></p>
<p>3. The session was attended by representatives of Member States, non-Member States 
</p>
<p>represented by observers, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations (NGOs) in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>4. The 1st meeting of the sixth session of the Ad Hoc Committee was opened by the 
</p>
<p>Chief of the Anti-Discrimination Section, Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights (OHCHR). The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>made an opening statement in which he recalled that the Committee&#8217;s work was to think of 
</p>
<p>ways to strengthen the protection of all persons from the scourges of racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, as articulated in the Durban Declaration 
</p>
<p>and Programme of Action, which continued to guide the work of the Office. The task of the 
</p>
<p>Committee was to indicate how the international community could ensure greater decency 
</p>
<p>&#8212; greater dignity, equality and fairness &#8212; for the millions of victims of those violations. 
</p>
<p>He expressed confidence that the Committee would achieve more progress during the 
</p>
<p>session, fulfil its mandate and move forward, providing guidance on ways to address 
</p>
<p>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance more effectively.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Election of the Chairperson-Rapporteur  
</b></p>
<p>5. At the 1st meeting, the Ad Hoc Committee elected Abdul Samad Minty, Permanent 
</p>
<p>Representative of South Africa to the United Nations Office at Geneva, as its Chairperson-
</p>
<p>Rapporteur, by acclamation. 
</p>
<p>6. The Chairperson-Rapporteur thanked the High Commissioner for his participation 
</p>
<p>and his opening statement, and thanked the Committee for his own re-election, noting that 
</p>
<p>he would work collectively with all partners and members of the Committee. In 
</p>
<p>paragraph 199 of the Durban Programme of Action, the World Conference had 
</p>
<p>recommended that the Commission on Human Rights prepare complementary international 
</p>
<p>standards to strengthen and update international instruments against racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in all their aspects. The Committee&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>discussions would be continued with the incremental approach adopted in previous 
</p>
<p>sessions, offering members the opportunity to further reflect on and understand issues to be 
</p>
<p>discussed, as well as their link to the mandate of the Committee and paragraph 199 of the 
</p>
<p>Programme of Action. The format of the outcome of the session would be determined by </p>


<p>the discussions that would take place during the session. On the basis of the consensus that 
</p>
<p>had been achieved during the previous two sessions, the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>encouraged the Committee to continue to focus on the plight of victims and to ensure 
</p>
<p>unconditional respect for human dignity. In that regard, he considered it useful to explore 
</p>
<p>possibilities for an international regulatory framework for xenophobia given that its more 
</p>
<p>aggressive manifestations needed stronger measures. He noted in particular the blatant acts 
</p>
<p>of racism and xenophobia in and around soccer fields that continued to be witnessed in 
</p>
<p>many countries because adequate action had not been taken to counteract them.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Adoption of the agenda 
</b></p>
<p>7. At the 1st meeting, the Ad Hoc Committee adopted the agenda for the sixth session. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Chairperson-Rapporteur introduced the draft programme of work. The 
</p>
<p>programme of work (see annex III) was adopted at the 1st meeting.  
</p>
<p>9. The Chairperson-Rapporteur invited general statements about the session from 
</p>
<p>delegations and participants. Many delegations warmly welcomed the opening statement 
</p>
<p>and participation of the High Commissioner. 
</p>
<p>10. The representative of Ethiopia, speaking on behalf of the African Group, renewed 
</p>
<p>the commitment of the Group to the work of the Committee and recalled Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council decision 3/103, in which the Council had mandated the Committee to elaborate, as 
</p>
<p>a matter of priority and necessity, complementary standards in the form of either a 
</p>
<p>convention or additional protocol(s) to the International Convention on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>All Forms of Racial Discrimination (hereinafter the Convention), filling the existing gaps in 
</p>
<p>the Convention and also providing new normative standards aimed at combating all forms 
</p>
<p>of contemporary racism, including incitement to racial and religious hatred. The Group 
</p>
<p>remained concerned that limited progress had been made in elaborating a complementary 
</p>
<p>standard to the Convention due to unwarranted discussions on the very need for 
</p>
<p>complementary standards. The representative stressed the need to address victims of 
</p>
<p>profiling in areas elaborated in the list of topics of the second session, as those victims 
</p>
<p>required of the Committee better protection, maximum remedies and total elimination of 
</p>
<p>impunity for those acts of racism. The African Group called upon all regional groups to 
</p>
<p>further their political commitment to concluding complementary standards and enhancing 
</p>
<p>the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</p>
<p>11. The Ambassador of Brazil offered the support of the Permanent Mission of Brazil to 
</p>
<p>the United Nations in Geneva for the work of the Ad Hoc Committee. Highlighting the 
</p>
<p>multicultural and multiracial society of Brazil, the Ambassador underlined the importance 
</p>
<p>of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action to Brazil and that instrument&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>important contribution to the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
</p>
<p>related intolerance. Referring to measures to counter racism, he noted that affirmative 
</p>
<p>action measures were at the core of the domestic politics of Brazil.  
</p>
<p>12. The Ambassador of Pakistan, on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation 
</p>
<p>(OIC), pointed to the increasing discrimination against Muslims and to a general trend of 
</p>
<p>islamophobia around the world, which were impediments to peaceful cohesion. He 
</p>
<p>underscored the importance of paragraph 199 of the Durban Programme of Action and of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council resolution 16/18, as instructive for combating racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. He underlined the need to criminalize 
</p>
<p>incitement to racial, national and religious hatred, and stated that the Rabat Plan of Action </p>


<p>on the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
</p>
<p>incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence was seen as a useful basis for further 
</p>
<p>discussions.  
</p>
<p>13. The Ambassador of Algeria stated that Algeria supported the statements made by the 
</p>
<p>representative of Ethiopia and the Ambassador of Pakistan, who had spoken on behalf of 
</p>
<p>the African Group and of OIC, respectively. He noted an increase in xenophobia and racist 
</p>
<p>acts, and their impact on migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. The phenomenon of 
</p>
<p>xenophobia was spreading worldwide, and the number of victims was also increasing; he 
</p>
<p>emphasized that victims were affected in a &#8220;moral&#8221; as well as in a &#8220;physical&#8221; sense. Algeria 
</p>
<p>supported the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee and urged a victim-centred approach to its 
</p>
<p>work. It would be important to look at the specificity of existing instruments. 
</p>
<p>14. The representative of Morocco stated that Morocco supported the statements made 
</p>
<p>on behalf of the African Group and on behalf of OIC. Morocco attached particular 
</p>
<p>importance to the work of the Committee. He noted an upsurge in racist and xenophobic 
</p>
<p>thinking and actions worldwide and cautioned against a one-directional approach to the Ad 
</p>
<p>Hoc Committee&#8217;s work. He noted a substantial threat to the framework already in place and 
</p>
<p>said that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, along with the Vienna 
</p>
<p>Declaration and Programme of Action, served as important sources of information. The 
</p>
<p>delegate referred to a need to bring equilibrium to the international community, and 
</p>
<p>thanked delegations that had contributed positively to the work of the Committee. The 
</p>
<p>Rabat Plan of Action provided a solid approach to issues being addressed by the 
</p>
<p>Committee. 
</p>
<p>15. The representative of the European Union stated that racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance ran counter to the principles that underlay the European 
</p>
<p>Union and that were common values of all European Union member States, namely, respect 
</p>
<p>for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human 
</p>
<p>rights. She quoted the declaration made by the High Representative of the Union for 
</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on behalf of the European Union on the International 
</p>
<p>Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination: &#8220;We must act more resolutely to tackle 
</p>
<p>all forms of intolerance, racism, xenophobia and other types of discrimination. In times of 
</p>
<p>economic crisis, the dangers of rising racism and xenophobia, fuelled in part by increasing 
</p>
<p>unemployment, and insecurity about the future, are very real. It is in these challenging 
</p>
<p>times that our commitment to combating racism must be relentless.&#8221; Priority should be 
</p>
<p>given to the effective implementation of existing international human rights law, in 
</p>
<p>particular the Convention.  
</p>
<p>16. The representative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela offered his country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>support for the work of the Ad Hoc Committee and expressed regret that some countries 
</p>
<p>still did not support the Committee. He urged the endorsement and implementation of what 
</p>
<p>had been agreed by consensus in paragraph 199 of the Durban Programme of Action, in 
</p>
<p>order to address racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</p>
<p>worldwide. 
</p>
<p>17. The representative of Switzerland, on behalf also of Argentina, Armenia, Brazil, 
</p>
<p>Chile, Colombia, Japan, Mexico and Uruguay, expressed appreciation for the intersessional 
</p>
<p>preparations and support for the programme of work and the use of expert presentations 
</p>
<p>during the session. He emphasized the importance of the Convention and the Durban 
</p>
<p>Declaration and Programme of Action to the work of the session, and said that the 
</p>
<p>delegations on whose behalf he spoke would engage constructively in determining whether 
</p>
<p>there were gaps in the normative framework and how they would be addressed at the 
</p>
<p>session. </p>


<p>18. The representative of South Africa aligned her delegation with the general statement 
</p>
<p>delivered by the representative of Ethiopia, on behalf of the African Group. She welcomed 
</p>
<p>the incremental approach to dealing with the topics, as guided by the Chairperson-
</p>
<p>Rapporteur. South Africa remained concerned that paragraph 199 of the Durban 
</p>
<p>Programme of Action had become contested, and was also concerned about the lack of 
</p>
<p>progress in elaborating complementary standards to the Convention; she reminded the 
</p>
<p>Committee of its mandate, quoting decision 3/103. In the view of South Africa, the task of 
</p>
<p>the Committee was to address gaps and she therefore urged delegations to transcend their 
</p>
<p>entrenched positions and move in the direction of providing adequate protection and 
</p>
<p>remedies to victims of racism and putting an end to impunity for acts of racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. She expressed the delegation&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>commitment to working constructively to expedite elaboration of the urgently needed 
</p>
<p>complementary standards to the Convention. 
</p>
<p>19. The representative of Indonesia stressed that the phenomena of racism, xenophobia 
</p>
<p>and related intolerance still existed and, in some cases, had intensified and took various 
</p>
<p>forms. The important work of the Committee was to achieve a concrete result in respect of 
</p>
<p>what was meant by complementary standards to the Convention. Hate speech with religious 
</p>
<p>and ethnic dimensions was in need of attention. The issue touched on freedom of religion 
</p>
<p>vis-&#224;-vis freedom of expression and opinion. Indonesia valued highly freedom of religion 
</p>
<p>and freedom of expression and believed that those freedoms could go hand in hand within 
</p>
<p>the framework of international human rights law at the national level. Indonesia also 
</p>
<p>realized that those phenomena had a transboundary character, partly due to the rapid 
</p>
<p>development of information and communication technology. Indonesia was of the view that 
</p>
<p>there might be a need for an international instrument to prevent effectively incitement to 
</p>
<p>hostility and violence based on religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>20. The representative of the United States of America stated that racism was 
</p>
<p>incompatible with his country&#8217;s values. He underlined the importance of the Committee&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>work, observing that the mandate included promoting consensus action plans and that it 
</p>
<p>should not work on elaborating confusing new international law instruments. Xenophobia 
</p>
<p>was a serious problem; however, addressing it did not require new or revised treaties, but 
</p>
<p>rather the implementation of existing human rights law. The delegation was of the view that 
</p>
<p>those conclusions had been echoed in the opinions of experts who had previously addressed 
</p>
<p>the Committee.  
</p>
<p>21. The representative of Nigeria aligned his country with the statement made on behalf 
</p>
<p>of the African Group. He highlighted issues of stigmatization and xenophobia and the 
</p>
<p>importance of strengthening international protection for the victims of such abuses and 
</p>
<p>emphasized that refugees, asylum seekers and migrants were particularly vulnerable, 
</p>
<p>underscoring the importance of the work of the Committee.  
</p>
<p><b> III. General and topical discussions 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Prevention and awareness-raising  
</b></p>
<p>22. At the 2nd meeting, the Ad Hoc Committee heard presentations from Patrick Gasser, 
</p>
<p>Senior Football and Social Responsibility Manager, Union of European Football 
</p>
<p>Associations (UEFA), Jonas Burgheim, Deputy Head, United Nations Office on Sport for 
</p>
<p>Development and Peace, and Pavel Klymenko, a representative of the Football against 
</p>
<p>Racism in Europe (FARE) Network, on the agenda topic of &#8220;Prevention and awareness-
</p>
<p>raising, including through human rights education and training, in the fight against racism, 
</p>
<p>racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance&#8221; as it related to sport.  </p>


<p>23. At the 3rd meeting, the Chairperson of the Working Group of Experts on People of 
</p>
<p>African Descent, Mireille Fanon-Mend&#232;s-France, gave a presentation on the same agenda 
</p>
<p>topic. At the 4th
 
meeting, Karel Fracapane, of the Section of Health and Global Citizenship 
</p>
<p>Education, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) 
</p>
<p>briefed the Committee on the Organization&#8217;s work on that agenda topic.  
</p>
<p>24. For summaries of those presentations and the discussions with the meeting 
</p>
<p>participants that followed, see annex I, section A. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Questionnaire conducted pursuant to paragraph 4 of  
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council resolution 21/30 
</b></p>
<p>25. At the 5th
 
meeting, the Chairperson-Rapporteur provided an overview of the updated 
</p>
<p>summary of the responses received to the recirculated questionnaire conducted pursuant to 
</p>
<p>paragraph 4 of Human Rights Council resolution 21/30. In a note verbale of 21 July 2014, 
</p>
<p>he had invited Permanent Missions in Geneva and New York that had not forwarded 
</p>
<p>responses to the questionnaire, and had indicated that additional information from States 
</p>
<p>that had previously responded to the questionnaire would be welcome.  
</p>
<p>26. An additional 13 replies had been received by the deadline of 19 September 2014. 
</p>
<p>The Chairperson-Rapporteur suggested that the questionnaire and the summary of the 
</p>
<p>replies be considered in a collective manner that could help the Ad Hoc Committee 
</p>
<p>improve the information in the updated summary of responses, and look at weaknesses and 
</p>
<p>make suggestions to address them. Both approaches to the work of the Committee &#8212; 
</p>
<p>through an additional convention or without one &#8212; were important as long as improved 
</p>
<p>conditions for victims were the result.  
</p>
<p>27. The Chairperson-Rapporteur introduced the document that summarized the 
</p>
<p>responses to the questionnaire and invited participants to reflect on how to proceed with the 
</p>
<p>outcome and how to take the issue of the questionnaire forward. The responses were still 
</p>
<p>not representative; they were anecdotal, but were nevertheless useful for the various aspects 
</p>
<p>of the discussion. The original replies received to the questionnaire were available on the 
</p>
<p>OHCHR website.  
</p>
<p>28. The Chairperson-Rapporteur posed various questions, referring to the role of 
</p>
<p>institutions and legislation, constitutional provisions, remedies for victims and positive 
</p>
<p>measures. He pointed out that most of the new replies provided interesting information on 
</p>
<p>the issue of xenophobia, which appeared to be a concern affecting many countries around 
</p>
<p>the world. In that regard he inquired about initiatives undertaken at the national level, and 
</p>
<p>asked whether it was possible that some countries or regions did not face issues related to 
</p>
<p>xenophobia. He inquired about the difference between hate crimes and xenophobic crimes, 
</p>
<p>and asked whether xenophobia was a sentiment or a motivation for an act. He invited 
</p>
<p>participants to consider xenophobia as a spectrum. The Chairperson-Rapporteur also asked 
</p>
<p>whether combating extremism was the same as combating discrimination and xenophobia, 
</p>
<p>inquired about the effectiveness of national mechanisms, and asked whether the definition 
</p>
<p>of &#8220;national mechanism&#8221; should be understood narrowly or construed broadly and whether 
</p>
<p>the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination was effective, especially with 
</p>
<p>respect to xenophobia. He also asked which recommendations of that Committee had been 
</p>
<p>implemented by States and whether reservations were proving to be a significant obstacle 
</p>
<p>for the implementation of the Convention.  
</p>
<p>29. The representative of the European Union made preliminary comments, expressing 
</p>
<p>disappointment that the rate of response to the questionnaire remained low. She emphasized 
</p>
<p>that some regions continued to be underrepresented in those responses, and that the 
</p>
<p>European Union would like to hear from them. Pointing to the importance of the </p>


<p>Convention, she reiterated that States that had not yet ratified or acceded to the Convention 
</p>
<p>should do so. The long-standing position of the European Union was that full 
</p>
<p>implementation of the existing standards was key; only one of the new replies mentioned 
</p>
<p>the need for complementary standards.  
</p>
<p>30. The representative of Brazil stated that, according to the responses received, both 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and national mechanisms were concerns for countries. However, there was no 
</p>
<p>consensus yet on the question of gaps. Further discussion was needed on both topics, and 
</p>
<p>the views of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination on those issues 
</p>
<p>were essential. Alternatively, the Ad Hoc Committee could reflect on the possibility of 
</p>
<p>favouring the development of, inter alia, plans of action and guidelines on those issues. 
</p>
<p>With regard to procedural gaps, the responses to the questionnaire indicated that the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination still lacked an official mandate to 
</p>
<p>engage in actions such as visits to countries and follow-up to its recommendations, which 
</p>
<p>were important for the fulfilment of its functions. Treaty bodies created subsequently had 
</p>
<p>provisions on those issues. Therefore, additional norms could be needed in that area. 
</p>
<p>31. The representative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela highlighted the 
</p>
<p>importance of new complementary standards to combat racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance, and referred to the need to criminalize discrimination in 
</p>
<p>all its forms. Venezuelan society was multi-ethnic and the Government was committed to 
</p>
<p>implementing the 2011 law against racial discrimination, article 11 of which addressed 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and racist acts. The representative also highlighted the positive role of civil 
</p>
<p>society with regard to the prevention and eradication of racial discrimination, and reported 
</p>
<p>on the establishment of a national institution against racial discrimination as an effective 
</p>
<p>implementation of provisions of the Convention and the Durban Declaration and 
</p>
<p>Programme of Action. The Government was committed to collecting disaggregated data, 
</p>
<p>and the recent 2011 census would provide more detailed information on the population.  
</p>
<p>32. The representative of the Russian Federation also supported the need for the 
</p>
<p>development of additional standards, emphasizing that existing international standards were 
</p>
<p>proving ineffective. He encouraged delegations to consider drafting new complementary 
</p>
<p>standards and making improvements to the effectiveness of existing mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>33. The representative of Morocco informed the meeting that Morocco had adopted a 
</p>
<p>new migration policy, which called for a human rights-based approach. Migrants required 
</p>
<p>legal recognition and rights in areas such as access to housing and education. The new 
</p>
<p>policy was comprehensive and covered asylum seekers and refugees. He pointed out the 
</p>
<p>need to move away from a security-oriented approach that led to a fortress mentality, and 
</p>
<p>acknowledged problems with data collection, adding that currently the country was 
</p>
<p>conducting a census that would influence positively the development of public policies. He 
</p>
<p>highlighted the importance of vital statistics.  
</p>
<p>34. The Chairperson-Rapporteur asked whether constitutions and legislation were 
</p>
<p>sufficient to address racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and 
</p>
<p>asked how Governments could move from legal measures to the protection of victims on 
</p>
<p>the ground. He invited participants to share good practices and difficulties in that regard. 
</p>
<p>35. The representative of Morocco said that there were different approaches to 
</p>
<p>combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. On one side 
</p>
<p>there were provisions in the Constitution to combat discrimination. There was also the 
</p>
<p>operational side, taking into consideration concrete facts, since Morocco was a country of 
</p>
<p>origin, transit and destination for migrants. Those combined factors left Morocco with a 
</p>
<p>large number of irregular migrants. A new asylum and migration policy was needed. In that 
</p>
<p>regard, a report had been submitted to the Government, which had decided to adopt a new 
</p>
<p>policy. The representative noted that day-to-day issues at the practical level should be </p>


<p>addressed. Early warning efforts had highlighted the need for amended legal provisions. 
</p>
<p>New bills on migration and refugees had been adopted. The challenge was translating those 
</p>
<p>legal norms into practice. 
</p>
<p>36. The representative of Italy highlighted the strong principles contained in the Italian 
</p>
<p>Constitution, which applied European Union directives that created obligations. Institutions 
</p>
<p>such as the National Office against Racial Discrimination were entrusted with protecting 
</p>
<p>victims; access by victims to the Office&#8217;s website was easy and there was a 24-hour phone 
</p>
<p>line. He acknowledged that additional resources were needed. Referring to question 2 (vi) 
</p>
<p>of the questionnaire on article 14 of the Convention, he said that there was no information 
</p>
<p>concerning how many States had accepted article 14. He highlighted the large number of 
</p>
<p>reports overdue for submission to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination as a serious issue, stating that many countries had never submitted a report, 
</p>
<p>or were very overdue in doing so.  
</p>
<p>37. The Chairperson-Rapporteur confirmed that the large number of reports overdue to 
</p>
<p>all treaty bodies was a general problem, which had been acknowledged during the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review process. Some countries did not have the resources to submit reports.  
</p>
<p>38. The representative of Egypt indicated that Egypt was a &#8220;compatible and consistent 
</p>
<p>society&#8221; in terms of race and religion, and that there were no problems with minorities in 
</p>
<p>terms of racial discrimination in its latest Constitution. All citizens were equal, and 
</p>
<p>everyone was equal before the law. There was no xenophobia nationally and citizens 
</p>
<p>considered themselves Egyptians, although they might have another origin. The National 
</p>
<p>Council for Human Rights was an independent body that dealt with all issues of human 
</p>
<p>rights and received complaints from victims. It had the required resources. The National 
</p>
<p>Council referred complaints to judicial authorities and to the courts, and facilitated access 
</p>
<p>to the judicial process.  
</p>
<p>39. The representative of Uruguay said that Uruguay had ratified the Convention. In 
</p>
<p>addition to the Constitution, there were a series of specific laws on issues related to 
</p>
<p>discrimination, for example, on migrants, including the rights of migrants, family 
</p>
<p>reunification and non-discrimination on any grounds. A rapid response programme had 
</p>
<p>been set up by the migration authorities, allowing them to issue identity documents within 
</p>
<p>48 hours. In 2004, a law on racial discrimination had been adopted and a commission on 
</p>
<p>racism and discrimination had been created to implement the law. There were also policies 
</p>
<p>to prevent discrimination. The commission had introduced a draft bill to the parliament on a 
</p>
<p>quota for people of African descent, which had been adopted. During the universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review of Uruguay the Government had committed itself to drafting a plan of action against 
</p>
<p>racial discrimination; it was in the second phase, focusing on the drafting of the plan. 
</p>
<p>40. The representative of South Africa highlighted the fact that the 1996 Constitution 
</p>
<p>recognized the injustices of the country&#8217;s past, focused on a nation united in its diversity, 
</p>
<p>and was aimed at creating racial harmony. Chapter 9 of the Constitution had established the 
</p>
<p>Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and 
</p>
<p>Linguistic Communities. In 2002, the country had hosted the African Union Summit to 
</p>
<p>strengthen the cohesion of African people. In 2012 it had hosted the Global African 
</p>
<p>Diaspora Summit, which had given concrete meaning to the concept of &#8220;one family&#8221;. South 
</p>
<p>Africa also played an important role in the New Partnership for Africa&#8217;s Development 
</p>
<p>(NEPAD).  
</p>
<p>41. The representative of Algeria stated that the country&#8217;s Constitution addressed racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, and that there were laws that gave effect to the principle of non-
</p>
<p>discrimination. Article 29 of the Constitution banned any discrimination; all codes, 
</p>
<p>including the criminal and electoral codes, prohibited discrimination. He emphasized the 
</p>
<p>importance of equality of persons, and said that particular attention was paid to issues </p>


<p>concerning migrants and their families. Legislative and institutional measures were in place 
</p>
<p>to eliminate discrimination; access to civil justice was no longer conditional for foreigners; 
</p>
<p>and interpretation and legal assistance were also available to foreigners in the country.  
</p>
<p>42. The representative of Switzerland stated that xenophobia was not a legal term under 
</p>
<p>its national law and that the public service must respect fundamental rights. Racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination was punishable in Switzerland. The law provided sufficient protection 
</p>
<p>against discrimination, but it was important to strengthen the application of current 
</p>
<p>legislation. He informed the meeting about three institutions: (a) the Federal Commission 
</p>
<p>against Racism, established in 1995, which had been monitoring activities in order to 
</p>
<p>identify racism and racial discrimination, working to promote better understanding, 
</p>
<p>emphasizing prevention and hearing concerns of minorities; (b) the Service for Combating 
</p>
<p>Racism, which had been promoting coordination and setting measures to combat racism 
</p>
<p>since 2001; and (c) the Federal Commission for Migration, which, since 2008, had been 
</p>
<p>bridging the gap between the authorities and civil society on migration issues.  
</p>
<p>43. The representative of Greece informed the Committee that, three weeks previously, 
</p>
<p>the Greek Parliament had adopted a new anti-racist law, which prohibited racist speech and 
</p>
<p>violence against individuals on the basis of race and other forms of discrimination and 
</p>
<p>included various measures and sanctions, such as imprisonment and fines. If such acts were 
</p>
<p>performed by a public servant, it was considered an aggravating factor, and the sanction 
</p>
<p>was doubled. The delegate also noted the importance of public awareness measures, 
</p>
<p>informing the meeting about some initiatives organized in Geneva by the Permanent 
</p>
<p>Mission of Greece, such as a side event to the Human Rights Council on equality and sport, 
</p>
<p>and an event organized with the Permanent Mission of South Africa featuring the lawyer of 
</p>
<p>the late President Nelson Mandela, George Bizos.  
</p>
<p>44. The Chairperson-Rapporteur pointed out the role of the judiciary in interpreting law. 
</p>
<p>He said that it would be interesting to look at case law and how the judiciary took its own 
</p>
<p>responsibility and created a precedent for other cases. He also said that national 
</p>
<p>mechanisms were mandated by legal provisions; however, it was important to examine their 
</p>
<p>effectiveness and how the population was represented in such institutions. In addition, he 
</p>
<p>referred to procedural gaps with regard to the Convention, especially in relation to 
</p>
<p>xenophobia.  
</p>
<p>45. The representative of the Russian Federation emphasized that reservations to the 
</p>
<p>Convention had a negative impact on its implementation. For example, with regard to 
</p>
<p>article 4, in the era of modern technology an expansion of hate speech was taking place and 
</p>
<p>there was a need for the withdrawal of reservations to that article. The Russian Federation 
</p>
<p>did not have reservations.  
</p>
<p>46. The representative of Brazil said that the Ad Hoc Committee should discuss further 
</p>
<p>whether the Convention had substantive gaps. With regard to procedural gaps, during the 
</p>
<p>past two sessions, experts from the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
</p>
<p>had noted that they did not have a mandate for country visits and that it would be useful for 
</p>
<p>them to have such a mandate, set out in an additional document. That point had also been 
</p>
<p>made in the replies to the questionnaire. 
</p>
<p>47. The representative of the United States emphasized that the best way to respond to 
</p>
<p>hate speech was with more speech. He noted that the Convention clearly prohibited 
</p>
<p>discrimination and acts of violence and that there were no gaps in the Convention with 
</p>
<p>regard to xenophobia as a legal matter. There were clearly gaps in the effective 
</p>
<p>implementation of existing obligations and that was a productive area for continued 
</p>
<p>discussion, to which the United States looked forward.  
</p>
<p>48. The representative of South Africa recalled that reservations were permissible unless 
</p>
<p>they were incompatible with the treaty; that included reservations to article 4. She </p>


<p>highlighted the fact that, without additional standards, contemporary forms of racism and 
</p>
<p>racial discrimination would go unpunished, and noted the importance of the Committee on 
</p>
<p>the Elimination of Racial Discrimination&#8217;s general recommendation No. 15 (2004) on 
</p>
<p>discrimination against non-citizens.  
</p>
<p>49. The representative of the European Union said that European Union member States 
</p>
<p>were required, in accordance with directives, to establish equality bodies, which were 
</p>
<p>independent organizations that, inter alia, could conduct independent surveys, publish 
</p>
<p>independent reports and issue recommendations. Equinet was a European network of 
</p>
<p>equality bodies comprising 38 organizations. With regard to hate speech, full respect for 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression and the importance of the existing international framework were 
</p>
<p>underlined. The representative referred to the 2008 Council of the European Union 
</p>
<p>framework decision on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia 
</p>
<p>by means of criminal law, which included intentional public incitement to racist or 
</p>
<p>xenophobic hatred or violence as an offence and required amendments to criminal law.  
</p>
<p>50. The representative of Morocco pointed out the need to control hate speech on the 
</p>
<p>Internet; such control was a major concern for many States, but should not in any way 
</p>
<p>detract from State efforts to combat hate speech through traditional media. Morocco had 
</p>
<p>developed legal measures, including article 6 of the Constitution, which enshrined equality 
</p>
<p>before the law, and a criminal code and press code. Journalists inciting hatred against 
</p>
<p>foreigners were punished in Morocco. It was important to interact effectively with the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and submit regular reports.  
</p>
<p>51. The representative of the United States expressed his country&#8217;s strong disagreement 
</p>
<p>with regard to restrictions on freedom of expression. He emphasized the fact that such 
</p>
<p>restrictions were dangerous and that Governments should not control expression. 
</p>
<p>Undemocratic Governments misused such measures.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Special measures  
</b></p>
<p>52. At the 6th meeting, the Ad Hoc Committee commenced a discussion on the topic 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Special measures, including affirmative or positive measures, strategies or actions, to 
</p>
<p>prevent, combat and eradicate all forms and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance&#8221;. The meeting was chaired, exceptionally, by Ephrem 
</p>
<p>B. Hidug of the Permanent Mission of Ethiopia to the United Nations Office at Geneva. 
</p>
<p>During the meeting, Carlos V&#225;zquez, a member of the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination, gave a presentation on the treatment of special measures in the 
</p>
<p>International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and in 
</p>
<p>the practice of the Committee. 
</p>
<p>53. At the 7th
 
meeting, Theodore Shaw, Professor and Director of the Center for Civil 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Chapel Hill School of Law, University of North Carolina, also gave a 
</p>
<p>presentation on the topic of special measures. At the 8th meeting, Elisa Alonso Mon&#231;ores, a 
</p>
<p>researcher at the Institute of Economics, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, 
</p>
<p>gave a presentation on &#8220;Affirmative actions in Brazil: recent experience and social 
</p>
<p>indicators&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>54. At the 9th meeting, Dimitrina Petrova, Executive Director of the Equal Rights Trust, 
</p>
<p>gave a presentation on the agenda topic.  
</p>
<p>55. For summaries of the presentations and the respective discussions with participants 
</p>
<p>that followed, see annex I, section B. </p>


<p><b> D. National mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>56. At the 10th meeting, Pedro Mouratian, President, National Institute against 
</p>
<p>Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism (INADI) in Argentina, briefed the Ad Hoc 
</p>
<p>Committee on the work of his organization on the topic &#8220;Establishment, designation or 
</p>
<p>maintaining of national mechanisms with competences to protect against and prevent all 
</p>
<p>forms and manifestation of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</p>
<p>intolerance&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>57. For a summary of the presentation and the discussion with participants that 
</p>
<p>followed, see annex I, section C. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Xenophobia 
</b></p>
<p>58. The topic &#8220;Xenophobia&#8221; was discussed at the 11th meeting. A presentation was 
</p>
<p>made by Ioannis Dimitrakopoulos, Head of the Equality and Citizens&#8217; Rights Department, 
</p>
<p>European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.  
</p>
<p>59. For a summary of the presentation and the discussion with participants which 
</p>
<p>followed, see annex I, section D.  
</p>
<p><b> F. General discussion and exchange of views, 12th meeting  
</b></p>
<p>60. The Ad Hoc Committee held a general discussion and exchange of views at its 12th 
</p>
<p>meeting.  
</p>
<p>61. The representative of the European Union made some preliminary observations and 
</p>
<p>was of the view that the reissued questionnaire had produced an outcome that was, in terms 
</p>
<p>of substance, very similar to that of the first questionnaire. Some regions were well 
</p>
<p>represented, including European countries, while representative information from some 
</p>
<p>other regions was still lacking. The Ad Hoc Committee&#8217;s discussions confirmed that 
</p>
<p>challenges remained. Many positive steps and best practices from various parts of the world 
</p>
<p>were also highlighted. Situations varied and solutions addressing racism and related issues 
</p>
<p>took different forms, depending on the country, hence there was no one-size-fit-for-all 
</p>
<p>approach. Regarding the issue of complementary standards, the representative noted that, in 
</p>
<p>the view of the European Union, the sixth session had confirmed the assessment that more 
</p>
<p>needed to be done by States and stakeholders to implement and monitor the implementation 
</p>
<p>of existing standards more vigorously. The Convention remained the key international 
</p>
<p>instrument and the European Union regretted its lack of universal ratification. The 
</p>
<p>European Union saw no evidence that the lack of international legal standards would 
</p>
<p>prevent efforts to fight those phenomena.  
</p>
<p>62. The representative of the United States noted, in reference to the discussion during 
</p>
<p>the 11th meeting, that immigration reform was a priority of its Administration, which had 
</p>
<p>emphasized that there needed to be a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million illegal 
</p>
<p>immigrants in the United States. With regard to the large numbers of unaccompanied 
</p>
<p>children that had received much attention, the United States was working with 
</p>
<p>neighbouring concerned Governments to address root causes of emigration and to inform 
</p>
<p>about the risks of migration.  
</p>
<p>63. The representative of Brazil suggested that the Committee could start elaborating 
</p>
<p>documents, such as plans of action or guidelines, to fill the interpretative gap that 
</p>
<p>Ms. Petrova had mentioned in her presentation. The representative of Brazil said that </p>


<p>achieving a positive impact in victims&#8217; lives should have the utmost priority, and said she 
</p>
<p>looked forward to the discussion on procedural gaps.  
</p>
<p>64. The representative of the African Union underlined that it was the established 
</p>
<p>mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee to elaborate complementary standards. It was not the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of the Committee to consider whether those standards were necessary or 
</p>
<p>whether there were any gaps, as that had already been decided in the Durban Declaration 
</p>
<p>and Programme of Action and by the Human Rights Council. A variety of views had been 
</p>
<p>expressed over the course of the sixth and previous sessions and it was time to move 
</p>
<p>forward and draft a number of provisions. The Committee should not continue to discuss 
</p>
<p>endlessly, but should draw on existing conclusions and be true to its mandate. He pointed to 
</p>
<p>the issue of immigration mentioned by the representative of the United States and said that 
</p>
<p>achieving progress in that area would be important. He pointed to racism and sport as an 
</p>
<p>important area where the Committee could potentially make a contribution.  
</p>
<p>65. The representative of South Africa, on behalf of the African Group, reiterated that, 
</p>
<p>through decision 3/103, the Human Rights Council had established the Ad Hoc Committee 
</p>
<p>and provided the clear mandate to elaborate &#8220;as a matter of priority&#8221; conventions or 
</p>
<p>additional protocols to the Convention. That decision did not speak about considerations or 
</p>
<p>discussions concerning possible gaps or the need for standards. Neither did paragraph 199 
</p>
<p>of the Durban Programme of Action leave any room for such considerations. There was a 
</p>
<p>clear mandate to elaborate complementary standards. That focus was clear, without any 
</p>
<p>doubt. The African Group regarded the ongoing discussion, and the insistence on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Convention, as flawed, since additional standards had, in numerous 
</p>
<p>other examples, been elaborated by the international community. Victims of racial profiling 
</p>
<p>required better support; it was time for the total elimination of impunity for perpetrators of 
</p>
<p>racism. Only with political will could the complementary standards be completed; such will 
</p>
<p>must be found, as there was a need to move forward.  
</p>
<p>66. The representative of Algeria noted that there were gaps in the legal framework, in 
</p>
<p>particular concerning victims&#8217; rights. Consequently, work needed to be done in order to 
</p>
<p>implement a victim-centred approach to combating racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance. He called on all delegations to focus on the plight of 
</p>
<p>victims. The presentations during the past sessions had provided enough material, a number 
</p>
<p>of questionnaires had been circulated, discussions had taken place, also in the framework of 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council, and it could not be argued that there were insufficient 
</p>
<p>contributions upon which to move forward. Issues such as migration needed the 
</p>
<p>Committee&#8217;s attention and the representative referred to the recurrent issue of working 
</p>
<p>methods of the Committee and of other Committees of the Council. Mandates were being 
</p>
<p>challenged regularly. That was, however, not the role of the Ad Hoc Committee, since there 
</p>
<p>was a clear mandate, and it was time to make progress on the very mandate that was 
</p>
<p>negotiated in Durban.  
</p>
<p>67. The representative of Pakistan, on behalf of OIC, noted that important contributions 
</p>
<p>had been made by experts during the session, and stated that it was impossible to question 
</p>
<p>the mandate of the Committee. Throughout the presentations it was difficult to understand 
</p>
<p>why the Committee had discussed the necessity of complementary standards, as the 
</p>
<p>mandate already reflected an assumption that such necessity existed. OIC was of the 
</p>
<p>opinion that there was a need for complementary standards. During the twenty-fifth session 
</p>
<p>of the Human Rights Council, under agenda item 9, a representative of OIC had 
</p>
<p>recommended that there should be an optional protocol that dealt with all forms of racism, 
</p>
<p>racial discrimination, xenophobia and related forms of intolerance. Therefore, OIC 
</p>
<p>recommended that an additional protocol to the Convention be drafted which dealt with 
</p>
<p>racism in a comprehensive manner, and that the next session of the Ad Hoc Committee </p>


<p>should be dedicated to substantive gaps. In the view of OIC, it was time to look for a way 
</p>
<p>forward and to consider new forms of intolerance, including religious intolerance. 
</p>
<p>68. The representative of Switzerland said that, in his view, positions were split between 
</p>
<p>those who defended the mandate without a clear idea of what the gaps were, and those who 
</p>
<p>reiterated that implementation was key and that the Convention did not need further 
</p>
<p>protocols. Switzerland had tried to identify areas where gaps could be identified; however, 
</p>
<p>it had been unable to do so. Consequently, Switzerland did not question the mandate, but 
</p>
<p>had doubts whether it could be fulfilled. A redrafting of the Convention was not an option, 
</p>
<p>since the substantive case for required new laws had not been made. The subject of 
</p>
<p>xenophobia had already been clarified two years ago and the tools to address that 
</p>
<p>phenomenon and others were in place. There was never one recipe that worked in all 
</p>
<p>situations and it was not a good idea to impose a tight prefabricated system on all States. 
</p>
<p>The main principles that would guide the fight against racism existed. It was now 
</p>
<p>essentially a question of implementation.  
</p>
<p>69. The representative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reiterated his 
</p>
<p>delegation&#8217;s firm support for the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee. The Committee had 
</p>
<p>been working for six years and had examined international standards and non-compliance 
</p>
<p>with those standards. The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action provided the 
</p>
<p>mandate to close any gaps concerning new forms of discrimination, and the Committee 
</p>
<p>should focus its work on that area. He supported the statements made by the representative 
</p>
<p>of South Africa on behalf of the African Group, and by the representative of Pakistan on 
</p>
<p>behalf of OIC, and urged more substantive work from the Committee. He was of the view 
</p>
<p>that the various presentations showed that there were new forms of racism, and the content 
</p>
<p>of those presentations would allow the Committee to draft new complementary standards to 
</p>
<p>the Convention. The mechanism had to be improved to cover new forms of racism, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia, hate speech and incitement to hatred, including towards migrants.  
</p>
<p>70. The representative of Germany stressed that the Committee had to find a way 
</p>
<p>forward, and the ongoing exchange in the room was important. However, in the 
</p>
<p>representative&#8217;s view, one had to listen to the experts that were invited, who had all stressed 
</p>
<p>that there was no need for new standards to battle phenomena such as xenophobia. 
</p>
<p>Germany fully supported the European Union statement that there were no substantive gaps 
</p>
<p>in the Convention; however, countries had to improve their implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Convention. That was also the case in other human rights areas. It was not customary to 
</p>
<p>question automatically the underlying standards in those areas, but it was good practice to 
</p>
<p>focus on implementation. In that respect, the representative supported the representative of 
</p>
<p>Switzerland&#8217;s statement.  
</p>
<p>71. The representative of Egypt stated that the very fact that the Ad Hoc Committee 
</p>
<p>existed showed the need for an update of the legal framework. It was necessary to identify 
</p>
<p>existing gaps in legislation and assess how they could be filled. The representative 
</p>
<p>supported the proposal made by the representative of Pakistan, on behalf of OIC, 
</p>
<p>concerning the elaboration of an additional protocol, as it would be an essential step by the 
</p>
<p>Committee. 
</p>
<p>72. The representative of Indonesia noted that the question of implementation needed to 
</p>
<p>be addressed, as did the need for complementary standards. The idea of complementary 
</p>
<p>standards had been accepted when the Ad Hoc Committee had been established, and it 
</p>
<p>should not be contentious. On the substantive points, the representative supported the 
</p>
<p>statements made by the representative of Pakistan on behalf of OIC and by the 
</p>
<p>representative of Egypt. In Indonesia there was a real gap due to cross-border issues related 
</p>
<p>to incitement to hatred. Indonesia felt that perpetrators went unpunished but had a great 
</p>
<p>impact on the domestic situation in the country, which could lead to unrest. Consequently it </p>


<p>had become clear that there were substantive gaps when it came to transboundary 
</p>
<p>incitement to hatred based on religion. 
</p>
<p>73. The representative of Morocco said that there was a clear reason for the existence of 
</p>
<p>the Ad Hoc Committee, and that the relevant resolutions and decisions and the Durban 
</p>
<p>Declaration and Programme of Action provided a firm legal basis. The discussion of 
</p>
<p>whether the Committee should exist should not proceed. The Durban Declaration and 
</p>
<p>Programme of Action had been adopted in 2001 and now, after 13 years, racism was still 
</p>
<p>alive, as many presentations had underlined. The Committee was not only compelled to 
</p>
<p>restrict racism but to eradicate it, and it could not stand idle. The Committee had held six 
</p>
<p>sessions and it was clear that large tasks lay before it. It needed to strengthen international 
</p>
<p>legislation, and the consensus was not to rewrite, but to refine, the Durban Declaration and 
</p>
<p>Programme of Action. In the view of Morocco, inaction meant that the Committee was not 
</p>
<p>fulfilling its mandate and was committing an &#8220;offence&#8221;. The Committee&#8217;s work was 
</p>
<p>necessary and could take several forms; it was up to the Committee to decide which one 
</p>
<p>would prevail.  
</p>
<p>74. The representative of Tunisia expressed support for the statements made by the 
</p>
<p>representative of South Africa on behalf of the African Group and by the representative of 
</p>
<p>Pakistan on behalf of OIC. The current international framework was inadequate because 
</p>
<p>there were new forms of racism, and political movements that ran on platforms that profited 
</p>
<p>from hatred against foreigners could be observed. No act of racism could be left 
</p>
<p>unpunished, and the international community needed to complete the legal arsenal. Victims 
</p>
<p>were often unwilling to report incidents or file charges, as the Committee had heard in the 
</p>
<p>presentations. Since the adoption of the Convention, racism had changed, surfacing 
</p>
<p>regularly in combination with discrimination on economic and religious grounds. Ongoing 
</p>
<p>economic crises exacerbated racial discrimination. Many other factors, such as religion, 
</p>
<p>were not addressed by the Convention. As noted by the representative of South Africa, the 
</p>
<p>Committee was not in a position to reinvent the legal norms, but needed to address racism 
</p>
<p>as it appeared today. In addition, the communication revolution had added a new factor.  
</p>
<p>75. The representative of Pakistan clarified that OIC did not suggest that the drafting of 
</p>
<p>an optional protocol meant redrafting the Convention. However, a number of human rights 
</p>
<p>conventions had optional protocols. Consequently, he proposed that a substantive 
</p>
<p>discussion be held at the Ad Hoc Committee&#8217;s next session to consider actual substantive 
</p>
<p>gaps to be filled. The Committee had enough raw material from which to draw.  
</p>
<p>76. The representative of Germany noted that, indeed, nothing prohibited countries from 
</p>
<p>taking action to fight racism. Once more, the central questions were whether the 
</p>
<p>Convention was being implemented and whether national instruments were being adapted 
</p>
<p>in accordance with international human rights norms.  
</p>
<p>77. The representative of Switzerland reiterated that the Committee had been engaged in 
</p>
<p>debate for six sessions and had not yet identified any substantial gaps that were so urgent 
</p>
<p>that the Committee should elaborate complementary standards. However, in the view of 
</p>
<p>Switzerland, the Committee had one clear message: countries had to fight the phenomena 
</p>
<p>of racism. Switzerland doubted that any complementary standards would lead to any further 
</p>
<p>action. In addition, it had to be noted that most optional protocols concerned 
</p>
<p>communications and addressed clearly identified needs.  
</p>
<p>78. The representative of Algeria stated that there was a clear need for standards and 
</p>
<p>that it was necessary to fill gaps that had been identified during prior sessions. The 
</p>
<p>Committee had heard repeated calls to improve implementation but there were clear limits 
</p>
<p>to the implementation of existing instruments. In the view of Algeria, it had emerged from 
</p>
<p>the general discussions that current instruments were not sufficient to address all forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination.  </p>


<p>79. The representative of Tunisia added that work on a draft protocol did not prevent 
</p>
<p>countries from implementing the Convention. The existing gaps, however, had to be 
</p>
<p>addressed, and xenophobia and racial profiling were such gaps. The representative 
</p>
<p>expressed optimism that the Ad Hoc Committee could progress and noted that countries 
</p>
<p>were in no way hindered by the work of the Committee from taking action at the national 
</p>
<p>level.  
</p>
<p>80. The representative of the African Union said that the creation of a rule was just a 
</p>
<p>first step towards its implementation, as a rule might not gain universal acceptance. States 
</p>
<p>could always decide if they wished to become party to a treaty.  
</p>
<p>81. The Chairperson-Rapporteur summarized the discussion and noted that differences 
</p>
<p>of opinion still remained. It appeared that delegations had not considered the presented 
</p>
<p>evidence but had adhered to their original policy positions.  
</p>
<p>82. The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action had been adopted by consensus 
</p>
<p>and there had been no objections to the document at the World Conference against Racism, 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in Durban in 2001. States that 
</p>
<p>had participated in that decision should maintain an element of goodwill, such as had 
</p>
<p>existed at that time.  
</p>
<p>83. The Ad Hoc Committee had had a large number of meetings due to the ensuing 
</p>
<p>differences and divisions between some groups of countries. One group insisted there was 
</p>
<p>no need for a new law, but that it was preferable to focus on better implementation. Another 
</p>
<p>view was that one could aim at better implementation but that was not enough. A protocol 
</p>
<p>that dealt with new phenomena, that group insisted, was needed.  
</p>
<p>84. The Chairperson-Rapporteur underlined that, according to various statements, 
</p>
<p>racism had been on the rise in many forums, sectors and regions. As explained during the 
</p>
<p>session, racism in certain sectors, such as in football, was marked and there was already a 
</p>
<p>debate within the International Federation of Associations of Football (FIFA) and other 
</p>
<p>federations on how to address that issue.  
</p>
<p>85. The Chairperson-Rapporteur expressed reluctance to continue with a perpetual 
</p>
<p>stalemate and asked delegations to consider the way forward in order to identify a solution 
</p>
<p>before the end of the session. He adjourned the formal meeting and the Ad Hoc Committee 
</p>
<p>proceeded with an informal meeting of regional coordinators and interested delegations. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Procedural gaps with regard to the International Convention on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>86. At the 13th meeting, Anwar Kemal, a member of the Committee on the Elimination 
</p>
<p>of Racial Discrimination, made a presentation on &#8220;Procedural gaps with regard to the 
</p>
<p>International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination&#8221;. For a 
</p>
<p>summary of the presentation and the discussion that followed, see annex I, section E. 
</p>
<p><b> H. General discussion and exchange of views, 14th meeting 
</b></p>
<p>87. At the 14th meeting, the Ad Hoc Committee held another general discussion and 
</p>
<p>exchange of views. The Chairperson-Rapporteur recalled the need to consider what was to 
</p>
<p>be done with the list of new topics and what steps should be taken with regard to the 
</p>
<p>questionnaire. 
</p>
<p>88. The representative of the United States addressed the issue of reservations to the 
</p>
<p>Convention, and the purpose of the Ad Hoc Committee and its future work. With regard to </p>


<p>reservations, during discussions there had been criticism of States that had made 
</p>
<p>reservations to the Convention, in particular to article 4. The representative noted that, 
</p>
<p>according to the United Nations treaty collection website, about 20 States had made 
</p>
<p>reservations to article 4. A wide spectrum of States had made reservations, including the 
</p>
<p>United States. Where freedom of expression intersected with anti-discrimination laws there 
</p>
<p>were some difficult issues; however, the United States would accept no obligation that 
</p>
<p>would limit the fundamental freedoms protected in its Constitution. For example, the 
</p>
<p>United States had allowed a controversial march by the Nazi party in a largely Jewish 
</p>
<p>neighbourhood and had also protected the right of others to protest against the march. The 
</p>
<p>representative emphasized that reservations to conventions were generally allowed. On the 
</p>
<p>purpose of the Ad Hoc Committee, the representative emphasized that Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council decision 3/103, in which the Council had requested the Committee to develop a 
</p>
<p>new treaty, had been adopted by a vote, not by consensus. Also, paragraph 199 of the 
</p>
<p>Durban Programme of Action did not call for a new treaty; instead, the language was 
</p>
<p>&#8220;prepare complementary international standards&#8221;, which did not prescribe the type of 
</p>
<p>document. There was merit in the Ad Hoc Committee&#8217;s work to address any gaps, but the 
</p>
<p>Committee was not asked by the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action for a new 
</p>
<p>treaty or protocol, but rather complementary standards, which might take other forms. In its 
</p>
<p>more recent consensus resolutions, such as 21/30, the Council referred to paragraph 199 of 
</p>
<p>the Durban Programme of Action, underlining the need for complementary standards. The 
</p>
<p>United States did not see the need for a new legally binding instrument; however, it did see 
</p>
<p>the possible need for other complementary standards, and was ready to discuss forms of 
</p>
<p>standards that could improve protection in those areas. 
</p>
<p>89. The representative of Brazil noted that, following the presentations during the 
</p>
<p>session, the Committee had a lot of information with which to move forward. In his briefing 
</p>
<p>on procedural gaps, Mr. Kemal had stressed the importance of strengthening the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Convention by addressing procedural gaps through, for example, an 
</p>
<p>optional protocol to the Convention allowing for country visits. The representative 
</p>
<p>emphasized that that issue had been raised with the Ad Hoc Committee on a number of 
</p>
<p>occasions by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and that it was 
</p>
<p>time for the Ad Hoc Committee to take action on the issue in order to have an impact. 
</p>
<p>90. The representative of Pakistan, on behalf of OIC, welcomed the suggestion that it 
</p>
<p>was time for the Ad Hoc Committee to take the recommendation of the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Racial Discrimination forward and consider an optional protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention on procedural gaps. She also welcomed the position of the representative of the 
</p>
<p>United States that it was time to discuss forms of complementary standards. Pakistan 
</p>
<p>underlined that the general recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination, in which the Committee considered substantive gaps, were not 
</p>
<p>considered as legally binding but rather as guidance, and complementary standards could 
</p>
<p>take the issues addressed in general recommendations and include them in an optional 
</p>
<p>protocol. The representative recommended that, during its next session, the Ad Hoc 
</p>
<p>Committee spend time exploring (a) forms of complementary standards; (b) an optional 
</p>
<p>protocol to the Convention to address procedural gaps; and (c) an optional protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention to address substantive gaps, following issues referred to in general 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. 
</p>
<p>91. The representative of Chile said that Chile was in favour of any proposal to advance 
</p>
<p>the work of the Ad Hoc Committee, and supported the earlier intervention of the 
</p>
<p>representative of Brazil. 
</p>
<p>92. The representative of South Africa, on behalf of the African Group, reiterated the 
</p>
<p>position that reservations to articles 2, 4 and 14 of the Convention created gaps and should 
</p>
<p>be addressed. She proposed that the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination </p>


<p>should be invited to provide information on reservations and how they affect the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Convention. The representative emphasized that the Convention was 
</p>
<p>a living document with 35 related general recommendations, which illustrated that there 
</p>
<p>were substantive gaps in the Convention. The Ad Hoc Committee should consider the 
</p>
<p>substantive gaps at its next session. It should also consider the core elements of the 
</p>
<p>procedural gaps to the Convention highlighted by the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination with regard to monitoring and country visits; also, the Committee 
</p>
<p>should be asked to make a presentation on that issue at the next session of the Ad Hoc 
</p>
<p>Committee. The representative also suggested proposing that OHCHR be invited to make a 
</p>
<p>presentation at the seventh session of the Ad Hoc Committee on comparative analysis of 
</p>
<p>treaty body mechanisms and how the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Racial Discrimination procedures differed, so the gaps could be addressed. 
</p>
<p>93. The representative of the European Union reiterated that the European Union was 
</p>
<p>committed to a discussion on potential gaps and to finding constructive ways to implement 
</p>
<p>what already existed to address racism. Since the establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee, 
</p>
<p>much progress had been made in the European Union at the national and regional levels, 
</p>
<p>and European Union legislation had been developed which in some cases went beyond the 
</p>
<p>United Nations framework. When the working methods of the Ad Hoc Committee had been 
</p>
<p>discussed, representatives of the European Union had emphasized the need to move 
</p>
<p>forward on the basis of facts, not aspirations. Future work on identifying any gaps must be 
</p>
<p>based on analysis and facts. Complementary standards did not need to be an optional 
</p>
<p>protocol or a new convention; they could also be new guidelines, best practices and general 
</p>
<p>recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The 
</p>
<p>representative requested facts on substantive gaps that could not be addressed by the 
</p>
<p>Convention, stating that members of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination had repeatedly noted the Committee&#8217;s regret that States were not fulfilling 
</p>
<p>reporting and implementation obligations as they should. 
</p>
<p>94. The Chairperson-Rapporteur concluded the meeting, noting that there were different 
</p>
<p>perceptions: that considering complementary standards involved looking at additional 
</p>
<p>protocols or conventions and that legal standards could be, inter alia, best practices and 
</p>
<p>guidelines. In presentations and reports, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination had asked countries to review their reservations, so there were clearly issues 
</p>
<p>concerning both reservations and reporting, areas that could improve enforcement of 
</p>
<p>Convention provisions. Another remaining consideration was that of interpretation or 
</p>
<p>judgement based on fact. States would not have to agree with a new legal standard, as they 
</p>
<p>had the prerogative to consider ratifying the instrument. 
</p>
<p>95. The meeting was adjourned to allow regional coordinators to consider the proposals 
</p>
<p>made and in which areas conclusions and recommendations could be reached at the sixth 
</p>
<p>session, and to make proposals concerning the level of consensus and agreement. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Adoption of the report  
</b></p>
<p>96. The Chairperson-Rapporteur opened the 15th meeting on the morning of 17 
</p>
<p>October. The meeting was adjourned to allow the Committee additional time to continue its 
</p>
<p>informal discussions, with a view to arriving at agreement.  
</p>
<p>97. The meeting was resumed later that afternoon. Further to the informal discussions, 
</p>
<p>the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the following topics would be discussed at the seventh 
</p>
<p>session of the Committee: 
</p>
<p>(a) Issues related to the implementation of the Convention: </p>


<p>(i) Universal accession to or ratification of the Convention; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Analysis of the number, range and basis of reservations to various articles 
</p>
<p> and their implications; assessment of the use of the complaint mechanism under 
</p>
<p> article 14; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Issues, challenges and best practices pertaining to reporting under the 
</p>
<p> Convention; 
</p>
<p>(iv) Implementation of recommendations to States; 
</p>
<p>(b) Procedural gaps with regard to the Convention: 
</p>
<p>(i) Further elaboration of the views of the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p> Racial  Discrimination on key elements with regard to procedural gaps and best 
</p>
<p> ways to address them (follow-up to the 2007 study and the different presentations 
</p>
<p> given and proposals made to the Ad Hoc Committee in accordance with its 
</p>
<p> mandate); 
</p>
<p>(ii) Presentation by OHCHR: comparison of relevant procedures of other treaties;  
</p>
<p>(c) National, regional and subregional mechanisms: 
</p>
<p>(i) Panel discussion to provide a comparative perspective on national, regional 
</p>
<p> and subregional mechanisms;  
</p>
<p>(d) Presentation and discussion on the purpose of general recommendations by 
</p>
<p>the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the process leading to their 
</p>
<p>issuance in the context of the effective implementation of the Convention, and any possible 
</p>
<p>shortcomings; 
</p>
<p>(e) General discussions with one or more members of the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Racial Discrimination. 
</p>
<p>98. The Ad Hoc Committee agreed on the following general conclusions on racism and 
</p>
<p>sport: 
</p>
<p>(a) Racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance are 
</p>
<p>increasing across the globe. Virulent manifestations of these scourges have also been 
</p>
<p>observed and documented in and around the world of sport, including on football pitches in 
</p>
<p>every region; 
</p>
<p>(b) Football is a prominent sport with global reach, with the capacity to draw 
</p>
<p>massive audiences, and creates a great impression on millions of people in all regions of the 
</p>
<p>world; 
</p>
<p>(c) International football federations and national football associations are aware 
</p>
<p>of the problems of racial discrimination in the sport and are undertaking efforts to combat 
</p>
<p>this scourge; 
</p>
<p>(d) Sport, and in particular football, can be used to amplify anti-discrimination 
</p>
<p>messages and support the primary efforts of Governments and civil society against racism; 
</p>
<p>(e) The Ad Hoc Committee encourages the Human Rights Council to invite 
</p>
<p>OHCHR, in particular the Anti-Discrimination Section, to continue to prioritize issues of 
</p>
<p>racism in sport, with an emphasis on football, in its work. In that regard, the Committee 
</p>
<p>believes that resources should be made available to OHCHR to carry out activities 
</p>
<p>pertaining to racism and sport.  
</p>
<p>99. Also at the 15th meeting, the report of the sixth session was adopted <i>ad referendum</i>, 
</p>
<p>with the understanding that delegations would forward technical corrections to their </p>


<p>interventions, in writing, to the secretariat by 31 October 2014. The Chairperson-
</p>
<p>Rapporteur invited general statements from the participants. 
</p>
<p>100. The representative of Pakistan, on behalf of OIC, thanked Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>for his excellent leadership and guidance during the session.  
</p>
<p>101. The representative of South Africa, on behalf of the African Group, thanked the 
</p>
<p>Chairperson-Rapporteur for his leadership and expressed recognition of the progress that 
</p>
<p>had been made and of the improved constructive atmosphere of the sixth session. She 
</p>
<p>recalled that the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee should be guided by paragraph 199 of 
</p>
<p>the Durban Programme of Action and Human Rights Council decision 3/103 and resolution 
</p>
<p>10/30, and restated the view of the African Group that such guidance should be the focus of 
</p>
<p>the Committee when undertaking its work.  
</p>
<p>102. The representative of the European Union thanked the Chairperson-Rapporteur for 
</p>
<p>contributing to a constructive atmosphere and a rich exchange of views, adding that the 
</p>
<p>Chairperson-Rapporteur&#8217;s long-standing experience had assisted the Committee in finding 
</p>
<p>common ground for the way forward. With regard to the two new topics considered during 
</p>
<p>the session with respect to prevention and awareness-raising and to special measures, the 
</p>
<p>European Union was of the view that they had been thoroughly addressed by the invited 
</p>
<p>experts, none of whom had indicated that there was any particular area that was not covered 
</p>
<p>by the current international legal framework to fight racism and tackle related issues. On 
</p>
<p>the topic of xenophobia, she underlined that it was being combated through different anti-
</p>
<p>discrimination measures on various grounds, and that the European Union remained of the 
</p>
<p>view that there was no added value in the Committee working on a legal definition of that 
</p>
<p>phenomenon. As to the topic of national mechanisms, the need persisted to further explore 
</p>
<p>the potential of such mechanisms to improve the implementation of existing international 
</p>
<p>standards, which would ensure their effectiveness. On the issue of procedural gaps, the 
</p>
<p>representative underlined that, as a starting point, the Committee on the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination was able to carry out its work effectively within existing procedures. 
</p>
<p>The level of cooperation by States parties was not always satisfactory, which was why the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the existing procedures should be improved in the first place. The 
</p>
<p>representative also suggested that the Ad Hoc Committee provide its considerations to the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council on the issue of the duration of the meeting time allocated to the 
</p>
<p>Committee. Looking forward to the next session, the representative said that the work of 
</p>
<p>the Committee would benefit from considering those consensual topics, during which 
</p>
<p>States across regions could share their experiences in implementing existing norms and 
</p>
<p>standards.  
</p>
<p>103. The representative of China expressed appreciation for the wisdom of the 
</p>
<p>Chairperson-Rapporteur and paid tribute to all colleagues in the Ad Hoc Committee and the 
</p>
<p>secretariat for their hard work during the previous two weeks. The delegate noted that 
</p>
<p>racism was a serious violation of human rights and that the international community was 
</p>
<p>witnessing serious and worsening racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</p>
<p>intolerance. The international community should uphold the international framework aimed 
</p>
<p>at combating racism and, therefore, demonstrable political will should be attached to the 
</p>
<p>Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the outcome of the Durban Review 
</p>
<p>Conference. It was important to promote harmony and co-existence among different races 
</p>
<p>and societies of the world. In so doing, the elaboration of new complementary standards to 
</p>
<p>address contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</p>
<p>intolerance should take place. The Ad Hoc Committee was urged to achieve tangible results 
</p>
<p>to that end.  
</p>
<p>104. The representative of Brazil thanked the Chairperson-Rapporteur for his role in 
</p>
<p>helping the Ad Hoc Committee to find consensus in adopting the conclusions of the 
</p>
<p>session. She expressed optimism about the focus of the Ad Hoc Committee and that its </p>


<p>future work would fulfil the mandate given to it by the Human Rights Council. She 
</p>
<p>particularly welcomed the conclusions and the proposal for future discussions on the issue 
</p>
<p>of procedural gaps with respect to the Convention.  
</p>
<p>105. The representative of the United States also thanked the Chairperson-Rapporteur for 
</p>
<p>the spirit and guidance he had brought to the sixth session of the Ad Hoc Committee, and 
</p>
<p>expressed appreciation to all colleagues for their efforts to reach consensus during the 
</p>
<p>session.  
</p>
<p>106. In closing the meeting, the Chairperson-Rapporteur thanked participants for their 
</p>
<p>statements of appreciation to him, noting that the progress made during the session was a 
</p>
<p>result of the hard work of delegations.  </p>

</b></p>
<p>1. At the 2nd meeting on 7 October 2014, the Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration of 
</p>
<p>Complementary Standards heard presentations given by Mr. Patrick Gasser, Senior FSR 
</p>
<p>Manager at Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), Mr. Jonas Burgheim, 
</p>
<p>Deputy Head of the United Nations Office on Sport for Development and Peace 
</p>
<p>(UNOSDP), and Mr. Pavel Klymenko, a representative of the Football Associations against 
</p>
<p>Racism in Europe (FARE Network) on &#8220;Prevention and awareness-raising, including 
</p>
<p>through human rights education and training, in the fight against racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance&#8221; as it related to sport.  
</p>
<p>2. Mr. Patrick Gasser presented on UEFA&#8217;s role in the area of racism in sport, stating 
</p>
<p>that football provided a unique platform to address that issue. UEFA was active in anti-
</p>
<p>racism initiatives in football. It had established a set of sanctions for disciplinary controls, it 
</p>
<p>organized Football Action week every October during Day 3 of the UEFA Champions 
</p>
<p>League and had just held a &#8220;Respect Diversity&#8221; conference in Rome in September 2014. 
</p>
<p>Its&#8217; &#8220;No to Racism&#8221; campaign included education, campaigning and sanctions. He noted 
</p>
<p>that UEFA&#8217;s anti-discrimination campaign comprised 54 Euro 2016 qualifiers (national 
</p>
<p>team&#8217;s competition), 40 games of the Champions League and Europa League (club 
</p>
<p>competition). The following actions took place during those matches: &#8220;No to Racism&#8221; 
</p>
<p>campaign via announcements on stadium speakers; graphics on giant screens; the 
</p>
<p>broadcasting of television advertisements; messages in match programmes and kids-players 
</p>
<p>escort initiative. In addition, UEFA pursued a number of educational programmes, such as 
</p>
<p>seminars on institutional discrimination, the Captains for Change Initiative and the Women 
</p>
<p>in Football Leadership Programme.  
</p>
<p>3. UEFA noted that it tackled all forms of discrimination, including racism, gender  
</p>
<p>discrimination and homophobia. While its jurisdiction was currently limited to 
</p>
<p>UEFA-sponsored events, such as Champions League matches, UEFA also worked at 
</p>
<p>influencing national associations. An important part of UEFA&#8217;s national approach was the 
</p>
<p>cooperation between the UEFA&#8217;s control and disciplinary body and the FARE Network in 
</p>
<p>order to monitor football matches and report discriminatory behaviour.  
</p>
<p>4. Mr. Jonas Burgheim, introduced the work of the Special Adviser on Sport for 
</p>
<p>Development and Peace and the United Nations Office on Sport for Development and 
</p>
<p>Peace and the work of the Intergovernmental Working Group in the area of sport, peace and 
</p>
<p>development. The Group&#8217;s main activities were the promotion and support of (national) 
</p>
<p>policies and projects as well as policy work in cooperation with UN partners, with reference </p>


<p>to GA resolution A/RES/67/17. He noted that the Human Rights Council had become 
</p>
<p>increasingly active in the field of human rights and sport, noting resolutions 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/RES/13/27, adopted in 2010, A/HRC/RES/26/18 and A/HRC/27/L.14 both adopted 
</p>
<p>in 2014 in that regard. Mr. Burgheim explained that UNOSDP worked with a number of 
</p>
<p>different actors ranging from governments to other United Nations entities to sport 
</p>
<p>federations. The Office was active in policy formulation and was implementing concrete 
</p>
<p>projects under its mandate. UNOSDP was involved in the drafting process of the relevant 
</p>
<p>General Assembly resolutions, and had intervened from time to time to resolve emblematic 
</p>
<p>cases concerning discrimination in sport, notably a recent case concerning the wearing of 
</p>
<p>the head scarf during a women&#8217;s basketball games. Mr. Burgheim underlined the 
</p>
<p>importance of sport in the area of anti-discrimination, noting that sport was a powerful tool 
</p>
<p>to strengthen social ties and networks, and promote ideals of peace, fraternity, solidarity, 
</p>
<p>non-violence, non-discrimination, tolerance and justice. Sport was a global phenomenon, 
</p>
<p>which had a strong convening power and enjoyed wide-spread popularity, especially among 
</p>
<p>youth. He offered the support of the Office on Sport for Development and Peace and 
</p>
<p>provision of relevant expertise to the Ad Hoc Committee.  
</p>
<p>5. Mr. Pavel Klymenko, FARE Network, briefed delegates about the work of the 
</p>
<p>network concerning racism and xenophobia in sport, especially football. The FARE 
</p>
<p>network membership, though primarily European, was also growing on a global scale. 
</p>
<p>FARE was currently active in more than forty countries and cooperated with UEFA, FIFA, 
</p>
<p>CONCACAF and others. Among the major issues in football that were addressed by FARE 
</p>
<p>were: the re-emergence of far-right parties and extremist movements in Europe; the 
</p>
<p>continued abuse of ethnic minorities; escalating xenophobia and extremist symbolism at 
</p>
<p>matches; the existence of glass ceilings for minorities in sports administration and 
</p>
<p>coaching; and the fact that national bodies and Governments were slow to respond to such 
</p>
<p>problems. He explained that stronger sanctions from responsible sport associations, as well 
</p>
<p>as national authorities were important to combat racism and xenophobia in sport. It was 
</p>
<p>important that UEFA disciplinary bodies be informed, following an analysis of the 
</p>
<p>probability of risk at certain matches and that independent monitoring of these matches take 
</p>
<p>place. He added that FARE assisted with the collection of data, carrying out a preventative 
</p>
<p>prognostic function.  
</p>
<p>6. Mr. Klymenko stated that strong leadership was necessary, as there was an obvious 
</p>
<p>need to broaden diversity in sport, in cooperation with affected communities. He added that 
</p>
<p>the system of data collection undertaken by FARE Network allows for prevention, and 
</p>
<p>could be replicated at the national level. It was also important to ensure that legal 
</p>
<p>frameworks were consistent at the national level, as such commonly-agreed principles to 
</p>
<p>assist in addressing discriminatory incidents in sport at the international level could be 
</p>
<p>useful. The cooperation between police forces and sport organizers was critical. In addition, 
</p>
<p>the expert suggested that anti-discrimination campaigns needed to be supported by 
</p>
<p>countries and public authorities should engage with fans and victims.  
</p>
<p>7. The representative of Morocco while noting that football was at the forefront in 
</p>
<p>addressing discrimination in that sport, inquired about anti-discrimination initiatives in 
</p>
<p>other sports and other regions and whether it would be possible to build on the initiatives 
</p>
<p>taking place in Europe. The European Union welcomed the expert discussion of practical 
</p>
<p>initiatives taking place to combat racism in sport. It also inquired whether there were 
</p>
<p>attempts to expand these initiatives to other regions and other sports, and also asked about 
</p>
<p>other forms of discrimination, such as discrimination against women and persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, asking about examples of efficient approaches. It noted that an increased 
</p>
<p>partnership between UN organizations and sport federations was essential to combat 
</p>
<p>discrimination. The Human Rights Council should play a role in that regard. Some sport 
</p>
<p>associations, such as the International Olympic Committee, that had UN observer status, </p>


<p>were very active, but, the potential for close cooperation was largely l untapped and 
</p>
<p>remained to be utilized.  
</p>
<p>8. Mr. Burgheim and Mr. Gasser noted that in addition to football, other sport 
</p>
<p>federations were becoming engaged in the fight against discrimination. With regard to the 
</p>
<p>global coverage of football and racism issues, it was recalled that FIFA was invited to 
</p>
<p>present to the Ad Hoc Committee, but was unable to participate on this occasion due to 
</p>
<p>scheduling constraints. Mr. Klymenko noted that similar problems in other sports such as 
</p>
<p>basketball, cricket and rugby had triggered some responses in other regions, like North 
</p>
<p>America, Latin America and Asia. He told the Committee that Australian sport associations 
</p>
<p>had, for example, developed frameworks for fighting discrimination, in particular 
</p>
<p>homophobia, in team sports. Football associations in other regions were undertaking similar 
</p>
<p>actions such as the independent monitoring used by the FARE network and that the 
</p>
<p>network was open to assisting other regions, if requested. Nevertheless, he added, clearly 
</p>
<p>not all stakeholders were engaged in the fight against racism.  
</p>
<p>9. The representative of Uruguay noted that racism and violence existed in football in 
</p>
<p>Uruguay, mostly at the club level and noted a chain of responsibilities, which included the 
</p>
<p>need to enhance the awareness of national federations.  
</p>
<p>10. The representative of the Republic of South Africa asked the experts to comment on 
</p>
<p>the role of sport in healing, remembrance and reconciliation, with regard to racism. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Burgheim recalled that dual aspects and values of sport were reflected in para. 86 and 
</p>
<p>218 of the DDPA, and noted that the symbolism and practice of sport could have a strong 
</p>
<p>impact on reconciliation. Mr. Gasser noted that UEFA actively pursued reconciliation 
</p>
<p>projects for example, in Eastern Europe or in the Middle East. In his view, the goal is to 
</p>
<p>&#8220;wave a new social fabric for the next generation&#8221;. Mr. Gasser explained that UEFA 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction and its rules and regulations applied to UEFA competitions, and not national 
</p>
<p>leagues, which complicated addressing national instances of racism in football. He did 
</p>
<p>however; note some good practice examples that could share with the organizers of national 
</p>
<p>competitions and national associations. He stated that improved cooperation was required 
</p>
<p>on this and that UEFA was pleased to share its good practices, if asked. He added that 
</p>
<p>UEFA was also involved in sponsoring tobacco-free matches, and public health issues such 
</p>
<p>as childhood obesity.  
</p>
<p>11. In response to the questions, Mr. Gasser also noted that while racism was a very key 
</p>
<p>component, the UEFA respect diversity approach set a wider consideration than race, as the 
</p>
<p>organization was against any form of discrimination. Both he and Mr. Burgheim also 
</p>
<p>stressed the need to involve local actors and stakeholders in anti-discrimination initiatives, 
</p>
<p>underlining the very important local partnerships with organizations like FARE Network. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Klymenko agreed that it was essential to reach out to all stakeholders involved in sports 
</p>
<p>in order to involve them in anti-discrimination initiatives. 
</p>
<p>12. A representative of the International Basketball Federation (IBF) stated that perhaps 
</p>
<p>there was no racism per se in sport, as rather sport offered a platform for sentiments which 
</p>
<p>already existed in different societies. While noting the important role to be played by sports 
</p>
<p>federations, such as IBF, he underlined the fact that it was for Member Stares to have 
</p>
<p>regulations in place to prohibit and punish racism.  
</p>
<p>13. The experts agreed that while sport indeed mirrored society, racism was also present 
</p>
<p>in the sport itself. Large sporting events, unfortunately, could provide giant venues for 
</p>
<p>discrimination, underlining the importance of using these very same venues to combat 
</p>
<p>discrimination through anti-discrimination campaigns and messages. Mr. Gasser explained 
</p>
<p>that the effect of sport as an &#8220;opinion maker&#8221; could be assessed by the fact that 
</p>
<p>advertisement time during prominent sport events, such as the Champions League matches, 
</p>
<p>sold for millions of Euros.  </p>


<p>14. The Chairperson-Rapporteur inquired as to why despite the practical measures being 
</p>
<p>undertaken in the arena of sport, racist and xenophobic incidents continued to occur; 
</p>
<p>whether it was possible to link issues of awareness-raising to penalties in the initiatives 
</p>
<p>being considered and carried out; and whether contexts like the media or political discourse 
</p>
<p>could provoke these sentiments and violence at sports events. The Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>also asked about whether the experts were involved in the FIFA &#8220;good behaviour 
</p>
<p>barometer&#8221; and whether they had any comments on its scientific basis and effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Gasser replied that according to its own statistics, the number of incidents had 
</p>
<p>increased, however this was a good sign as it meant that monitoring and tracking, in 
</p>
<p>partnership with FARE Network were now more effective and that over time with the 
</p>
<p>efforts undertaken, these figures would start to decrease. He cautioned that there was a limit 
</p>
<p>to what could be asked of federations, as efforts against racism could backfire and fail. 
</p>
<p>Football could not create peace; rather, the primary role was for Governments; federations, 
</p>
<p>national associations and civil society were stakeholders who could assist within their 
</p>
<p>jurisdictions and means. All society must contribute, and success could only come from 
</p>
<p>interplay among all actors. Mr. Klymenko added that as civil society and governing bodies 
</p>
<p>were making some good progress, the actions of football bodies now needed to be matched 
</p>
<p>by the Governments and the United Nations,. 
</p>
<p>15. At the 3rd meeting on 8 October, the Chairperson of the Working Group of Experts 
</p>
<p>on People of African Descent (WGEPAD), Ms. Mireille Fanon-Mendes France, presented 
</p>
<p>on the topic of &#8221;Prevention and awareness-raising, including through human rights 
</p>
<p>education and training, in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and 
</p>
<p>related intolerance.&#8221; She pointed out that several human rights instruments such as the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the 
</p>
<p>International Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and mechanisms such as the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on Education pointed to the importance of education as a commodity 
</p>
<p>and service to achieve other aims. She indicated Declarations such as the International 
</p>
<p>Decade for Education in the field of human rights proclaimed in 1994 by the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly; the guidelines for national education plans on human rights adopted by the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly in 1996 and proclamation of the &#8220;World education program in the field 
</p>
<p>of human rights&#8221;. Despite such efforts by the international community, she pointed out that 
</p>
<p>education was increasingly being commercialized and driven by the market economy, 
</p>
<p>leading to the creation of social hierarchy. 
</p>
<p>16. Ms. Fanon-Mendes France provided an overview of the situation of human rights 
</p>
<p>education in France and stated that while vocational training was being promoted and 
</p>
<p>integrated into the business sector, it had left out important elements of human rights 
</p>
<p>education &#8220;directed to the full development of the human personality and the sense of 
</p>
<p>dignity&#8221; and &#8220;for anyone able to play a useful role in a free society&#8221; as stipulated in the 
</p>
<p>major human rights conventions. Rather, education and training was seen primarily as a 
</p>
<p>productive investment for businesses. She added that the results were overwhelming 
</p>
<p>elsewhere as well: in Africa, human rights was not a part of the curricula in many countries; 
</p>
<p>in both Europe and the Americas, very few countries had developed action plans in the area 
</p>
<p>of human rights education; and in the Asia and the Pacific, only two countries had 
</p>
<p>developed plans of action in the area. She listed a number of reasons behind the challenge 
</p>
<p>in promoting human rights education such as the lack of political will of States, the lack of 
</p>
<p>resources and specialists in this field, as well as prevailing political instability, corruption, 
</p>
<p>endemic poverty and illiteracy in different countries. 
</p>
<p>17. Ms. Fanon-Mendes France also described the detrimental impact of racism on the 
</p>
<p>promotion of human rights education, impinging upon universal values of non-
</p>
<p>discrimination. She gave a number of contemporary examples in French society that 
</p>
<p>pointed to the need to increase awareness-raising not only for children, but adults as well as 
</p>
<p>people from all walks of life, on the importance of receiving human rights education. Given </p>


<p>the historical impact of racism, Ms. Fanon-Mendes France suggested that deconstructing 
</p>
<p>the notion of racism was key to addressing the persistence of inequality and domination 
</p>
<p>related to racial distinctions in pluralistic contemporary societies. In this context, she also 
</p>
<p>suggested that the international community had an important opportunity during the 
</p>
<p>International Decade for People of African Descent to promote human rights education, 
</p>
<p>including through awareness-raising activities to prevent and combat racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</p>
<p>18. The delegate of Morocco asked if the construction of memorials could serve as a 
</p>
<p>vector to combat racial discrimination, and asked if education on human trafficking could 
</p>
<p>be seen as an example of a preventive approach. The representative also asked about 
</p>
<p>preventive measures to combat xenophobia. The representative of the European Union 
</p>
<p>delivered a statement strongly condemning all forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance and added that comprehensive legislation had been in 
</p>
<p>place in the EU since 2000 which covered areas such as education, employment, housing, 
</p>
<p>etc. It also protected people of African descent as well as individuals from direct and 
</p>
<p>indirect forms of discrimination. The representative asked the presenter to assess the 
</p>
<p>possibility of attaining progress and tangible results in the promotion of human rights 
</p>
<p>education as part of the upcoming Decade. 
</p>
<p>19. The representative of Switzerland (on behalf of Argentina, Armenia, Brazil, Chile, 
</p>
<p>Colombia, Japan, Mexico, Switzerland and Uruguay) stated that human rights education 
</p>
<p>played a vital role in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</p>
<p>intolerance. These delegations shared the view that the World Programme for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Education and the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Education and 
</p>
<p>Training, adopted in December 2011, provided a common framework for action for all 
</p>
<p>relevant actors. It hoped that States would further develop their national action plans and 
</p>
<p>initiatives in this area in order to raise the awareness of the public and shift society toward a 
</p>
<p>more tolerant and respectful one. Schools, especially primary school, are the perfect place 
</p>
<p>to start efforts. As called for by the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the 
</p>
<p>outcome documents of the Durban Review Conference, States should be encouraged to take 
</p>
<p>action in keeping with the World Programme for Human Rights Education and the UN 
</p>
<p>Declaration. 
</p>
<p>20. The delegate of Switzerland asked for the presenters&#8217; views on the relationship 
</p>
<p>between existing instruments, and the World Programme for Human Rights Education and 
</p>
<p>whether there was a need for complementary standards. The representative of South Africa 
</p>
<p>said that Paragraph 199 of the DDPA had already identified that there are gaps in the 
</p>
<p>current instruments and asked the presenter for relevant recommendations related to 
</p>
<p>elaborating instruments on prevention and human rights education. The representative of 
</p>
<p>Cuba asked the presenter about ways to ensure increased prevention and awareness-raising 
</p>
<p>on the subject and asked Ms. Fanon-Mendes France about the identification of gaps in the 
</p>
<p>subject area. The representative of the USA stated that while the United States had made 
</p>
<p>strides in combating racial discrimination, the example of the Trayvon Martin incident 
</p>
<p>showed that more work needed to be done. While action needed to be undertaken to address 
</p>
<p>gaps with respect to xenophobia at the international level, new treaties or modifications to 
</p>
<p>existing treaties, were not required. The representative asked the expert if the existing tools 
</p>
<p>were effective and adequate.  
</p>
<p>21. In response, Ms. Fanon-Mendes France said that it was crucial that the world 
</p>
<p>community viewed the legacy of racism as a shared history not just limited to people of 
</p>
<p>African descent. She noted that it was important effectively to enforce existing international 
</p>
<p>laws and standards. She added that some of the issues which she felt were important to be 
</p>
<p>elaborated upon further included the intersectionality of racial discrimination, xenophobia, 
</p>
<p>the definition of Afrophobia and the phenomenon of racial profiling. All these areas </p>


<p>required further definitions clarity and laws relating to these issues needed to be less vague 
</p>
<p>and more enforceable, she added. Besides these three issues, it was important to address the 
</p>
<p>prevalence of structural racism, in order to reconcile the divisive gap between laws and 
</p>
<p>practices. The representatives of the Republic of South Africa, Brazil and Uruguay 
</p>
<p>expressed appreciation that the presenter had identified the issue of intersectionality in 
</p>
<p>terms of combating racial discrimination.  
</p>
<p>22. In concluding the 3rd meeting, the Chairperson-Rapporteur said that Committee 
</p>
<p>members thought that the ICERD was not sufficient to address the issue of xenophobia and 
</p>
<p>therefore new standards were required, while others thought that the implementation of 
</p>
<p>existing standards were sufficient to address xenophobia.  
</p>
<p>23. At the 4th meeting, Mr. Karel Fracapane, of the Section of Health and Global 
</p>
<p>Citizen Education, Education Sector, at UNESCO briefed the Committee on UNESCO&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>work in the area of &#8220;Prevention of awareness-raising, including through human rights 
</p>
<p>education and training, in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, and xenophobia 
</p>
<p>and related intolerance.&#8221; At UNESCO, he noted that human rights education (HRE) had a 
</p>
<p>vital role in undermining prejudice, shaping attitudes and behaviours of tolerance, and 
</p>
<p>cultivating respect for human rights of all people. He referred to the 1974 Recommendation 
</p>
<p>concerning Education for International Understanding, Cooperation, Peace and Education 
</p>
<p>relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which provided a normative 
</p>
<p>framework for promoting values and principles of human rights in and through education. 
</p>
<p>Member States were invited to report regularly on the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Recommendation. The 5th consolidated report on the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>Recommendation had been submitted to the General Conference of UNESCO in 2013, and 
</p>
<p>provided a vast overview of how themes and issues such as tolerance, women&#8217;s rights, child 
</p>
<p>protection, indigenous people&#8217;s rights, social justice, violence at school, prevention of 
</p>
<p>racism, discrimination and xenophobia, sexuality and health education, gender equality, etc. 
</p>
<p>were addressed in the formal and non-formal educational sectors of the 55 reporting 
</p>
<p>countries, as well as the challenges faced in their national contexts. He added that 
</p>
<p>UNESCO and the OHCHR had jointly developed a self-assessment tool to help countries 
</p>
<p>build their national plans of action on human rights education.  
</p>
<p>24. Mr. Fracapane explained that UNESCO had also developed a programme on global 
</p>
<p>citizenship education (GCE), which included human rights education. GCE could be 
</p>
<p>delivered through various modes and in all venues, including formal, non-formal and 
</p>
<p>informal education, noting that in most countries, the formal education system would be the 
</p>
<p>main mode of delivery. GCE should be integrated in education systems, either as a stand-
</p>
<p>alone subject, or as a component of existing programmes and/or the ethos of a learning 
</p>
<p>environment and system. 
</p>
<p>25. He explained that the UNESCO project Teaching Respect for All (TRA) could be 
</p>
<p>interesting to the Committee&#8217;s work, as it was the project that created a set of guidelines to 
</p>
<p>counter discrimination. Countries could adapt the content according to their contexts and 
</p>
<p>needs. The project led to the elaboration of educational materials to address challenges such 
</p>
<p>as racism, ethnic discrimination, xenophobia and prejudice based on gender, colour, descent 
</p>
<p>or national, ethnic or religious identities. 
</p>
<p>26. Mr. Fracapane stated that an integral part of the human rights education work at 
</p>
<p>UNESCO concerned Holocaust remembrance, and he outlined the features of the Education 
</p>
<p>for Holocaust Remembrance project. He explained that UNESCO aimed at making the 
</p>
<p>study of the past and the commemoration of victims meaningful to present generations. He 
</p>
<p>stated that education about the Holocaust, genocide, and mass atrocity presented a good 
</p>
<p>starting point for raising awareness about processes leading to violent conflicts. Analysing 
</p>
<p>past and present examples of mass atrocities, Mr. Fracapane noted, would help raise 
</p>
<p>awareness about the need to promote, preserve and nurture the fundamental rights of </p>


<p>individuals. The Education for Holocaust Remembrance project was established to educate 
</p>
<p>about the Holocaust and also combat Holocaust denial. It involved the commemoration of 
</p>
<p>the International Day in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust on 27 January each year, 
</p>
<p>as well as educational modules for ministries of educations around the world. It also aims to 
</p>
<p>sensitize States and the general public on Holocaust remembrance and genocide prevention.  
</p>
<p>27. During the following discussion, the representative of Morocco underlined the 
</p>
<p>importance of education and in particular human rights education. Answering a question 
</p>
<p>posed by Morocco and Brazil, Mr. Fracapane noted that the Teaching Respect for All 
</p>
<p>programme had now reached the end of its pilot phase, and that there were plans to expand 
</p>
<p>the programme to a global level.  
</p>
<p>28. The representative of the USA inquired about the scope of the programme. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Fracapane explained that the programme addressed various forms of discrimination and 
</p>
<p>could be adapted to a local context &#8211; depending on which form of discrimination was dealt 
</p>
<p>with. The programme per se covered among others racism, gender equality, homophobia or 
</p>
<p>discrimination against handicapped people. Different countries made different uses of the 
</p>
<p>programme.  
</p>
<p>29. Morocco inquired about the distinguishing characteristics of the Global Citizenship 
</p>
<p>Education. Mr. Fracapane explained that the GCE methodology encompassed human rights 
</p>
<p>education but had a broader focus. Global citizenship meant addressing a number of 
</p>
<p>different areas that could not be separated of which a global citizen needed to be aware. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, the programme encompassed sustainable development, health, education, 
</p>
<p>human rights and other areas. The GCE initiative served as an umbrella under which all of 
</p>
<p>those areas came together. The initiative also corresponded to a shift away from purely 
</p>
<p>cognitive education. 
</p>
<p>30. The representative of Morocco noted the role of memorial processes and asked if 
</p>
<p>UNESCO dealt with other atrocities, such as Rwanda or Srebrenica. Mr. Fracapane stated 
</p>
<p>that the Holocaust was an important starting point to begin a discussion of &#8220;where 
</p>
<p>discrimination can lead.&#8221; Indeed, all instruments to prevent genocide were based on the 
</p>
<p>Holocaust experience. The Holocaust was the universal example of a mass atrocity, and it 
</p>
<p>was also a practical example, as there was a lot of material from which teachers could draw. 
</p>
<p>The UNESCO expert stressed that there was an obvious link between different crimes 
</p>
<p>against humanity. It was important to focus on &#8220;the drama of history&#8221; rather than one event. 
</p>
<p>The Holocaust could also be used in order to grapple with a country&#8217;s own history. He 
</p>
<p>explained that Argentina, for example, had reformed school curricula and started to teach 
</p>
<p>about the Holocaust, which allowed teachers to talk about the years spent under the rule of 
</p>
<p>the military regime. Argentina was now proceeding to work on the issue of including 
</p>
<p>crimes against indigenous populations in the curriculum. That was a practical example of 
</p>
<p>how a country can tackle its own history by learning about the history of others.  
</p>
<p>31. The Chairperson-Rapporteur recalled that UNESCO was pioneering work on human 
</p>
<p>rights education, in particular in the field of anti-racism, from the 1960s. A number of 
</p>
<p>publications had been produced at that time which underlined one human race. The 
</p>
<p>Chairperson-Rapporteur asked Mr. Fracapane to inquire with UNESCO headquarters if the 
</p>
<p>impact of those various educational tools produced by UNESCO had been assessed. It 
</p>
<p>would be important for the Committee to know which educational tools had been successful 
</p>
<p>in the past, and which had failed in order not to repeat mistakes, but build on the 
</p>
<p>achievements.  
</p>
<p>32. The Republic of South Africa noted that education was essential to anti-
</p>
<p>discrimination work and also stated that it was crucial to recognize the importance of the 
</p>
<p>past. Three Holocaust memorials existed in South Africa, which were used for teaching 
</p>
<p>purposes and served as a constant warning that silence (while someone was experiencing </p>


<p>discrimination) could result in disaster. The representative urged the Committee to take the 
</p>
<p>side of the victims and recalled that during the morning&#8217;s session, five additional protocols 
</p>
<p>were discussed. The UNESCO expert was asked if Mr. Fracapane would be able to make 
</p>
<p>any recommendations regarding the gaps in anti-racism law that could be addressed by the 
</p>
<p>Committee.  
</p>
<p>33. The representative of the United States of America added that he would appreciate 
</p>
<p>recommendations from the expert but did not agree with the South African position that 
</p>
<p>there were gaps in the law. The UNESCO expert replied that, in his view, there was no 
</p>
<p>need for new laws; as such laws were already in place. Countries were asked to report on 
</p>
<p>the implementation of existing laws and it had become clear that there was a gap between 
</p>
<p>the legal framework and the actual practice on the ground. The expert recommended that 
</p>
<p>countries and stakeholders engage with UN system and agencies more intensively in order 
</p>
<p>to develop programmes and ensure the implementation of the legal framework at all levels. 
</p>
<p>34. In response to the question of South Africa, Mr. Fracapane noted that discrimination 
</p>
<p>resulted from a variety of factors. There was; however, a real gap between the legal 
</p>
<p>framework and its implementation. One of the reasons was a lack of capacity and capacity-
</p>
<p>building measures, and a lack of focus by the international community. Regional and local 
</p>
<p>communities, needed to participate in capacity-building &#8211; in particular when it came to 
</p>
<p>human rights education. An important factor for future success would be to address 
</p>
<p>informal education. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Summary of the expert presentations and initial discussions on the topic 
</b></p>
<p>of &#8220;Special measures, including affirmative or positive measures, 
<b>strategies or actions, to prevent, combat and eradicate all forms and 
</b></p>
<p><b>manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</b></p>
<p>intolerance&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>35. In the afternoon of 9 October, the Ad Hoc Committee commenced a discussion on 
</p>
<p>the topic of &#8220;Special measures, including affirmative or positive measures, strategies or 
</p>
<p>actions, to prevent, combat and eradicate all forms and manifestations of racism, racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance&#8221;. This 6th meeting was chaired, 
</p>
<p>exceptionally, by Mr. Ephrem B. Hidug of the Permanent Mission of Ethiopia to the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Office at Geneva.  
</p>
<p>36. The presentation by the expert, Mr. Carlos Vazquez, a member of the CERD, was 
</p>
<p>focused on the treatment of &#8220;special measures&#8221; in the Convention for the Elimination of All 
</p>
<p>Forms of Racial Discrimination, as well as in the practice of the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The Committee&#8217;s practice is reflected in its 
</p>
<p>Concluding Observations and in its General Recommendation No. 32, on &#8220;The meaning 
</p>
<p>and scope of special measures in the Convention on the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination.&#8221; In theory, the Committee might also have occasion to address special 
</p>
<p>measures in individual communications against States parties that have opted into this 
</p>
<p>procedure under article 14 of the Convention. However, to date the Committee has not 
</p>
<p>addressed, in its decisions on individual communications, whether a State&#8217;s decision to 
</p>
<p>employ special measures, or its failure to do so, amounts to a breach of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>37. He clarified that the Convention uses the term &#8220;special measures&#8221; to describe a 
</p>
<p>concept that is sometimes referred to by other terms, such as &#8220;affirmative action,&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#8220;affirmative measures,&#8221; or &#8220;positive measures,&#8221; however, the meaning of these terms in 
</p>
<p>certain legal systems can be different from the meaning in the Convention. &#8220;Special 
</p>
<p>measures&#8221; is a broader term that includes, for example, programmes that draw distinctions 
</p>
<p>along racial or ethnic grounds in order to benefit disadvantaged groups, and also </p>


<p>programmes that seek to improve the position of disadvantaged groups by other means. He 
</p>
<p>noted that although the CERD occasionally used these other terms, especially &#8220;affirmative 
</p>
<p>action,&#8221; its preference, for the purpose of clarity, was to apply the wording of the 
</p>
<p>Convention. He added that the one term that the Committee definitively rejected was the 
</p>
<p>term &#8220;positive discrimination.&#8221; This phrase, the Committee has said, is a contradiction in 
</p>
<p>terms, since all racial discrimination is prohibited by the Convention and therefore cannot 
</p>
<p>be &#8220;positive.&#8221; Mr. Vazquez continued that the term &#8220;reverse discrimination&#8221; is more 
</p>
<p>complicated and should be used cautiously, if at all. A measure pursued by a State party 
</p>
<p>could in theory amount to reverse discrimination &#8211; if it failed to satisfy the conditions set 
</p>
<p>forth in the Convention for using special measures. If a measure does satisfy the 
</p>
<p>Convention&#8217;s conditions, then the measure does not amount to discrimination, and hence is 
</p>
<p>not reverse discrimination. 
</p>
<p>38. With regard to the text of the Convention, special measures are mentioned in two 
</p>
<p>provisions: article 1, section 4, and article 2, section 2. Article 1 defines racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination, which is prohibited by the Convention, and section 4 makes clear that 
</p>
<p>special measures ordinarily do not constitute prohibited racial discrimination. Specifically, 
</p>
<p>article 1, section 4 provides that &#8220;Special measures taken for the sole purpose of securing 
</p>
<p>adequate advancement of certain racial or ethnic groups or individuals requiring such 
</p>
<p>protection as may be necessary in order to ensure such groups or individuals equal 
</p>
<p>enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms shall not be deemed 
</p>
<p>racial discrimination, provided, however, that such measures do not, as a consequence, lead 
</p>
<p>to the maintenance of separate rights for different racial groups and that they shall not be 
</p>
<p>continued after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>39. Article 1, section 4 should be understood as a clarification of the definition of &#8220;racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination&#8221; in article 1, section 1. Section 1 defines racial discrimination as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;distinction[s], exclusion[s], restriction[s] or preference[s] based on race, colour, descent, 
</p>
<p>or national or ethnic origin.&#8221; Because special measures sometimes take the form of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;preferences&#8221; based on race or ethnicity, they might be thought to be barred by article 1, 
</p>
<p>section 1. Section 4, however, makes it clear that such preferences are not barred if they are 
</p>
<p>adopted to secure the adequate advancement of groups requiring such protection, and if 
</p>
<p>other conditions are satisfied. One might think that section 4 is an exception to the broad 
</p>
<p>prohibition of racial discrimination. The Committee, however, views section 4 as instead a 
</p>
<p>clarification of the meaning of section 1. Article 1, section 1 does not prohibit all 
</p>
<p>preferences, but only those preferences &#8220;which ha[ve] the purpose or effect of nullifying or 
</p>
<p>impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public 
</p>
<p>life.&#8221; The Committee elaborated on this definition in its General Recommendation 14, in 
</p>
<p>which it observed that &#8220;differentiation of treatment will not constitute discrimination if the 
</p>
<p>criteria for such differentiation, judged against the objectives and purposes of the 
</p>
<p>Convention, are legitimate.&#8221; Article 1, section 4 should be understood to clarify that 
</p>
<p>preferences adopted for the purpose of securing the advancement of disadvantaged groups 
</p>
<p>serve a legitimate purpose, and, if they meet the other conditions set forth in Article 1, 
</p>
<p>section 4, they do not violate the Convention. 
</p>
<p>40. Mr. Vasquez explained the conditions that determine the validity of special 
</p>
<p>measures. Article 1, section 4 refers to special measures taken for the &#8220;sole purpose&#8221; of 
</p>
<p>securing the advancement of disadvantaged groups. According to the Committee&#8217;s General 
</p>
<p>Recommendation 32, the &#8220;sole purpose&#8221; language &#8220;limits the scope of acceptable 
</p>
<p>motivations for special measures within the terms of the Convention.&#8221; This raises 
</p>
<p>potentially difficult questions when racial preferences are adopted for multiple purposes. 
</p>
<p>For example, in some countries, racial preferences in university admissions are justified on 
</p>
<p>the ground that it is important for the educational mission to expose students to a diverse 
</p>
<p>range of viewpoints. The achievement of diversity would appear to be a motivation distinct </p>


<p>from securing the advancement of disadvantaged groups. Do racial preferences adopted for 
</p>
<p>the purpose of achieving diversity run afoul of the limitations of article 1, section 4, 
</p>
<p>because they are not taken for the &#8220;sole purpose&#8221; of securing the advancement of 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged groups? The Committee&#8217;s General Recommendation does not address this 
</p>
<p>point, but the Committee&#8217;s practice does not suggest that special measures are problematic 
</p>
<p>because they serve this additional purpose. This may be an example of the Committee&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>interpretation of the Convention as a &#8220;living instrument.&#8221; As measures rarely have a single 
</p>
<p>purpose, a literal approach to the &#8220;sole purpose&#8221; criterion is therefore unrealistic. 
</p>
<p>41. Article 1, section 4 also provides that special measures must be adopted for the 
</p>
<p>purpose of securing &#8220;adequate advancement&#8221; for disadvantaged groups. The General 
</p>
<p>Recommendation indicates that this term refers to &#8220;goal directed programmes which have 
</p>
<p>the objective of alleviating and remedying disparities in the enjoyment of human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms affecting particular groups and individuals, protecting them from 
</p>
<p>discrimination.&#8221; These include &#8220;persistent or structural disparities and de facto inequalities 
</p>
<p>were resulting from&#8221; historical circumstances. As there is a danger that communities 
</p>
<p>themselves may not agree that special measures are necessary to secure their advancement, 
</p>
<p>the General Recommendation provides that special measures should be designed and 
</p>
<p>implemented on the basis of prior consultation with affected communities and the active 
</p>
<p>participation of such communities. Special measures should not be imposed on 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged groups against their wishes. He also noted also that Recommendation 
</p>
<p>requires consultation with &#8220;affected communities,&#8221; not just the beneficiaries of the special 
</p>
<p>measures, representatives of races or ethnicities that would not be benefited by the special 
</p>
<p>measure. 
</p>
<p>42. Article 1, section 4 imposes two additional conditions for the validity of special 
</p>
<p>measures: they must be temporary and not lead to the maintenance of separate rights for 
</p>
<p>different racial groups. This is in contrast to article 2(2) which provides that special 
</p>
<p>measures &#8220;shall in no case entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate 
</p>
<p>rights for different racial groups after the objectives for which they were taken have been 
</p>
<p>achieved.&#8221; Article 1(4) imposes two separate requirements &#8211; the measures must not 
</p>
<p>maintain separate rights for different racial groups and they must be temporary; article 2(2) 
</p>
<p>imposes one requirement &#8211; the wording indicates that measures may establish separate 
</p>
<p>rights for different racial groups as long as they are temporary. The General 
</p>
<p>Recommendation does not discuss the difference in language. In discussing article 1(4), the 
</p>
<p>Recommendation interprets it to impose two separate requirements (that the measures not 
</p>
<p>establish separate rights for different racial groups and that they be temporary). In 
</p>
<p>discussing article 2(2), the Recommendation says that the limitations it imposes are &#8220;in 
</p>
<p>essence the same&#8221; as those imposed by article 1(4). The General Recommendation does go 
</p>
<p>on to say, however, that the obligation not to maintain special rights for different racial 
</p>
<p>groups in &#8220;narrowly drawn&#8221; insofar as it refers only to &#8220;racial&#8221; groups, and thus and calls to 
</p>
<p>mind the practice of Apartheid in South Africa.  
</p>
<p>43. The General Recommendation draws an important distinction between special 
</p>
<p>measures, which must be temporary, and the permanent rights to which certain minorities 
</p>
<p>might be entitled. For example, minorities have the right to enjoy their own culture, profess 
</p>
<p>and practice their own religion and use their own language, and indigenous peoples have 
</p>
<p>the right to use land traditionally occupied by them. Similarly, women have rights to non-
</p>
<p>identical treatment based on biological differences, such as maternity leave. These 
</p>
<p>permanent rights should be distinguished from special measures, which are to be used only 
</p>
<p>temporarily. The Recommendation also makes clear that these permanent rights recognized 
</p>
<p>by international human rights law are not &#8220;special rights&#8221; within the meaning of 
</p>
<p>article 1(4).  </p>


<p>44. He noted that CERD practice on special measures has primarily been focused on 
</p>
<p>urging States parties to put such measures in place more frequently. Although the 
</p>
<p>Committee&#8217;s Concluding Observations have at times expressed concern over special 
</p>
<p>measures that have remained in place longer than necessary, or otherwise raise issues under 
</p>
<p>article 1(4), it is much more common for the Committee to express concern about a State 
</p>
<p>party&#8217;s failure to take special measures where they seem warranted. And the Committee&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Concluding Observations rarely express views about the appropriateness of particular types 
</p>
<p>of special measures as compared to others. 
</p>
<p>45. Mr. Vazquez summarized the nature of States parties&#8217; obligations under the 
</p>
<p>Convention: Article 2(2), as the General Recommendation makes clear, means that it is 
</p>
<p>mandatory &#8211; not discretionary &#8211; for States parties to employ special measures &#8220;when 
</p>
<p>circumstances so warrant.&#8221; States parties must initially determine whether the 
</p>
<p>circumstances warrant special measures, and this is to be done by assessing whether there is 
</p>
<p>a disparate enjoyment of human rights by persons or groups within the State party on the 
</p>
<p>basis of race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin, and an ensuing need to correct 
</p>
<p>such imbalance. This assessment is to be made on the basis of disaggregated data. Once the 
</p>
<p>need for special measures has been determined, the State party must choose among the 
</p>
<p>various types of special measures that might conceivably be employed. This determination 
</p>
<p>must, inevitably, be sensitive to the particular situation of the various racial and ethnic 
</p>
<p>groups in the State party, and must be done in consultation with such groups and other 
</p>
<p>&#8220;affected parties.&#8221; As the General Recommendation notes, the Convention must be 
</p>
<p>interpreted in a context-sensitive manner, and &#8220;context-sensitive interpretation . . . includes 
</p>
<p>taking into account the particular circumstances of States parties without prejudice to the 
</p>
<p>universal quality of the norms of the Convention.&#8221; The Committee recognizes that &#8220;[t]he 
</p>
<p>nature of the Convention and the broad scope of the Convention&#8217;s provisions imply that . . . 
</p>
<p>the conscientious application of Convention principles will produce variations in outcome 
</p>
<p>among States parties,&#8221; although it has also stressed that &#8220;such variations must be fully 
</p>
<p>justifiable in light of the principles of the Convention.&#8221; In the end, the selection of special 
</p>
<p>measures inevitably requires sensitive judgments by the State parties, but these judgments 
</p>
<p>are to be exercised within the parameters and in compliance with the requirements of the 
</p>
<p>Convention, as elaborated in General Recommendation 32. 
</p>
<p>46. Brazil speaking (on behalf of Argentina, Armenia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, 
</p>
<p>Switzerland and Uruguay) stated that special measures, including affirmative or positive 
</p>
<p>action, can be an important tool to prevent and eliminate racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance. The importance of special measures, and its 
</p>
<p>framework, can be found in both the ICERD, in its articles 1(4) and 2, and in the DDPA 
</p>
<p>and in the outcome of its Review Conference. The DDPA recognizes the necessity for 
</p>
<p>special measures or positive actions for the victims of racism, racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p>xenophobia and related intolerance in order to promote their full integration into society. 
</p>
<p>Those measures for effective action, including social measures, should aim at correcting the 
</p>
<p>conditions that impair the enjoyment of rights and the introduction of special measures to 
</p>
<p>encourage equal participation of all racial and cultural, linguistic and religious groups in all 
</p>
<p>sectors of society and to bring all onto an equal footing. Therefore, special measures and 
</p>
<p>affirmative action can not only have corrective functions, but also an important preventive 
</p>
<p>role. The delegation asked Mr. Vazquez whether he considered that there are gaps in the 
</p>
<p>international framework that would require additional international norms on special 
</p>
<p>measures, and invited him to share good practices in the area. 
</p>
<p>47. Mr. Hidug, in his role as Chairperson-Rapporteur, asked for Mr. Vazquez&#8217;s views on 
</p>
<p>why, given the mandatory nature of article 2(2) of the ICERD, it was only being 
</p>
<p>implemented by some countries. </p>


<p>48. Mr. Vazquez expressed his agreement at the preventative, as well as corrective, 
</p>
<p>function of special measures. He explained that the Committee considers that CERD is 
</p>
<p>flexible enough to address any gaps in the international framework, and therefore a new 
</p>
<p>instrument on standard on special measures, was not really needed. The Convention was 
</p>
<p>detailed enough in its provisions for special measures and the Committee has developed 
</p>
<p>further guidance through General Recommendation 32, which is sufficient. Special 
</p>
<p>measures are context specific and it is difficult to provide more detailed guidance than that 
</p>
<p>provided in General Recommendation 32. The CERD could, if required, revisit the 
</p>
<p>recommendation to add further details in the future.  
</p>
<p>49. In his personal view, a survey of the special measures undertaken by states around 
</p>
<p>the world could be interesting. He stated that a significant number of States had taken 
</p>
<p>special measures in different contexts such as in the area of employment, election to 
</p>
<p>political office etc., adding that it was inaccurate to state that few States had implemented 
</p>
<p>them. Although States report to CERD on special measures, due to word limit of the 
</p>
<p>periodic report it was not possible to provide a lot of detail on special measures taken. 
</p>
<p>Information about the type, context and nature of measures, would allow the Committee to 
</p>
<p>analyse and compile best practices and provide States with further guidance on what 
</p>
<p>available options and novel approaches which had not occurred to them. 
</p>
<p>50. The delegate of Mexico recalled that legislative measures were undertaken as part of 
</p>
<p>national reforms in June 2014, including exclusion, inclusion and positive measures. The 
</p>
<p>measures addressed physical access and communication barriers, and awareness-raising 
</p>
<p>activities and training. Mexico is also taking steps to remove barriers through the 
</p>
<p>distribution of documents in indigenous languages, and there is a policy to combat 
</p>
<p>discrimination such as in the area of homophobia. Special temporary measures have been 
</p>
<p>introduced for groups that face discrimination, particularly people of African descent and 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples. National councils to prevent discrimination are tasked with gathering 
</p>
<p>information about the work of different institutions in this area.  
</p>
<p>51. The European Union underlined that ICERD is an important instrument and it 
</p>
<p>reiterated its concern at delays in reporting under the Convention. The delegate inquired 
</p>
<p>about how many states have recognized the communications procedure of CERD under 
</p>
<p>article 14, and inquired whether any new General Recommendations were planned by 
</p>
<p>CERD. 
</p>
<p>52. Mr. Vazquez appreciated the information provided about the new legislation in 
</p>
<p>Mexico and the areas where action was being taken to ensure disadvantaged communities 
</p>
<p>are not left behind. With regard to inclusion measures, he distinguished between permanent 
</p>
<p>rights held by groups and special temporary measures. He added that special measures are 
</p>
<p>dealt with by other committees and other conventions, and in those contexts special 
</p>
<p>measures may take different forms. 
</p>
<p>53. In response to the EU, he noted that reporting in some cases is delayed and measures 
</p>
<p>are being taken to address this. Regarding the number of States which have opted into the 
</p>
<p>communications procedure there are approximately 55 states, which is a third of States 
</p>
<p>parties and he encouraged more States to join. General Recommendation 35 on combatting 
</p>
<p>racial hate speech was adopted and released in August 2013. During the April session in 
</p>
<p>2015, CERD will consider new topics for General Recommendations. CERD is in the 
</p>
<p>process of looking at working methods with an aim to harmonize these with those of other 
</p>
<p>treaty bodies and one of the areas to be harmonized concerns the adoption of General 
</p>
<p>Recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Mexico provided clarification on its previous intervention regarding law reform and 
</p>
<p>special measures. Only the last measure mentioned in her intervention is a temporary 
</p>
<p>special measure. </p>


<p>55. At the 7th meeting on 10 October, Mr. Theodore Shaw, Professor and Director of 
</p>
<p>the Center for Civil Rights of the Chapel Hill School of Law, University of North Carolina 
</p>
<p>presented on the topic: Special Measures, including affirmative or positive measures, 
</p>
<p>strategies or actions, to prevent, combat and eradicate all forms and manifestations of 
</p>
<p>racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. Mr. Shaw provided some 
</p>
<p>historical context and background to the issue recalling to the transatlantic slave trade and 
</p>
<p>subsequent slavery in the USA, as well as the &#8220;Jim Crow&#8221; legal era which continued to 
</p>
<p>exist in many parts of the country until the 1960s. He said that affirmative action began in 
</p>
<p>the 1960s as a remedial imperative to address the effects of 350 years of segregation and 
</p>
<p>slavery which had to be viewed as a continuum. 
</p>
<p>56. He also said that since its introduction in the United States, affirmative action in the 
</p>
<p>education sector had faced repeated backlash in the form of lawsuits alleging &#8220;reverse 
</p>
<p>discrimination&#8221;. He cited the example of the case of <i>DeFunis v. Odegaard</i> (1974) 
</p>
<p>concerning Marco DeFunis, an applicant to the University of Washington Law School, who 
</p>
<p>alleged that he was discriminated against when he was not admitted although black and 
</p>
<p>Latino minority group members had been accepted into the university. The case was 
</p>
<p>ultimately found to be moot in 1974, as DeFunis had been provisionally admitted while the 
</p>
<p>case was pending. He also gave the example of the <i>Board of Regents of the University of 
</i></p>
<p><i>California v. Bakke</i> (1978), in which Mr. Bakke, an applicant to medical school had been 
</p>
<p>rejected, while applicants from minority groups had been accepted. This landmark decision 
</p>
<p>by the Supreme Court of the US upheld affirmative action but ruled that specific quotas 
</p>
<p>were impermissible. More recently,, in 2003 the United States Supreme Court dealt with 
</p>
<p>the case of <i>Grutter v. Bollinger</i> in which it also upheld the affirmative action policy of the 
</p>
<p>University of Michigan Mr. Shaw added that in the United States these decisions were 
</p>
<p>taken on the basis of a diversity rationale, rather than a remedial rationale. He provided 
</p>
<p>different examples of the challenges in implementing affirmative action in the employment 
</p>
<p>sector and stated that while the aim had been to achieve a country in which race did not 
</p>
<p>subordinate people; there has been an ongoing struggle to fight against colour blindness to 
</p>
<p>address the impact of racial discrimination.  
</p>
<p>57. The representative of Uruguay provided information about ongoing country 
</p>
<p>initiatives to promote affirmative action in the education system for people of African 
</p>
<p>descent, and asked about ways to continue to enforce and implement affirmative action to 
</p>
<p>bring about lasting change in the future, given its temporary nature. The representative of 
</p>
<p>Egypt asked the presenter what he considered to be the most appropriate steps at the 
</p>
<p>international and the national levels to address gaps between existing laws and their 
</p>
<p>enforcement. The delegate of Morocco asked for the presenter&#8217;s view on the effectiveness 
</p>
<p>of the justice system to address racism and best practices from US experience that could be 
</p>
<p>replicated.. The representative of the Republic of South Africa provided information on the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s experience in applying affirmative action through the introduction of the 
</p>
<p>Employment Equity Act and asked the presenter for reasons as to why there had always 
</p>
<p>been a strong reaction to affirmative action policies and measures. Brazil highlighted its 
</p>
<p>positive experience with the introduction of affirmative action, and asked the presenter for 
</p>
<p>reasons behind the backlash against affirmative action. The representative of the United 
</p>
<p>States of America expressed the Government&#8217;s commitment to address disparities in the 
</p>
<p>society including through federal measures, and requested the presenter to shed more light 
</p>
<p>on his work with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People 
</p>
<p>(NAACP) Legal Defense Fund. 
</p>
<p>58. In response, Mr. Shaw emphasized that education was an engine of opportunity and 
</p>
<p>that backlash in this sector was faced primarily through racial discrimination against black 
</p>
<p>Americans. He observed that while several types of scholarships existed in the American 
</p>
<p>educational system for people from different nationalities, groups and those with different 
</p>
<p>interests, the policies most under attack were those opportunities availed to racial </p>


<p>minorities. He emphasized that laws themselves were insufficient, and, based on his 
</p>
<p>experience, there needed to be a broader embracing of the principle of anti-discrimination. 
</p>
<p>Given the present day challenges faced by African-Americans as evidenced in the recent 
</p>
<p>situation in Ferguson, Missouri, he stated that there remained significant challenges and 
</p>
<p>problems to be addressed, in spite of there being legislation in place. He stated that the fight 
</p>
<p>against racial discrimination could not be won by lawyers but rather by politicians, and 
</p>
<p>gave the example of Gandhi and Mandela, who despite being lawyers, were politicians who 
</p>
<p>believed in equality and justice. According to Mr. Shaw, the backlash against affirmative 
</p>
<p>action measures has been due to racial discrimination and the inability of people to deal 
</p>
<p>with a long legacy of racism and to speak about it, by trying to leave it behind, including by 
</p>
<p>ignoring what is an unpleasant part of a country&#8217;s history. It is also a challenge to maintain 
</p>
<p>affirmative action policies and programmes, as opportunity was often seen as a zero sum 
</p>
<p>game. In conclusion, he gave a brief account of how the NAACP Legal Defense Fund had 
</p>
<p>become the model for legal defence groups worldwide from its early days in the fight 
</p>
<p>against racial discrimination.  
</p>
<p>59. At the 8th meeting on 10 October, Ms. Elisa Alonso Mon&#231;ores, Researcher at the 
</p>
<p>Instituto de Economia/UFRJ in Brazil gave a presentation on &#8220;Affirmative actions in 
</p>
<p>Brazil: Recent experience and social indicators&#8221;. The expert noted that her data stemmed 
</p>
<p>from LAESER, a research group of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), 
</p>
<p>working on race relations in Brazil (www.laeser.ie.ufrj.br).  
</p>
<p>60. She noted that Brazil had the second largest population of people of African descent 
</p>
<p>in the world (after Nigeria) and the biggest &#8221;Afrodescendiente&#8221; population in the Americas. 
</p>
<p>In the 2010 national census, 96.8 million Brazilians self-declared themselves as 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Afrodescendientes&#8221;, representing 50,7 per cent of the total population. Brazil&#8217;s affirmative 
</p>
<p>action policies were focused on the educational sector and access to public universities. She 
</p>
<p>noted that over a period of time, the country&#8217;s illiteracy rate had steadily declined; 
</p>
<p>nevertheless, the comparative rates of illiteracy for &#8220;Afrodescendants&#8221; and whites remained 
</p>
<p>highly unequal. In recent decades, there had been a pronounced increase in the average 
</p>
<p>years of education for both people of African descent and the white population. 
</p>
<p>61. Ms. Mon&#231;ores pointed out that generally there were more white students in private 
</p>
<p>and public universities and at private schools. Private schools were considered of higher 
</p>
<p>quality, whereas public universities were perceived as offering the best education. In 2013, 
</p>
<p>statistics highlighted that 89.3 per cent of young &#8220;Afrodescendants&#8221; (between 18-24) were 
</p>
<p>not attending university.  
</p>
<p>62. The expert explained that Law No. 12,711/2012, adopted in August of 2012 was the 
</p>
<p>basis for affirmative action policies in Brazil. She noted that fifty per cent of all student 
</p>
<p>slots at the public universities were reserved for people of African descent, and the 
</p>
<p>remaining fifty per cent were subject to competition. This corresponded to the latest census 
</p>
<p>of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). She added that as yet there 
</p>
<p>was no affirmative action law with respect to the labour market. Draft Law 6783/13 had 
</p>
<p>passed the House of Representatives on March 26th 2014 and was still pending in the 
</p>
<p>Senate, reserving twenty per cent of public service posts for people of African descent. This 
</p>
<p>Law would not apply to the legislature and the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>63. During the interactive discussion, the representative of Italy noted that the data 
</p>
<p>presented by the expert did not indicate specific reasons for discrimination, as the 
</p>
<p>discrimination and inequalities in access to university education could be attributed to race 
</p>
<p>as well as to other socio-economic factors. The delegate inquired whether affirmative action 
</p>
<p>policies of the State applied to poor white people in Brazil, and highlighted the problems 
</p>
<p>faced by some European countries in the collection of disaggregated data.  </p>


<p>64. Mexico requested data on the number of people of African descent and the delegate 
</p>
<p>of the Republic of South Africa inquired about how long the affirmative action measures 
</p>
<p>taken by Brazil would be kept in place, and what event or development had triggered the 
</p>
<p>initiation of the affirmative action policies.  
</p>
<p>65. Responding to a question from the delegate of the Republic of South Africa about 
</p>
<p>the efficiency of affirmative action, the expert noted that the impact of affirmative action 
</p>
<p>had not yet been assessed in Brazil. She explained that graduates that had entered through 
</p>
<p>the quota system attained lesser results than their peers upon entering university. During the 
</p>
<p>course of their studies, they would often adapt to the new environment and would graduate 
</p>
<p>in greater numbers compared to other students. In general, she noted that it was important 
</p>
<p>to promote education. A smaller number of people of African descent graduated from high 
</p>
<p>school; therefore, fewer people of African descent could attend university. However, as 
</p>
<p>society underwent changes and the level of education among the general population (which 
</p>
<p>was to a large degree of African descent) increased, that problem would decrease. She 
</p>
<p>added that the overall efficiency of affirmative action would be studied during the next ten 
</p>
<p>years. 
</p>
<p>66. The representative of Morocco asked about lessons learned which could be 
</p>
<p>replicated elsewhere and inquired about why affirmative action policies focused only on 
</p>
<p>people of African descent, while it appeared that indigenous populations were not included. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Mon&#231;ores noted that the indigenous population was much smaller, whereas people of 
</p>
<p>African descent represented more than half of the country&#8217;s population. Her research group 
</p>
<p>studied people of African descent, as research issues concerning the indigenous population 
</p>
<p>were &#8220;complex&#8221;. She noted that it was not common in Brazil to integrate the study of both 
</p>
<p>groups and that quotas were introduced for both groups. 
</p>
<p>67. Answering a question from the South African representative, the expert provided 
</p>
<p>some context and noted that plans for introducing affirmative action policies had 
</p>
<p>commenced in 2003. She explained that affirmative action was supported by the strong 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Black movement&#8221; which had been mobilized in the lead up to the Durban Word 
</p>
<p>Conference against Racism. The delegate added that Brazil was never a true racial 
</p>
<p>democracy, and that indeed strong racism existed not far below the surface. The 
</p>
<p>implementation of affirmative action policies had resulted in more open discussions about 
</p>
<p>race and racism in Brazilian society.  
</p>
<p>68. The Brazilian representative added that the history of racism in Brazil was 
</p>
<p>characterized by invisibility. In the 1980s, the country still reported to CERD that there was 
</p>
<p>no racism in Brazil. That attitude had changed after the process of democratization. People 
</p>
<p>of African descent were very well organized and Brazil featured a Ministry for Racial 
</p>
<p>Equality. The representative noted that the Durban World Conference against Racism and 
</p>
<p>the subsequent processes were essential to the developments in the country. Some questions 
</p>
<p>were complicated, such as how to correctly address the linkages between socio-economic 
</p>
<p>status and race.  
</p>
<p>69. The delegate of Mexico inquired about the labour market, and the expert noted that 
</p>
<p>some federal states had introduced quotas for public service &#8211; but that was not yet the case 
</p>
<p>at the federal level. Currently, more white people served in the public service than people of 
</p>
<p>African descent (approximately 60 per cent of the public service consists of white civil 
</p>
<p>servants). 
</p>
<p>70. The representative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela noted that similar 
</p>
<p>problems existed in other countries of the region, which shared a similar history and same 
</p>
<p>context pertaining to racism. He noted that the mandate of the Working Group of Experts 
</p>
<p>on People of African Descent had been focused on precisely those issues noted in the 
</p>
<p>expert&#8217;s presentation. He mentioned that his country supported the policies presented by the </p>


<p>expert. The representative of Uruguay also noted that the situation was similar in Uruguay. 
</p>
<p>Affirmative action also existed, though only ten per cent of the population were of African 
</p>
<p>descent. The law in Uruguay focused more on public service than the educational sector. 
</p>
<p>The two countries were however, exchanging information regarding their experiences in 
</p>
<p>that area. The representative also asked if Brazil had encountered the problem of &#8220;filling 
</p>
<p>quotas&#8221;. The expert replied that that was sometimes the case. Certain quotas existed (such 
</p>
<p>as a 30 per cent quota for female parliamentarians), but there were not enough women 
</p>
<p>parliamentarians to fill that quota.  
</p>
<p>71. The Chairperson-Rapporteur noted that according to the expert&#8217;s presentation, 
</p>
<p>students who were disadvantaged in early life could do well later in life. He inquired if that 
</p>
<p>meant that they would also have better employment opportunities and if so, were they 
</p>
<p>consequently better integrated in society. The Chairperson-Rapporteur also asked if some 
</p>
<p>structural analysis had been undertaken and if the question of class and race been looked at 
</p>
<p>in order to create upward mobility in Brazilian society. The expert answered that the 
</p>
<p>integration of those who had benefitted from special measures in society had yet to been 
</p>
<p>studied. She expressed some caution about the assessing the intersection between class and 
</p>
<p>race, in terms of an economic analysis. There was a strong linkage between various factors 
</p>
<p>that could lead to discrimination, such as social class, economic status and race. She 
</p>
<p>underlined the fact that all aspects were of importance and that economic models had 
</p>
<p>difficulties isolating for the impact of these various social factors. Professor Shaw added 
</p>
<p>that race and class were indeed very often interlinked, noting that inequality was on the rise, 
</p>
<p>on the global level as well as within certain countries. He stated that the increasing 
</p>
<p>inequality had already reached crisis proportions tearing apart the social fabric in some 
</p>
<p>countries.  
</p>
<p>72. The representative of Ghana pointed out that many historical and current conflicts 
</p>
<p>were not fought among people of different racial backgrounds, but that conflicts were 
</p>
<p>regularly sustained by the perception of superiority of one or both sides to the conflict. The 
</p>
<p>representative noted that respect for the individual must always be the cornerstone of any 
</p>
<p>policy. He also expressed support for the work of the Committee in contributing to the topic 
</p>
<p>of racism and sport.  
</p>
<p>73. On 13 October, during the 9th meeting, Ms. Dimitrina Petrova, Executive Director 
</p>
<p>of the Equal Rights Trust gave a presentation on Special Measures, including affirmative or 
</p>
<p>positive measures, strategies or actions, to prevent, combat and eradicate all forms and 
</p>
<p>manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</p>
<p>74. She introduced the concept of a unified human rights framework on equality which 
</p>
<p>offered a holistic approach, recognizing both the uniqueness of each different type of 
</p>
<p>inequality and the overarching aspects of different inequalities. The unified framework 
</p>
<p>brought together: a) types of inequalities based on different grounds, such as race, gender, 
</p>
<p>religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation and gender identity, among others 
</p>
<p>b) types of inequalities in different areas of civil, political, social, cultural and economic 
</p>
<p>life, including employment, education and the provision of goods and services and c) status 
</p>
<p>inequalities and socio-economic inequalities. This conceptual framework was expressed in 
</p>
<p>the Declaration of Principles on Equality adopted at an expert meeting in 2008 and 
</p>
<p>subsequently endorsed by various experts and activists on equality and human rights from 
</p>
<p>around the world.  
</p>
<p>75. She explained that, in her view, the synonymous concepts of special measures, 
</p>
<p>affirmative action and positive action should be seen in the light of the modern 
</p>
<p>understanding of non-discrimination and equality as legal rights. As such, positive action is 
</p>
<p>a necessary element of the right to equality. But it was very important to note the growing 
</p>
<p>trend of interpreting &#8220;special measures&#8221; as part of, rather than an exception to, equal 
</p>
<p>treatment. For example, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against </p>


<p>Women (CEDAW) in its General Recommendation No. 25 stated that under the 
</p>
<p>Convention, temporary special measures &#8220;should target discriminatory dimensions of past 
</p>
<p>and current societal and cultural contexts which impede women&#8217;s enjoyment of their human 
</p>
<p>rights and fundamental freedoms.&#8221; The notion of positive action should be similarly applied 
</p>
<p>in the context of the rights to race-based equality and non-discrimination protected by the 
</p>
<p>ICERD. The CERD General Recommendation No. 32 went a long way toward defining 
</p>
<p>special measures as mandatory in a substantive equality paradigm, departing decisively 
</p>
<p>from interpreting them as a supplementary afterthought. Having identified patterns of 
</p>
<p>substantive inequality, including on the grounds of race, ethnicity and nationality, States 
</p>
<p>should be required to take positive action measures to address them. 
</p>
<p>76. Special measures could be classified into different categories according to the 
</p>
<p>purpose, or the compelling public interest they satisfy. She outlined different typologies of 
</p>
<p>special measures identified both in the academic literature and in legislation. Professor 
</p>
<p>Christopher McCrudden had identified five different types of affirmative action: 
</p>
<p>(i) eradication of practices that have the effect of disadvantaging a particular group, such as 
</p>
<p>a word-of-mouth hiring; (ii) policies that seek to increase the proportion of members of a 
</p>
<p>previously excluded or under-represented group; (iii) outreach programmes, designed to 
</p>
<p>attract members of under-represented groups; (iv) preferential treatment, or reverse 
</p>
<p>discrimination in favour of a certain group; (v) redefining merit by altering the 
</p>
<p>qualifications necessary for a post so as to encourage recruitment or promotion of members 
</p>
<p>of a disadvantaged group. It should be noted, however, that &#8220;reverse discrimination&#8221; was 
</p>
<p>increasingly excluded from the scope of legitimate special measures, as was the 
</p>
<p>synonymous &#8220;positive discrimination&#8221; &#8211; justly described by CERD as a contradiction in 
</p>
<p>terms. 
</p>
<p>77. She added that the countries which have significant experience in applying positive 
</p>
<p>action measures included Canada, South Africa, some of the Member States of the 
</p>
<p>European Union, the USA, and India. But there were also cautionary tales, such as 
</p>
<p>Malaysian experience, where measures seemingly developed into entrenched privileges. 
</p>
<p>78. She recommended that: (i) UN mandate holders should engage in an effort to 
</p>
<p>consolidate, harmonize and update the international human rights framework related to 
</p>
<p>equality, in order to position special measures/positive action in the new, holistic legal 
</p>
<p>framework, which was capable of reflecting both the overarching aspects and the &#8220;inter-
</p>
<p>sectionalities&#8221; of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance with all 
</p>
<p>other forms of bias and discrimination; and (ii) UN mandate holders, particularly the treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies, should issue interpretative guidance to construe the denial of special measures as a 
</p>
<p>form of discrimination, by analogy with the denial of reasonable accommodation in CRPD. 
</p>
<p>The lack of positive action (also known as affirmative action or special measures) to 
</p>
<p>overcome past disadvantage and accelerate progress towards equality of particular groups 
</p>
<p>could constitute a violation of the right to non-discrimination or the right to equality. She 
</p>
<p>explained that was not a new standard, but simply a corollary of the recognition of special 
</p>
<p>measures as a necessary part of the right to non-discrimination, and of their mandatory 
</p>
<p>character (the expert referenced CERD General Recommendation 32, paras. 20 and 30). 
</p>
<p>Positive action measures were most commonly used to promote equality within the ambit of 
</p>
<p>socio-economic rights such as, for example, education, work, housing or health. Examples 
</p>
<p>included the recognition of special protection and special consideration to the needs of the 
</p>
<p>Roma due to their different lifestyle (<i>Orsus v. Croatia</i>, European Court of Human Rights). 
</p>
<p>79. She noted that, in her view there were no significant substantive nor procedural gaps 
</p>
<p>in the international human rights legal system related to special measures. Rather there was: 
</p>
<p>(i) a need to update, harmonise and unify the international legal framework related to 
</p>
<p>equality, and (ii) a need to fill certain interpretative gaps, and provide guidance on certain 
</p>
<p>aspects of &#8220;special measures&#8221;, including through explicit recognition that the denial of </p>


<p>special measures, where they were mandatory (in order to realise the rights to non-
</p>
<p>discrimination and equality) constituted a form of discrimination. 
</p>
<p>80. During the discussion that followed, Brazil recalled efforts in Latin America to 
</p>
<p>consolidate the laws on discrimination. Countries aimed, under the OAS umbrella, at 
</p>
<p>drafting one convention that would encompass all forms of discrimination. As there was no 
</p>
<p>consensus on some questions, two conventions were drafted and adopted as a solution. The 
</p>
<p>representative of Brazil also asked if new norms on special measures were needed.  
</p>
<p>81. Ms. Petrova responded that while she saw no substantive or procedural gaps in the 
</p>
<p>existing legal framework, there may be a need for further interpretation on how special 
</p>
<p>measures and equality were related. Such an &#8220;interpretation gap&#8221; could be addressed in the 
</p>
<p>form of another general recommendation by the CERD. 
</p>
<p>82. The representative of Morocco asked if the existing analysis of special measures in a 
</p>
<p>number of countries could be compiled in one study. The expert noted that such 
</p>
<p>compilation was possible, however its value would be hard to assess, as there was no 
</p>
<p>rigorous quantitative assessment on the efficiency of special measures. That lack of 
</p>
<p>quantitative assessment was also due to a lack of reliable statistics and in many regions, 
</p>
<p>statistics on ethnicity were very controversial. There were also issues concerning data 
</p>
<p>protection, as well as the quality of existing statistics was at doubt. Countries often used 
</p>
<p>self-identification in order to determine ethnicity, which could be very insufficient; and it 
</p>
<p>was not clear if data were comparable across borders.  
</p>
<p>83. Asked about her personal assessment of quotas, Ms. Petrova noted that she was not 
</p>
<p>in support of them, as they often created more problems than benefits. In her view, it was 
</p>
<p>advisable to empower people, through outreach programmes, clear targeting initiatives, 
</p>
<p>mainstreaming and other measures, than to introduce quotas.  
</p>
<p>84. The representative of the United States noted that special measures needed to fit the 
</p>
<p>local context and that consequently a certain amount of State discretion was required. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Petrova replied that the best bodies for assessing the validity of special measures were 
</p>
<p>the courts. It should be kept in mind that special measures were always purpose-driven, and 
</p>
<p>designed for a specific purpose.  
</p>
<p>85. The Chairperson-Rapporteur noted that in many countries the group facing 
</p>
<p>discrimination was in the minority; however, there were other countries such as South 
</p>
<p>Africa or Brazil were those that were subject to discrimination were the majority of the 
</p>
<p>population. The expert noted that the key issue was that of disadvantage, rather than the 
</p>
<p>proportion of the population. With the development of equality law, the empowerment of 
</p>
<p>the weakest had increasingly become the purpose of this law. In her view, the trend was 
</p>
<p>moving in the direction of transformative equality and protection of the weaker members of 
</p>
<p>society. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Summary of the expert presentation and initial discussion on the topic 
</b></p>
<p>of &#8220;Establishment, designation or maintaining of national mechanisms 
<b>with competences to protect against and prevent all forms and 
</b></p>
<p><b>manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
</b></p>
<p>intolerance&#8221; <b> 
</b></p>
<p>86. At the 10th meeting on 13 October, Mr. Pedro Mouratian, President, Instituto 
</p>
<p>Nacional contra la Discriminaci&#243;n, la Xenofobia y el Racismo (INADI), Argentina, briefed 
</p>
<p>the Committee on the work of his organization under the topic of &#8220;National mechanisms&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Mouratian noted that the institute was one of few specialized bodies in the region of 
</p>
<p>Latin America. It was founded in 1995 pursuant to the Law on National Institution against </p>


<p>Racism. He added that INADI&#8217;s history is strongly linked to the Durban process, during 
</p>
<p>which Argentina committed to drawing up a national plan against racism. Since the 
</p>
<p>inception of that plan, equality had become a cross-cutting policy issue in Argentina.  
</p>
<p>87. He explained that INADI was a decentralized organization, present in all of 
</p>
<p>Argentina&#8217;s provinces and had a staff of 470 civil servants working full time.. It was 
</p>
<p>governed by an advisory body (10 representatives of civil society) and a board (that also 
</p>
<p>included representatives of the States and civil society). While the president and the vice 
</p>
<p>president were nominated by parliament, INADI, although a state institution enjoyed 
</p>
<p>considerable independence and had its own budget. Working under the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Secretariat, the institute focused on two issues: i) the substantive matters of discrimination; 
</p>
<p>and ii) the receipt of complaints, that were followed up by the delivery of opinions. He 
</p>
<p>underscored the fact that INADI had cross-cutting mandate &#8211; addressing many areas of life.  
</p>
<p>88. The goal of INADI was to change societal behaviour which has a human rights or 
</p>
<p>discriminatory approach and that its substantive work was directed at the promotion of 
</p>
<p>equality. The institute cooperated closely with civil society organizations that fought 
</p>
<p>discrimination and it also coordinated civil society networks. The institute also monitored 
</p>
<p>legislative proposals. He cited three laws as particularly noteworthy: The 2004 Migration 
</p>
<p>Act, the Equal Marriage Act, and the General Equality Act.  
</p>
<p>89. He underscored the fact that every kind of discrimination was considered a State 
</p>
<p>matter in Argentina, and that INADI was consulted on bills before their submission to 
</p>
<p>Parliament. He also highlighted INADI&#8217;s work in the area of awareness-raising, including 
</p>
<p>specialized materials which integrated non-discriminatory practices. Mr. Mouratian also 
</p>
<p>commented on the issue of invisibility of people of African descent in Argentina, noting 
</p>
<p>that these communities although historically large in number, now were a much smaller 
</p>
<p>population, often hidden from view. He stated that the national institution for statistics and 
</p>
<p>the national census were gathering statistics and those measures were aimed at awareness-
</p>
<p>raising and to reaching these communities which had been victims of serious discrimination 
</p>
<p>over the centuries. 
</p>
<p>90. Mr. Mouratian told delegates that one of the problematic issues in Argentina was 
</p>
<p>discrimination in football and that INADI was targeting it by observing football matches. 
</p>
<p>INADI also conducted awareness-raising campaigns together with UNICEF and cooperated 
</p>
<p>with sports journalists to spread anti-discrimination messages. He explained that this work 
</p>
<p>was proving successful. In 2010, one third of all football matches had to be suspended due 
</p>
<p>to discrimination and xenophobia, while now only one of six matches was suspended.  
</p>
<p>91. During the discussion which followed, Pakistan inquired whether guidelines or 
</p>
<p>complementary standards at the international level were required to achieve uniformity of 
</p>
<p>objectives so that countries had a standard by which to assess their national situation. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Mouratian noted that each country was different, that there were many laws already in 
</p>
<p>place, and that was important to use those laws and conventions in order to promote 
</p>
<p>national legislation.  
</p>
<p>92. Further to Mr. Mouratian&#8217;s presentation, the European Union underscored its full 
</p>
<p>commitment to the rights of LGBT persons and recognized the important role played by 
</p>
<p>civil society in this regard. The delegate further stressed the importance of national 
</p>
<p>mechanisms and inquired if guidelines for setting up new national mechanisms would be 
</p>
<p>useful. Mr. Mouratian agreed that national mechanisms were of importance, acknowledged 
</p>
<p>the UN&#8217;s role in assisting the creation of such institutions and national plans, and also 
</p>
<p>emphasised the importance of networking among those institutions to create synergies and 
</p>
<p>exchange experiences. 
</p>
<p>93. Asked about the role of the media by the European Union, Mr. Mouratian noted that 
</p>
<p>the media played a key role in awareness-raising; however, media outlets could also create </p>


<p>stigmatization and confirm societal prejudices. INADI consequently published handbooks 
</p>
<p>for journalists to avoid such stereotyping, and it also observed national broadcasting in 
</p>
<p>order to analyse media content and issue recommendations. He underlined that in doing so, 
</p>
<p>INADI was careful to avoid any infringements on the independence of media and the 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression and opinion.  
</p>
<p>94. The delegate of Morocco inquired about the division of labour between INADI and 
</p>
<p>the Ombudsman of Argentina. Mr. Mouratian explained that the Ombudsman, created 
</p>
<p>following constitutional reform, had the main task of follow-up on individual complaints. 
</p>
<p>While INADI and the Ombudsman cooperated on a number of issues, issues related to 
</p>
<p>discrimination were automatically referred to INADI.  
</p>
<p>95. The representative of Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela noted that INADI was 
</p>
<p>setting a good example in the region. Venezuela had been learning from these good 
</p>
<p>practices, and would soon be joining the network of national mechanisms to improve 
</p>
<p>institutional cooperation and the exchange of experiences. The representative 
</p>
<p>acknowledged the issue of racism in sport, supported further cooperation in that area, and 
</p>
<p>fully supported the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee to draw up international standards.  
</p>
<p>96. Brazil acknowledged its national-level cooperation with INADI, noting that several 
</p>
<p>institutions for the promotion of racial equality, such as the SEPPIR existed in Brazil but 
</p>
<p>pointed out that despite the close cooperation the two institutions also differed, in that they 
</p>
<p>served different societies, with different populations. Brazil faced similar challenges 
</p>
<p>regarding sports and football, as there were episodes of racism at Brazilian matches. A 
</p>
<p>major team was expelled from national competition due to actions of supporters of that 
</p>
<p>team. The delegate suggested that the Committee could further discuss this topic as a 
</p>
<p>theme, and while perhaps not elaborate a standard, guidelines or plan of action could be 
</p>
<p>considered.  
</p>
<p>97. A representative of the non-governmental organization &#8220;African Reporters for 
</p>
<p>defence of human rights&#8221; complimented INADI for its work and noted that it was important 
</p>
<p>for people of African descent to find their place in Argentinian society. The 1
st
 of January 
</p>
<p>2015 marked the beginning of the Decade for People of African Descent, and he asked the 
</p>
<p>expert to elaborate on any cases of discrimination that he had handled involving people of 
</p>
<p>African descent. Mr. Mouratian replied that he had handled several such cases, highlighting 
</p>
<p>the case of an Argentinian of African descent returning to Argentina with a valid passport, 
</p>
<p>detained by immigrations officials who did not realize that there were Argentinians of 
</p>
<p>African descent. 
</p>
<p>98. A representative of the non-governmental organization &#8220;Indian Council of South 
</p>
<p>America&#8221; inquired about INADI activities to address issues concerning racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination and violations of the right of self-determination of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Mouratian replied that Argentina had taken steps to acknowledge its indigenous 
</p>
<p>heritage. The 2006 Law on Expropriation of Land was an example in that regard, as it was 
</p>
<p>an attempt to change the culture of the country.  
</p>
<p>99. The representative of Chile requested more information regarding the suspension of 
</p>
<p>football matches, and inquired how INADI convinced football leagues to join human rights 
</p>
<p>campaigns. The expert noted that discrimination in football was widespread, and confirmed 
</p>
<p>that it was important to work with associations, and noting he importance of political 
</p>
<p>decisions in that regard. In addition, cooperation with international agencies, such as 
</p>
<p>UNICEF, was highly important and was responsible for good results.  
</p>
<p>100. In answer to questions from Morocco, the expert noted that INADI currently had 23 
</p>
<p>provincial offices in addition to its headquarters in Buenos Aires. He explained that 
</p>
<p>resources were distributed according to needs in the country based on where discrimination 
</p>
<p>was particularly prominent. </p>


<p><b> D. Summary of the expert presentation and initial discussion on the topic 
</b></p>
<p>of &#8220;Xenophobia&#8221; <b> 
</b></p>
<p>101. The topic of &#8220;Xenophobia&#8221; was discussed at the 11th meeting on 14 October. A 
</p>
<p>presentation was made by Mr. Ioannis Dimitrakopoulos, Head of the Equality and Citizen&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Rights Department at the EU Fundamental Rights Agency. He provided an overview of the 
</p>
<p>work of the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), which is a body of the European Union, 
</p>
<p>created in 2007. He stated that FRA undertakes data collection and analysis to assist EU 
</p>
<p>institutions and Member States in their efforts, as duty bearers, to comply to European and 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards reflected in the EU treaties and the EU Charter of 
</p>
<p>Fundamental Rights. 
</p>
<p>102. He explained that the Agency&#8217;s mandate was to collect reliable, comprehensive and 
</p>
<p>comparable data through a series of EU-wide surveys on discrimination and hate crime by 
</p>
<p>interviewing large random samples of different target populations. The surveys target 
</p>
<p>specific population groups, such as migrants and minorities, and select random samples 
</p>
<p>who are asked how they are treated, if they experience discrimination and intolerance, and 
</p>
<p>if their human rights are fulfilled. The surveys gave individual rights holders a voice 
</p>
<p>through FRA reports which reach decision and policy makers, assisting the development of 
</p>
<p>evidence-based legal and policy responses. 
</p>
<p>103. He pointed out that data published by law enforcement agencies and criminal justice 
</p>
<p>systems in the EU Member States show great fluctuation between 2011 and 2012 in 
</p>
<p>officially recorded crime in the EU with racist, xenophobic, anti-Roma, anti-Semitic or 
</p>
<p>Islamophobic/anti-Muslim motives. In some countries there was a decrease in officially 
</p>
<p>recorded racist crimes, while an increase of the same in other countries. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Dimitrakopoulos noted that official data are not comparable, as they are collected using 
</p>
<p>different methodologies, they are also not always comprehensive and cannot show the full 
</p>
<p>extent of the problem, as hate crime tends to be both under-reported and under-recorded. 
</p>
<p>104. Mr. Dimitrakopoulos highlighted the fact that the results of large-scale surveys 
</p>
<p>carried out by FRA, which target specific population groups, show that hate crime and 
</p>
<p>discrimination remain a problem for a sizeable proportion of respondents. At the same time, 
</p>
<p>the results also show that victims and witnesses of such crimes and discriminatory 
</p>
<p>treatment often do not report, to law enforcement, the criminal justice system, other 
</p>
<p>competent public bodies, NGOs or victim support groups. Between 57% and 74% of 
</p>
<p>incidents of assault or threats experienced by members of minority or migrant groups 
</p>
<p>surveyed in the EU were not reported to the police. He said that the main reasons for non-
</p>
<p>reporting for all these respondents include that &#8220;nothing would change&#8221; by reporting 
</p>
<p>incidents, that &#8220;such incidents happen all the time&#8221;, and that they &#8220;did not trust the police&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>105. In order to tackle the problem of hate crime, the EU has put in place a broad set of 
</p>
<p>legal and policy measures, including criminal legislation penalizing public incitement to 
</p>
<p>violence or hatred on the basis of race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin; 
</p>
<p>legislation prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin and religion; 
</p>
<p>and also the provision of financial support to address racism, xenophobia, and related 
</p>
<p>intolerance through financial instruments, such as the Fundamental Rights and Citizenship 
</p>
<p>Programme and the Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity. In 2012, a directive 
</p>
<p>establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime 
</p>
<p>required individual assessments to take into account personal characteristics of the victim, 
</p>
<p>including ethnicity, race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, residence status, and 
</p>
<p>gender identity or expression. The assessments should also take account of whether it is a 
</p>
<p>hate crime, or a crime committed with a discriminatory motive.  </p>


<p>106. He stated that these responses are apparently not sufficient. At the level of 
</p>
<p>legislation, hate crime should recognize the motivations underlying it and the effect it has 
</p>
<p>on victims. At the policy level, this means implementing policies that will lead to collecting 
</p>
<p>reliable data on hate crime that would record, at a minimum, the number of incidents of 
</p>
<p>hate crime reported by the public and recorded by the authorities; the number of 
</p>
<p>convictions of offenders; the grounds on which these offences were found to be 
</p>
<p>discriminatory; and the punishments issued to offenders. This should be supplemented by 
</p>
<p>practical mechanisms to encourage victims and witnesses to report incidents of hate crime, 
</p>
<p>as well as mechanisms that would show that authorities are taking hate crime seriously. He 
</p>
<p>noted that the Fundamental Rights Agency has recently been asked to work together with 
</p>
<p>Member States, at their request, to assist them in efforts to develop effective methods to 
</p>
<p>encourage reporting and ensure proper recording of hate crimes.  
</p>
<p>107. According to the speaker, what is currently necessary, in the EU context, is not 
</p>
<p>additional legal standards, but rather the implementation of existing standards and effective 
</p>
<p>monitoring. The FRA seeks to achieve this by developing specific indicators based on the 
</p>
<p>model developed by the OHCHR, for measuring implementation of human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>He said that in future, FRA will work on indicators concerning racism, xenophobia and 
</p>
<p>related intolerance focusing on hate crime. He stated that indicators are neither designed, 
</p>
<p>nor suitable for, ranking Member States, but that their objective is to highlight the norms 
</p>
<p>and principles of fundamental rights enshrined in the EU treaties and translate these into 
</p>
<p>contextually relevant indicators for implementing and measuring progress made at national 
</p>
<p>level. He suggested that developing such indicators and populating them with data can 
</p>
<p>contribute decisively in promoting human rights standards by strengthening accountability 
</p>
<p>and empowering those most vulnerable and marginalized. 
</p>
<p>108. The delegate of Pakistan, on behalf of Organization for Islamic Cooperation, stated 
</p>
<p>that there has been an increase in religious intolerance and discrimination in many parts of 
</p>
<p>the world, and asked the speaker to elaborate on concrete steps taken by the FRA to curb 
</p>
<p>religious intolerance and discrimination in European Union Member States. With regard to 
</p>
<p>the collection of data, the delegate inquired about evidence regarding incitement to 
</p>
<p>imminent violence.  
</p>
<p>109. The representative of the USA requested additional information on quantitative 
</p>
<p>indicators, including their usefulness, advantages and limitations.  
</p>
<p>110. The delegate of the Republic of South Africa, on behalf of the African Group, 
</p>
<p>pointed out that the speaker&#8217;s comment on the need for complementary standards was a 
</p>
<p>moot point, as the World Conference against Racism in Durban had already identified a 
</p>
<p>need to elaborate complementary standards, in the form of an additional protocol or a 
</p>
<p>convention, and that now the question was how this would occur.  
</p>
<p>111. In his reply to the delegates&#8217; questions, Mr. Dimitrakopoulos emphasized that the 
</p>
<p>FRA applies existing definitions, as it is not a standard-setting institution. He noted that 
</p>
<p>during the FRA&#8217;s surveys rights-holders are questioned directly, through a detailed 
</p>
<p>questionnaire which asks them whether they had experienced unequal treatment, rather 
</p>
<p>their general views on the subject matter. With regard to religious intolerance, the presenter 
</p>
<p>said that the survey respondents sometimes were not able to distinguish whether the 
</p>
<p>discrimination they faced was ethnic, racial or religious discrimination. He said that in 
</p>
<p>2009, the FRA published a report analysing the survey data of Muslim respondents and in 
</p>
<p>2012, a FRA survey focused on Jewish people living in nine EU Member States. He 
</p>
<p>cautioned that a survey is a snapshot at time, and therefore FRA is committed to repeat 
</p>
<p>surveys over a regular period of time to identify trends. These trends allow Governments to 
</p>
<p>target their measures more efficiently. He also said that developing indicators is not an easy 
</p>
<p>task, however, measurement of factors tends to attract notice. He stated that human rights 
</p>
<p>implementation is measurable. </p>


<p>112. The representative of Morocco stated that anti-discrimination policies often failed to 
</p>
<p>materialize at two levels, in EU Member States and in the European Union Commission 
</p>
<p>and he inquired about whether there were issues of political will or differences across 
</p>
<p>Member States. The delegate added that the Rabat Plan of Action could be a blueprint for 
</p>
<p>OHCHR action in the area of incitement to racial, national and religious hatred and asked 
</p>
<p>whether the FRA incorporated the Plan in its work.  
</p>
<p>113. The EU stated that the FRA produces reliable and comparable data, helping the EU 
</p>
<p>institutions and Member States at the national and regional level and its work is transparent 
</p>
<p>and publicly available. It was noted that racism is a global issue, affecting every society and 
</p>
<p>country everywhere in the world, and urged other regions to share similar experiences with 
</p>
<p>regard to data collection.  
</p>
<p>114. The United States of America highlighted the fact that there is no need for new 
</p>
<p>standards, rather better implementation of existing standards was required. With reference 
</p>
<p>to LGBT issues, the delegate also requested information about how the FRA decided which 
</p>
<p>specific grounds would be covered in their survey and data collection work, and whether it 
</p>
<p>was on the basis of European Union law or regulation.  
</p>
<p>115. The delegate of Pakistan, on behalf of the OIC, stated that religious intolerance in 
</p>
<p>many parts of the world was increasing and emphasized that ICERD does not have a 
</p>
<p>definition of xenophobia, which created several loopholes in the existing standards.  
</p>
<p>116. The delegate of Algeria asked whether the FRA interacted with the European 
</p>
<p>Commission &#8220;European barometer work&#8221; and whether racial discrimination is considered in 
</p>
<p>those surveys. The delegate inquired how the European Charter was implemented on the 
</p>
<p>ground, and whether the FRA analysed the implications of case law related to xenophobia 
</p>
<p>and hate crime. Adding that preventative approaches, such as human rights education and 
</p>
<p>good practices are useful, there are, nonetheless, certain limits which require legal and 
</p>
<p>policy measures and that legal issues are part of a preventative approach. It was added that 
</p>
<p>when victims are forced to take their cases to the European Court of Human Rights, there is 
</p>
<p>likely a lack of protection.  
</p>
<p>117. In reply, the presenter noted that concerted and continuous efforts are required, 
</p>
<p>particularly in the area of education, as that is where young people learn how to live in 
</p>
<p>multicultural societies. He said that moving from a homogeneous to a multi-ethnic society 
</p>
<p>will take some time. He stated that the manifestation of Islamophobia varied, depending on 
</p>
<p>the Member State, and that there could be different reasons why Muslims would be treated 
</p>
<p>differently. The fact that victims could not distinguish between ethnic or religious 
</p>
<p>discrimination shows that they are intertwined. He noted that it is important to empower 
</p>
<p>victims to seek redress and improve the way police handle hate crimes. He added that 
</p>
<p>definitions could be discussed at length; however, it was important to see what people 
</p>
<p>experienced on the ground. In his view, there is sufficient case law that provides 
</p>
<p>definitions.  
</p>
<p>118. The delegate of Morocco highlighted the fact that perhaps victims were unable to 
</p>
<p>distinguish the exact grounds for the discrimination they faced because they faced multiple 
</p>
<p>forms of discrimination. He noted that surveys might not be the appropriate approach to 
</p>
<p>collect data about racial discrimination. He emphasized the need for victim-centred 
</p>
<p>approaches, as the victim of the discrimination might not be in a position to reply 
</p>
<p>adequately to the survey and that the understanding of a question, and hence the responses, 
</p>
<p>could change from one survey respondent to another. 
</p>
<p>119. The delegate of the Republic of South Africa pointed out that it had not been stated 
</p>
<p>that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance are necessarily 
</p>
<p>attributed to one particular region, and noted that the persistence of xenophobia is a 
</p>
<p>rejection of multiculturalism.  </p>


<p>120. The delegate of Pakistan, on behalf of the OIC, stated that only when a crime is 
</p>
<p>defined and identified could it be tackled in a comprehensive manner. If there is sufficient 
</p>
<p>case law, additional international standards would unify such evidence that could be applied 
</p>
<p>in all countries and not only in certain regions, and that these additional standards would 
</p>
<p>bring about significant changes.  
</p>
<p>121. The delegate of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela stated that there is a need for 
</p>
<p>additional standards as there is an increase of new forms of discrimination which must be 
</p>
<p>combated in a systematic and multi-fashioned level. He noted that there has been an 
</p>
<p>increase of incitement to hatred in recent times.  
</p>
<p>122. In his comments, Mr. Dimitrakopoulos stated that EU policies had come a long way 
</p>
<p>and pointed out that both policies and data are needed to guide policy makers, adding that it 
</p>
<p>the issue is not only protection on paper, but how it is translated in real practice. He 
</p>
<p>informed the meeting that victims&#8217; support services data are collected and available on the 
</p>
<p>website of the FRA for each Member State. The second wave of surveys, following up on 
</p>
<p>previous surveys should illustrate whether victims are willing to use and enforce their 
</p>
<p>rights. He noted that there is a certain fatigue as victims state that discrimination happens 
</p>
<p>repeatedly. He added that improved police training is necessary and in the EU context, it is 
</p>
<p>important to eliminate impunity and to monitor systematically the implementation of 
</p>
<p>existing standards. 
</p>
<p>123. The Chairperson-Rapporteur referred to historical experiences of slavery, 
</p>
<p>colonialism, apartheid, and the post-colonial period which occurred in many different 
</p>
<p>regions of the world, highlighting their impact on racial discrimination as it developed in 
</p>
<p>the 20th century and onward. He noted that the post-independence period and ensuing 
</p>
<p>immigration witnessed racism and racial discrimination in developed countries. He stated 
</p>
<p>that a victim was often a victim based solely on appearance, and highlighted instances of 
</p>
<p>racial profiling in different regions and locations, including airports. He added that for this 
</p>
<p>reason, surveys directed at victims did not always capture this dynamic or reveal the mind-
</p>
<p>set and mentality of perpetrators or violations. Therefore, surveys, such as those collected 
</p>
<p>by the FRA, should reflect perpetrators&#8217; viewpoints well. He also stated that survey results 
</p>
<p>could also seemingly highlight the lack of confidence in State structures and institutions. 
</p>
<p>He stated that at times, the value of drafting of new laws could represent a moral barometer, 
</p>
<p>telling society that certain behaviour will not be tolerated. The Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>inquired whether in addressing racial discrimination and xenophobia, the objective was to 
</p>
<p>eliminate racism, or just to reduce it, and inquired how far racism should be tolerated.  
</p>
<p>124. Mr. Dimitrakopoulos agreed that it would be useful to study the issue and profile of 
</p>
<p>perpetrators, especially since they are often thought to be bigots, racists and extremists 
</p>
<p>when in fact they are often regular people. There were good grounds to look at larger social 
</p>
<p>groups and how they manifest their political convictions. He underlined the importance of 
</p>
<p>victims and their right to seek redress and the necessity of building trust in order that 
</p>
<p>victims report crimes, so that the system can respond effectively. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Summary of the expert presentation and initial discussion on the topic 
</b></p>
<p>of &#8220;Procedural gaps to the ICERD&#8221; <b> 
</b></p>
<p>125. At the 13th meeting on 15 October, Mr. Anwar Kemal of the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Racial Discrimination, made a presentation on &#8220;Procedural Gaps with regard 
</p>
<p>to the ICERD.&#8221; He noted that CERD had been following the discussions of the Ad Hoc 
</p>
<p>Committee with keen interest, recalling that in previous sessions, CERD Committee 
</p>
<p>members Mr. Alexey Avtonomov and Ms. Fatimata Binta Dah had shared valuable insights 
</p>
<p>on the issue of procedural gaps; Mr. Patrick Thornberry interacted with the Ad Hoc </p>


<p>Committee on the subject of xenophobia; and Mr. Carlos Vazquez had presented on the 
</p>
<p>subject of special measures, just the week prior. Mr. Kemal recalled the 2007 study by 
</p>
<p>CERD (A/HRC/4/WG.3/7) which outlined possible measures to strengthen the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Convention, including a proposal to adopt an optional protocol to 
</p>
<p>provide for an inquiry procedure. He continued that Mr. Alexey Avtonomov, in his capacity 
</p>
<p>as CERD&#8217;s Chairperson had emphasized the fact that the Committee believes that the 
</p>
<p>substantive provisions of the ICERD are sufficient to combat racial discrimination in 
</p>
<p>contemporary conditions and that in the near future it ought to be able to address any 
</p>
<p>problems without amending the Convention, substantially.  
</p>
<p>126. He stated that Mr. Avtonomov had also suggested, however, the possibility of an 
</p>
<p>optional protocol to the Convention adopting procedures to make possible to undertake 
</p>
<p>country visits to selected countries for the purposes of investigating and evaluating the 
</p>
<p>situations. He concurred that implementation of the ICERD could be strengthened if 
</p>
<p>supported by the optional protocol to establish an inquiry procedure. Such an inquiry 
</p>
<p>procedure already existed for the Committee against Torture, CEDAW, the Committee on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Committee on Enforced Disappearances, the 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the Committee on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>the Child. He noted that ICERD, adopted almost 50 years ago, remained relevant to new 
</p>
<p>challenges faced today, and provided guidance on relevant and applicable standards owing 
</p>
<p>to its flexible working methods, including through days of discussion, adoption of general 
</p>
<p>recommendations, responding to urgent situations through early warning and urgent action 
</p>
<p>procedures.  
</p>
<p>127. Mr. Kemal further highlighted the important role of General Recommendations that 
</p>
<p>assist States Parties in interpreting the articles of the Convention and effectively 
</p>
<p>implementing their obligations. CERD had adopted 35 general recommendations, including 
</p>
<p>the most recent general recommendation on racist hate speech adopted in 2013. He stressed 
</p>
<p>the fact that the Committee had been able to apply the Convention effectively to address 
</p>
<p>new and emerging facts of discrimination based on race, colour, descent or national or 
</p>
<p>ethnic origin. He noted that the biggest obstacle to effectiveness was that a large number of 
</p>
<p>countries did not submit reports at all, or their reports were chronically overdue. The 
</p>
<p>second obstacle was the non-implementation of CERD&#8217;s recommendations, followed by the 
</p>
<p>third obstacle which are reservations to ICERD. 
</p>
<p>128. Mr. Kemal also noted that CERD did not deal with discrimination on the grounds of 
</p>
<p>religion. The Committee acted only if &#8220;intersectionality&#8221; were present. That meant that if 
</p>
<p>persons belonging to another racial or ethnic group were also discriminated against on 
</p>
<p>grounds of religion and gender &#8211; only then would such situation fall under CERD&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>competence. CERD was also active when it came to early warning and urgent action, 
</p>
<p>Mr. Kemal noted. CERD for example, adopted Decision 1(85) under its Early Warning and 
</p>
<p>Urgent Action Procedure responding to the current turmoil in Iraq. In that decision, CERD 
</p>
<p>denounced massacres and other human rights abuses by terrorist that called themselves 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Islamic State&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>129. Brazil (on behalf of Argentina, Armenia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea and Switzerland) stated that CERD&#8217;s views were central to discussing 
</p>
<p>procedural gaps with regard to the ICERD. These delegations were of the view that in order 
</p>
<p>to prevent and combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the 
</p>
<p>best use of the existing international instruments must be made, and the implementation at 
</p>
<p>national level (particularly the ICERD and the DDPA) secured. It recalled that Mr. Kemal 
</p>
<p>had stated that there were procedural gaps with regard to ICERD, in areas such as visits to 
</p>
<p>countries, evaluation and follow-up procedures. By dealing with these gaps, both the 
</p>
<p>implementation and monitoring of ICERD would be improved. This would also have 
</p>
<p>positive impacts on other the topics that had been discussed by the Committee, such as </p>


<p>prevention and human rights education, special measures, xenophobia and national 
</p>
<p>mechanisms. The presentation of Mr. Kemal had shown that the Ad Hoc Committee should 
</p>
<p>keep discussing the issue of procedural gaps and that there was clear room for 
</p>
<p>improvement. That idea had already been stressed by the &#8220;study of CERD on possible 
</p>
<p>measures to strengthen implementation through optimal recommendation or the update of 
</p>
<p>its monitoring procedures&#8221; in 2007. The group believed that the topic of procedural gaps 
</p>
<p>should be further discussed in future sessions of the Ad Hoc Committee, in order to find 
</p>
<p>ways to address those concretely. 
</p>
<p>130. The United States of America noted that Mr. Kemal proposed a protocol to ICERD 
</p>
<p>that would allow country visits. The representative asked if other treaties contained similar 
</p>
<p>provisions for country visits and how such visits would be organized. The expert noted that 
</p>
<p>other treaty bodies indeed used country visits. An improved inquiry procedure would be 
</p>
<p>beneficial to CERD as racism had become a global phenomenon and CERD would need to 
</p>
<p>inquire in various parts of the world. The expert explained that he was not in a position to 
</p>
<p>explain the &#8220;mechanics&#8221; of a country visit, and that CERD would rely on the Secretariat to 
</p>
<p>undertake work with regard to this issue when the need arose. He agreed that such visits 
</p>
<p>might be expensive if all members of CERD would decide to travel, but the Protocol could 
</p>
<p>be drafted in such a way to avoid this.  
</p>
<p>131. The representative of Uruguay asked if the article 14 procedure was used frequently 
</p>
<p>and if the procedure could be made more effective. Mr. Kemal explained that less than 60 
</p>
<p>countries had accepted the article 14 procedure and that CERD received very few 
</p>
<p>complaints on the basis of article 14. The procedure was not well-known, and individuals 
</p>
<p>might consider the procedure not worth the effort, or they might fear it. He added that many 
</p>
<p>complaints were, rejected because domestic remedies had not been exhausted. 
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, CERD might consider taking some action in order to support the victim, if 
</p>
<p>the Committee was of the opinion that the case had some merit.  
</p>
<p>132. Brazil inquired how CERD dealt with discrimination based on religion. The expert 
</p>
<p>noted that in his view sometimes religion could be linked to ethnicity, and the aspects of 
</p>
<p>ethnicity and religion became fused. CERD tended to treat issues of religious 
</p>
<p>discrimination on a case-by-case basis, and only if there were multiple aspects of 
</p>
<p>discrimination that were linked to ethnicity.  
</p>
<p>133. The delegate of Pakistan, on behalf of the OIC, reminded the Committee that a 2006 
</p>
<p>study noted that an optional protocol would be helpful. The representative asked Mr. Kemal 
</p>
<p>how the Committee should proceed in his opinion. The expert noted that it was important to 
</p>
<p>consult on the way forward with the CERD, following a decision made by the Committee.  
</p>
<p>134. The Republic of South Africa stated that multiple reservations made to key articles 
</p>
<p>of ICERD impeded the Convention&#8217;s implementation. The representative emphasized that 
</p>
<p>ICERD was mainly an aspirational document for many countries that had made 
</p>
<p>reservations, as the Convention was not enforceable. That constituted a protection gap. 
</p>
<p>Implementation made sense only if human rights could be adjudicated, and reservations 
</p>
<p>defeated that purpose. Implementation of ICERD was, however, not enough as 
</p>
<p>paragraph 199 of the DDPA had held. That mandate still obliged the Committee to update 
</p>
<p>the existing legal framework. The expert assured South Africa that recommendations by 
</p>
<p>countries (for general comments) were considered by CERD, and that the Committee had 
</p>
<p>recently published a comment on hate speech because it saw the need, and this need had 
</p>
<p>also been expressed by several countries.  
</p>
<p>135. The European Union noted that the expert confirmed that CERD was able to address 
</p>
<p>all new and arising challenges under the current Convention. His point that there was no 
</p>
<p>substantial gap was important information for the Committee. The representative further 
</p>
<p>asked what obstacles hindered full implementation according to the expert. The expert </p>


<p>referred to his statement and noted that the lack of responses to CERD from countries was a 
</p>
<p>major obstacle as was non-reporting by countries. Furthermore, countries did not respond to 
</p>
<p>concluding observations. In addition, often implementation did not take place, and 
</p>
<p>reservations weakened the treaty.  
</p>
<p>136. The representative of Ghana drew attention to the African Peer Review Mechanism 
</p>
<p>(APRM), and noted there might be gaps in the legal framework when it came to migrants. 
</p>
<p>The expert thanked the representative on the information regarding this mechanism and 
</p>
<p>noted that CERD was interested to hear about developments in various regions and would 
</p>
<p>appreciate receiving more information. On migrant workers, the expert noted that it was 
</p>
<p>essential that countries that had not yet done so, joined the treaty. Ghana asked about the 
</p>
<p>role of genocide in CERD&#8217;s work, the expert stated that during the 1990s CERD became 
</p>
<p>very mindful of genocide &#8211; because of massacres &#8211; and the Committee took action when a 
</p>
<p>situation deteriorated. CERD had also become more sensitive to the problems of indigenous 
</p>
<p>people and had taken those up in an early warning procedure.  
</p>
<p>137. Namibia noted that ICERD was not a stagnant instrument but should be subjected to 
</p>
<p>constant evolution. Namibia had experienced drastic forms of racism, including hate speech 
</p>
<p>which was particularly disturbing and the root causes of hate speech should be addressed. 
</p>
<p>Data should be collected on the circumstances in which hate speech could arise. The 
</p>
<p>representative also held that the importance of article 7 of ICERD had not diminished. An 
</p>
<p>educational approach was essential to address indoctrination and inadequate education.  
</p>
<p>138. The Republic of South Africa, on behalf of the Africa Group, stated that when 
</p>
<p>analysing the proposals for the future work of the Committee, one noticed that there were 
</p>
<p>gaps in ICERD. The representative asked the expert about the key elements of an additional 
</p>
<p>protocol. The delegate noted that ICERD was a living instrument as many forms of 
</p>
<p>discrimination could not have been foreseen when it was created in the 1960s. Mr. Kemal 
</p>
<p>suggested that an improved inquiry mechanism could rely on the existing procedures of 
</p>
<p>other mechanisms. Country visits were needed because of the serious problems that existed 
</p>
<p>when it came to implementing ICERD.  
</p>
<p>139. Italy remarked that the idea of country visits was interesting. Such visits could be 
</p>
<p>important tools to increase the ICERD&#8217;s implementation. However, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</p>
<p>had already undertaken 35 country visits. The added value of CERD visits was not clear, 
</p>
<p>particularly since closer cooperation between CERD and the Rapporteur could result in an 
</p>
<p>improved exchange of information. The proliferation of mechanisms and visits could in 
</p>
<p>practice create problems. Italy also inquired about the level of cooperation between the 
</p>
<p>Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide and CERD when it came to early warning. 
</p>
<p>The expert noted that CERD and the special rapporteurs cooperated as closely as possible, 
</p>
<p>reports and information were exchanged and improved cooperation would require 
</p>
<p>additional resources. Regarding country visits, the expert noted that countries would have 
</p>
<p>to consent to any visit. He agreed that they had to be planned well, and in advance. 
</p>
<p>140. Morocco noted that it had regularly called upon the various human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms not to work in separate silos, but to cooperate closely. Cooperation, such as the 
</p>
<p>cooperation between CERD and the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, 
</p>
<p>racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance should increasingly feed into the 
</p>
<p>UPR process. The representative also asked if CERD planned a general comment on 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Islamophobia&#8221;. Mr. Kemal agreed that the UPR played a crucial role and that all 
</p>
<p>mechanisms would nurture each other. Regarding the recommendation to draft a general 
</p>
<p>comment on &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221; Mr. Kemal noted that the topic and &#8220;phobias&#8221; relating to other 
</p>
<p>religions were already referenced in CERD&#8217;s comment on hate speech. He underlined that 
</p>
<p>CERD was concerned with vulnerable people regardless of which group or religion they 
</p>
<p>belonged to. Action was taken in every regard. The most troubling aspect about hate speech </p>


<p>was its use by politicians. In quite a few countries such hate speech was punished by voters, 
</p>
<p>but that was not always the case. Religion was not the mandate of CERD, but the 
</p>
<p>Committee was alert to all injustices and would act when forms of discrimination 
</p>
<p>intersected with ethnic discrimination.  
</p>
<p>141. The representative of Pakistan remarked that CERD had covered procedural gaps by 
</p>
<p>drafting general comments. However, States did not regard general comments as legally 
</p>
<p>binding. Consequently, the representative doubted how general comments could cover 
</p>
<p>substantive gaps that had emerged. Mr. Kemal noted that it was a &#8220;question of degree&#8221;, as 
</p>
<p>in fact, ICERD was not fully implemented, despite the fact that it was binding. As 
</p>
<p>international law did not know enforcement machinery, it was impossible to force countries 
</p>
<p>to respect some international frameworks. General comments were also not intended to 
</p>
<p>punish countries, but assist them. 
</p>
<p>142. Egypt requested clarification on the gaps in ICERD and inquired if the Committee 
</p>
<p>could tackle those procedural gaps by drafting a single optional protocol or several. The 
</p>
<p>representative also asked if the Committee should address substantive gaps. Mr. Kemal 
</p>
<p>underlined that ICERD was comprehensive enough and that during the last forty years 
</p>
<p>CERD had taken an activist approach. The Convention, as a living document, was flexible 
</p>
<p>and had covered all issues. One single protocol on country visits as suggested by the 
</p>
<p>CERD, was enough to further the implementation of the Convention.  
</p>
<p>143. The Chairperson-Rapporteur recalled that during the World Conference against 
</p>
<p>Racism in Durban there was a consensus that there were gaps in the ICERD. Some 
</p>
<p>countries appeared to have subsequently moved away from that agreement. He added that 
</p>
<p>ICERD was subject to many reservations. He stated that it could be argued that the bulk of 
</p>
<p>these reservations constituted a gap. Important new phenomena such as the surge of racism 
</p>
<p>in and around football pitches also needed to be addressed. The Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>asked if CERD had addressed such issues. The expert noted that the application of peer 
</p>
<p>pressure could help address the issue of reservations. It was also important to note that 
</p>
<p>regarding ICERD, countries would also insist on securing freedom of expression and 
</p>
<p>opinion despite the dangers of hate speech, in particular, which used by politicians 
</p>
<p>remained. He noted that punishment, as had sometimes been the case, came via the voting 
</p>
<p>process where voters rejected those politicians. In some other countries, such a reaction had 
</p>
<p>not materialized and CERD noted those situations.  </p>
