"Within six weeks of announcing our acquisition of high-quality assets in the STACK oil window,
we've already closed the transaction and will accelerate an additional rig on this acreage in the
third quarter while still decreasing our 2016 capital budget. This deal expands our inventory and
further positions Marathon Oil for growth in Oklahoma at a competitive valuation. Coupled with
recent non-core divestitures, we're delivering on our objective to further concentrate our capital
allocation to the lower cost, higher margin U.S. resource plays," said Marathon Oil President and
CEO Lee Tillman. "In addition to successful portfolio management, we continued our relentless
focus on reducing costs and driving durable operational efficiencies while delivering impressive
new well results in the resource plays."
North America E&P
North America Exploration and Production (E&P) production available for sale averaged 224,000
net barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) for second quarter 2016. On a divestiture-adjusted
basis, production was down 6 percent from the prior quarter and 13 percent from the year-ago
period. Second quarter North America production costs were 5 percent lower than the previous
quarter and 28 percent lower than the year-ago period. On a per barrel basis, unit production
costs were $6.28 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe), down 13 percent from the year-ago period and
essentially flat with the prior period.
OKLAHOMA RESOURCE BASINS: The Company's unconventional Oklahoma production
averaged 27,000 net boed during second quarter 2016, flat to the prior quarter and up compared
to 24,000 net boed in the year-ago quarter. During second quarter 2016, Marathon Oil brought
online two gross Company-operated STACK Meramec extended lateral (XL) wells in the volatile
oil window. The Irven John achieved a 30-day production rate of 1,710 boed (70 percent oil) and
the Olive June averaged 1,570 boed (75 percent oil) over 30 days. Additionally, three SCOOP
Woodford XL wells were brought online, with the Eubank well averaging 1,950 boed (30 percent
oil) over 30 days.
The Company closed on the STACK acquisition on Aug. 1. Since announcing the acquisition,
three additional Meramec wells -- Moeller, Blackjack and Post -- have reached 30 days of
production with rates of 1,925 boed (51 percent oil), 1,365 boed (47 percent oil) and 780 boed
(51 percent oil), respectively, and at an average completed well cost of approximately $4 million.
Marathon Oil continues to operate the drilling rig on the acquired STACK acreage and will add
one incremental rig late in the third quarter. This will bring consolidated drilling activity to four rigs
in Oklahoma primarily focused in the STACK. The Company expects eight to 10 STACK
Meramec wells to sales in the third quarter.
EAGLE FORD: In second quarter 2016, Marathon Oil's production in the Eagle Ford averaged
109,000 net boed, compared to 120,000 net boed in the prior quarter and 135,000 net boed in the
year-ago quarter. The sequential production decrease was due to lower completion activity with
40 percent fewer gross operated wells brought to sales and reduced contribution from 2015 high-
density pads drilled at tighter well spacing. During second quarter 2016, the Company brought
30 gross (21 net) operated wells to sales, of which 19 were lower Eagle Ford, three upper Eagle
Ford and eight Austin Chalk, compared to 50 gross (32 net) wells to sales in the previous quarter.
The Hollman six-well pad, an Austin Chalk and lower Eagle Ford co-development, was brought
online with 30-day production rates averaging 1,055 to 2,020 boed (45-53 percent oil). Second
quarter completed well costs were $4.2 million, down approximately 30 percent from the year-
ago quarter. Wells were drilled at an average rate of 2,400 feet per day and an average spud-to-
total depth of less than eight days.
BAKKEN: Marathon Oil averaged 53,000 net boed of production in the Bakken during second
quarter 2016, compared to 57,000 net boed in the prior quarter and 61,000 net boed in the year-
ago quarter as strong well productivity and high reliability continued supporting the base
production. Four gross wells were brought to sales in the second quarter -- two Middle Bakken
and two Three Forks -- all with higher intensity completions of 12 to 18 million pounds of
proppant per well and about 45 stages per well. The Clarks Creek Middle Bakken well achieved
a 30-day initial production rate of 2,840 boed (84 percent oil) making it the highest rate well in the
Williston basin in
the past three years. Additionally, the Juanita Middle Bakken well and the Charmaine well in the
first bench of the Three Forks achieved 2,700 boed (84 percent oil) and 2,530 boed (84 percent
oil), respectively, over 30 days. Despite the higher intensity completions, completed well costs
averaged $6 million per well.
GULF OF MEXICO: The outside-operated Gunflint oil development on Mississippi Canyon block
948 in the Gulf of Mexico achieved first production in July. The two-well field is ramping up and is
expected to reach a minimum gross production of 20,000 boed with oil representing
approximately 75 percent of the volumes produced. Marathon Oil holds an 18 percent working
interest.
During third quarter 2016, Marathon Oil signed an agreement to terminate its Gulf of Mexico
deepwater drilling rig contract. As a result, the Company expects to recognize a termination
payment of $113 million in other operating expense in the quarter, which will be reported as a
special item.
International E&P
International E&P production available for sale (excluding Libya) averaged 120,000 net boed for
second quarter 2016, an increase of 20 percent compared to the prior quarter and up 11 percent
compared to the year-ago quarter. The increase over the prior quarter was primarily a result of a
full quarter of production in Equatorial Guinea, the resumption of production from Brae Alpha in
the U.K., increased production efficiency at other Brae facilities and better reliability from
Foinaven. Second quarter production costs (excluding Libya) were 17 percent lower than the
year-ago quarter. On a per barrel basis, unit production costs (excluding Libya) were $4.34 per
boe, a decrease of 25 percent compared to the year-ago quarter.
EQUATORIAL GUINEA: Production available for sale averaged 102,000 net boed in second
quarter 2016 compared to 84,000 net boed in the previous quarter and 86,000 net boed in the
year-ago quarter. Second quarter 2016 base production continued to benefit from last year's re-
completion and development programs as well as the absence of downtime experienced in the
previous and year-ago quarters. The Alba B3 compression project, designed to maintain the
production plateau two additional years and extend field life up to eight years, was completed
within budget and on schedule with first gas in early July. The B3 platform allows Marathon Oil to
convert approximately 130 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves, more than doubling the
Company's remaining proved developed reserve base in EG.
U.K.: Production available for sale averaged 18,000 net boed in second quarter 2016, compared
to 16,000 net boed in the previous quarter and 22,000 net boed in the year-ago quarter. Second
quarter 2016 benefited from resumption of normal operations at the Brae Alpha platform and
better reliability from the outside-operated Foinaven field.
Oil Sands Mining
Oil Sands Mining (OSM) production available for sale for second quarter 2016 averaged 40,000
net barrels per day (bbld) compared to 49,000 net bbld in the prior quarter and 25,000 net bbld in
the year-ago quarter. The decrease compared to first quarter 2016 was due in part to a 4,000
bbld impact from the temporary suspension of operations at the mines related to wildfire
response efforts in May. In addition, planned maintenance activities at the expansion
upgrader and the Jackpine mine were completed on schedule and on budget. Despite the
referenced production impacts, second quarter production was within guidance as mining
operations achieved record production levels in June. Operating expense per synthetic barrel
(before royalties) was $39.00, an increase compared to the previous quarter due primarily to
second quarter planned maintenance, currency effects and the impacts of downtime related to
the wildfires.
Guidance
Marathon Oil expects third quarter 2016 North America E&P production available for sale to
average 200,000 to 210,000 net boed which reflects the divestment of the majority of the
Wyoming assets, the inclusion of the STACK assets in Oklahoma acquired Aug. 1, and decline
from the Eagle Ford high-density pads drilled in 2015. Third quarter International E&P production
available for sale (excluding Libya) is expected to be within a range of 125,000 to 135,000 net
boed. Considerable uncertainty remains around the timing of future production and sales levels
from Libya, and Marathon Oil continues to exclude Libya volumes from its production forecasts.
OSM synthetic crude oil production is expected to range from 45,000 to 50,000 net bbld.
The Company is adjusting its full-year 2016 E&P production guidance range resulting in a new
range of 330,000 to 345,000 net boed, which reflects divestitures and acquisitions closed to date.
OSM synthetic crude oil production guidance remains unchanged at 40,000 to 50,000 net bbld.
Full-year guidance for North America unit production costs is being adjusted down by $1.00 per
boe to a range of $6.00 to $7.00 per boe. Full-year guidance for International unit production
costs is being adjusted down by $0.50 per boe to a range of $4.50 to $5.50 per boe.
Additionally, the Company expects its full-year 2016 capital program to be $1.3 billion, or $100
million lower than the original budget, despite the inclusion of increased activity from the
Oklahoma STACK acquisition.
Corporate and Special Items
Net cash provided by operating activities was $178 million during second quarter 2016, and net
cash provided by operations before changes in working capital was $290 million. Cash additions
to property, plant and equipment were $299 million in second quarter 2016. Total liquidity as of
June 30 was $5.9 billion, which consists of $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and an
undrawn revolving credit facility of $3.3 billion.
During the quarter, the Company announced the sale of Wyoming assets for proceeds of $870
million, before closing adjustments, of which approximately $690 million was received in the
second quarter with the remaining assets expected to close before year end. The Company
entered into separate agreements to sell its 10 percent working interest in the outside-operated
Shenandoah in the Gulf of Mexico, assets in Colorado and certain undeveloped acreage in West
Texas for a combined total of approximately $80 million in proceeds, before closing adjustments.
During the quarter, it closed on certain of these asset sales and expects the remaining sales to
close by year-end.
The adjustments to net loss for second quarter 2016 total $41 million before tax and largely
consist of: a net gain on the sale of assets of $296 million; impairments associated with the
decision to not drill remaining Gulf of Mexico undeveloped leases of $141 million; a pension
settlement of $31 million; and an unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of $91 million.

Non-GAAP Measures
Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income (loss)
and net cash provided by operations before changes in working capital, to evaluate the
Company's financial performance between periods and to compare the Company's performance
to certain competitors. Management also uses net cash provided by operations before changes
in working capital to demonstrate the Company's ability to internally fund capital expenditures,
pay dividends and service debt. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their
most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. See the tables below for reconciliations
between each non-GAAP financial measure and its most directly comparable GAAP financial
measure.
