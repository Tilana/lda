<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> Following the introduction, chapter I of the present report highlights the key activities of 
the Special Rapporteur, from 17 December 2007 to 31 December 2008. The main report, 
contained in chapter II, highlights several concerns of the Special Rapporteur regarding the role 
of intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism. Section A stresses the need for a specific 
and comprehensive legislative framework to regulate the broader powers that have been given to 
intelligence agencies in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The 
collection and sharing of &#8220;signal&#8221; intelligence has led to several violations of the right to privacy 
and the principle of non-discrimination, while &#8220;human intelligence&#8221; - the gathering of 
intelligence by means of interpersonal contact - has even led to violations of jus cogens norms 
such as the prohibition against torture and other inhuman treatment. 
</p>
<p> Evidence suggests that the lack of oversight and political and legal accountability has 
facilitated illegal activities by intelligence agencies. This issue is addressed throughout the 
report, but in section B of chapter II the Special Rapporteur examines in particular the challenges 
that the increased cooperation between intelligence agencies pose in this context. He clarifies the 
human rights obligations of States when their intelligence agencies perform joint operations, 
participate in interrogations and send or receive intelligence for operational use. 
</p>
<p> When unlawful conduct by intelligence agencies occurs, it may have been condoned or 
even secretly directed by government officials. In this context the Special Rapporteur looks into 
best practices of different oversight bodies. In section C he emphasizes that domestic State 
secrecy or public interest immunity clauses cannot discard their positive obligations under 
human rights law to conduct independent investigations into severe human rights violations and 
provide the victims of these violations with an effective remedy. 
</p>
<p> The concluding section makes recommendations to different key actors (intelligence 
agencies, domestic legislative assemblies, domestic executive powers and the United Nations) in 
order to improve the accountability of intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, 
pursuant to General Assembly resolution 62/159 and Human Rights Council resolution 6/28. 
The main report highlights the activities of the Special Rapporteur from 1 November 2007 to 
31 December 2008 and focuses thematically on the role of intelligence agencies and their 
oversight in the fight against terrorism. The addenda contain a communications report<b>1</b> and the 
report on the fact-finding mission to Spain from 7 to 14 May 2008.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>2. Regarding upcoming country visits, the Special Rapporteur hopes to conduct a mission to 
Tunisia prior to presenting this report. The Government extended an invitation in June 2008 but 
has not replied to the request to provide specific dates for the visit. There are outstanding visit 
requests to Algeria, Egypt, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Philippines. The Special Rapporteur has 
recently requested visits to Chile, Peru and Thailand. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  ACTIVITIES OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>

lectures in Melbourne and Sydney on human rights and counter-terrorism. 
</p>
<p>10. On 23 April 2008, the Special Rapporteur gave a public lecture on human rights and 
counter-terrorism in St Petersburg. 
</p>
<p>11. From 19 to 20 May 2008 the Special Rapporteur participated in the United Nations 
Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF) meeting in New York. The Special 
Rapporteur is a member of the Working Groups on Protecting Human Rights while Countering 
Terrorism; on Supporting and Highlighting Victims of Terrorism; and on Countering the Use of 
the Internet for Terrorist Purposes. 
</p>
<p>12. On 5 June 2008 the Special Rapporteur participated in a teleconference meeting with the 
Terrorism Prevention Branch of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and 
made a written submission regarding human rights components which have been adopted in the 
UNODC draft model on legislative provisions against terrorism. 
</p>
<p>13. From 9 to 12 June 2008 the Special Rapporteur was in Washington, DC, and gave an 
informal Congressional briefing organized by the Center on Global Counterterrorism 
Cooperation. He had a working level meeting with the Legal Affairs Office of the State 
Department of the United States to discuss legal developments regarding cases before the 
military commissions at Guantanamo Bay and interrogation techniques of terrorist suspects as a 
follow-up to his mission report.<b>3</b> The Special Rapporteur also participated in a panel discussion 
at the American University on the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-
Terrorism Strategy. 
</p>
<p>14. On 16 June 2008 the Special Rapporteur was in Prague to participate in the 
Euro-Mediterranean seminar on ensuring respect for human rights while countering terrorism 
in accordance with international law, co-organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Czech Republic and the European Commission, under the European Union (EU) Presidency of 
Slovenia. 
</p>
<p>15. From 23 to 27 June 2008 the Special Rapporteur attended the fifteenth session of the 
annual meeting of special procedures. He also had high-level meetings with the Permanent 
Missions of Tunisia and Thailand. 
</p>
<p>16. On 24 June 2008 the Special Rapporteur chaired an expert meeting in Geneva on 
&#8220;International aviation law: promoting legal safeguards and protecting human rights in the 
counter-terrorism context&#8221;, sponsored by REDRESS and supported by the Office of the

 <p> 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR). Among the participants were 
legal representatives from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Venice 
Commission of the Council of Europe. 
</p>
<p>17. On 26 June 2008 the Special Rapporteur participated in a panel event, sponsored by the 
International Council on Human Rights Policy (ICHRP) at the Graduate Institute of International 
and Development Studies in Geneva, on &#8220;Terrorism: risks and choices for human rights 
organizations&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>18.  From 14 to 18 July 2008 the Special Rapporteur conducted consultations in Geneva, in 
preparation for his reports to the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. He also met 
with the Permanent Representative of Pakistan. 
</p>
<p>19. On 18 and 19 September 2008 the Special Rapporteur convened an expert group meeting 
at the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence to discuss thematic issues related to his 
mandate. The meeting was funded by the &#197;bo Akademi University Institute for Human Rights, 
through its project to support the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p><p>20. On 18 October 2008 the Special Rapporteur addressed a workshop in the 
Norwegian Parliament on &#8220;Accountability of international intelligence cooperation&#8221;, 
organized by the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces, the Norwegian 
Parliamentary Intelligence Oversight Committee and the University of Durham Human Rights 
Centre. 
</p>
<p>21. From 20 to 22 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur was in New York to present his report 
(A/63/223) to the Third Committee of the General Assembly. The Special Rapporteur had formal 
meetings with the Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee, the Counter-Terrorism 
Committee (CTC) and the Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED). He met with 
the Chair of CTITF and with two of its working groups. The Special Rapporteur chaired a 
follow-up expert meeting on international aviation law which focused on international bodies 
such as CTC, CTED and ICAO to identify legal tools to help prevent, detect and investigate 
rendition flights. He also met with a number of non-governmental organizations and gave a 
press conference. 
</p>
<p>22. On 27 October 2008 the Special Rapporteur chaired a meeting on the &#8220;Principle of legality: 
defining terrorism and terrorism-related offences&#8221;, as part of a regional seminar on upholding 
human rights while countering terrorism in Amman, organized by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>23. On 7 November 2008 the Special Rapporteur participated in an expert seminar on 
&#8220;The impact of terrorism and counter-terrorism measures on the enjoyment of economic, 
social and cultural rights&#8221; organized by the CTITF Working Group on the Protection of 
Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>24. From 11 to 12 November 2008 the Special Rapporteur was represented at a stakeholder 
meeting in New York organized by the CTITF Working Group on Countering the Use of the 
Internet for Terrorist Purposes. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II. THE ROLE OF INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND THEIR  
OVERSIGHT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM 
</b></p>
<p>25. In the course of his mandate the Special Rapporteur has noticed that lack of oversight and 
political and legal accountability has facilitated illegal activities by intelligence agencies.<b>4</b> Such 
unlawful conduct may have been condoned or even secretly directed by government officials. 
This report will therefore reflect upon the human rights implications of conferring broader 
powers on, and increasing cooperation between, intelligence agencies. It will examine the case 
law, legislation and practice of a number of Member States in order to clarify the scope of their 
human rights obligations regarding intelligence agencies and to identify a set of best practices 
that would improve the accountability and oversight of these services in the context of 
counter-terrorism operations.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A. Broadening powers granted to intelligence agencies and  
the need for ex ante accountability mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>26. In general terms the main function of intelligence agencies is to detect potential national 
security threats, including terrorist threats, by gathering data<b>6</b> and information in such a way as 
not to alert those targeted, through a range of special investigative techniques such as secret 
surveillance, interception and monitoring of (electronic) communications, secret searches of 
premises and objects, and the use of infiltrators. These investigative techniques are effective 
measures that States may utilize to counter international terrorism.<b>7</b> Their justification can be 
seen in the positive obligation of States under international human rights law to take preventive 
measures in order to protect individuals whose life or security is known or suspected to be at risk 
from the criminal acts of another individual, including terrorists.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  The term &#8220;intelligence agencies&#8221; is used in this report for agencies with a foreign and/or a 
</p>
<p>domestic mandate. 
<b>5
</b>  The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the assistance of his research assistant at the EUI, 
</p>
<p>Mathias Vermeulen, and for the cooperation of the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of 
Armed Forces (DCAF), the International Commission of Jurists, and the participants of his PhD 
candidate seminar on legal issues in national, European and international action against terrorism 
at the European University Institute (EUI), in the preparation of the present report. 
<b>6
</b>  For the purposes of this document the word &#8220;data&#8221; is used here to describe hard, single, precise 
</p>
<p>facts, which can be used to identify a living person (names, birthday, addresses, telephone 
numbers, fax numbers, e-mail addresses, vehicle registration data, fingerprints, DNA profiles). 
<b>7
</b>  See for instance: <i>Klass and Others v. Germany</i>, European Court of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>(ECHR), 6 September 1978, paras. 48-50, <i>Murray v. the United Kingdom</i>, 
ECHR, 28 October 1994, para. 58. 
<b>8
</b>  The Human Rights Committee has stressed several times that the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights also protects the right to security of the person outside the context 
of formal deprivation of liberty. See especially <i>Delgado Paez v. Colombia</i>, communication 
No. 195/1985, Views adopted on 12 July 1990, para. 5.5. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  A legislative framework for special investigative techniques 
</b></p>
<p>27. A crucial first element in ensuring that States and their intelligence agencies are 
accountable for their actions is the establishment of a specific<b>9</b> and comprehensive legislative 
framework that defines the mandate of any intelligence agency and clarifies its special powers. 
Without such a framework States are likely not to meet their obligation under human rights 
treaties to respect and ensure the effective enjoyment of human rights.<b>10</b> An example of best 
practice lies in the very detailed provisions governing each investigative technique that Dutch 
intelligence may use.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>28. The approaches of States as to what measures and techniques require judicial approval tend 
to vary, depending on the scope and strength of the constitutional rights recognized in the State 
in question, in particular the scope of privacy rights.<b>12</b> The mere act of opening a thematic, 
organization-specific or individual intelligence file may not be seen as raising a human rights 
issue when there are suspicions that someone is planning to commit a terrorist offence.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>29. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur stresses however that information gathered for 
&#8220;strategic intelligence&#8221; (i.e. information obtained by intelligence agencies for the purposes of 
policymaking) must not be used in court proceedings when there is no judicial supervision 
attached to measures directed at named individuals. The Special Rapporteur has noted with 
concern that in different courts, the line between such strategic intelligence and probative 
evidence has become blurred to the advantage of different forms of &#8220;national security 
imperatives&#8221;.<b> </b>Judicial approval for a special investigative technique must be given in order to 
make permissible the use of the fruits of the technique as evidence in court. 
</p>
<p>30. States may make use of certain preventive measures like covert surveillance or the 
interception and monitoring of communications, provided that these are case-specific 
interferences, on the basis of a warrant issued by a judge on showing of probable cause or 
reasonable grounds; there must be some factual basis, related to the behaviour of an individual 
which justifies the suspicion that he may be engaged in preparing a terrorist attack. This 
preventive, intelligence-led approach seeks to anticipate rather than to circumvent legal 
proceedings and can be a desirable, reasonable and proportionate method to identify risks or to 
find out more about suspicions against a terrorist suspect. However, States need to be aware that

</b>  See for instance <i>Kruslin v. France</i>, ECHR, 24 April 1990, para. 33.

<p>  See for background: <i>Leander v. Sweden</i>, ECHR, 26 March 1987, paras. 52-57. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the first sentence of article 14.1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is 
applicable in any matter dealt with by the judiciary and requires compliance with the basic 
principles of fair trial.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>31. Although no general norm exists in international law expressly prohibiting or limiting acts 
of intelligence gathering, it is crucial that States clarify &#8220;threshold criteria&#8221; that might trigger a 
whole range of human rights intrusive actions by an intelligence agency, which can range from 
data mining to covert action.<b>15</b> Clear legislated powers for intelligence agencies also help to 
distinguish between the tasks of intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Failure to make 
these clear distinctions will lead to blurred lines of accountability and to the risk that special 
powers are used in routine situations where there is no pre-eminent threat to the population.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Minimum thresholds for the gathering of information:  
the problem of data mining and sharing 
</b></p>
<p>32. The increasing use of &#8220;data mining&#8221;<b> </b>by intelligence agencies, entailing the matching of 
various databases according to a number of variables, blurs the boundary between permissible 
targeted surveillance and problematic mass surveillance which potentially amounts to arbitrary 
or unlawful interference with privacy. There is namely an inherent risk of &#8220;over-inclusiveness&#8221; 
(meaning that information is gathered because it may be useful, rather than for a defined 
purpose) in data mining, as the technical capabilities of this technique can tempt the user towards 
broadening the definition of what is considered suspicious. 
</p>
<p>33. In this regard the Special Rapporteur reiterates his recommendations on the issue of 
racial/ethnic profiling.<b>17</b> While data mining is not prohibited as such, it should not be allowed to 
include variables that result in compromising the right to non-discrimination. Data-mining 
software that performs &#8220;sentiment analysis&#8221;, which extracts and summarizes opinions from 
unstructured human-authored documents on the Internet in order to create a terrorist profile - and 
which is apparently used by intelligence agencies in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, 
Israel, Singapore and Taiwan<b>18</b> - must not be used as the basis for deprivation of liberty or 
inclusion on &#8220;watch lists&#8221; that may impede air travel, banking, and employment opportunities at 
airports or in places where radioactive materials are used, such as hospitals.

<p><b>14
</b>  See Human Rights Committee, general comment No. 32 (2007) on the right to equality before 
</p>
<p>courts and tribunals and to a fair trial, paras. 7 and 8. 
<b>15
</b></p>
<p>  Covert action refers to unacknowledged intervention or measures taken by an intelligence 
agency in the territory or affairs of another country.

Practice for Oversight of Intelligence Activities</i> (Oslo, Publishing House of the Parliament 
of Norway, 2005), p. 29. 
<b>17
</b></p>
<p>  See also, in general, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s remarks on the use of counter-terrorism 
practices that are based on terrorist profiles that include characteristics such as the presumed 
&#8220;race&#8221;, ethnicity, national origin or religion of a person (A/HRC/4/26, para. 59). 
<b>18
</b></p>
<p>  The Economist, 25 September 2008. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>34. In combination with the frequent problem of poor-quality data, which can be wrongly 
recorded, wrongly interpreted or outdated when matched with other databases,<b>19</b> major concerns 
arise that innocent people are identified as terrorist threats.<b>20</b> These potential flaws in data 
collection are a cause of concern for the Special Rapporteur, especially as there is an increasing 
trend of facilitating personal data sharing amongst intelligence and law enforcement agencies at 
the national level and across borders within bilateral or multilateral frameworks such as the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. 
</p>
<p>35. As a general element of best practice the Special Rapporteur invites Member States to 
adopt legislation which embodies basic data protection principles reflected in documents such as 
the guidelines concerning computerized personal data files adopted by the General Assembly in 
resolution 45/95.<b>21</b> These guidelines start with the principle that &#8220;information about persons 
should not be collected or processed in unfair or unlawful ways, nor should it be used for ends 
contrary to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations&#8221;.<b>22</b> This includes the 
obligation of all Member States to promote and respect human rights. The Special Rapporteur 
emphasizes that any departures from the principles of accuracy (art. 2), purpose limitation 
(art. 3), or access (art. 4) should be narrowly constructed. The Special Rapporteur reminds States 
especially of the fifth principle (non-discrimination, art. 5) that data &#8220;likely to give rise to 
unlawful or arbitrary discrimination, including information on racial or ethnic origin, colour, sex 
life, political opinions, religious, philosophical and other beliefs as well as membership of an 
association or trade union, should not be compiled&#8221;, and therefore should not be shared either. 
Exceptions to the fifth principle may be authorized only within the limits prescribed by the 
International Bill of Human Rights and other relevant instruments in the field of protection of 
human rights and the prevention of discrimination. In this context, the Special Rapporteur has 
serious concerns about the sharing of data and information between intelligence agencies in 
China, Russia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan within the 
framework of the Shanghai Convention on Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism. 
This sharing of data and information is not subject to any meaningful form of oversight and there 
are no human rights safeguards attached to data and information sharing. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur refers to best practice where the supply and receipt of data 
between intelligence agencies and its subsequent use is regulated<b> </b>by written agreements made 
</p>
<p>

</i></p>

<b>20
</b></p>
<p>  See for instance the case of Bisher Al-Rahwi, documented in Amnesty International, <i>State 
of Denial: Europe&#8217;s Role in Rendition and Secret Detention</i> (London, Amnesty International 
Publications, 2008), p. 11.

directive, 24 July 1998.

<p>  E/CN.4/1990/72. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>between the proper authorities.<b>23</b> As an element of best practice, these agreements can be 
submitted to oversight bodies,<b>24</b> which ideally undertake a significant auditing process of the 
foreign intelligence agency before a State enters into such an agreement. Such an auditing 
process might entail field visits and consulting local non-governmental organizations on the 
human rights record of the agency. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Non-traditional powers to arrest, detain and interrogate 
</b></p>
<p>37. After the events of 11 September 2001, some Governments insisted that clear distinctions 
between intelligence and law enforcement powers were no longer tenable, arguing that the 
extraordinary character of the contemporary terrorist threat demands that intelligence agencies 
acquire new powers to interrogate, arrest and detain people. Giving powers of arrest, detention 
and interrogation to intelligence agencies is not as such a violation of international law, provided 
these agencies comply with all relevant human rights standards regarding arrest and detention 
and with domestic constitutional and other provisions prescribed for ordinary law enforcement 
agencies.<b>25</b> However, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that in several countries the power 
shift from law enforcement agencies to intelligence agencies for countering and preventing 
terrorist threats was accomplished precisely to circumvent such necessary safeguards in a 
democratic society, abusing thereby the usually legitimate secrecy of intelligence operations.<b>26</b> 
This shift can ultimately endanger the rule of law, as the collection of intelligence and the 
collection of evidence about criminal acts becomes more and more blurred.<b>27</b> This leads to a 
situation where States begin preferring to use undisclosed evidence gathered by intelligence 
agents in administrative proceedings over attempts to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt in a 
criminal trial. Seen in the light of the inherent limitations of intelligence information, preventive 
measures that deprive a person of his or her liberty must not be based solely on intelligence. In 
these cases, intelligence has to be turned into concrete evidence and proof after a period of time 
so that the affected person can challenge the evidence against him or her. If intelligence cannot 
be transformed into evidence over time, or the State fails to obtain new evidence, the preventive 
measures need to cease.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>38. In some countries intelligence agencies have legally acquired the power to arrest and 
detain people who are expected to have information about terrorist activities.<b>28</b> Preventive 
detention for public security reasons, including that of interrogating persons for intelligence 
purposes, may in exceptional circumstances be a proportionate interference with the right to 
liberty, provided the detention has clear and accessible basis in the law, information on the 
reasons for detention have been given and the detention is subject to judicial review.<b>29</b> Detention 
must not be arbitrary,<b>30</b> and compensation in the case of unjustified detention must be 
available.<b>31</b> The Special Rapporteur is concerned about situations where persons are detained for 
a long period of time for the sole purpose of intelligence-gathering or on broad grounds in the 
name of prevention. These situations constitute arbitrary deprivation of liberty.<b>32</b> The existence 
of grounds for continued detention should be determined by an independent and impartial court. 
Without delay, the continued detention of such a person triggers a duty for the authorities to 
establish whether criminal suspicions can be confirmed and, if this is the case, to bring charges 
against the suspect and to put him on trial. The mere &#8220;administrative&#8221; detention of a person, for 
the sole purpose of gathering information would be unlawful.<b>33</b> 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned about situations in which intelligence 
agencies wield arrest and detention powers, but where there is no effective judicial oversight 
over the actions of the intelligence services, resulting in impunity. In Algeria for example, the 
military intelligence service (DRS) specializes in detaining and interrogating people who are 
believed to possess information about the terrorist activities of armed groups acting within 
Algeria or of international terrorist networks acting abroad. Articles 12 and 16 of the Criminal 
Procedure Code stipulate that in exercising these functions the DRS operates under the authority 
of the prosecutor. However, reports indicate that actually the DRS is operating without any 
civilian oversight.<b>34</b> Unlike cases where arrests are carried out by police or gendarmerie officers, 
prosecutors seem not to be informed of arrests carried out by the DRS. Prosecutors apparently do

<p>not use their prerogative to order medical examinations, to visit barracks which are used for 
<i>garde &#224; vue</i> detention, or to verify the records on the arrest, questioning and release of detainees 
held by the DRS. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that these circumstances substantially 
increase the risk that persons are arbitrarily detained or will be exposed to torture or other 
inhuman treatment. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned about situations, for instance in Morocco,<b>35</b> 
Jordan<b>36</b> and Pakistan, where the detention and interrogation powers of the intelligence services 
in counter-terrorism operations and investigations have no clear statutory basis.<b>37 </b>The arrest and 
detention of persons on grounds which are not clearly established in domestic law is a violation 
of article 9, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Without 
such a legal framework there is a danger that intelligence services arrest people on the basis of 
sheer assumptions, which might be based only on a &#8220;guilt by association&#8221; pattern. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur notes that since September 2001 there has been a trend towards 
outsourcing the collection of intelligence to private contractors.<b>38</b> While the involvement of 
private actors can be necessary as a technical matter in order to have access to information (for 
instance for electronic surveillance), there are reasons to be wary of using contractors to 
interrogate persons who are deprived of their liberty.<b>39</b> The combination of a lack of proper 
training, the introduction of a profit motive into situations which are prone to human rights 
violations, and the often questionable prospect that such contractors will be subject to judicial 
and parliamentary accountability mechanisms,<b> </b>justifies the conclusion that intelligence activities 
that may affect the life, physical integrity or liberty of individuals should remain within the 
exclusive domain of the State. If States however decide to contract private military and security 
companies, they should, as a minimum, comply with the Montreux Document on pertinent

</p>
<p><b>4.  Oversight and review mechanisms of intelligence agencies 
</b></p>
<p>42. As the main beneficiary of intelligence information, the executive must effectively 
supervise and direct the actions of the intelligence agency. These directions should be put in 
writing,<b>41</b> and outline in detail which actions the agencies may and must not carry out vis-&#224;-vis 
which persons. At stake is not only the oversight and control of the intelligence services but also 
preventing so-called &#8220;plausible deniability&#8221;<b>42</b> on behalf of the executive and holding the latter 
accountable for potential abuses. The Special Rapporteur stresses in this context that 
authorization for covert actions must be consistent with the human rights obligations of 
States not only for legal and moral, but also for intelligence reasons.<b>43</b> 
</p>
<p>43. Authorization for an agency to assassinate, disappear or arbitrarily detain terrorist suspects 
can never be justified as a legitimate intelligence-led preventive approach to counter-terrorism. 
Equally, giving powers to arrest and detain high-value detainees in secret detention centres, or 
allowing inhuman and degrading treatment of suspects under the name of &#8220;enhanced 
interrogation techniques&#8221; for the purpose of gathering information<b>44</b> are clear violations of 
international law. The Special Rapporteur stresses in this regard that the &#8220;necessity defence&#8221; as it 
is known in the criminal law of some countries must never serve as a policy or an ex ante 
justification for the use of prohibited interrogation techniques - even in so-called &#8220;ticking bomb&#8221; 
situations.<b>45</b>

<b>42
</b></p>
<p>  &#8220;Plausible deniability&#8221; refers to the deliberate creation of power structures and chains of 
command which are loose and informal enough to enable denying the involvement of the 
executive when a human rights violation is being disclosed. 
<b>43
</b></p>
<p>  See for instance United States Senate Armed Services Committee inquiry into the treatment of 
detainees in United States custody, 12 December 2008, p. xii: &#8220;The fact is that senior officials in 
the United States Government solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques, 
redefined the law to create the appearance of their legality, and authorized their use against 
detainees. Those efforts damaged our ability to collect accurate intelligence that could save lives, 
strengthened the hand of our enemies, and compromised our moral authority.&#8221;

</b></p>
<p>  See A/HRC/6/17/Add.4, paras. 17-21. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>44. Several States have devised independent permanent offices, such as inspectors-general, 
judicial commissioners or auditors, through statutes or administrative arrangements which 
review whether intelligence agencies comply with their duties. They can act as proactive early 
warning mechanisms to signal potential problems to the executive, thereby improving 
accountability. These offices can be required for instance to report at least every six months to 
the relevant executive bodies on developments and actions of the agencies. To fulfil this function 
properly such offices must have unrestricted access to all files, premises and personnel of the 
agency; this is the case for instance in Canada,<b>46</b> South Africa<b>47</b> and various countries in Europe. 
Specialized and continuous supervision has clear merits compared to ad hoc investigations by 
general supervisory authorities.<b>48</b> A specific oversight task falls to the national parliament, which 
in the sphere of intelligence should play its traditional role of holding the executive branch and 
its agencies accountable to the general public. In practice, there is a diverse range of 
parliamentary oversight bodies which all have different features, depending on national 
constitutions and legal traditions. 
</p>
<p>45. While the Special Rapporteur is aware that it is difficult to identify a universal best 
practice on this issue, the Norwegian system of parliamentary control is a system that contains at 
least the elements of best practice as it has an explicit human rights purpose, namely &#8220;to 
ascertain and prevent any exercise of injustice against any person&#8221; and to &#8220;ensure that activities 
are kept within the framework of statute law, administrative or military directives and 
non-statutory law&#8221;.<b>49</b> Furthermore, the parliamentary oversight committee is composed of seven 
members, who are appointed by Parliament but who don&#8217;t necessarily have political affiliations. 
In this way the committee cannot be abused for party political games, a high level of expertise is 
guaranteed and the credibility of the expert-members is assured. The members are supported by a 
secretariat of three lawyers and one secretary who all have security clearance. The members have 
the power to compel the production of evidence to the committee concerning all matters 
experienced in the course of their duties. In pursuing its duties, the committee has access to the 
archives and registers, premises, and installations of all branches of the executive and the 
intelligence agency. 
</p>
<p>46. There is a risk that with compartmentalized oversight, whereby oversight bodies are 
assigned to examine just one part of the intelligence community, cross-cutting problems fall 
through the gaps between oversight bodies. Oversight bodies with a thematic mandate are 
therefore generally better equipped to address the increasing overlap of functions, cooperation 
and the sharing of information between various governmental agencies. The Norwegian

</p>
<p><b>B.  Intelligence cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>47. When it became clear, soon after the events of 11 September 2001, that the attacks were 
prepared in part in Western Europe, and that some of the terrorists apparently involved in the 
attacks were under observation by, inter alia, the German and French intelligence agencies, the 
need for more effective and coordinated cooperation between intelligence agencies was widely 
acknowledged.<b>51</b> The benefit of sharing intelligence is clear: no State has an all-seeing &#8220;Eye of 
Providence&#8221; which enables it to know all potential information which might be relevant for its 
national security interests. 
</p>
<p>48. This legitimate cooperation often poses accountability problems. This is mainly because on 
the one hand domestic accountability mechanisms only tend to take into account the actions of 
domestic agencies because their mandate does not cover the cooperation of their agencies with 
third partners or, where they are mandated to scrutinize cooperation, these powers are often very 
limited. On the other hand, two key concepts that underlie most top secret intelligence-sharing 
agreements, namely the &#8220;need to know&#8221; approach to intelligence distribution<b>52</b> and the policy of 
&#8220;originator control&#8221;,<b>53</b> increase the possibility that many countries, including liberal democracies 
opposed to torture, become complicit in international crimes. Because of the desire to maintain 
cooperation from (especially more powerful) foreign agencies, intelligence services have limited 
incentives to request clarification on how certain information has been obtained or to ensure that 
the information they share will not be used in a manner that leads to human rights violations. At 
the same time domestic oversight bodies are often powerless to oversee the adherence of a 
foreign intelligence agency to any conditions attached to outgoing information.

<p>  Under the &#8220;need to know&#8221; principle, &#8220;individuals should have access to classified information 
only when they need the information for their work, and access should never be authorized

Committee, <i>A Short Guide to the Handling of Classified Information</i> (Brussels, NATO Archives,

security policy and the entrenchment of State secrecy&#8221;, <i>Cornell International Law Journal</i>, 
vol. 36, No. 2 (2003), p. 337.<i> 
<b></b></i><b>53
</b></p>
<p>  Under the principle of &#8220;originator control&#8221; - also often referred to as the &#8220;third party 
rule&#8221; - intelligence agencies only send intelligence under the understanding that neither the 
information nor its source will be disclosed without the prior consent of the entity which 
provided it. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>49. Intelligence cooperation is often practised in the context of multilateral organizations such 
as NATO or the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that 
the secrecy and security of information policies that are adopted by States within these 
multilateral frameworks provide an insurmountable wall against independent investigations into 
human rights violations. For instance, the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human 
Rights of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (rapporteur Dick Marty) gives credible 
information that bilateral (secret) agreements that allowed for blanket overflight rights, access to 
ports and military bases for covert Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operations, including 
secret detentions and renditions, were developed around &#8220;permissive&#8221; NATO authorizations 
agreed on 4 October 2001.<b>54</b> In the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation cooperation between 
secret services is exercised without any oversight. A service merely requests &#8220;assistance&#8221;<b>55</b> from 
another service upon which the receiving State &#8220;shall take all necessary measures to ensure a 
prompt and most complete execution of the request&#8221;.<b>56</b> According to article 11.4 of the Shanghai 
Convention on Combating Terrorism, Separatism and Extremism, any information on the means 
used by agencies in order to provide assistance to another agency &#8220;shall not be subject to 
disclosure&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>50. To counter the lack of accountability in intelligence cooperation, cooperation between 
national oversight bodies should be enhanced. Existing initiatives in this field, such as the 
biannual International Intelligence Review Agencies Conference or the ad hoc meetings of 
parliamentary intelligence oversight committees of EU member and candidate countries, are a 
first step in the right direction but happen too infrequently and are currently limited to a too 
small group of States. The Special Rapporteur supports the idea, developed by Belgian Standing 
Committee I, of setting up a permanent knowledge-sharing platform for (parliamentary) review 
bodies of intelligence services, where best practices on legislation, jurisprudence and general 
developments in the field can be shared, thereby supporting the professionalization of the review 
bodies of Member States.<b>57</b> Such a platform might even be extended to operational matters, 
whereby the collaboration on inquiries and the exchange of information could lead into a form of 
&#8220;joint oversight&#8221;.<b>58</b>

<p>  The State just has to describe &#8220;the contents&#8221; of the required assistance (Shanghai Convention

interrogating, detaining and extraditing persons.

<p>  A further model for such cooperation can be found in the periodic meetings of police

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Joint operations 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur remains deeply troubled that the United States has created a 
comprehensive system of extraordinary renditions, prolonged and secret detention, and practices 
that violate the prohibition against torture and other forms of ill-treatment. This system required 
an international web of exchange of information and has created a corrupted body of information 
which was shared systematically with partners in the war on terror through intelligence 
cooperation, thereby corrupting the institutional culture of the legal and institutional systems of 
recipient States. 
</p>
<p>52. While this system was devised and put in place by the United States, it was only possible 
through collaboration from many other States. There exist consistent, credible reports suggesting 
that at least until May 2007 a number of States facilitated extraordinary renditions in various 
ways. States such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Croatia, Georgia, Indonesia, Kenya, the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Pakistan and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland have provided intelligence or have conducted the initial seizure of an individual 
before he was transferred to (mostly unacknowledged) detention centres in Afghanistan, Egypt, 
Ethiopia, Jordan, Pakistan, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Syria, Thailand, Uzbekistan, or to 
one of the CIA covert detention centres, often referred to as &#8220;black sites&#8221;. In many cases, the 
receiving States reportedly engaged in torture and other forms of ill-treatment of these detainees. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur reminds States that they are responsible where they knowingly 
engage in, render aid to or assist in the commission of internationally wrongful acts, including 
violations of human rights.<b>59</b> Accordingly, grave human rights violations by States such as 
torture, enforced disappearances or arbitrary detention should therefore place serious constraints 
on policies of cooperation by States, including by their intelligence agencies, with States that are 
known to violate human rights. The prohibition against torture is an absolute and peremptory 
norm of international law.<b>60</b> States must not aid or assist in the commission of acts of torture, or

will only be responsible to the extent that its own conduct has caused or contributed to the 
internationally wrongful act.&#8221; Article 16 reflects a rule of customary international law. See

<p>  The obligation to protect against and sanction torture is an obligation erga omnes, an 
obligation owed to all States. See International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia

<p>recognize such practices as lawful, including by relying on intelligence information obtained 
through torture.<b>61</b> States must introduce safeguards preventing intelligence agencies from making 
use of such intelligence. <b>62</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Participation in interrogations 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the participation of foreign agents in the 
interrogation of persons held in situations that violate international human rights standards. The 
difference that some Governments make between intelligence and law enforcement personnel is 
of limited relevance, as the active participation through the sending of interrogators<b>63</b> or 
questions,<b>64</b> or even the mere presence of intelligence personnel at an interview with a person 
who is being held in places where his rights are violated,<b>65</b> can be reasonably understood as 
implicitly condoning such practices.<b>66</b> The continuous engagement and presence of foreign

<p>  As Justice Neuberger states: &#8220;(&#8230;) even by adopting the fruits of torture, a democratic 
State is weakening its case against terrorists, by adopting their methods, thereby losing the 
moral high ground an open democratic society enjoys&#8221;. Lord Justice Neuberger (dissenting) 
in <i>A and Ors v. Secretary of State for the Home Department</i>, [2004] EWCA Civ 1123 
(11 August 2004), para. 497.<i> 
<b></b></i><b>63
</b></p>
<p>  Evidence proves that Australian, British and United States intelligence personnel have 
themselves interviewed detainees who were held incommunicado by the Pakistani ISI in 
so-called safe houses, where they were being tortured. Many countries (Bahrain, Canada, China, 
France, Germany, Italy, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Tajikistan, 
Tunisia, Turkey, United Kingdom, Uzbekistan) have sent interrogators to Guantanamo Bay as 
well (see Center for Constitutional Rights, &#8220;Foreign interrogators in Guantanamo Bay&#8221;, available 
at http://ccrjustice.org/files/Foreign%20Interrogators%20in%20Guantanamo%20Bay_1.pdf). 
<b>64
</b></p>
<p>  German and Canadian intelligence agencies provided questions to Syrian Military Intelligence 
in the cases of Muhammad Zammar and Abdullah Almalki. Both detainees were tortured 
afterwards while in Syrian custody. See Amnesty International, United States of America: Below 
the radar - Secret flights to torture and &#8220;disappearance&#8221;, 5 April 2006, pp. 18-19; Internal Inquiry 
into the Actions of Canadian Officials in Relation to Abdullah Almalki, Ahmed Abou-Elmaati 
and Muayyed Nureddin, 2008, p. 411.<i>

<p>  United Kingdom intelligence personnel for instance conducted or witnessed just 
over 2,000 interviews in Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay and Iraq. See Intelligence and Security

</p>
<p>officials has in some instances constituted a form of encouragement or even support.<b>67</b> In the 
view of the Special Rapporteur, the responsibility of the receiving State may be triggered also by 
even more passive and geographically distant forms of creating a demand for intelligence 
information obtained through internationally wrongful means. Therefore, the Special Rapporteur 
believes that the active or passive participation by States in the interrogation of persons held by 
another State constitutes an internationally wrongful act if the State knew or ought to have 
known that the person was facing a real risk of torture<b>68</b> or other prohibited treatment, including 
arbitrary detention.<b>69</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Sending and receiving intelligence for operational use 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that not only active participation in interrogations 
where people are tortured would constitute a violation of human rights law, but also taking 
advantage of the coercive environment. At a minimum, States which know or ought to know that 
they are receiving intelligence from torture or other inhuman treatment, or arbitrary detention, 
and are either creating a demand for such information or elevating its operational use to a policy, 
are complicit in the human rights violations in question.<b>70</b> The Special Rapporteur believes that 
reliance on information from torture in another country, even if the information is obtained only 
for operational purposes, inevitably implies the &#8220;recognition of lawfulness&#8221; of such practices and 
therefore triggers the application of principles of State responsibility.<b>71</b> Hence, States that receive 
information obtained through torture or inhuman and degrading treatment are complicit in the 
commission of internationally wrongful acts. Such involvement is also irreconcilable with the 
obligation erga omnes of States to cooperate in the eradication of torture. 
</p>
<p>56. States also claim that in practice it is difficult to assess under what conditions the 
information has been gathered: intelligence is usually not shared as raw intelligence, but as a 
refined product. While the Special Rapporteur recognizes that this is done as a matter of 
convenience, he is concerned that this practice also is maintained in order to give intelligence 
services the possibility of denying responsibility for the use of information that has been 
obtained in breach of international law. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>67
</b>  This is particularly the case if - as alleged in Pakistan - persons are held at the request and 
</p>
<p>with the approval of foreign agents. Equally, the Arar Inquiry considered the sending of a team 
of investigators to speak to the Syrian Intelligence Services SMI to be highly problematic. 
<b>68
</b></p>
<p>  See analogously, ICTY Furundzija Appeal Judgement (21 July 2000), paras. 115-120 and

responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, arts. 40-41.

responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, arts. 40-41. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur is equally concerned about the supply of information to foreign 
intelligence services, when there are no adequate safeguards attached to the further distribution 
of such information among other governmental agencies in the receiving State, such as law 
enforcement and immigration agencies which have the power to arrest and detain a person. In the 
Arar case, for example, the information sharing between the United States and Canada was on 
the basis of a purely verbal &#8220;free flow&#8221; agreement: intelligence was to be exchanged in real time 
through direct communication among the various agencies involved.<b>72</b> In this agreement, the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police abandoned the privacy policies that ordinarily would have 
governed national security investigations, which resulted in the sharing of inaccurate and 
misleading information and in broader sharing of information than was usually the case. It was 
this information that led the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service to conclude 
that Arar was a member of Al-Qaida after which he was deported to Syria where he was 
subsequently tortured. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Ex post facto accountability and the right to an effective remedy 
</b></p>
<p>58. Ex-ante control and oversight mechanisms are important in preventing and discovering 
human rights violations by intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism. Equally important, 
however, is the duty of the State to create a framework that enables an independent investigation 
into human rights violations by intelligence agencies after a complaint has been received in 
order, firstly, to establish the facts and, secondly, to hold intelligence agencies and the executive 
accountable for their actions. The Special Rapporteur is concerned in this context about the 
adoption of indemnity/impunity clauses which result in impunity for intelligence agents.<b>73</b> Such 
indemnity clauses can bar effective access to court and violate the human right to an effective 
remedy. 
</p>
<p><b>The abuse of State secrecy provisions 
</b></p>
<p>59. While the Special Rapporteur recognizes that States may limit the disclosure to the general 
public of specific information which is important for the protection of national security, for 
instance about the sources, identities and methods of intelligence agents, he is nevertheless 
worried by the increasing use of State secrecy provisions and public interest immunities for 
instance by Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the 
United Kingdom or the United States to conceal illegal acts from oversight bodies or judicial 
authorities, or to protect itself from criticism, embarrassment and - most importantly - liability.

&#8220;Towards a right to privacy in transnational intelligence networks&#8221;, <i>Michigan Journal of 
International Law</i>, vol. 28, No. 3 (2007), pp. 675-676. 
<b>73
</b></p>
<p>  See for instance Algeria, articles 45 and 46 of Ordinance 06-01 of 27 February 2006 
(implementing the Charter for Peace and Reconciliation) grant impunity to members of the 
security forces and even criminalize criticism of State agents with years of imprisonment. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>60. The human rights obligations of States, in particular the obligation to ensure an effective 
remedy, require that such legal provisions must not lead to a priori dismissal of investigations, or 
prevent disclosure of wrongdoing, in particular when there are reports of international crimes or 
gross human rights violations.<b>74</b> The blanket invocation of State secrets privilege with reference 
to complete policies, such as the United States secret detention, interrogation and rendition 
programme<b>75</b> or third-party intelligence (under the policy of &#8220;originator control&#8221; (see 
paragraph 48 above)) prevents effective investigation and renders the right to a remedy illusory. 
This is incompatible with article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It 
could also amount to a violation of the obligation of States to provide judicial assistance to 
investigations that deal with gross human rights violations and serious violations of international 
humanitarian law. <b>76</b> 
</p>
<p>61. In order to enable effective investigations to take place, the Special Rapporteur is of the 
opinion that robust whistle-blower protection mechanisms for intelligence agents and other 
informers are crucial in order to break illegitimate rings of secrecy. Reliable factual information 
about serious human rights violations by an intelligence agency is most likely to come from 
within the agency itself. In these cases, the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public 
interest in non-disclosure. Such whistle-blowers should firstly be protected from legal reprisals 
and disciplinary action when disclosing unauthorized information. Secondly, independent 
oversight mechanisms must be able to give whistle-blowers and informants the necessary 
protections, which could be modelled on the witness protection programmes of the International 
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, 
the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the important work many investigative journalists and 
non-governmental organizations do around the world in uncovering human rights violations by 
intelligence agencies. Often accountability is not triggered by formal mechanisms, but through 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>74
</b>  See for instance Inter-American Court of Human Rights, <i>Myrna Mack-Chang v. Guatemala</i>, 
</p>
<p>judgement, 25 November 2003, para. 180; ECHR, <i>Imakayeva v. Russia</i>, judgement, 
9 November 2006. 
<b>75
</b></p>
<p>  In <i>El-Masri v. Tenet</i>, the Government filed a declaration by CIA director Porter J. Goss which 
argued that the claims alleged by rendition victim El-Masri would force the CIA to admit or 
deny the existence of clandestine CIA activities, and that therefore dismissal of the suit was the 
only proper outcome on the basis of State secrets privilege. (Assertion of a Formal Claim of 
State Secrets Privilege and Request for Expedited Consideration, 8 March 2006, United States 
District Court - Eastern District of Virginia, Case No. 1:05-cv-1417-TSE-TRJ). See also the 
declarations of James B. Comey, acting Attorney General and Tom Ridge, Secretary of the 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 18 January 2005 in <i>Arar v. Ashcroft</i>

</p>
<p>revelations by these actors. In order for the press to perform their vital function as an external, 
unofficial control mechanism, robust freedom of information laws and laws protecting 
journalists&#8217; confidential sources<b>77</b> are absolutely necessary. States must limit prosecutions for 
breaching secrecy provisions to their officials,<b>78</b> introduce a mandatory public interest test and 
oblige the courts to consider the public interest value when it comes to the publication of official 
State secrets. 
</p>
<p>63. In all cases judges must be the ultimate arbitrators in assessing the merits of the State 
secrecy claim when serious human rights violations are at stake. Their rulings may allow the 
disclosure of the disputed information to the public or to a terrorist suspect and his lawyer in 
legal proceedings. In order to test secrecy claims in the latter case, a judicial body should have 
access to the actual evidence a Government is seeking to protect, rather than mere summaries or 
declarations provided by the Government. Where there are reasons for excluding elements that 
can justifiably be considered as State secrets, courts should consider counter-balancing measures 
for not making available such information in a public hearing, for instance by limiting access to 
the information to the (if necessary, security cleared) lawyer of the suspect. Only when strictly 
necessary could a judge decide to make a distinction between disclosing the provenance of the 
evidence (the source and the method used) and the content of the information, which should 
always be open to challenge.  
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>64. The increased powers of intelligence services to conduct measures that seriously interfere 
with individuals&#8217; rights, as well as the increasing relevance of intelligence for legal and 
administrative actions, make it essential that adequate accountability mechanisms are put in 
place to prevent human rights abuses. Under international human rights law, States are under a 
positive obligation to conduct independent investigations into alleged violations of the right to 
life, freedom from torture or other inhuman treatment, enforced disappearances or arbitrary 
detention,<b>79</b> to bring to justice those responsible for such acts, and to provide reparations where

<p><b>77
</b>  In Belgium, for instance, the Law on the protection of journalistic sources of 7 April 2005 
</p>
<p>(Moniteur Belge, 27 April 2005) permits journalists and media employees explicitly &#8220;to keep 
their sources secret&#8221; (art. 3). 
<b>78

<p>they have participated in such violations. States retain this positive obligation to protect human 
rights where they grant privileges within their national territory to another State, including to 
intelligence services. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>For legislative assemblies 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that any interference with the right to privacy, 
family, home or correspondence by an intelligence agency should be authorized by 
provisions of law that are particularly precise, proportionate to the security threat, and 
offer effective guarantees against abuse. States should ensure that competent authorities 
apply less intrusive investigation methods than special investigation techniques if such 
methods enable a terrorist offence to be detected, prevented or prosecuted with adequate 
effectiveness. Decision-making authority should be layered so that the greater the invasion 
of privacy, the higher the level of necessary authorization. Furthermore, in order to 
safeguard against the arbitrary use of special investigative techniques and violations of 
human rights, the use of special investigative techniques by the intelligence agencies must 
be subject to appropriate supervision and review.</b> 
66. <b>There should be a domestic legal basis for the storage and use of data by intelligence 
and security services, which is foreseeable as to its effects and subject to scrutiny in the 
public interest. The law should also provide for effective controls on how long information 
may be retained, the use to which it may be put, and who may have access to it, and ensure 
compliance with international data protection principles in the handling of information. 
There should be audit processes, which include external independent personnel, to ensure 
that such rules are adhered to.</b> 
</p>
<p>67. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends the adoption of legislation that clarifies the 
rights, responsibilities, and liability of private companies in submitting data to government 
agencies.</b> 
</p>
<p>68. <b>Parliamentary oversight committees, ad hoc parliamentary inquiry committees, royal 
commissions, etc. should have far-reaching investigative powers, access to the archives and 
registers, premises, and installations of the executive and the agency, in order to fulfil their 
domestic oversight function. These bodies should also be able to proactively investigate the 
relationship of a domestic agency with a particular State or service, or all exchanges of 
information with foreign cooperating services pertaining to a particular case. After their 
inquiry these bodies should produce simultaneously a confidential report for the executive 
and a separate report for public disclosure. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Special Rapporteur supports the recommendation of the Eminent Jurist Panel on 
Counter-Terrorism, Terrorism and Human Rights that intelligence agencies should not 
perform the functions of law enforcement personnel.80 If, despite the potential for abuse,

</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>intelligence services are nonetheless accorded powers of arrest, detention and 
interrogation, the Special Rapporteur urges that they be under the strict and effective 
control of ordinary civilian authorities and operate with full respect for international 
human rights law.</b> 
</p>
<p>70. <b>Intelligence cooperation must be clearly governed by the law (including human rights 
safeguards) and by transparent regulations, authorized according to strict routines (with 
proper &#8220;paper trails&#8221;) and controlled or supervised by parliamentary or expert bodies.</b> 
<b>For the executive power 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The executive should have effective powers of control, provided for in law, over the 
intelligence agencies and have adequate information about their actions in order to be able 
to effectively exercise control over them. The minister responsible for the intelligence and 
security services should therefore have the right to approve matters of political sensitivity 
(such as cooperation with agencies from other countries) or undertakings that affect 
fundamental rights (such as the approval of special investigative powers, whether or not 
additional external approval is required from a judge).</b> 
72. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges all relevant authorities of countries that have allegedly 
participated in extraordinary renditions, torture, disappearances, secret detentions or any 
other serious human rights violation to investigate fully any wrongful acts of intelligence 
agencies committed on their territory. States must ensure that the victims of such unlawful 
acts are rehabilitated and compensated. States must also stop transferring anyone to the 
custody of the agents of another State, or facilitating such transfers, unless the transfer is 
carried out under judicial supervision and in line with international standards.</b> 
73. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that States insert a clause in their 
intelligence-sharing agreements which makes the application of an agreement by a party 
subject to scrutiny by its review bodies and which declares that the review bodies of each 
party are competent to cooperate with one another in assessing the performance of either 
or both parties.81</b> 
</p>
<p><b>For intelligence agencies 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that classified information may be shared with 
other intelligence agencies only when it contains a written caveat, which limits the further 
distribution of such information among other governmental agencies in the receiving State, 
such as law enforcement and immigration agencies, which have the power to arrest and 
detain a person. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur advises that sanctions against a 
person should not be based on foreign intelligence, unless the affected party can effectively 
challenge the credibility, accuracy and reliability of the information and there are credible 
grounds to believe that the information is accurate and reliable.

<p>Human Rights of Transnational Intelligence Sharing, conference paper for the DCAF workshop

 <p> 
</p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur urges Member States to reduce to a minimum the 
restrictions of transparency founded on concepts of State secrecy and national security. 
Information and evidence concerning the civil, criminal or political liability of State 
representatives, including intelligence agents, for violations of human rights must not be 
considered worthy of protection as State secrets. If it is not possible to separate such cases 
from true, legitimate State secrets, appropriate procedures must be put into place ensuring 
that the culprits are held accountable for their actions while preserving State secrecy.</b> 
</p>
<p>76. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that intelligence agencies develop internal and 
international training programmes in how to comply with human rights in their 
operations. Such training should be based on the idea that compliance with human rights is 
a part of professional qualifications, and a source for professional pride, for any 
intelligence officer. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>A codified regulation should be in place which guarantees appropriate support and 
security for whistle-blowers within the intelligence agencies.</b> 
</p>

such as guidelines for human rights compliance and best practice by intelligence agencies.82</b>
