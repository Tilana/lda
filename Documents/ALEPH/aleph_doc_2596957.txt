30 June 2016. The Consolidated Financial Report is appended to this News Release.
Operations
HIGHLIGHTS
  Langer Heinrich Mine (LHM) produced(1) 4.763Mlb U3O8 for the year ended 30 June 2016, down
5% from 2015.
  C1 unit cost of production(2) for the year ended 30 June 2016 was a record low of US$25.88/lb
and a decrease of 11% from US$29.07/lb in 2015.
  TSF3 water return issue largely resolved and not expected to impact future quarters.
Sales and revenue
  Sales revenue of US$184.9M for the year ended 30 June 2016, selling 4.899Mlb U3O8.
  Average  realised  uranium  sales  price  for  the  year  was  US$37.75/lb  U3O8  compared  to  the 
average  TradeTech  weekly  spot  price  for  the  year  of  US$33.19/lb  U3O8,  a  premium  to  spot  of 
US$4.56/lb.
Corporate
  Cost reduction initiatives deliver:
  Underlying  EBITDA(3)  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  of  US$24.8M,  a  US$45.7M 
improvement from a negative underlying EBITDA of US$20.9M for the year ended 30 June 
2015.
  Gross profit for the year ended 30 June 2016 of US$13.7M, an increase of 661% compared
to the year ended 30 June 2015 of US$1.8M.
  Underlying  all-in  cash  expenditure(4)  per  pound  of  uranium  production  for  the  year  ended 
30 June 2016  was  US$38.75/lb  (vs. guidance  of  US$38.00/lb  to  US$40.00/lb),  a  decrease  of 
24% compared to the year ended 30 June 2015 of US$50.75/lb.
  Cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2016 of US$59.2M (vs. guidance in the range of US$45M 
to US$65M) decreased by US$124.5M from US$183.7M at 30 June 2015, primarily as a result of 
the repayment of debt.
1 LHM production volumes and unit C1 cost of production include an adjustment to in-circuit inventory relating to leached 
uranium within process circuit. 
2 C1 cost of production = cost of production excluding product distribution costs, sales royalties and depreciation and 
amortisation  before  adjustment  for  impairment.  C1  cost,  which  is  non-IFRS  information,  is  a  widely  used  ‘industry 
standard’ term. 
3 EBITDA = The Company’s Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) represents profit 
before  finance costs,  taxation,  depreciation  and  amortisation,  impairments,  foreign  exchange gains/losses,  restructure 
costs and other income. EBITDA, which is non-IFRS information, is a widely used ‘industry standard’ term. 
4 Underlying All-In Cash Expenditure = total cash cost of production plus capital expenditure, KM care & maintenance 
expenses, corporate costs, exploration costs and debt servicing costs and repayments. Underlying All-In Cash 
Expenditure, which is a non-IFRS measure, is widely used in the mining industry as a benchmark to reflect operating 
performance.

Level 4, 502 Hay Street, Subiaco, Western Australia 6008    Postal: PO Box 201, Subiaco, Western Australia 6904
  Achieved objective of being cash flow positive on an ‘all in’ basis for FY2016 excluding one-off
restructuring costs and capital management.
  Progress on capital management during the year (US$122.9M of debt repaid):
  Repurchased US$62M of Convertible Bonds due April 2017 to reduce outstanding amount
to US$212M.
  Repaid and terminated the US$60.9M LHM Syndicated Facility.
  US$25.0M LHM Revolving Credit Facility put in place and was undrawn as at 30 June 2016.
  Progress on strategic initiatives (over US$200M to be raised):
  A  non-binding  terms  sheet  has  been  signed  with  CNNC  Overseas  Uranium  Holding  Ltd 
(COUH) (the existing 25% minority shareholder in LHM), to sell a 24% interest in LHM. The 
sale,  if  it  proceeds,  will  raise  US$175M  in  cash  for  the  Company  with  Paladin  working 
towards a formal close of the transaction in the fourth quarter of CY2016.
  A binding terms sheet signed with MGT Resources Limited (MGT) for sale of up to a 75% 
interest  in  the  Company’s  100%  owned Manyingee  project.  On  closing  of  the transaction, 
MGT  will  acquire  a  30%  initial  interest  in  Manyingee  for  US$10M  cash  with  an  option  to 
acquire an additional 45% interest within twelve months for US$20M cash. The transaction 
is conditional on definitive documentation and a vote of MGT’s shareholders expected to be 
concluded in the fourth quarter of CY2016.
Outlook
  Key elements of guidance for quarter to 30 September 2016 include:
  Uranium Sales – Anticipated to be in the range of 650,000lb to 750,000lb U3O8.
  LHM C1 unit cash costs – Expected to be within the range of US$20/lb to US$22/lb.
  Cash and cash equivalents balance as at 30 September 2016 – Forecast to be in the range
of US$35M to US$55M.
  Proposed LHM mine plan adjustment involving reduced mining material movement combined
with processing plant feed coming from stockpiled low and medium grade ores:
  Effectively  shifts  higher-grade  ore  processing  into  later  years  when  uranium  prices  are
expected to be higher.
  Reduces  production  of  finished  U3O8  by  up  to  1.0Mlb  to  1.5Mlb  per  year  for  next  two
years but comes with a material reduction in cash operating costs.
  Using  Paladin  internal  assumptions,  generates  approximately  US$40M  of  cumulative
incremental cash flow in FY2017 and FY2018.
  FY2017 Guidance has been reviewed after changes to the LHM mine plan as follows:
  LHM production of approximately 3.8Mlb U3O8 to 4.0Mlb U3O8.
  LHM  C1  cash  costs  in  the  range  of  US$19/lb  to  US$22/lb  (US$20/lb  to  22/lb  for  1H
FY2017 and US$19/lb to US$21/lb for 2HFY2017).
  All-in cash expenditure for the full-year FY2017 in the range of US$32/lb to US34/lb.
  Previously  announced  strategic  initiatives  continue  to  progress  towards  formal  transaction
closure.

Results
(References  below  to  2016  and  2015  are  to  the  equivalent  year  ended  30  June  2016  and  2015 
respectively).
Safety and sustainability
The  Company’s  12  month  moving  average  Lost  Time  Injury  Frequency  Rate(5)  (LTIFR)  was  1.8  as 
compared to 2.4 for the previous year to 30 June 2015. 
 
Paladin’s safety record has continued to improve in the past year as a result of a long-term commitment to 
identify  new  initiatives  and  improvements,  increases  in  in-house  and  external  training,  more  formal  risk 
assessments, more rigorous permits to work and more thorough site inductions. The Company remains fully 
focussed on improving on this positive trend.
Langer Heinrich Mine (LHM)
Langer Heinrich Mine (LHM) produced 4.763Mlb U3O8 for the year ended 30 June 2016, down 5% from the 
previous year (2015: 5,037Mlb U3O8).
  Ore milled of 3,574,147t, up 5% (FY2015: 3,397,659t).
  Average plant feed grade of 699ppm U3O8, down 9% (FY2015: 768ppm).
  Overall recovery of 86.3%, down 1% (FY2015: 87.6%).
C1 unit cost of production for the year decreased by 11% to US$25.88/lb from US$29.07/lb in 2015 as a 
result  of  the  lower  production  volume.  In  the  September  quarter,  plant  production  was  affected  by  a 
decrease  in  throughput  caused  by  reduced  availability  associated  with  planned  annual  maintenance  and 
equipment  reconfiguration  (e.g.  scrubber  relining  and  reconfiguration  of  BRP).  Overall  recovery  was  also 
lower, caused principally by an atypical ore type which was unexpected, but fed for the whole quarter due to 
mine scheduling constraints. In the June quarter, production was impacted by a decrease in ore milled that 
was  associated  with  a  lack  of  recycled  water  from  the  tailings  system  and  unplanned  mechanical  plant 
breakdowns. This issue was largely resolved by the end of the June quarter by drilling and preparation of 
new return water wells. It is not expected to have a material impact on production going forward.
Kayelekera Mine (KM) remains on care and maintenance
In FY2016 activities at site focused on the water treatment programme.
Profit and Loss
Total sales volume for the year was 4.899Mlb U3O8 (2015: 5.367Mlb).
Sales revenue for the year decreased by 7% from US$198.6M in 2015 to US$184.9M in 2016, as a result of 
a 9% decrease in sales volume which has been partially offset by a 2% increase in realised sales price. 
 
The  average  realised  uranium  sales  price  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  was  US$37.75/lb  U3O8 
(2015:  US$37.00/lb  U3O8),  compared  to  the  TradeTech  weekly  spot  price  average  for  the  year  of 
US$33.19/lb U3O8. 
 
Gross Profit for the year increased by 661% from US$1.8M in 2015 to US$13.7M in 2016. 
 
Impairments of US$173.9M were recognised in 2016 (2015: US$241.4M)



Impairment of LHM ore stockpiles US$168.9M, resulting from a revaluation of stockpiles of 
unprocessed ore.
Impairment of aircraft ahead of its sale US$0.3M.
Impairment of investment in Deep Yellow Limited US$1.5M.
  Obsolescence write down of stores and consumables at KM US$2.4M.

Impairment of Summit’s office building in Mount Isa US$0.8M.

Net  loss  after  tax  attributable  to  members  of  the  Parent  for  the  year  of  US$122.0M  (2015:  Net  loss 
US$267.8M).
Underlying  EBITDA  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  of  US$24.8M  improved  by  US$45.7M  from  a 
negative underlying EBITDA of US$20.9M for the  year ended 30 June  2015. The improved  EBITDA 
was primarily due to cost reduction initiatives that were implemented during the year.
Cash flow
Cash inflow from operating activities for the year was US$4.3M (2015: cash outflow US$24.7M), primarily 
due  to  receipts  from customers  of  US$186.0M,  which  were  partially  offset  by  payments  to  suppliers  and 
employees of US$153.8M and net interest paid of US$27.3M.
Cash outflow from investing activities for the year totalled US$5.3M (2015: cash outflow US$15.6M):
  plant and equipment acquisitions of US$3.8M.

capitalised exploration expenditure of US$4.2M.
  partially offset by receipt of US$2.5M from the sale of aircraft and receipt of US$0.2M from
sale of investments.
Cash  outflow  from  financing  activities  for  the  year  of  US$122.5M  is  attributable  to  the  repurchase  of 
US$62M April 2017 Convertible Bonds for US$56.4M (excluding accrued interest), repayment of US$60.9M 
under  the  LHM  Syndicated  Facility  and  US$5.2M  distribution  to  CNNC  by  way  of  repayment  of 
intercompany loans assigned to CNNC.
Cash position and capital management
At 30 June 2016, the Group’s cash and cash equivalents were US$59.2M, a decrease of US$124.5M from 
US$183.7M at 30 June 2015 primarily as a result of the repayment of debt. Guidance previously provided 
was  for  the  30  June  2016  cash  balance  to  be  in  the  range  of  US$45M  to  US$65M.  The  Company  has 
achieved  its  objective  of  being  cash  flow  positive  on  an  ‘all  in’  basis  for  FY2016  excluding  one-off 
restructuring costs and capital management.
During  the  year  ended  30  June  2016,  the  Company  repurchased  US$62M  of  the  US$274M  Convertible 
Bonds  due  April  2017  for  approximately  US$56.4M  (excluding  accrued  interest)  and  repaid  US$60.9M 
under the LHM Syndicated Facility.
In June 2016, a US$25.0M 24-month Revolving Credit Facility was implemented at LHM. The purpose is to 
provide a buffer facility that can be drawn in periods where LHM-level working capital requirements are in 
deficit, mainly due to the timing of sales receipts. The provider of the Revolving Credit Facility is Nedbank 
Limited,  through  its  UK  registered  subsidiary,  N.B.S.A.  Limited.  Nedbank  has  also  taken  on  the  role  of 
exclusive provider of the Kayelekera Environmental Performance Bond. At 30 June 2016 the Company had 
not drawn any funds under this facility.
The  documents  comprising  the  Annual  Report  including  the  audited  Financial  Statements  for  the  year 
ended  30 June  2016 together with Appendix 4E  and  Management Discussion and  Analysis are attached 
and will be filed with the Company’s other documents on Sedar (sedar.com) and on the Company’s website 
(paladinenergy.com.au).
Outlook
Uranium market
The TradeTech U3O8 Spot Price at the end of June 2016 was US$26.80/lb, approximately 27% lower than 
at the end of June 2015.

Conflicting developments continue to characterise the restart programme for the Japanese reactor fleet. On 
the positive side, in August, the Ikata Unit 3 became the fifth restarted nuclear unit in Japan. Meanwhile the 
Japanese Nuclear Regulation Authority has approved 20-year lifespan extensions for Takahama Units 1 & 
2, making these the first reactors to obtain life extension approval since the introduction of tighter regulations 
in 2013. Progress with Units 1 & 2 is in contrast to the status of Units 3 & 4 at the Takahama NPP, which 
remain  offline  following  an  injunction  issued  and  subsequently  upheld  by  the  Otsu  District  Court.  Kansai 
Electric’s  appeal  against  the  injunction  is  progressing  but  is  expected  to  take  several  months  to  reach  a 
resolution. 
 
The US nuclear industry has been impacted by negative sentiment in the last six months. During the June 
quarter  Pacific  Gas  and  Electric  announced  it  would  not  seek  to  extend  the  operation  of  its  two  Diablo 
Canyon  nuclear  units  beyond  their  current  operating  licence  expiry  in  2025  and  Entergy  announced  it 
proposed  to  close  its  James  A.  Fitzpatrick  nuclear  power  plant  in  New  York.  However,  the  more  recent 
news flow is improving. On 1 August the New York Public Service Commission approved a Clean Energy 
Standard, which supports nuclear as a form of clean energy and provides subsidies to reflect the value of 
carbon dioxide emissions avoided  by clean nuclear power generation. As an immediate response to this, 
Exelon Generation announced it would take over ownership of the James A. FitzPatrick nuclear power plant 
that  Entergy  Corporation  had  previously  determined  to  close.  A  number  of  other  US  states  are  now 
considering similar rule changes or legislation.  
 
Growth in emerging markets continues unabated. China brought three new reactors online during the June 
quarter and India started up its second unit at Kudankulam on 10 July.  
 
Supply 
 
As  CY2016  progresses,  it’s  becoming  clear  that  uranium production  will  be  lower  than  expected.  In  April 
Cameco announced production cuts at three of its mine / mill complexes, which Paladin estimates to have 
removed 4.9Mlb from CY2016 uranium supply. On 11 July 2016, Sibanye Gold announced the closure of its 
Cooke mine, which will remove a further 600,000lb equivalent of annualised uranium equivalent supply from 
the market. In addition, prior to the commencement of the year analysts expected China General Nuclear’s 
Husab  mine  to  produce  approximately  6Mlb  of  uranium  for  CY2016,  with  a  February  start  for  finished 
product  shipments  as  per  statements  made  in  CY2015  by  that  company’s  Namibian  unit.  However, 
shipments are yet to commence from that mine. 
 
Paladin’s move to process more stockpiled material (as described in the Company outlook section) is more 
about  increasing  cash  flows  and  preserving  value  but  it  will  also  have  the  effect  of  adding  to  the  supply 
reductions in the market place.
Company strategy
Paladin believes that the uranium market will improve though FY2017 due to the combination of: improving 
regulatory and market environment for nuclear utilities in the US; more Japanese restarts; and the continued 
aggressive build programme of new nuclear reactors globally.  
 
Despite  the  Company’s  belief  in  a  uranium  industry  turnaround,  its  current  strategies  are  focused  on 
optimising  actions  to  maximise  cash  flow  whilst  also  prudently  enacting  capital  management  actions. 
Paladin’s strategies are aimed at maximising shareholder value through the uranium price downturn whilst 
remaining  positioned  for  a  future  normalisation  of  the  uranium  market  and  price.  Key  elements  of  the 
Company’s strategy include:
  Maximising  LHM  operating  cash  flows  through  optimisation  initiatives  that  preserve  the
integrity of the long-term life of mine plan.
  Maintaining KM and the Company’s exploration assets on a minimal expenditure, care and
maintenance basis.
  Minimise corporate and administrative costs.
Ref: 409830_5
  Page 5
  Progress strategic initiatives with respect to partnerships, strategic investment, funding and 
corporate transactions, that result in de-risking Paladin’s funding structure or provide clear 
value accretion for shareholders.
Company outlook
Paladin is working on a proposed LHM mine plan adjustment involving reduced mining material movement 
combined  with  processing  plant  feed  coming  from  stockpiled  low  and  medium  grade  ores.    The  revised 
mine plan effectively shifts higher-grade ore processing into later years when uranium prices are expected 
to be higher. The FY2017 average feed grade will be reduced into the range of 550ppm to 570ppm vs our 
previous  internal  Company  budget  of  700ppm.    The  impact  of  the  change  will  reduce  finished  U3O8 
production by up to 1.0Mlb to 1.5Mlb per year for each of the next two years.  However, the requirement for 
less movement of mined material on site during the period reduces cash operating costs by well in excess 
of any lost revenue. Using Paladin’s internal assumptions the initiative will generate approximately US$40M 
of  cumulative  incremental  operating  cash  flow  for  FY2017  and  FY2018.    The  proposed  LHM  mine  plan 
adjustment requires a number of third-party consents and Paladin  intends to initiate the plan in a phased 
approach over the next three months.
Taking into account the proposed revised LHM mine plan, key relevant guidance items for FY2017 include:
  LHM Production – Annual production guidance in the range of approximately 3.8Mlb  U3O8
to approximately 4.0Mlb U3O8.
  LHM  C1  cash  costs  –  C1  unit  cash  cost  for  FY2017  is  expected  to  be  in  the  range  of 
US$19/lb  to  US$22/lb,  being  US$20/lb  to  US$22/lb  in  1HFY2017  and  then  US$19/lb  to 
US$21/lb in 2HFY2017 once the revised mine plan is fully implemented.
  Corporate  costs,  exploration  and  KM  –  Guidance  for  combined  expenditure  on  corporate 
costs, exploration and KM care and maintenance is forecast to be approximately US$14M. 
This is a further reduction of US$5M compared to FY2016.
  The Company expects FY2017 that the all-in cash expenditure for the full-year FY2017 will
be in the range of US$32/lb to US$34/lb.
Key relevant guidance items for the quarter to 30 September 2016 include:
  Uranium Sales – Anticipated to be in the range of 650,000lb to 750,000lb U3O8.
  LHM C1 cash costs – Expected to be within the range of US$20/lb to US$22/lb (previously
US$23/lb to US$25/lb).
  Cash and cash equivalents balance as at 30 September 2016 – Forecast to be in the range
of US$35M to US$55M.
The previously announced strategic initiatives regarding the COUH acquisition of an additional 24% interest 
in LHM for US$175M and sale of an interest in Manyingee project to MGT continue to be progressed in the 
documentation stage.  Paladin has also received legal advice confirming that COUH’s investment in LHM 
will not require an application to the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board.  Paladin intends to use 
funds received from the strategic initiatives together with existing cash reserves to fully repay the US$212M 
outstanding amount of the Convertible Bonds due April 2017.

INSIGHTS FROM THE CEO

Dear Stakeholders, 
 
During  FY2016,  Paladin  made  significant  headway  in  its  strategy  to  survive  the  low  uranium  price 
environment  whilst  at  the  same  time  preserve  options  to  grow  when  the  market  environment 
normalises.  
 
Importantly, we maintained a safe workplace for our 1,326 employees and contractors located across 
four continents and continued to maintain the highest environmental standards.  
 
On behalf of our Paladin team, I can characterise the company’s key traits as follows:
  We are a global leader in uranium – Paladin is the 8th largest uranium company in the world
by capacity and the largest pure-play uranium producer listed on the ASX.
  Langer  Heinrich  Mine  is  a  strategic  tier  one  mine  –  Our  main  operating  asset,  Langer 
Heinrich  Mine  in  Namibia  can  be  undisputedly  considered  a  tier  one  mine  in  the  uranium 
industry.  It’s the fourth largest open-pit uranium mine in the world, has a remaining production 
life in excess of 20-years and is within the first quartile of global cash costs.  As a testament to 
its  quality,  Langer  Heinrich  Mine  generated  US$46.1M  of  free  operating  cash  flow  in  FY2016 
despite the low uranium price environment.
  Optimisation is a core competency for us – Paladin has an industry leading position in being 
able  to  introduce  optimisation  projects  that  enhance  our  operating  margins.    Our  Bicarbonate 
Recovery  Plant (BRP)  installation  at  Langer  Heinrich  Mine  was  largely  designed  in-house and 
since its implementation in FY2015 and FY2016, it has halved our reagent costs.  The resultant 
saving  has  been  reflected  in  an  approximately  US$6/lb  reduction  in  our  cash  cost  of  uranium 
production.  The team that designed the BRP continues to work on future optimisation initiatives 
to ensure we get maximum value from our resources.
  We  believe  Paladin  provides  the  best  senior  leverage  to  uranium  price  upside  –  The 
uranium  market  will  eventually  reach  a  post-Fukushima  incident  normalisation  where  uranium 
prices  are  much higher  than now.    Paladin has  unique leverage  to uranium  price upside.   We 
are generally more exposed to spot prices vs. fixed contract prices than peer companies and we 
can also quickly bring on an additional 2-2.5Mlb of annual production through the re-start of our 
Kayelekera Mine in Malawi, which has been on care and maintenance since mid-2014.
Paladin’s current strategy is based around four key elements, including:
  We  are  maximising  operating  cash  flows  from  Langer  Heinrich  Mine  through  optimisation  and
cost reduction initiatives whilst preserving the integrity of the long-term mine plan.
  Our exploration business and Kayelekera Mine are being maintained on a minimal expenditure
and care and maintenance basis until such time as uranium price recovers substantially.
  Corporate costs and administrative expenses are minimised. 
 
  We  have  been  pursuing  initiatives  with  respect  to  partnerships,  strategic  investment,  funding
and corporate transactions.
Through the combination of our focussed strategy, the quality of our asset base and more importantly, 
the quality of the Paladin team implementing the strategy, we have really moved the Company ahead 
in FY2016.  
 
When I look at our performance for the year, what stands out for me is the impressive cost reductions 
achieved.  These are important because a lower cost structure is the key to having a business that’s 
sustainable through to the period until uranium prices recover.  Langer Heinrich Mine’s C1 cash cost of 
production set a record low for FY2016 and that’s despite the fact that average plant feed grade was 
lower.  Our ‘all in’ company-wide cash expenditure dropped from US$50.75/lb of uranium produced in 
FY2015  to  US$38.75/lb  in  FY2016.  This  24%  drop  was  driven  by  optimisations  across  the  entire 
business.

INSIGHTS FROM THE CEO
7
Subsequent  to  the  end  of  the  financial  year,  we  announced  two  proposed  transactions,  which  in 
combination could raise in excess of an additional US$200M for Paladin. The first transaction relates 
to the execution of a non-binding terms sheet to sell 24% of Langer Heinrich Mine to CNNC Overseas 
Uranium  Holdings  Ltd  (COUH)  for  US$175M  and  the  second  transaction  relates  to  a  binding  terms 
sheet to sell a 30% initial interest in Manyingee Project to MGT Resources Limited for US$10M, with 
the  grant  of  an  option  to  allow  them  to  increase  their  stake  to  75%  for  the  payment  of  an  additional 
US$20M.    The  purpose  of  these transactions  is  to continue  to  de-risk  Paladin’s  balance sheet.    The 
proceeds  will  be  used in combination  with our  existing cash to fully  repay  the  US$212M  outstanding 
under our 2017 Convertible Bond.  Once that bond is repaid, our next major debt maturity will not be 
until 2020 and our ongoing cash interest bill  will be half of what  was paid in FY2016, leaving us in a 
much stronger position to ride out the current weak uranium market. 
 
Coming back to the uranium market, we continue to expect a normalisation to occur at some point and 
that will bring with it much higher prices.  It seemed apparent to me that the market was already in the 
early stages of a recovery from the Fukushima Incident earlier in FY2016. After having a period below 
US$30/lb  in  May-July  2014,  uranium  prices  started  to  recover  along  with  increased  transaction 
volumes  in  the  uranium  market.  The  improved  conditions  were  driven  by  Japan  re-starting  reactors 
that  were closed  after the  Fukushima Incident and  improved conditions in a number of other nuclear 
markets.  However,  in  January  and  February  2016  the  uranium  market  reversed  its  course  and  by 
March the uranium spot price fell below US$30/lb and has remained there since. Paladin believes this 
recent  weakness  is  mostly  the  result  of  US-centric  issues  at  this  time.  In  early  CY2016  natural  gas 
prices  continued  to  decline  and  there  was  a  lot  of  regulatory  uncertainty  in  the  US  concerning  how 
various  governments  would  approach  the  requirement  to  stimulate  clean  energy  investment.  In 
unregulated  power  markets,  utilities  had  become concerned that  some of  their  nuclear  reactors  may 
have  less  long  term  viability  compared  with  cheap  natural  gas  or  heavily  subsidised  wind  and  solar. 
Feedback from  US  utility  customers  to Paladin  was  that  their  purchasing  activities  were scaled  back 
until there is more certainty. 
 
Recent  news  indicates  we  may  see  the  certainty  US  buyers  need  coming  back  quite  quickly.  On  1 
August  2016  the  New  York  Public  Service  Commission  approved  a  Clean  Energy  Standard,  which 
supports  nuclear  as  a  form  of  clean  energy  and  provides  subsidies  to  reflect  the  value  of  carbon 
dioxide  emissions  avoided  by  nuclear  power  generation.  As  an  immediate  response  to  this,  Exelon 
Generation announced it would take over ownership of the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant 
in  Scriba,  New  York  from  Entergy  Corporation,  with  operation  of  the  power  plant  to  be  continued 
whereas it had previously  been slated for closure. A  number of other US states are now considering 
similar rule changes or legislation.  
 
Short-term issues aside, the case for uranium is quite positive. Demand continues to accelerate in new 
markets,  with  all  of  the  ‘BRICS’  countries  (i.e.,  Brazil,  Russia,  India,  China  and  South  Africa)  rapidly 
growing their nuclear power capacity and increasing their reliance on nuclear power as a proportion of 
overall  power  generation.  On  the  supply  side,  current  low  prices  are  starting  to  constrain  supply.  In 
April  2016  Cameco  announced  production  cuts  at  three  of  its  mine  /  mill  complexes,  which  we 
estimate  could  reduce  annualised  supply  by  5-7Mlb  per  year.  On  11  July  2016,  Sibanye  Gold 
announced  the  closure  of  its  Cooke  mine,  which  will  remove  a  further  600,000lb  of  annual  uranium 
equivalent production.  
 
Finishing off, I want to point out that the Paladin team has been an incredible asset for shareholders in 
improving the sustainability of our business.   A number of valued team members left our business in 
FY2016 due to necessary headcount reductions.  The remaining team members have ‘pulled together’ 
by  doing  more  with  less  and  in  many  cases  lower  pay  scales.    Paladin’s  team  members  are  world 
class experts in their respective fields and have operated very diligently to deliver results that protect 
the interests of shareholders. I personally am thankful for the efforts of the team. 
  
 
Yours faithfully
ALEXANDER MOLYNEUX

LANGER HEINRICH MINE (LHM) 
 
Paladin  through  its  Namibian  subsidiary,  Langer  Heinrich  Uranium  (Pty)  Ltd  75%  and  CNNC 
Overseas Uranium Holding Limited 25% 
 
Following  the  sale  of  a  25%  equity  stake  to  CNNC  Overseas  Uranium  Holding  Limited  (CNNC),  a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of China National Nuclear Corporation, Paladin owns 75% of LHM in Namibia 
through its Namibian subsidiary, Langer Heinrich Uranium (Pty) Ltd (LHUPL).   Paladin purchased the 
Langer  Heinrich  project  in  August  2002  and,  following  development  and  construction,  production 
commenced  from  the  open  pit  mine  and  conventional  alkaline  leach  plant  in  early  2007,  with annual 
production  of  2.7Mlb  of  U3O8  achieved  in  FY2009.    Soon  afterwards,  a  Stage  2  expansion  was 
undertaken to increase production to 3.7Mlb pa  U3O8, followed by construction and commissioning of 
the Stage 3 expansion, completed in FY2012 resulting in production over 5Mlb.   
 
Langer Heinrich is a surficial, calcrete type uranium deposit containing a Mineral Resource of 56,298t 
U3O8 at a grade of 0.047% U3O8 in the Measured and Indicated categories (including ROM stockpiles) 
in seven mineralised zones designated Detail 1 to 7 (see figure below), along the length of the Langer 
Heinrich valley within the 15km length of a contiguous paleodrainage system.  The deposit is located 
in the Namib Desert, 80km from the major seaport of Walvis Bay.
Operations 
 
Langer Heinrich produced 4.763Mlb (2,161t) U3O8 in FY2016, down 5% from the previous year’s total 
of 5.137Mlb (2,284t) U3O8.  Recoveries through the plant decreased by 1.3% from the previous year to 
86.3% with a decrease in feed grade of 9% to 699ppm.  Plant throughput increased by 5% to 3.57 Mt.
With the continued decline in uranium price, initiatives to reduce the operating and unit costs at LHM 
continued  to  be  the  principal  focus  of  attention,  with  a  number  of  improvements  again  identified  and 
implemented.    The  BRP  continues  to  perform  well  above  design  expectations  and  after  a  minor 
modification  to  improve  performance  further  has  stabilised  well.    This  technology  may  now  be 
considered  established  and  offers  a  great  deal  of  further  potential  benefit.    Since  the  introduction  of 
BRP, reagent costs per pound U3O8 have reduced by almost 5% and almost all of this reduction is due 
to  BRP,  although  foreign  exchange  rate  movements  have  also  contributed  beneficially.    The  BRP 
involves leading edge technology for which Paladin has developed and owns the intellectual property.  
Suitable patent protection has been applied for to protect this very valuable intellectual property asset 
that is expected to have broad application throughout the uranium processing sector.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS (continued)
Future production and possible expansion options to allow the treatment of much lower feed grade ore 
remain under development, with significant progress being achieved.  Various evaluations have been 
completed  or  planned  on  piloting  and  testing  programmes  to  test  the  most  promising  options  and 
enhancements.    The  goal  of  this  work  is  to  increase  production  at  lower  ore  grades  with  lower  unit 
costs.    The  focus  is  also  on  improved  process  efficiencies  and  operability  and  the  BRP  is  a  good 
example of the nature of outcomes being sought.   
 
A  focus  on  cost  reduction  and  efficiency  again  remains  at  the  forefront  going  into  FY2017  with  an 
expectation of further significant future benefits.

Ore Reserve has been depleted for mining to the end of June 2016.  
 
The  Ore  Reserve  was  estimated  from  the  original  un-depleted  Measured  and  Indicated  Mineral 
Resource of 151.8Mt at a grade of 0.054% U3O8.  During the year the Mineral Resource estimate for 
the  project  was  updated  to  incorporate  all  the  additional  drilling  completed  on  site  since  2010.    The 
additional Reverse Circulation (RC) drilling amounted to some 29,954 holes for 1,044,922m added to 
the resource dataset.  It also allowed for an important increase in the definition of the non-mineralised 
basement profile.  This updated basement profile was then used to further refine the Ore Reserve pit 
design. The Mineral Resource estimate was completed using Multi-Indicator Kriging and incorporates 
a  specific  adjustment  based  on  expected  mining  parameters  which  have  now  been  adjusted  from 
those used in the 2010 Mineral Resource to incorporate information derived from actual mining.  As a 
result,  additional  dilution  and  mining  recovery  are  not  included  in  the  Ore  Reserve  estimation. 
Changes from the 2010 Mineral Resource have been a significant transfer on material from Indicated 
to  Measured  category  and  a  substantial  reduction  in  Inferred  material  due  to  the  increased  drilling 
density.  Overall  there  was  a  less  than  1%  reduction  in  contained  metal.  Differences  between  the 
updated Ore Reserve are related to depletion due to mining, refinement of the pit design based on the 
new basement profile and better definition of mineralisation edges due to increased drilling density and 
removal of material from the Ore Reserve as a result of on-going conversion of existing pits to tailings 
facilities.  There  has  been  no  change  to  either  the  Mineral  Resource  or  Ore  Reserve  cut-off  grades, 
both remaining at 250ppm.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS (continued)
These  reserves  form  the  basis  of  the  continuing  life  of  mine  plan  for  the  Project.    The  revised  mine 
plan allows a project life of 20 years, based on current processing feed rates.  
 
Exploration (EPL3500) 
 
EPL3500 previously covered the western extension of the mineralised Langer Heinrich paleochannel. 
An  application  to  convert  the  EPL  to  a  mining  lease  has  progressed  through  the  regulatory  process 
and  is  with  the  Minister  awaiting  final  approval.    During  the  year  a  test  passive  seismic  survey  was 
conducted in order to cost effectively determine the likely basement location with promising results. It 
is expected that the survey area will be significantly expanded in the 2017 financial year.  
 
MALAWI  
 
KAYELEKERA MINE (KM) 
 
Kayelekera  Mine  (KM),  which  is  currently  on  care  and  maintenance  (C&M),  is  located  in  northern 
Malawi,  600km  north  of  the  country’s  capital  city,  Lilongwe,  and  52km  west  of  the  regional 
administrative and commercial centre of Karonga. 
 
Kayelekera is a sandstone-hosted uranium deposit, associated with the Permian Karoo sediments and 
hosted  by  the  Kayelekera  member  of  the  North  Rukuru  sedimentary  outcrop  of  the  Karoo  System.  
The mineralisation  is  associated  with seven  variably  oxidised, coarse grained arkoses,  separated by 
shales  and  mudstones.    Uranium  mineralisation  occurs  as  lenses,  primarily  within  the  arkose  layers 
and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  in  the  mudstone.    The  lowest  level  of  known  mineralisation  is  at  a  depth  of 
approximately 160m below surface. 
 
Kayelekera is owned  100% by  Paladin (Africa) Limited (PAL),  an 85% subsidiary of Paladin.  In July 
2009, Paladin issued 15% of the equity in PAL to the Government of Malawi (GoM) under the terms of 
the  Development  Agreement  signed  between  PAL  and  the  Government  in  February  2007,  which 
established  the  fiscal  regime  and  development  framework  for  KM.  PAL  operates  KM  under  the 
provisions  of  Environmental  Certificate  27.3.1,  granted  in  March  2007,  following  approval  of  the 
Kayelekera  Project  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  and  Mining  Licence  ML152,  granted  in 
April  2007.  ML152  covers  an  area  of  some  55km²  surrounding  the  Kayelekera  deposit  and  was 
granted for  a period  of  15 years,  renewable for  further  10-year  periods.    The  EIA  contained a Social 
Impact  Assessment  and  Management  Plan,  which  was  implemented  during  the  construction  and 
operational  phases  of  KM,  with  certain  components  continuing  during  C&M.    Under  the  terms  of  the 
Development  Agreement,  PAL  has  undertaken  various  corporate  social  responsibility  (CSR) 
obligations  in  relation  to  operation  of  a  Social  Responsibility  Plan,  Local  Business  Development  and 
Community Consultation. 
 
Construction took place in 2007-9 and KM operated for five years from 2009-2014, producing a total of 
10.7Mlb  U3O8  in  that  period.    As  a  consequence  of  sustained  losses  due  to  low  prevailing  uranium 
prices  in  the  wake  of  the  2011  Fukushima  incident,  production  at  KM  was  suspended  in  May  2014. 
The  operation  was  placed  on  C&M  until  such  time  as  economic  conditions  improve  sufficiently  to 
enable  KM  to  resume  production  with  sustained  profitability.    More  than  50%  of  the  project’s  total 
reserves  and  resources  remain  for  future  development.  This  is  sufficient  to  provide  for  2.5Mlb  pa  of 
production,  with the  potential  to produce strong  cash  flows  for  at  least  another  six  years.    Additional 
regional exploration has the potential to extend that further.  
 
C&M Operations 
 
KM completed its second full year on C&M, with no production since May 2014 and no sales revenue 
since December 2014.  The key focus at KM remains: ensuring the safety of C&M personnel and the 
security  of  the  project  assets;  maintaining  idled  plant  and  equipment  in  a  fit  state  of  readiness  to 
facilitate a rapid restart of operations when a decision is made to do so; maintaining legal and social 
obligations  encompassing  community  relations,  environmental  and  radiological  monitoring;  and 
treating and discharging surplus water stocks at KM to reduce KM’s water balance prior to the onset of 
the next rainfall season.

During  production,  rainfall  run-off  water  captured  in the operational  area was  stored on  site and  was 
recycled  for  use in processing  of  uranium  ore.  Since the  operation went  on C&M,  this  has  no longer 
been  occurring,  necessitating  the  controlled  release  of  treated  water  in  order  to  reduce  KM’s  water 
balance  prior  to  the  onset  of  the  next  rainfall  season.  PAL  modified  a  section  of  the  KM  processing 
plant  to  treat  water  to  remove  contaminants  prior  to  release  to  meet  internationally  recognised 
standards.  
 
PAL’s license to treat and release water was renewed by the GoM in October 2014 for the 2015 wet 
season,  with  the  government  maintaining  the  prior  strict  conditions  regulating  critical  water  quality 
parameters,  including  the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  drinking  water  guideline  for  uranium 
content.  Controlled  treated  water  release  recommenced  in  January  2016  and  continued  without 
incident. In late June, discharge was again suspended due to the very low receiving water level in the 
local  river  system.    Comprehensive  monitoring  of  samples  has  been  undertaken  at  the  end  of  the 
discharge  outlet  and  upstream  and  downstream  from  KM.  At  30  June  2016  water  inventories  had 
reduced  in  the  two  major  storage  ponds  and  the  dams  are  on  track  to  reach  their  pre-wet  season 
targets and are well below the levels for the same period last year.  
 
A  feasibility  study  for  recommencement  of  production  at  KM  was  completed  during  the  year,  results 
showed  that  KM  remains  a  valuable  strategic  asset  that  can  be  quickly  returned  to  production  when 
justified  by  a  higher  uranium  price  environment.    This  study  will  be  reviewed  and  updated  in  the 
coming year. 
 
Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves Estimation 
 
Mineral  Resources  and  Ore  Reserves  are  unchanged  from  those  reported  in  2014.    As  part  of  the 
Kayelekera re-start study it is expected that an updated Mineral Resource will be completed which will 
incorporate  previous  drilling  undertaken  to  the  west  of  the  current  pit.    This  extensional  drilling  only 
intersected  mineralisation  at  depth  and,  given  the  current  and  projected  uranium  prices,  this  is  not 
expected to contribute to additional Ore Reserves.  
 
Mineral  Resources  and  Ore  Reserves  conforming  to  both  the  JORC(2004)  code  and  NI  43-101  are 
detailed below.

Exploration 
 
The exploration group continues to work in areas close to the mine in order to identify any additional 
targets  within  easy  access  of  the  processing  plant.    Whilst  mineralised  areas  have  been  identified 
these  are  not  currently  considered  attractive  enough  to  warrant  drilling.    This  activity  is  expected  to 
continue until all the Karoo sandstone outcrop areas within the vicinity have been covered.   
 
The Malawian Government is currently implementing a new Cadastral system and is in the process of 
introducing  a  new  mining  act.    The  company  was  expecting  that,  while  this  was  in  progress  a 
moratorium on the grant of new licences would be in place however the company was notified of the 
grant of two of its applications – EPL417 Rukuru and EPL418 Uliwa.  Whilst some work is expected to 
be performed on both licences, due to current market conditions the company has applied for a waiver 
from the expenditure commitments on both. The other 3 licences are still in application. 
 
CANADA 
 
MICHELIN PROJECT 
 
Paladin  Energy  Ltd,  through  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary  Aurora  Energy  Ltd  (Aurora),  holds  rights  to 
91,500  hectares  within  the  Central  Mineral  Belt  of  Labrador  (CMB),  Canada,  approximately  140km 
north of Happy Valley-Goose Bay and 40km southwest of the community of Postville.   
 
Paladin  completed  the  acquisition  of  Aurora  in  February  2011  and,  in  March  2012,  the  Nunatsiavut 
Government, a regional, aboriginal government formed in 2005, lifted the three year moratorium on the 
mining, development and production of uranium on Labrador Inuit Land.  Five of Paladin’s six deposits 
in this project area fall within these lands.  Paladin started exploration in the summer of 2012.  
 
Aurora  claims  cover  a  significant  area  of  prospective  ground  over  the  CMB.    The  CMB  contains 
 Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources as well as an additional 
publically reported 83.9Mlb U3O8
86.6Mlb  U3O8  Inferred  Mineral  Resource  in  12  deposits,  half  of  which  are  covered  by  the  Aurora 
tenements.  The largest of these deposits is Michelin, the flagship of Aurora’s CMB project and one of 
the world’s top five albitite-hosted resources.   
 
On 26 June 2014, Paladin announced a revised Mineral Resource estimate for the Michelin Deposit, 
conforming  to  both  the  JORC(2012)  Code  and  Canadian  National  Instrument  43-101.    The  updated 
Mineral  Resource  Estimate  for  the  deposit  has  provided  added  confidence  in  the  character  of  the 
mineralisation with the significant increase in Measured and Indicated category material.  Importantly, 
in addition, the near surface open pittable portion of the deposit now contains a substantial increase in 
both uranium grade and contained metal. 
 
Over  the  last  financial  year  Aurora  carried  out  an  extensive  soil  survey  during  the  northern  summer 
field season in order to better define the mineralised trends within the Michelin – Rainbow (MRT) area.  
The results from the soil survey will be combined with a comprehensive geophysical data compilation 
and analysis exercise conducted by Condor Consulting.  It is expected that the results from this data 
integration will allow for the definition of additional targets in the region and will aid in the identification

of  ‘blind’  mineralisation.    Additional  infill  geochemical  surveys  are  planned  for  the  northern  summer 
season commencing September 2016 to identify drill targets in this zone. 
 
Additional Potential 
 
The Michelin Deposit is still open along strike and at depth.  Drilling programmes have already  been 
designed  to  both  infill  and  extend  the  existing  Mineral  Resource  and  these  will  be  executed  when 
conditions allow.  In addition, there are also a number of promising targets within the MRT and wider 
CMB,  which  are  currently  being  explored  and  are  expected  to  contribute  to  the  economic  viability  of 
the project.  Mineral Resources for deposits within the Michelin project are detailed below.

Exemption from Non-Resident Ownership Restriction 
 
On 22 June 2015  Paladin received notification from the Canadian Government that its submission to 
be  the  majority  owner  of  a  uranium  mine  at  the  Michelin  Project  has  been  approved.    Under  the 
current Non-Resident Ownership Policy (NROP), non-resident mining companies can own 100% of an 
exploration  project  but,  by  the  stage  of  first  production,  there  must  be  a  minimum  level  of  Canadian 
resident ownership in individual uranium mining projects of 51%. 
 
This  posed  an  obvious  limitation  to  the  Michelin  Project.    Given  the  Company’s  global  mining 
experience  and  reputation,  it  has  always  considered  itself  as  an  owner/operator  of  its  uranium 
projects.    The  granting  of  an  exemption  from  NROP  allowing  Paladin  to  proceed  eventually  to 
production  at  the  Michelin  Project  will  permit  Paladin  to  introduce  a  suitable  minority  joint  venture 
partner at the appropriate time should this be desired. 
 
QUEENSLAND  
 
In  early  2015,  the  Queensland  Government  reinstated  the  previous  ban  on  uranium  mining.    This 
decision has caused Paladin to slow the development of its uranium holdings in the Mount Isa region 
of northwest Queensland.   
 
Paladin  has  an  82.08%  majority  shareholding  in  Summit  Resources  Limited  (Summit)  acquired  in 
2007.  Summit’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Summit  Resources (Aust) Pty  Ltd (SRA), operates the Isa 
Uranium  Joint  Venture  (IUJV)  and  the  Mount  Isa  North  Project  (MINP).    Additionally,  the  company 
wholly owns the Valhalla North Project (VNP) immediately to the north of the MINP area.   
 
The  three  projects  include  10  deposits  containing  106.2Mlb  U3O8  Measured  and  Indicated  Mineral 
Resources  as  well  as  42.2Mlb  U3O8  Inferred  Mineral  Resources.    The  bulk  of  the  mineralisation  is 
concentrated  in  the  Valhalla  deposit.    Of  this,  95.8Mlb  U3O8  Measured  and  Indicated  Mineral 
Resources as well as 37.4Mlb U3O8 Inferred Mineral Resources are attributable to Paladin.  51.4% of 
the  Mineral  Resources  are  located  at  Valhalla;  the  rest  is  distributed  over  the  Bikini,  Skal,  Odin, 
Andersons,  Mirrioola,  Watta,  Warwai,  Duke  Batman  and  Honeypot  deposits.    The  table  below  lists

geochemical assay and downhole radiometric logging.  
 
Metallurgical test work on all the deposits completed during the  year has, to a large extent, validated 
the previous assumptions. The mineralisation from all of the deposits can be radiometrically sorted to 
a greater or lesser extent with no appreciable increase in deleterious gangue materials. Other forms of 
mineral sorting may be trialled in the future to improve the sorting efficiency of some of the deposits.

Follow  on  alkaline  leach  test  work  also  indicates  that  the  material  from  all  of  the  deposits  can  be 
leached  using  this  methodology,  though  with  variable  levels  of  uranium  recovery  broadly  in  line  with 
the  work  previously  undertaken. Work  in  the  future  will  be  focussed  on  optimising  the  potential  flow 
sheet, improving recoveries in both the sorting and leach steps and analysing reagent consumption in 
order to better define the economics of all of the projects. 
 
The exploration is managed through separate projects, the locations are shown  in the following map

ISA URANIUM JOINT VENTURE (IUJV) 
Summit Resources (Aust) Pty Ltd (SRA) 50% and Manager 
Mount Isa Uranium Pty Ltd (MIU) 50% 
 
The IUJV covers ground containing the Valhalla, Odin and Skal uranium deposits 40km north of Mount 
Isa. Mineral Resource estimates are included in the table on the previous page. 
 
Participants in the joint operation are SRA and Mount Isa Uranium Pty Ltd (MIU), each holding a 50% 
interest, with SRA as manager. MIU is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Valhalla Uranium Pty Ltd (VUL), a 
formerly  public  company  and  now  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  Paladin.  Paladin’s  effective 
participating  interest  in  the  IUJV  is  91.04%  through  its  ownership  of  82.08%  of  the  issued  capital  of 
Summit.  
 
Ground subject to the IUJV covers 17.24km2 at Valhalla and 10km2 at Skal.  These two areas lie within 
a larger holding of contiguous tenements of 934km2 held 100% and managed by SRA and Paladin as 
outlined  in  the  map  above.  Valhalla  is  now  covered  by  MDL510  and  Skal  by  MDL517  which  also 
includes the Bikini and Mirrioola Deposits.  
 
MOUNT ISA NORTH PROJECT (MINP) 
 
The  MINP  is  located  10  to  70km  north  and  east  of  Mount  Isa  and  contains  numerous  uranium 
prospects.    The  area  is  100%  held  and  managed  by  SRA  utilising  Paladin  staff  and  expertise. 
Exploration  continues  on  MINP  where  Summit  holds  934km2  of  granted  tenements  that  are 
prospective  for  uranium,  copper  and  base  metals.    In  early  2015  the  Queensland  Government 
extended  the  licences  for  a  further  three  years  to  2018.    The  tenements  are  centred  on  the  city  of 
Mount Isa.  The project includes the Bikini, Mirrioola, Watta, Warwai and Andersons uranium deposits 
which  are  covered  by  MDL’s  509,  511  and513  respectively,  as  well  as  numerous  other  uranium 
prospects. Mineral Resource estimates are shown in the table on page 17. 
 
VALHALLA NORTH PROJECT (VNP) 
 
The VNP is located on EPM 12572 totalling 70km2, situated approximately 80km north of the Valhalla 
deposit.  The geological setting is similar to the Summit/Paladin projects to the south where albitised 
basalts with interbedded metasediments are mineralised along east-west and north-south structures in 
Eastern Creek Volcanics.  The project includes the Duke Batman and Honey Pot deposits (covered by 
MDL’s 507 and 508 respectively) and Mineral Resource estimates for these deposits are listed in the 
table on page 17. 
 
QUEENSLAND URANIUM POLITICS  
 
The expectation in Queensland is that a conservative government will strongly support uranium mining 
while  a  Labor  government  (under  current  policy)  will  not  permit  it.    After  the  Labor  government  was 
elected in March 2015 it indicated that it would continue to allow exploration for uranium but would not 
permit mining, this situation is expected to remain until such time as there is a change in government.

MANYINGEE URANIUM PROJECT (Manyingee) 
 
Manyingee is located in the north-west of Western Australia, 1,100km north of Perth and 85km inland 
from the coastal township of Onslow.  The property is comprised of three mining leases covering 1,307 
hectares.    Paladin  purchased  Manyingee  in  1998  from  Afmeco  Mining  and  Exploration  Pty  Ltd 
(AFMEX), a subsidiary of Cogema from France.  
 
Between 1973 and 1984, approximately 400 holes were drilled by the previous owners to establish the 
extent  and  continuity  of  the  sediment-hosted  uranium  mineralisation  contained  in  permeable 
sandstone  in  paleochannels.    Field  trials  by  AFMEX  demonstrated  that  the  Manyingee  sandstone-
hosted uranium deposit is amenable to extraction by in-situ recovery (ISR).   
 
In 2012, Paladin drilled 96 holes for 9,026m of Rotary Mud and 242m of PQ core.  The drilling resulted 
in  a  new  geological  model  and,  on  14  January  2014,  Paladin  announced  an  updated  Mineral 
Resource  for  the  Manyingee  Project.    The  Mineral  Resource  estimate  conforms  to  both  the 
JORC(2012) Code and NI 43-101.

The  geology  of  the  deposit  is  well  understood,  having  been  subject  to  extensive  exploration  over  a 
number  of  years  with  the  stratigraphic  sequence  being  defined  by  the  comprehensive  dataset  of 
downhole electric logs.  A total of 35 water bores, in place since 2012, are used for ongoing monitoring 
of  physical  and  chemical  properties  of  the  aquifer  containing  the  uranium  mineralisation.    Paladin 
believes that the Mineral Resources on the mining leases can be increased and that commencement 
of production at the project can be achieved within a 4-5 year time frame.   
 
Following  the  receipt  of  the regional  and  local  scale  hydrological  study  from  consultants  CDM  Smith 
the company is progressing its application for a small scale field leach trial (FLT).  It is expected that 
the formal application will be submitted to the Department of Mines and Petroleum late in the second 
half of CY2016.  
 
On  the  21st  July  2016  the  company  announced  that  it  had  signed  a  binding  terms  sheet  with  MGT 
Resources Limited (MGT) for it to acquire up to 75% of the Manyingee project in a two stage process. 
The first stage, upon closing of the transaction, is that MGT will acquire 30% of the Manyingee project 
for  a  US$10M  cash  payment  and  will  form  a  joint  venture  over  the  project  with  the  company 
(Manyingee JV).  MGT  will  have the  option  of  acquiring an  additional  45%  of  the  Manyingee JV  from 
the company for US$20 in cash, exercisable for a period of 12 months following the Manyingee JV’s 
preparation of a plan to conduct an FLT. Also under the terms of the agreement, various share options 
are also available to both parties. 
 
CARLEY BORE 
 
The  company  completed  the  purchase  of  the  Carley  Bore  project  from  Energia  Minerals  Limited 
(EMX) early in FY2016.  Consisting of three contiguous exploration licences, this new project area is 
located 100km  south of  Paladin’s  Manyingee  Uranium  Project  (Manyingee)  as  shown  in  the  location 
map.    The  Carley  Bore  deposit,  as  estimated  by  EMX,  contains  an  Indicated  Mineral  Resource  of 
5.0Mlb  U3O8  grading  420ppm  and  an  Inferred  Mineral  Resource  of  10.6Mlb  U3O8  grading  280ppm 
(JORC (2012)) at a cut-off grade of 150ppm U3O8.

Carley Bore and Manyingee Tenement Package Location
This  acquisition  has  increased  the  Company’s  JORC  (2012)  Indicated  Mineral  Resources  within  the 
area by more than 30% to 20.7Mlb U3O8 at a grade of 680ppm, and the Inferred Mineral Resources by 
more than 100% to 20.9Mlb at a grade of 415ppm.  Carley Bore remains open to the north and south 
and  Paladin  believes  there  is  excellent  potential  within  this  land  package  to  increase  this  resource 
base by at least a further 15Mlb to 25Mlb.

The  large  tenement  package  contains  geology  similar  to  that  which  hosts  the  Carley  Bore  and 
Manyingee  deposits  as  well  as  numerous  identified  regional  drill  anomalies  which  offer  additional 
targets warranting follow-up investigation.  The established resource inventory and potential upside of 
the  combined tenement  portfolio  will  ensure  that  a  single  ISR  facility  in the region is  able to operate 
with a long processing life.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS (continued)
The potential to develop a significant mining operation with a long mine life extending well beyond 20 
years  within a new uranium district is compelling.  In-house studies indicate the acquisition  of Carley 
Bore  will  be  value  accretive  independent  of  the  significant  resource  upside  Paladin  considers 
exploration may deliver. 
 
Exploration  drilling  is  planned  to  start  in  October  2016  and  will  focus  on  resource  drilling  at  Carley 
Bore as well as limited regional exploration to test potential for additional uranium deposits.   
 
OOBAGOOMA URANIUM PROJECT (Oobagooma) 
 
The  Oobagooma  Project  (held  100%)  is  located  in  the  West  Kimberley  region  of Western  Australia, 
1,900km  north-north-east  of  Perth  and 75km  north-east  of  the  regional  centre of  Derby.    The  project 
now comprises one application for an EPL covering approximately 450km². 
 
In 1998, Paladin acquired a call option in relation to the purchase of Oobagooma.   This arrangement 
was more recently varied so that Paladin Energy Minerals NL is now the applicant and will, upon the 
anticipated grant, hold the exploration licence directly.  
 
The  Oobagooma  project  area  was  explored  by  AFMEX  between  1983  and  1986,  during  which  time 
extensive  zones  of  uranium  mineralisation  were  discovered.  AFMEX  identified  a  historic  resource  of 
21.9Mlb  U3O8  at  0.12%  U3O8  with  a  0.035%  cut-off.    Paladin  has  classified  this  mineralisation  as  an 
exploration target, but, after examining the  AFMEX data,  Paladin believes that following  validation of 
all  existing  data,  there  is  good  potential  to  upgrade  the  exploration  target  within  the  area  to  40  to 
50Mlb U3O8. 
 
Previous tonnages, grades, assays and other technical data for Oobagooma are taken from historical 
records prior to the implementation of JORC or NI 43-101. While the data are believed to have been 
acquired, processed and disclosed by persons believed to be technically competent, it is unverifiable 
at  present.  A  Competent  Person  as  defined  under  the  JORC  Code  or  Qualified  Person  as  defined 
under  NI  43-101  has  not  done  sufficient  work  to  classify  the  historical  estimate  as  current  Mineral 
Resources. Paladin is not treating any historical estimates as current Mineral Resources as defined in 
either the JORC Code or NI 43-101 and the historical estimates should not be relied upon. 
 
 
BIGRLYI JOINT VENTURE (BJV) 
Energy Metals Limited 53.29% and Manager 
Northern Territory Uranium Pty Ltd 41.71%

The  BJV  covers  ten  granted  Exploration  Licences  in  Retention  (ELRs),  two  granted  Exploration 
Licences  (ELs),  and  a  number  of  applications  all  located  in  the  Ngalia  Basin  approximately  320km 
north-west  of  Alice  Springs  in  the  Northern  Territory.  Participants  in  the  Project  are  Energy  Metals 
Limited  (53.29%  and  Manager),  Northern  Territory  Uranium  Pty  Ltd  (a  wholly-  owned  subsidiary  of 
Paladin) (41.71%) and Southern Cross Exploration NL (5%).  
 
Energy Metals Limited (EME), as the Manager of the BJV, announced in June 2011 the completion of 
a Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) for the Bigrlyi Project showing that, under current market conditions, it is 
not economically viable.  A substantial increase in the resource base that has been identified to date is 
required,  especially  resources  amenable  to  open  pit  mining  to  help  the  economic  outcome  of  this 
project.  EME is exploring the wider Ngalia Basin for additional resources on its 100% owned licences.   
 
In  late  June  2011,  EME  released  an  updated  Mineral  Resource  estimate,  conforming  to  both  the 
JORC(2004)  guidelines  and  NI  43-101,  based  on  all  drilling  to  date.    The  breakdown  of  Mineral 
Resource category is detailed below and is reported at a 500ppm U3O8 cut-off grade.

ANGELA-PAMELA PROJECT 
 
Angela is a sandstone-hosted roll-front type uranium deposit (held 100% by Paladin) with an Inferred 
Mineral  Resource  of  30.8Mlb  U3O8  at  0.13%  U3O8  located  in  the  Amadeus  Basin  of  Australia’s 
Northern Territory, approximately 25km from Alice Springs.   
 
In November 2006, Cameco Australia Pty Ltd (Cameco) and Paladin, in a 50:50 joint venture, won a 
tender in competition with numerous other applicants, for an Exploration Licence covering the Angela 
and Pamela uranium prospects.  
 
The joint venture conducted drilling programmes during 2009 and 2010, including 172  holes totalling 
32,810m.  Cameco formally  withdrew  from  the  joint venture in 2013  after  determining that  the  project 
did not meet its investment criteria at that time and Paladin then assumed 100% ownership.  
 
The Mineral Resource estimate is based on 794 holes totalling 180,468m and covers the Angela (1 to 
5) and Pamela deposits.  The mineralisation plunges shallowly, approximately 9°, to the west and the 
resource of the larger of the deposits, Angela 1, has been defined up to 4.3km to the west at depths 
up to 600m and remains open.   
 
The cut-off for the Mineral Resource is a combination of grade greater than or equal to 300ppm  U3O8 
and  thickness  greater  than  0.5m.    The  Mineral  Resource  estimate  conforms  to  the  JORC(2004) 
Guidelines and complies with NI 43-101.

additional work has been performed on the project. 
 
NIGER (West Africa) 
 
PROJECT AGADEZ 
 
Due  to  the  on-going  security  situation  in  Niger  and  the  likelihood  of  difficulty  in  renewing  the 
company’s  licences  when  they  became  due  the  company  has  now  formally  returned  the  3  licences 
and 1 application back to the Nigerien government and has withdrawn from the country.  
 
MINERAL RESOURCE AND ORE RESERVE SUMMARY 
 
The following tables detail the Company’s Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves and the changes that 
have occurred  within FY2016.    The  only  changes  to  Mineral  Resource  and Ore  Reserve  information 
were due to a combination of Mineral Resource update in  incorporate additional drilling, depletion for 
mining to 30 June 2016 at Langer Heinrich as well as minor reductions due to the establishment of in-
pit  tailings  facilities  which  have  sterilised  some  mined-out  areas  within  the  resource/reserve,  the 
surrender  of  tenements  in  Niger  and the addition  of  a  number  of  small  deposits  in the  Joint  Venture 
with Energy Metals.  There were no other material changes to the Company’s Mineral Resources and 
Ore Reserves.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS (continued)
The company’s current focus is on defining a more reasonable processing route  for material from its 
Tumas  calcrete  deposits  and  to  this  end  has  delivered  a  large  bulk  sample  from  the  Tumas  Zone  1 
deposit to Marenica Energy  Ltd’s U-pgrade testwork programme early in CY2016. The company  has 
reported encouraging results from the testwork and has successfully  demonstrated that upgrading of 
uranium into a low mass concentrate is feasible. 
 
The  company  is  currently  pursuing  a  mineral  resource  update  for  the  Tumas  Zone  1  and  Zone  2 
deposits incorporating an updated geological model based on information sourced from the recent infill 
drilling and bulk sampling exercise.

During  the  year,  LHM  reported  five  LTIs,  of  which  two  were  LHM  employees  and  three  were 
contractors.  The site’s annual LTIFR decreased from 3.0 to 2.3 with the decrease being attributed to a 
continued focus on safety, health, and radiation (SHR) management and training. 
 
The  mine’s  2016  NOSA  grading  audit,  resulted  in  the  operation  retaining  a  4  Star  Platinum  (Health, 
Safety  and  Environment)  grade  rating.    The  resulting  audit  score  of  84.4%  is  an  increase  over  the 
previous years result of 82.6%.   
 
LHM  has  continued  to  focus  on  training,  further  up-skilling  and  broadening  of  the  employees  and 
contractors  safety  and  health  knowledge  base  to  ensure  a  safer  work  environment.    This  focus  also 
extended to incident investigation with both management and supervisory personnel receiving training 
on the Incident Cause Analysis Method. 
 
LHM  is  actively  involved  with  the  Namibian  Uranium  Association,  a  leading  source  of  advocacy, 
training and research on uranium, health and safety related issues.  LHM participates in the Chamber 
of  Mines  Safety  Committee  who  together  with  a  group  of  Mines  Safety  Managers  conduct  quarterly 
peer safety reviews.   
 
The 2015 Annual Radiation Report4 was compiled and delivered to the Namibian Radiation Protection 
Authority (NRPA) in March 2016.  Radiation doses (excluding natural background) reported include:  
 
 
 

The mean dose to Designated Workers was 1.3 mSv, compared with 3.1 mSv in 2014;  
The dose to Non-Designated Workers was 1.2 mSv (compared to 1.6 mSv in 2014); and  
The dose to a hypothetical group living on the site boundary (Remote Gate) for the entire 2015 
year  would have been 2.2  mSv (including natural background).  This compares with the mean 
world member of the public dose as reported by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the 
Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) of 2.4 mSv.
Kayelekera Mine 
 
KM  continues  to  operate  under  care  and  maintenance.    The  site  did  not  report  any  LTIs  during  the 
reporting  period.    The  site’s  annual  LTIFR  decreased  from  1.3  to  0.    KM  has  achieved  726  LTI  free 
days with 1,364,715 man hours worked at 30 June 2016.  This outcome is the result of the continued 
focus on high risk tasks and an emphasis on risk management of these tasks.  The continued in-house 
training  of  employees  concentrating  on  behaviour  based  safety  as  well  as  employees  being  actively 
encouraged  to  report  all  potential  safety  issues  and  incidents  has  led  to  a  reduction  in  workplace 
injuries. 
 
Internal NOSA based health, safety and environment audits were conducted for the period May 2015 
to June 2016.  These audits are aimed at identifying and addressing problems in preparation for the 
next external NOSA audit planned for June 2017. 
 
KM commenced using the “Take 5” risk assessment system during the reporting period.   The Take 5 
system is a straightforward tool used to identify and control hazards before employees start a task.  All 
site personnel receive ongoing training on the use of this system.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
HEALTH & SAFETY (continued)
The  2015  Annual  Dose Report  was  compiled  and  delivered  to all  employees  and contractors  at KM. 
The mean radiation  dose for  workers  for  2015  was  0.1 mSv  as  compared  to 1.9 mSv  in 2014.   This 
lower mean dose for workers can be attributed to the cessation of production with workers no longer 
handling  any  radioactive  material  in  form  of  uranium  ore  and  final  product.    Therefore  there  are  no 
employees or contractors classified as Radiation Workers in the 2015 results.  These workers are now 
grouped into one similar exposure group. 
 
The long lived radioactive dust concentrations and radon decay product concentrations are monitored 
around  the  site  to  provide  an  indication  of  ambient  conditions  and  also  to  provide  baseline  data  for 
when production resumes. 
 
Exploration 
 
Paladin’s exploration activities included soil sampling in Canada and limited ground surveys in Malawi.  
No LTIs were recorded for the year with the LTIFR rate remaining at 0.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Operational overview 
 
The  Group  has  two  uranium  mines  in  Africa5,  uranium  exploration  projects  in  Australia,  Africa  and 
Canada,  and  a  strategy  to  become  a  major  uranium  mining  house.    The  Company  is  incorporated 
under  the  laws  of Western  Australia  with  a  primary  share  market  listing  on  the  Australian  Securities 
Exchange (“ASX”) and additional listings on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) in Canada;  as  well 
as  the  Munich,  Berlin,  Stuttgart  and  Frankfurt  Stock  Exchanges  in  Europe;  and  the  Namibian  Stock 
Exchange in Africa. 
 
LHM 
 
LHM commenced production in 2007 with a capacity  of 2.7Mlb U3O8 pa.  After operating at this level 
for a sustained period of time, construction of the Stage 2 expansion to 3.7Mlb U3O8 pa commenced in 
CY2008.    LHM  reached  the  Stage  2  design  capacity  in  December  2009.    The  plant  consistently 
operated  at  the  3.7Mlb  U3O8  pa  rate  from  the  beginning  of  CY2010.    Construction  of  the  Stage  3 
expansion to 5.2Mlb U3O8 commenced at the beginning of CY2010 and was completed on 31 March 
2012.  Commercial  production  was  declared  from  1  April  2012.    The  plant  achieved  Stage  3  design 
performance in FY2013. 
 
In  FY2014,  the  focus  turned  to  process  innovation  and  production  optimisation.    The  plant  achieved 
record annual production totalling 5.822Mlb6 U3O8 for FY2014, 6% higher than FY2013.  In FY2015 the 
production optimisation strategy continued and focused on the better utilisation of existing equipment, 
operator  and  supervision  training  and  the  further  integration  of  process  control.    Production  was 
5.037Mlb U3O8.  Process innovation was focused on the Bicarbonate Recovery Plant (BRP).  The BRP 
was  commissioned  in  early  March  2015  and  apart  from  minor  downtime  to  complete  priority 
construction  punch  list  items,  the  plant  has  run  continuously  since,  at  or  above  design  throughput.  
The process performance of the plant is substantially better than predicted and bicarbonate recovery 
levels are much higher than forecast.  
 
In  FY2016,  the  plant  achieved  annual  production  of  4.763Mlb  U3O8.  In  the  September  quarter,  plant 
production was affected by a decrease in throughput caused by reduced availability associated with planned 
annual  maintenance  and  equipment  reconfiguration  (e.g.  scrubber  relining  and  reconfiguration  of  BRP).  
Overall recovery was also lower, caused principally by an atypical ore type which was unexpected, but fed 
for  the  whole  quarter  due  to  mine  scheduling  constraints.  In  the  June  quarter,  U3O8  production  was 
impacted  by  a  decrease  in  ore  milled  that  was  associated  with  a  lack  of  recycled  water  from  the 
tailings  system  and  unplanned  mechanical  plant  breakdowns.    Several  new  recovery  bores  were 
drilled and the recycle water system returned to normal operations by the end of July 2016.  
 
An  external review  of LHM’s processing operations  was  undertaken by a third-party  consultant during the 
year, resulting in a number of action items.  Such items include a heavy focus on initiatives to increase plant 
operating  uptime,  which  combined  with  other  innovations  already  in  the  implementation  or  design  phase, 
were rolled out in FY2016 with the remainder scheduled for FY2017. 
 
KM 
 
Construction  of  KM,  with  a  3.3Mlb  U3O8  design  capacity,  commenced  in  2007  and,  after  a  two-year 
construction  phase,  the  mine  entered  its  production  ramp-up  phase  in  CY2009.    KM  continued  to 
ramp-up  its  production  volumes  through  to  July  2010.    Commercial  production  was  declared  from        
1 July 2010.  KM made its first delivery of uranium to customers in December 2009.  During FY2012, 
the  operation  made  substantial  positive  steps  toward  the  design  of  3.3Mlb  U3O8  pa  through  a 
programme  of  plant  upgrades  aimed  at  addressing  bottlenecks.    The  plant  achieved  record  annual 
production totalling 2.963Mlb U3O8 for FY2013, 20% higher than FY2012.  The focus at KM turned to 
production optimisation with the acid recycling (nano-technology) project representing a key element. 
The  acid  recovery  plant  was  operational  up  to  the  cessation  of  ore  processing  and  continued  to 
improve beyond its design criteria.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)

On 7 February 2014, the Company announced that it  was suspending  production at KM and  placing 
the mine on care and maintenance due to the low uranium price and non-profitability of the operation. 
The  plant  operated  until  all  reagents  in  the  supply  chain  were  consumed  to  the  maximum  extent 
possible and the plant ceased production on 6 May 2014.  After a transition period, during which the 
site  was  made  safe,  the  plant  cleaned  and  all  remaining  product  dispatched  to  customers,  the  care 
and maintenance period commenced on 26 May 2014.  During care and maintenance the project will 
be maintained with an adequate component of staffing to keep the project in good working order and 
to preserve the critical aspects of Intellectual Property and operational knowhow. 
 
In FY2016  activities  focused  on  the  water  treatment  programme. Water  treatment  commenced  using 
filtration  in  mid-January  2016  with  potable  quality  water  being  discharged  to  the  local  mine  water 
supply dam.  The renewal of the Water Discharge Licence was received from the Malawi Government 
on 20 January 2016 and discharge off site was commenced in early February 2016 when the on-site 
storages reached threshold capacity. Following the highest February rainfall on record, the lime water 
treatment plant was brought back on line in late February to maximise the volume of water able to be 
discharged  from  the  site  in  conformance  with  the  site’s  Water  Management  Plan  and  Discharge 
Licence.    The  lime water  treatment  plant  ceased  operation on 30 June 2016.    The  membrane  water 
treatment  plant  continues  to  treat  water.  At  30  June  2016  water  inventories  had  reduced  in  the  two 
major  storage  ponds  and  the  dams  are  on  track  to  reach  their  pre-wet  season  targets  and  are  well 
below the levels for the same period last year.  
 
NON-IFRS MEASURES 
 
C1 cost of production 
C1  cost  of  production  =  cost  of  production  excluding  product  distribution  costs,  sales  royalties  and 
depreciation  and  amortisation  before  adjustment  for  impairment.    C1  cost,  which  is  a  non-IFRS 
measure,  is  a  widely  used  ‘industry  standard’  term.    We  use  this  measure  as  a  meaningful  way  to 
compare  our  performance  from  period  to  period.    We  believe  that,  in  addition  to  conventional 
measures  prepared  in  accordance  with  IFRS,  certain  investors  use  this  information  to  evaluate  our 
performance.  C1 cost information (unaudited) has been extracted from the financial statements. For 
an  analysis  of  total  cost  of  sales  refer  to  Note  12  to  the  financial  statements.    Refer  to  page  36  for 
reconciliation. 
 
Underlying EBITDA 
The  Company’s  Earnings  Before  Interest,  Tax,  Depreciation  and  Amortisation  (Underlying  EBITDA) 
represents  profit  before  finance  costs,  taxation,  depreciation  and  amortisation,  impairments,  foreign 
exchange  gains/losses,  restructure  costs  and  other  income.    As  the  mining  industry  is  a  capital-
intensive industry, capital expenditures, the level of gearing and finance costs may have a significant   
impact on the net profit of companies with similar operating results.  Therefore, the Company believes 
underlying EBITDA may be helpful in analysing the  operating results  of a mining company  like itself. 
Although underlying EBITDA is widely used in the mining industry as a benchmark to reflect operating 
performance,  financing  capability  and  liquidity,  it  is  not  regarded  as  a  measure  of  operating 
performance and liquidity under IFRS. Refer to page 35 for reconciliation. 
 
Underlying All-In Cash Expenditure per Pound 
Underlying All-In Cash Expenditure  = total cash cost  of production plus non-production costs, capital 
expenditure, KM care & maintenance expenses, corporate costs, exploration costs and debt servicing 
costs and mandatory repayments. Underlying All-In Cash Expenditure, which is a non-IFRS measure, 
is  widely  used  in  the  mining  industry  as  a  benchmark  to  reflect  operating  performance. We  use  this 
measure as a meaningful way to compare our performance from period to period as it provides a more 
comprehensive view of costs than the cash cost approach. Refer to page 36 for reconciliation.

References  below  to  2016  and  2015  are  to  the  equivalent  year  ended  30  June  2016  and  2015 
respectively. 
 
Revenue  in  2016  decreased  by  7%,  mainly  due  to  a  9%  decrease  in  sales  volume  which  has  been 
partially  offset  by  a  2%  increase  in  realised  sales  price.    There  were  no  sales  from  KM  (2015: 
0.204Mlb, 2014: 3.475Mlb).  The last of KM finished goods were sold in December 2014.   
 
Gross  Profit  in  2016  of  US$13.7M  is  higher  than  the  gross  profit  in  2015  of  US$1.8M  due  to  a  20% 
decrease in cost of sales and a 2% increase in realised sales price, which was partially offset by a 9% 
decrease in sales volume and a higher impairment of inventory at LHM  in 2016 of US$19.2M (2015: 
US$8.0M).  
 
Impairments of US$173.9M were recognised in 2016 (2015: US$241.4M), comprising of a US$168.9M 
impairment of LHM ore stockpiles, US$0.3M (2015: US$1.0M) impairment of the aircraft ahead of its 
sale in January 2016, US$1.5M (2015: US$2.9M) relating to the impairment of the investment in DYL, 
US$2.4M  (2015:  US$Nil)  relating  to  an  obsolescence  write  down  of  stores  and  consumables  at  KM 
and  US$0.8M  (2015:  US$Nil)  relating  to  the  impairment  of  Summit’s  office  building  in  Mount  Isa.    A 
change  in  the  life  of  mine  plan,  in  order  to  preserve  its  integrity,  has  resulted  in  a  change  in  the 
timescale  for  processing  the  LHM  ore  stockpiles.    The  stockpiles  are  now  forecast  to  be  processed 
over the next three years, which due to the lower forecast prices (compared to forecast prices in future 
periods when the stockpiles were originally planned to be processed) has resulted in the net realisable 
value  at  30  June  2016  being  estimated  as  US$Nil.    Additionally  in  2015  there  was  a  US$229.1M 
(US$180.8M  after  tax)  (2016:  US$Nil)  impairment  of  the  Queensland  exploration  assets  and  a 
US$8.4M (2016: US$Nil) impairment of the Bigrlyi exploration asset. 
 
Loss after Tax Attributable to the Members of the Parent for 2016 of US$122.0M is lower than the loss 
of  US$267.8M  in  2015,  and  is  predominantly  due  to  the  impairment  in  2015  of  the  Queensland  and 
Bigrlyi exploration assets (2016: US$Nil), an US$11.9M increase in gross profit, a US$8.7M decrease 
in corporate and marketing costs, a decrease in KM care  and maintenance expenses of US$3.3M, a 
profit on convertible bonds buyback of US$2.2M and a higher income tax benefit of US$83.4M (2015: 
US$38.1M) which has arisen as a result of deferred tax recognised on foreign exchange differences in 
Namibia  and  the  impairment  of  ore  stockpiles  which  have  been  partially  offset  by  a  US$168.9M

impairment  of  LHM  ore  stockpiles,  restructure  costs  of  US$5.3M  (2015:  US$Nil)  and  write  off  of 
US$2.9M  in  facility  establishment  costs  relating  to  the  repayment  of  the  entire  US$56.4M  remaining 
drawn under the LHM syndicated loan facility (2015: US$0.5M).  
 
Segment Information 
The  Namibian  segment  loss  increased  by  US$50.4M,  as  a  result  of  a  9%  decrease  in  sales  volume 
and  a  higher  inventory  impairment  expense,  which  was  partially  offset  by  a  2%  increase  in  realised 
sales  price,  a  20%  decrease  in  total  cost  of  sales  and  an  income  tax  benefit  of  US$84.2M.    The 
Malawian  segment  loss  decreased  by  US$13.1M  as  a  result  of  lower  care  and  maintenance  costs.  
The  exploration  activities  loss  has  decreased  by  US$167.4M  predominantly  due  to  the  2015 
impairment of exploration assets referred to above and the write off of all capitalised costs (US$1.4M) 
relating to the surrender of the licence of Spinifex Well.  In the Unallocated portion, the Group reflected 
the  remaining  Income  Statement  activities,  which  for  2016  comprise  mainly  marketing,  corporate, 
finance and administration  costs.  The loss (costs) in this area has decreased by  US$25.6M through 
the various cost reduction initiatives. 
 
Three Year Trend 
Revenue has decreased by 44% since 2014, due to a 44% decrease in sales volume.  Gross profit in 
2016  of  US$13.7M  is  a turnaround  from  a US$65.1M  gross  loss  in  2014  due  to  there  being a  lower 
impairment  of  inventory  in  2016  US$19.2M  (2014:  US$61.7M  impairment  of  inventory,  stores  and 
consumables  (KM  US$40.7M  and  LHM  US$21.0M).    In  addition,  the  gross  loss  in  2014  included  a 
gross loss before impairments from KM of US$19.6M.

Gross  Loss  in  2016  of  US$12.0M  is  higher  than  the  gross  loss  in  2015  of  US$1.6M  due  to  a  16% 
decrease  in  realised  sales  price  and  higher  impairment  of  inventory  in  2016  of  US$19.2M  (2015: 
US$8.0M).  The gross loss in 2014 included a gross loss before impairments from KM of US$9.2M.  
 
Impairments of US$172.9M were recognised in 2016 (2015:  US$239.7M), comprising of  US$168.9M 
of LHM ore stockpiles discussed earlier, US$0.8M (2015: US$1.2M) relating to the impairment of the 
investment  in  DYL,  US$2.4M  (2015:  US$Nil)  relating  to  an  obsolescence  write  down  of  stores  and 
consumables  at  KM  and  US$0.8M  (2015:  US$Nil)  relating  to  the  impairment  of  Summit’s  office 
building  in  Mount  Isa.  Additionally  in  2015  there  was  a  US$229.1M  (US$180.8M  after  tax)  (2016: 
US$Nil) impairment of the Queensland exploration assets, US$8.4M (2016: US$Nil) impairment of the 
Bigrlyi exploration asset and a US$1.0M (2016: US$Nil) impairment of the aircraft. 
 
Loss after Tax Attributable to the Members of the Parent for 2016 of US$82.7M is lower than the loss 
of  US$195.9M  in  2015,  and  is  predominantly  due  to  the  impairment  in  2015  of  the  Queensland  and 
Bigrlyi exploration assets (2016: US$Nil) which has been partially offset by a US$168.9M impairment 
of LHM ore stockpiles discussed earlier. 
 
Three Year Trend 
Revenue has decreased by 9% since 2014 due to a 9% decrease in realised sales price.  Gross Loss 
in 2016 is US$25.5M lower than the gross loss in 2014 of US$37.5M.  The gross loss in 2014 included 
a gross loss from KM of US$9.2M.

Underlying EBITDA 
 
* LHM production volumes and unit C1 cost of production for the quarters ended December 2014 and September 2014 include 
an adjustment to in-circuit inventory relating to leached uranium within the process circuit.  
 
The unit C1 cost of production for LHM increased 2% over the last year, from US$26.03/lb in the June 
2015 quarter to US$26.60/lb in the June 2016 quarter.  
 
The increase in C1 cash cost of production was largely due to issues with performance of water return 
sumps from LHM tailings storage facility no.3 (TSF3).   This raised C1 cash cost of production due to: 
(i)  the  loss  of  approximately  150,000lb  of  production  and  the  amortisation  of  fixed  cost  elements  of 
production  cost  over  the  lower  overall  volumes;  and  (ii)  an  additional  US$0.89/lb  in  C1  cash  cost 
directly  attributable  to  the  cost  of  purchasing  extra  water  externally  and  increased  soda  ash 
consumption due to the reduction in water recovery from TSF3 which is a major source of soda ash to 
the  circuit.  The  TSF3  return  water  issue  was  largely  resolved  by  31  July  2016  by  drilling  and 
preparation of new return water wells. It is not expected to have a material impact on production going 
forward.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
Total revenue for the quarter ended June 2016 was lower than the comparative quarter, due to lower 
realised  uranium  prices,  which  was  partially  offset  by  higher  sales  volumes.    Total  revenue  for  the 
quarter  ended  March  2016  was  higher  than  the  comparative  quarter,  due  to  higher  sales  volumes 
which  was  partially  offset  by  lower  realised  uranium  prices.    Total  revenue  for  the  quarters  ended 
December  2015  and  September  2015  were  lower  than the  comparative  quarters,  due  to  lower  sales 
volumes which was partially offset by higher realised uranium prices.  Additionally, KM is on care and 
maintenance with production ceasing on 6 May 2014.

Total assets 
Interest bearing loans and borrowings 
Total long-term liabilities 
Net Assets 
 
Cash and Cash  Equivalents have decreased by US$124.5M, mainly as a result of the repurchase of 
US$62.0M of April 2017 Convertible Bonds for US$56.4M (excluding accrued interest), repayment of 
US$60.9M  under  the  LHM  syndicated  loan  facility,  US$5.2M  distribution  to  CNNC  by  way  of 
repayment of loans assigned to CNNC, interest paid of US$27.8M and restructure costs of US$5.3M.  
 
Inventories  have  decreased  by  US$195.7M,  predominantly  due  to  the  US$188.1M  of  impairments 
discussed earlier and a decrease in the number of pounds of finished goods at 30 June 2016 as LHM 
produced 4.763Mlb and sold 4.899Mlb during the year.  
 
Interest  Bearing  Loans  and  Borrowings  have  decreased  by  US$105.3M,  primarily  as  a  result  of  the 
repurchase  of  US$62.0M  of  April  2017  Convertible  Bonds  for  US$56.4M,  repayment  of  US$60.9M 
under  the  LHM  syndicated  loan  facility,  US$5.2M  distribution  to  CNNC  by  way  of  repayment  of 
intercompany  loans  assigned  to  CNNC,  partially  offset  by  the  non-cash  accretion  of  the  convertible 
bonds of US$13.5M.  
 
Segment Assets: Namibian assets have decreased predominantly due to a decrease in inventory and 
property,  plant  and  equipment  which  was  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  cash  and  debtors.  
Malawian  assets  have  decreased  predominantly  as  a  result  of  a  decrease  in  cash  and  a  stores  and 
consumables  obsolescence  write  off.  The  Exploration  segment  assets  have  remained  stable  as  a 
result  of  a  decrease  in  the  US  dollar  value  of  exploration  assets,  due  to  the  weakening  of  the 
Canadian dollar currency against the US dollar, which was offset by the acquisition of the Carley Bore 
Uranium  Deposit  in  Western  Australia  and  capitalised  exploration  expenditure.  In  the  Unallocated 
portion, assets  decreased  primarily  due  to a  decrease in cash and cash equivalents,  which  included 
the  repurchase  of  US$62.0M  of  April  2017  Convertible  Bonds  for  US$56.4M  (excluding  accrued 
interest),  the  US$60.9M  repayment  of  the  LHM  syndicated  loan  facility  and  restructure  costs  of 
US$5.3M.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
liquidity  as  at  30  June  2016,  was  cash  of  US$59.2M  
The  Group’s  principal  source  of 
(30 June 2015: US$183.7M).   Any cash available to be invested is held with Australian banks with a 
minimum AA- Standard & Poor’s credit rating over a range of maturities.  Of this, US$51.2M is held in 
US dollars. 
 
Net Cash Inflow from Operating Activities was US$4.3M in 2016 (2015: outflow US$24.7M), primarily 
due  to  receipts  from  customers  of  US$186.0M  (2015:  US$215.4M)  which  were  partially  offset  by 
payments  to  suppliers  and  employees  of  US$153.8M  (2015:  US$210.9M)  and  net  interest  paid  of 
US$27.3M (2015: US$28.8M).  
 
Net  Cash  Outflow  from  Investing  Activities  was  US$5.3M  in  2016  and  is  due  primarily  to  plant  and 
equipment  acquisitions  of  US$3.8M  at  LHM,  as  well  as  capitalised  exploration  expenditure  of 
US$4.2M (including US$1.2M for the acquisition of the Carley Bore Uranium Deposit).  This has been 
partially offset by US$2.5M received for the sale of the aircraft and US$0.2M received from the sale of 
investments.    The  net  cash  outflow  of  US$15.6M  in  2015  was  primarily  due  to  plant  and  equipment 
acquisitions  of  US$11.5M,  including,  at  LHM,  the  BRP,  nano-filtration  equipment  and  spiral  heat 
exchangers, as well as capitalised exploration expenditure of US$4.2M. 
 
Net Cash Outflow from Financing Activities of US$122.5M in 2016 is attributable to the repurchase of 
US$62M  April  2017  Convertible  Bonds  for  US$56.4M  (excluding  accrued  interest),  repayment  of 
US$60.9M  under  the  LHM  syndicated  loan  facility  and  US$5.2M  distribution  to  CNNC  by  way  of 
repayment  of  intercompany  loans  assigned  to  CNNC.    The  net  inflow  in  2015  of  US$137.6M  was 
attributable  to  the  balance  of  the  proceeds  received  from  the  sale  of  a  25%  interest  in  LHM  of 
US$170M,  proceeds  from  the  entitlement  offer  of  US$119.7M  and  the  share  placement  to  HOPU  of 
US$52.7M,  and  from  the  convertible  bond  issue  of  US$150M,  which  were  partially  offset  by  the 
repurchase  of  the  US$300M  November  2015  convertible  bond,  a  US$39.9M  repayment  of  the  LHM 
project  finance  and  syndicated  loan  facility,  US$1.5M  in  syndicated  loan  facility  establishment  costs, 
US$3.0M in costs attributable to sale of the non-controlling interest in LHM, US$6.2M in equity capital 
raising costs and US$4.2M in convertible bond raising costs.  
 
GOING CONCERN 
 
As at 30 June 2016, the Group had a net current asset deficit of US$139.9M (30 June 2015: surplus 
US$231.8M), including cash on hand of US$59.2M (30 June 2015: US$183.7M).  Included within this 
cash on hand is US$0.6M (30 June 2015: US$31.2M), which is restricted for use in respect of supplier 
guarantees provided by LHM (30 June 2015: restricted for use in respect of the LHM syndicated loan 
facility and supplier guarantees provided by LHM). 
 
The LHM syndicated loan facility was repaid in full on 31 March 2016. 
 
Repayment  obligations  during  the next  twelve months to 30 June 2017 in respect of interest  bearing 
loans and borrowings are summarised as follows:
  Interest  payments  of  US$23.2M  for  the  2012  (due  2017)  and  2015  (due  2020)  unsecured
convertible bonds.
  US$212M principal repayment of 2012 unsecured convertible bonds maturing on 30 April 2017.
The  ability  of  the  Group  to  pay  its  debts  as  and  when  they  fall  due  and  thus  to  continue  as  a  going 
concern  is  dependent upon  the  achievement  of  certain strategic  and  financing initiatives,  as  outlined 
below.
409810_9
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
The Directors are satisfied that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern 
basis, due to:
  The following strategic initiatives announced on 21 July 2016:
40
o  A  non-binding  terms  sheet  signed  with  CNNC  Overseas  Uranium  Holdings  Ltd 
(COUH) (the existing 25% minority shareholder in LHM), to sell a 24% interest in the 
Langer  Heinrich  Mine.    The  sale  is  expected  to  raise  US$175M  in  cash  for  the 
Company with the Company working towards a formal close of the transaction in the 
fourth quarter of the 2016 calendar year.
o  A binding terms sheet signed with MGT Resources Limited (“MGT”) for sale of up to a 
75%  interest  in  the  Company’s  100%  owned  Manyingee  project.  On  closing  of  the 
transaction,  MGT  will  acquire  a  30%  initial  interest  in  Manyingee  for  US$10M  cash 
with an option to acquire an additional 45% interest within twelve months for US$20M 
cash. The transaction is conditional on definitive documentation and a vote of MGT’s 
shareholders expected to be concluded in the fourth quarter of CY2016.

financial  report  does  not  include  adjustments  relating  to  the  recoverability  or  classification  of  the 
recorded  assets  amounts  nor  to  the  amounts  or  classification  of  liabilities  that  might  be  necessary 
should the Group not be able to continue as a going concern.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 
The  preparation  of  the  Financial  Report  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions 
that  affect  the  reported  amount  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and 
liabilities  at the date  of  the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amount of  revenues  and  expenses 
during the reporting period.  Significant areas requiring the use of management estimates relate to the 
determination  of  the  following:  carrying  value  or  impairment  of  inventories,  financial  investments, 
property, plant and equipment, intangibles, mineral properties and deferred tax assets; carrying value 
of  rehabilitation,  mine  closure,  sales  contracts  provisions  and  deferred  tax  liabilities;  and  the 
calculation of share-based payments.  
 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
At  30  June  2016,  the  Group  has  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk,  which  is  the  risk  that  the  Group’s 
financial position will be adversely affected by movements in interest rates that will increase the cost of 
floating rate project finance debt or opportunity losses that may arise on fixed rate convertible bonds in 
a falling interest rate environment. Interest rate risk on cash and short-term deposits is not considered 
to be a material risk due to the historically low US dollar interest rates of these financial instruments. 
 
The Group has no significant monetary foreign currency assets or liabilities apart from Namibian Dollar 
cash,  receivables,  payables  and  provisions  and  Australian  dollar  cash  and,  payables  and  Canadian 
payables. 
 
The  Group  currently  does  not  engage  in  any  hedging  or  derivative  transactions  to  manage  uranium 
price movements, interest rate or foreign currency risks. 
 
The  Group’s  credit  risk  is  the  risk  that  a  contracting  entity  will  not  complete  its  obligation  under  a 
financial  instrument  that  will  result  in a financial  loss  to the  Group.    The  carrying  amount of  financial 
assets  represents  the  maximum  credit  exposure.    The  Group  trades  only  with  recognised,  credit 
worthy  third  parties.    In  addition,  receivable  balances  are  monitored  on  an  ongoing  basis  with  the 
result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not material. 
 
The  Group’s  treasury  function  is  responsible  for  the  Group’s  capital  management,  including 
management of the long-term debt and cash as part of the capital structure.  This involves the use of 
corporate  forecasting  models  which  enable  analysis  of  the  Group’s  financial  position,  including  cash 
flow forecasts, to determine the future capital management requirements.  To ensure sufficient funding 
for  operational  expenditure  and  growth  activities,  a  range  of  assumptions  are  modelled  so  as  to 
provide the flexibility in determining the Group’s optimal future capital structure. 
 
OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES  
 
Risk Factors 
 
The Group is subject to other risks that are outlined in the Annual Information Form 51-102F2, which is 
available on SEDAR at sedar.com 
 
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES 
 
During the year ended 30 June 2016, no payments were made to Director related entities.  Directors of 
the  Company  receive  fees  as  outlined  in  the  Company’s  management  circular  forming  part  of  the 
Company’s  Notice  of  AGM.    The  only  related  party  transactions  are  with  Directors  and  Key 
Management  Personnel.  Refer  to Note  27.    Details  of material  controlled entities  are  set out  in  Note

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS 
 
The Group has applied its  Disclosure Control Policy  to the preparation of the Consolidated Financial 
Report for year ended 30 June 2016, associated Management Discussion and Analysis and Report to 
Shareholders.    An  evaluation  of  the  Group’s  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  used  has  been 
undertaken and concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

INTERNAL CONTROLS 
 
The  Group has  designed appropriate  Internal  Controls  over  Financial  Reporting  (ICFR)  and ensured 
that these were in place for the  year ended  30 June  2016.  An evaluation of the design of ICFR has 
concluded that it is adequate to prevent a material misstatement of the Group’s Consolidated Financial 
Report as at 30 June 2016.  
 
During  the  year,  the  Group  continued  to  have  an  internal  audit  function  externally  contracted  to 
Deloitte  Touche  Tohmatsu.    Internal  audit  reports  and  follow-up  reviews  were  completed  during  the 
year and the Group continues to address their recommendations.  The resultant changes to the ICFR 
have  improved  and  will  continue  to  improve  the  Group’s  framework  of  internal  control  in  relation  to 
financial reporting. 
 
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
The  Group  has  adopted  all  new  and  amended  Australian  Accounting  Standards  and  AASB 
Interpretations  effective  from  1  July  2015.    The  nature  and  impact  of  each  new  standard  and 
amendment is described in Note 3 – Basis of Preparation. 
 
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
 
Other  than disclosed  below,  since 30 June 2016,  the Directors  are  not  aware  of  any  other  matter  or

Strategic Process Achieves Agreements to Raise Over US$200M 
 
On  21  July  2016  and  29  July  2016,  the  Company  announced  the  outcome  of  its  strategic  initiatives 
process  with  respect  to  partnerships,  strategic  investment,  funding  and  corporate  transactions,  with 
the result being two planned transactions to raise in excess of US$200M.  One pertains to a proposed 
sale  of  24%  of  Langer  Heinrich  Mine  (LHM)  and  one  pertains  to  a  potential  sale  of  up  to  75%  of 
Manyingee as set out below. 
 
Sale of 24% of LHM 
 
Paladin currently owns 75% of LHM and has signed a non-binding terms sheet with CNNC Overseas 
Uranium Holdings Ltd (COUH) (the existing 25% minority shareholder in LHM), to sell it a 24% interest 
in  LHM.    If  it  proceeds  on  its  current  terms,  the  sale  is  expected  to  raise  US$175M  cash  for  the 
Company  and  be  accompanied  by  long-term  arrangements  for  uranium  off-take.    The  proposed 
transaction is subject to the parties negotiating and executing definitive documentation, including: sale 
and  purchase  agreement;  shareholders  agreement;  and  documentation  for  the  uranium  off-take 
arrangements. We have been advised by COUH that any definitive agreement would also require the 
approval of the board of COUH’s ultimate parent company and third-party government and regulatory 
approvals.    Such  approvals  would  include  China  regulatory  approvals  customary  for  an  international 
transaction of the proposed size. Paladin is working towards a formal close of the transaction in fourth 
quarter of 2016 calendar year. Other than as set out in this announcement, the other key terms of this 
proposed transaction remain confidential.  
 
On completion of the transaction, Paladin will continue to hold 51% of LHM and be the operator. 
 
Sale of 75% of Manyingee  
 
Paladin  currently  owns  100%  of  Manyingee  and  has  signed  a  binding  terms  sheet  with  MGT 
Resources  Limited  (MGT)  for  it  to  make  a  two-stage  acquisition  of  75%  of  Manyingee  (excluding 
Carley Bore).

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
FINANCIAL REVIEW (continued)
On closing of the transaction, MGT will acquire a 30% initial interest in Manyingee for US$10M cash 
and  will  form  a  joint-venture  over  the  project  with  Paladin  (Manyingee  JV).    MGT  will  then  have  an 
option to acquire an additional 45% of Manyingee JV from Paladin for US$20M cash, exercisable for 
12-months  following  Manyingee  JV’s  preparation  of  a  plan  to  conduct  a  field  leach  trial  for  uranium 
extraction by in-situ recovery method. 
 
Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  MGT  will  issue  Paladin  options  to  subscribe  for  new  shares 
equivalent  to  5%  of  MGT’s  shares  outstanding  for  a  period  of  12-months  from  closing  of  the 
transaction at A$0.06 per share; and options to subscribe for new shares equivalent to 5% of MGT’s 
shares outstanding for a period of 24-months from closing of the transaction at A$0.08 per share. 
 
Paladin  will  issue  MGT  options  to  subscribe  for  new  shares  equivalent  to  2%  of  Paladin’s  shares 
outstanding for a period of 12-months from closing of the transaction at A$0.35 per share; and options 
to  subscribe  for  new  shares  equivalent  to  2%  of  Paladin’s  shares  outstanding  for  a  period  of  24-
months from closing of the transaction at A$0.45 per share. 
 
The transaction is conditional on definitive documentation and  a vote of MGT’s  shareholders.  MGT’s 
directors have irrevocably agreed to vote in favour.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
44
Paladin is committed to the goal of sustainable development, which is reflected in its corporate values. 
The  Company’s  values  include  promoting  the  creation  of  shared  wealth,  becoming  a  major  uranium 
supplier,  operating  at  global  best  practice,  safety  and  environmental  stewardship,  employee  welfare 
and  recognition,  and  contributing  and  responding  to  the  attitudes  and  expectations  of  local 
communities  in  the  countries  in  which  Paladin  operates.    The  Company  is  cognisant  of  the  extra 
diligence that  is  required for  those  in  the uranium  industry.    It  has  therefore  established an in-house 
team  with  extensive  knowledge  about  uranium  and  the  stringent  requirements  related  to  the 
commodity.  The Company emphasises acting with integrity, honesty and cultural sensitivity in all of its 
dealings.    In  support  of  this  commitment,  Paladin  applies  and  adheres  to  established  and 
internationally recognised principles of sustainable development for all of its global activities.  
 
In implementing its sustainable development programme, Paladin aims to achieve a balance between 
economic, environmental and social needs in all phases of its projects, and takes into consideration its 
employees,  communities,  shareholders  and  other  key  stakeholders.    Paladin  ensures  that  its  high 
standards are not compromised despite the difficult economic climate that it is currently operating in.   
 
To  deliver  on  Paladin’s  commitment  to  sustainable  development,  the  Company  has  a  Sustainability 
Committee whose role is to provide the Board with an overview of Paladin’s performance in the areas 
of  health,  safety,  radiation,  environment,  social  responsibility  and  sustainable  development,  and  to 
offer  advice  and  recommendations  where  significant  sustainability  related  issues  arise.    The 
Sustainability Committee comprises three members: the Chairman of Paladin’s Board,  Paladin’s CEO 
and a Non-executive independent Director who is also the Chairman of that Committee.  
 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
 
Paladin  produced  its  fourth  Sustainability  Report  (FY2015),  which  can  be  found  on  the  Company’s 
website www.paladinenergy.com.au.  
 
Paladin  is  continuing  the  data  collection  process  from  LHM  and  KM  for  input  into  the  FY2016 
Sustainability  Report.    Data  is  collected  specifically  to  meet  the  reporting  guidelines  of  the  Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) Framework applying the G4 requirements.  The GRI Sustainability Reporting 
Guidelines provide principles for and guidance on defining report content.  Paladin’s focus is on those 
indicators  that  are  considered  material  to  the  Company  and  have  therefore  conducted  materiality 
assessments  to  define  the  reporting  parameters.    To  allow  sufficient  time  for  comprehensive  data 
collection, assessment and reporting for the FY2016 period, the report is expected to be available on 
the website towards the end of CY2016. 
 
The following discussion provides an overview of Paladin’s environmental management.  More detail 
on environmental performance, specific management and quantitative data for the reporting period will 
be provided in the 2016 Sustainability Report.

to  develop  and
implement  an  EMS
Paladin  has  established  Corporate  Sustainable  Development  Standards  for  all  of  its  operational 
subsidiaries.    Operational  compliance  with  Paladin’s  Standards  forms  part  of  the  Corporate 
Environmental Audit Programme. 
 
Environmental Management System 
 
Within  the  Paladin  Environmental  Management  System  (EMS)  Standard,  each  operating  site  is 
required 
the  requirements  of 
ISO14001:2004.    The  EMS  for  LHM  was  re-certified  in  April  2015  for  a  period  of  three  years.    The 
development and implementation of an EMS at KM is continuing for the care and maintenance phase.  
 
An  Operational  Environmental  Management  Plan  (EMP)  for  LHM  will  be  submitted  at  the  end  of 
August  2016,  when  the  Annual  Environmental  Feedback  is  submitted  for  the  year  ended 
30 June 2016.  The  Operational  EMP  is  regularly  updated  and  revised  as  part  of  the  site’s  continual 
improvement  process.    A  care  and  maintenance  EMP  has  been  submitted  and  approved  by  the 
Malawian Government and is being adhered to during the care and maintenance phase.  
 
Environment Regulatory Reporting 
 
Both  LHUPL  and  PAL  prepare  various  environmental  reports  for  the  Namibian  and  Malawi 
Governments, respectively.  Regulatory reporting for LHM is conducted monthly and annually for water 
aspects, and, annually for general environmental reporting.  Regulatory environmental reporting at KM 
is conducted on a quarterly basis for data provision and for regulatory compliance, and on an annual 
basis for general environmental reporting. 
 
Inspection and Audit Programme 
 
The  Paladin  Environmental  Audit  Standard  requires  operating  sites  to  establish  and  implement 
environmental inspection and audit programmes to ensure that the environmental performance of the 
operations  is  reviewed,  audited  and  reported  to  the  Board.    These  audits  are  undertaken  to  ensure 
that  there  is  not  only  compliance  with  regulatory  and  Paladin  requirements,  but  also  with  the  World 
Bank  Equator  Principles  and  other  industry  standards,  particularly  those  specified  for  the  uranium 
industry.  During  the reporting  period,  inspections and audits  were undertaken at both LHM and  KM, 
with  the  findings  documented  and  actions  developed  to  rectify  and  manage  identified  issues.  
Corporate  Environmental  Audit  Reports  are  provided  to  the  Paladin  Energy  Board  Sustainability 
Committee.  
 
Energy 
 
Energy  requirements  at  Paladin’s  operations  are  principally  in  the  form  of  fuel  for  vehicles  and 
electricity  generation.    Electricity  at  LHM  is  purchased  from  the  Namibian  grid,  which  can  be 
supplemented,  if  necessary,  with power  generated  from  the  on-site power  plant.    Power  for  the  care 
and maintenance activities at KM is generated by a diesel-fuelled power station.   Fuel  usage at both 
sites  for  vehicles  comprises  diesel  and  minor  amounts  of  petrol.    Emulsion  is  used  at  LHM  as  an 
explosive for  blasting.    The  volume of  the  fuels  used  and the  energy  purchased  during the reporting 
period is being collated and will be reported in the 2016 Sustainability Report.  
 
Water  
 
Paladin applies a Standard for Water Use and Water Quality  at its operations to ensure that there is 
efficient, safe and sustainable use of water and that water resources and ecosystems around its sites 
are  protected.  Both  LHM  and  KM  have  implemented  water  management  strategies  and  maintain 
whole-of-site water balances to ensure that the Company’s objectives around water usage, supply and 
resource protection are achieved. Reuse and recycling of water is maximised as much as possible at 
Paladin’s operations.
409810_9
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
(continued)
46
A  specific  care  and  maintenance  water  management  strategy  has  been  developed  for  KM  which 
focuses on reducing stored water in the water collection ponds to ensure sufficient capacity remains in 
the ponds to capture rainfall runoff from the mining and processing areas of disturbance.   This water 
management  strategy  is  reviewed  periodically.    Water  from  the  ponds  is  being  treated  in  an  on-site 
water treatment plant to drinking water standards and a quality suitable for discharge.  Treated water 
is discharged into the local river under licence conditions.  
 
A comprehensive surface and groundwater monitoring programme is undertaken at LHM and KM.  All 
water  monitoring  data  are  collated  in  annual  water  reports  that  consolidate  and  summarise  the  key 
water aspects across Paladin’s operations. 
 
Water  aspects  as  per  the  GRI  indicator  requirements  will  be  presented  in  the  2016  Sustainability 
Report.  
 
Land Use, Biodiversity and Rehabilitation  
 
Land use and understanding land values are important components of sustainable development.  Prior 
to  disturbance  for  project  development  or  expansions,  studies  are  conducted  to  determine  land  use 
and  land  values  including  for  biodiversity,  ecological,  social  and  cultural  heritage.    Land  clearing 
approval processes are in place at all Paladin sites with the aim of minimising the area of disturbance, 
and  ensuring  areas  are  surveyed  to  assess  impacts  prior  to  clearing.    Progressive  rehabilitation  of 
disturbed  areas  is  undertaken  where  practicable  at  all  of  Paladin’s  exploration  sites  and  mining 
operations.   
 
Paladin’s aim is to conserve biodiversity by obtaining knowledge of the ecosystems within the regions 
in  which  the  Company  operates,  and  to  ensure  that  impacts  on  biodiversity  are  minimised  and 
managed.    Data  on  land  use  and  biodiversity  management  aspects  is  being  collated  from  LHM  and 
KM and will be presented in the 2016 Sustainability Report.   
 
Air Emissions 
 
Paladin  has  an  Air  Quality  Standard  in  place  with  the  intent  to  ensure  that  air  pollutant  emissions 
generated by any of Paladin’s activities are identified, impacts assessed and management measures 
established and implemented. The common air pollutants generated by Paladin activities which have 
the  potential  to  impact  on  human  health  and/or  the  environment  include;  radon,  particulate  matter 
(dust), sulphur oxides (SOX); carbon oxides (CO and CO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx).  
 
Dust generation during exploration activities and at the mine sites is suppressed using water sprays to 
enable  a  safe  working  environment  and  to  minimise  impacts  on  the  environment  and  surrounding 
communities.    Fugitive  dust  level  monitoring  is  conducted  at  both  the  LHM  and  KM  sites  and  the 
results are collated in Annual Environmental Reports and submitted to the respective Governments.   
 
SOX  emissions  are  generated  at  the  operations  by  the  burning  of  fuel  for  heating  and  power 
generation, and vehicle emissions.  The sulphuric acid plant at KM has been mothballed whilst the site 
is on care and maintenance.  Ambient ground level concentrations of SO2 are monitored around KM.  
Monitoring data are analysed and the results reported in the Annual Environmental Report submitted 
to the Malawi Government.   
 
The  radon  inhalation  pathway  has  been  identified  in  many  studies  as  the  main  contributor  to  public 
radiation dose received from a practice such as uranium mining  and milling.   This is  particularly  true 
for  permanent  habitation  occurring  on  or  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  a  mine  site.  At  KM  radon 
concentrations in the air are monitored at 10 locations both on and off site and to allow calculation of 
dose to the public.   Passive radon gas monitors (PRGM) are positioned  around the mine site and at 
Kayelekera  Village.  Five  polycarbonate  track  etch  radon  monitors  are  deployed  at  each  monitoring 
location for a period of three months, after which the radon monitors are collected and returned to the 
external radiological laboratory for analyses 
 
The principal direct greenhouse gas emissions from Paladin’s operations are those from fuel burning 
for  power  generation,  boilers,  burners,  emulsions  for  explosives  and  automotive  exhausts.    The  key 
indirect greenhouse gas emissions relate to the energy purchased from the Namibian electricity grid to
409810_9

power  the  LHM  operations.    Greenhouse  gas  emissions  data  are  collected  from  the  operating  sites 
and  will  be  calculated  as  Carbon  Dioxide  (CO2)  equivalent  emissions.    Paladin’s  current  Australian 
activities are confined to Paladin’s limited exploration activities and the corporate Perth office.  
 
Waste Rock 
 
Overburden  is  removed  to  allow  access  to  the  uranium  ore  in  the  mine  pit  and  placed  in  dumps.   
Waste  rock  dump  location,  design  and  placement  are  important  to  the  Company  in  terms  of 
environmental considerations and cost.  The main objectives for the final landform of the dumps are to 
be  stable,  blend  in  with  the  surrounding  landscape  and  be  capable  of  supporting  a  self-sustaining 
ecosystem.    
 
Studies  have  been  conducted  at  both  mine  sites  to  determine  the  best  locations  for  the  waste  rock 
dumps, taking haulage costs and environmental aspects into consideration.  The design of the dumps 
and the placement  of  waste rock  also considers  other  factors  such as  the  physical  and geochemical 
properties of the material placed in the dumps. 
 
Tailings 
 
Tailings  and  tailings  storage  facility  (TSF)  management  continues  to  be  a  high  priority  at  the  LHM 
operational site and also at KM whilst in care and maintenance.  Paladin applies measures to ensure 
that its TSFs are appropriately  designed, operated and managed according to acceptable standards.  
Specialist  TSF  engineers  have  designed  the  TSFs  at  both  LHM  and  KM.    The  specialists  have  also 
defined  the  operational  practice  and  management  to  ensure  that  the  tailings  and  TSFs  are 
appropriately  managed  and  any  potential  environmental  impacts  from  the  tailings  or  the  facility  are 
minimised.  Independent  experts  conduct  peer  reviews  of  the  design,  construction  and  operations  of 
the TSFs on an ongoing basis.   
 
Non-Mineral Waste 
 
Non-mineral waste includes typical general wastes, sewage and some water that may be considered 
hazardous.  The LHM and KM operations both have waste management programmes and procedures 
in  place  with  the  aim  of  applying  the  principles  of  reduce,  reuse  and  recycle  wherever  possible.    At 
LHM,  domestic  solid  wastes  are  separated into recyclable and non-recyclable.    Recyclable domestic 
waste is collected and taken to off-site recycling depots whilst the non-recyclables are delivered to the 
municipal landfill sites.  Facilities for the recycling of waste materials in Malawi are very limited, as are 
suitable  off-site  waste  disposal  locations.    Office  paper  is  mixed  with  rice  husks  and  recycled  into 
energy brickettes for use in cooking. Other waste materials generated at KM require on-site disposal 
so  the  wastes  are  categorised  and  segregated  into  their  types  and  directed  to  appropriate  on  site 
waste  disposal  sites.    Sewerage  treatment  plants  are  installed  at  both  mine  sites  to  treat  sewage. 
Treated sewage from the plants is directed to the process water pond at LHM, and at KM to the water 
pond  and  TSF.    Waste  oils  are  collected  by  licensed  contractors  in  both  Namibia  and  Malawi  and 
taken off-site for recycling or disposal. 
 
Environmental Incidents 
 
A standardised Paladin Incident Reporting Procedure is in place to ensure there is consistency across 
the  business  in terms  of  incident  classification  and  reporting.   Statistics  and  information  on incidents 
occurring during the reporting period will be included in the 2016 Sustainability Report.   
 
Closure 
 
Mine closure  planning  is  a key  component of  Paladin’s  commitment  to Sustainable Development.   A 
Closure  Standard  is  in  place  for  all  of  Paladin’s  developing  and  operational  sites.  The  intent  of  the 
Standard is to ensure that Paladin’s sites are left in a safe and stable manner and that environmental 
and social impacts are minimised so that tenements can be relinquished without future liability to the 
Company,  government  or  the  community.    During  the  reporting  period,  the  LHM  Draft  Mine  Closure 
Plan and Closure Strategy were being revised and updated to reflect current and future mine plans.  A 
Closure Strategy has been prepared for KM and progress continued on the preparation of a Draft Mine 
Closure Plan.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
 
Paladin’s  purpose  is  to  create  value  for  its  shareholders.  In  pursuit  of  this  goal,  the  Company 
recognises  that  encompassing  economic,  environmental  and  social  values  are  all  important 
components  of  corporate  success.    Paladin  stakeholders  expect  their  Company  to  be  a  good 
corporate  citizen,  with  fair  and  beneficial  business  practices  focused  on:  operating  to  the  highest 
ethical standards; contributing to the growth and prosperity of host countries and responding positively 
to  community  needs.  Paladin’s  approach  to  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  (CSR)  –  as  with  its 
commitment to sustainability – involves:







Top-level support of the Board of Directors and CEO;
Adherence to principles enunciated in Corporate Policy and Procedures;
Programmes aligned with host country Global Goals for Sustainable Development;
Personnel dedicated to achieving CSR objectives;
Compliance with recognised international codes of conduct;
Acknowledgement of voluntary standards; and,
Reporting in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative.
Paladin seeks to achieve these objectives by example, both through its own actions and by its active 
participation in industry and community-based organisations that foster and promote these values and 
aspirations.  Below is a summary of the organisations in which the Company participates:
Paladin  played  an  instrumental  role  in  establishing  the  Australia-Africa  Mining  Industry  Group 
(AAMIG) – an industry  body  that facilitates the sharing of knowledge and experience to create 
better outcomes on the ground. It partners with Australian and African governments to promote 
active  engagement  and  promotes  best  practice  in  CSR  among  Australian  mining  companies 
active in Africa.
Paladin has committed to the principles contained  in  Enduring Value – the Australian  Minerals 
Industry  Framework  for  Sustainable  Development.    This  commitment  is  aligned  with  the  Ten 
Sustainable Development Principles of the International Council on Mining and Metals.
Paladin  supports  the  Extractive  Industries  Transparency  Initiative  (EITI)  and  has  registered  as 
an EITI Supporting Company, endorsing its principles and criteria.  Taxes paid by Paladin to the 
Malawian and Namibian governments are presented in the Company's Sustainability Report.
Paladin  supports  and  respects  a  number  of  international  guiding  documents  and  seeks  to 
conduct  its  business  in  accordance  with  the  spirit  and  intent  of  them.  These  include  the  UN 
International  Bill of Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles  on  Business and  Human Rights, 
The UN Global Compact, the ILO Declaration, the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human 
Rights,  the  OECD  Guidelines  for  Multi-National  Enterprises  and the Equator  Principles.  These 
are embodied in Paladin’s governance framework.
Paladin’s  CSR  programmes  are  developed,  managed  and  assessed  in  compliance  with  the 
Group’s Community Relations Policy.
Paladin  contributes  significantly  to  those  economies  in  its  countries  of  operation  through  a 
variety of government taxes.  These are detailed below for both Malawi and Namibia, where the 
Group’s mines are located. It should be noted that the Kayelekera Mine in Malawi is currently on 
care and maintenance.

Human Rights 
 
Paladin is committed to respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The Company’s overall 
approach to  human  rights  issues  is  reflected  in its  Human  Rights  Policy,  which  can  be  found  on  the 
Paladin website.  
 
The  Human  Rights  Policy  provides  the  overarching  framework  to  assist  in  achieving  Paladin’s 
commitment  to  respect  human  rights  throughout  its  business.    The  Board  reviews  this  regularly  to 
ensure that it is current and that the requirements of the Policy reflect Paladin’s commitment to human 
rights principles.  
 
Training on human rights is conducted across the entire Paladin Group at all levels.  This also extends 
to key external stakeholders and suppliers with specific training tailored for the security contingents at 
each site. 
 
Industry Participation 
 
As a leading participant in the global uranium sector, Paladin plays  an active and responsible role in 
public  policy  development,  both  corporately  in  Australia  and  through  Group  subsidiary  companies  in 
their respective constituencies.  
 
The  Company  is  a member  of  the  Minerals  Council  of  Australia  (MCA),  which  represents  Australia’s 
exploration, mining and minerals processing industry, nationally  and internationally, in its contribution 
to sustainable development and society.  
 
The Australian Uranium Association (AUA) has been integrated into the MCA and is now represented 
specifically through the Uranium Forum of the MCA.  As such, Paladin is committed to abiding by and 
implementing  the  terms  of  the  Uranium  Industry  Code  of  Practice.  Along  with  the  Code,  the  Group 
observes the Charter and Principles of Uranium Stewardship, which provide a guide to doing business 
ethically, responsibly and safely. Together, the Code, Charter and Stewardship Principles make up a 
vital standards framework for the uranium industry. 
 
Senior  management  across  the  Group  at  both  board  and  committee  level  are  actively  involved  in  a 
number  of  industry  and  policy  making  organisations.    These  include  the  MCA,  Uranium  Council  of 
Australia, Advisory Group for IAEA, AAMIG and the Chamber of Mines and Energy of Namibia.  
 
It is pleasing to note that a report issued in 2015 by the Danish Institute for International Studies titled 
“Corporate  Engagement 
the  Nuclear  Supply  Chain  and  Material 
Stewardship and Traceability in Uranium Procurement” shows Paladin as an example …”Paladin can 
be  seen  as  having  one  of  the  most  robust  approaches  to  this  issue  among  all  eight  leading  mining 
companies…..; and …” sets the example on Uranium Stewardship”. 
 
LHUPL was a founding member of the Swakopmund-based Namibian Uranium Institute (NUI) in 2009. 
The NUI provides support  and advice for industry members, operates a Uranium Information Centre, 
and engages with the public and scientific community through hosting training and information events, 
meetings  and  workshops.    The  Institute’s  aim  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  healthcare,  environment 
management and radiation safety in Namibia.  
 
LHUPL also supports the Namibian Uranium Association (NUA), an advocacy body that represents the 
uranium industry exclusively.  
 
Members  of  the  NUA  work  co-operatively  to  ensure  the  Namibian  uranium  exploration,  mining  and 
exporting  industry  is  able  to  operate,  expand  and  thrive  safely  and  efficiently.    The  NUA’s  Board  of 
Directors, of which LHUPL’s Managing Director, Simon Solomons, is a member, also governs the NUI, 
which is an industry training and research centre.  LHUPL is represented on four of its working groups 
– Water Quality, Sustainable Development, Radiation Safety and Swakop River Farmers.

LHM  continues  to  provide  strong  support  to  the  Namibian  Chamber  of  Mines,  which  organised  a 
Namibian  Mining  Expo  in  April  2016.    This  very  successful  conference  was  attended  by  almost  500 
delegates  from  all  over  the  country  and  from  South  Africa  and  provided  an  important  forum  for 
interaction between industry leaders and stakeholders.  
 
Stakeholder Interaction 
 
Regular meetings are conducted with the stakeholder groups in countries where Paladin has interests.  
These interactions include regular and/or informal meetings with: 
 

Community groups;





Environmental groups;
Host nation government ministers and senior civil servants;
Indigenous groups;
Civil Society Organisations; and
Employees and their representative organisations.
International Initiatives 
 
Malaria Treatment for Children 
 
Paladin  has  continued  to  provide  support  to  Suda  Ltd  for  Suda’s  development  of ArTiMist™,  a  sub-
lingual (under the tongue) spray for the treatment of severe and complicated malaria in children. 
  
Suda  announced  the  results  from  a  Phase  III  trial  of  ArTiMist™  in  2013,  which  was  a  comparative 
study  against  intravenous  quinine.  The  report  from  the  trial  identified  that  ArTiMist™  was  superior 
when compared to IV quinine. Approximately 95% of the patients treated with ArTiMist™ had parasite 
count reduced by more than 90% within 24 hours versus 40.6% of the patients treated with IV quinine. 
Suda is working with the Medicines for Malaria Venture and other groups to expand the opportunity for 
ArTiMist™ by evaluating the product as an early interventional treatment before patients are referred 
to hospital.    Suda  and  its  Clinical  Advisory  Board  are  finalising the  design of  a pivotal  clinical  trial  of 
ArTiMist™  in  the  pre-referral  setting  and  Suda  aims  to  secure  philanthropic  funding  from  global 
organisations to support the trial. 
  
The majority of deaths from severe malaria in childhood are caused by the delayed administration of 
effective anti-malarial treatment.  There is a relentless deterioration in the clinical condition of a young 
child with malaria who fails to get effective treatment, with death ensuing in a matter of hours or days.   
  
Suda believes that ArTiMist™ has the potential to be  an effective pre-referral medication.  It has the 
potential to significantly reduce child mortality and the adverse effects suffered by children, particularly 
within the first 24 hours of infection. 
 
MALAWI  
 
Paladin has continued to fulfil its Social Development responsibilities in Malawi under the terms of the 
Kayelekera  Development  Agreement  and  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Social  Impact  Control 
Programme. Following  on  from  its  decision  to  place  KM on  care  and  maintenance last  year,  Paladin 
has maintained its community relations presence in Karonga, albeit at a reduced level of expenditure 
consistent  with Kayelekera’s non-producing status.  Paladin began the construction of a village clinic 
at the Kayelekera village, which is due for completion in CY2016.

Paladin has continued its ongoing community programmes focused primarily on health and education. 
Through  its  corporate  CSR  programmes  and  projects  undertaken  and  funded  by  the  Paladin  staff 
charity,  Friends  and  Employees  for  African  Children  (FEPAC),  the  Company  social  development 
footprint  extends  throughout  the  Karonga  District,  so  ensuring  that  villages  other  than  those  in  the 
immediate vicinity of KM benefit from its programmes. 
 
Garnet Halliday Karonga Water Supply Project 
 
The  Garnet  Halliday  Karonga  Water  Project  was  built  at  a  cost  of  more  than  US$10M  and  is  the 
centrepiece of Paladin’s Social Development commitment to Malawi, the objective being to provide a 
safe and reliable water supply to the Town of Karonga. 
 
The plant is now operating as per design, providing Karonga with a safe and reliable water supply that 
will meet the town’s projected needs until 2025.  During the year maintenance support continued to be 
provided.  
 
Community Liaison  
 
Engagement with the community locally is formalised through the District Executive Committee (DEC) 
stakeholders’ meetings, which are held monthly and are used as a community information forum and 
to address any stakeholder questions or concerns that arise.  
 
Monthly meetings are held with the Kayelekera village leadership and, on a more informal basis, with 
the Karonga District Commissioner and her staff together with traditional authorities and their advisors. 
Attendance  at  the  Village  Development  Committee  assists  in  communicating  about  current  CSR 
projects. The Company engages individually with NGOs in the region and is in regular contact with the 
District  Education  Manager,  the  District  Health  Administrator  and  the  District  Ministry  of  Water  and 
Irrigation.  
 
These forums ensure open communication between local stakeholders and the Company, particularly 
with the local CSR team on the ground and operating in the community on a daily basis. 
 
Community Education and HIV/AIDS Awareness 
 
There are 36 education-through-storybooks in circulation though no longer being circulated, covering a 
variety  of  community-focused  subjects,  and  has  been  translated  into  a  number  of  local  languages.  
They continue to be a very effective communications medium and remain extremely popular, given the 
general lack of reading material in the district, particularly in local languages.  
 
Community Health Care  
 
Paladin continued its support of local health clinics by providing transport for government medical staff 
in the region, alleviating the need for local villagers to travel long distances, and facilitating an under-
fives clinic.  
 
The construction of the local clinic has begun and should be completed in September CY2016.  
 
Paladin  also  runs  a  mosquito  control  programme  in  Kayelekera  Village,  Juma  Village  and  at,  in 
addition to the mine and accommodation areas, as a very effective malaria-control mechanism. 
 
Educational Support 
 
Paladin’s  Community  Relations  team  continues  to  assist  in  the  maintenance  of  local  schools  and 
teacher housing, assistance with teacher wages and provision of a variety of educational supplies.

An  annual  donation  from  a  Paladin  board  member  pays  for  the  school  fees  for  105  girls  who  would 
otherwise not be able to finish their education to a secondary level. 
 
In the 1st quarter of 2016 Paladin installed twelve windows including frames, glass and fly wire to two 
teachers houses at Kalowe primary school. The houses were originally supplied and built by Paladin in 
2014 and the windows were only covered by fly wire. 
 
In the 2nd quarter Paladin has installed solar panels for electrical supply at the Kayelekera community 
secondary  school,  the  panels  were  supplied  by  the  school  with  Paladin  only  supplying  the  technical 
support for installation and commissioning. 
 
Paladin has sponsored a boom gate and installation at Kapoka police road block that was requested 
by  the  Chitipa  police  officer  in  charge,  this  has  all  been  prepared  ready  for  installation  and  currently 
waiting for approval from the Malawi road authority to carry out excavations and installation which will 
be done by Paladin. 
 
Paladin donated twelve 44 gallon drums to the Karonga TWESA community development organization 
to  be  used  as  rubbish  bins,  these  drums  were  cleaned  and  painted  with  the  Paladin  logo  then

In the 1st quarter of 2016 Paladin repaired the community foot bridge over the Seri River at Kayelekera 
village due to the bridge being damaged during a high water flooding event. 
 
NAMIBIA 
 
In line with Paladin Energy’s policies and procedures, LHUPL continues to support the Government of 
Namibia  in  its  endeavours  to  develop  skilled,  talented,  ambitious  and  productive  citizens,  focussing 
specifically on its immediate impact areas within the Erongo region.   
 
LHUPL’s core Community Investments (CI) focus areas are Education and Skills; Sports and Culture; 
as  well  as  Health.  The  primary  target  group  of  all  LHUPL’s  community  investments  is  the  Namibian 
youth. 
 
During the year under review, LHUPL supported the following programmes: 
 
Education 
 
Mondesa Youth Opportunities (MYO) 
 
This  non-profit  organisation,  established  in  2005  as  an  after-school  programme,  offers  financially 
underprivileged, yet academically able Grade 4 to 8 learners with after school lessons in Mathematics; 
English; Life, Music and Computer skills. The Centre supports 120 learners on an annual basis with its 
whole  child  approach,  which  incorporates  academic  and  sport  performance  as  well  as  physical, 
emotional and nutritional health (through a feeding programme).  
 
LHUPL has been the main sponsor of MYO for the past six years and with a donation of N$1.2M made 
during the  year  under  review,  completed the  second  year  of  a five  year  commitment  with MYO.  The 
funds are utilised for the annual running costs of the Centre. Redundant computer equipment was also 
donated to the Centre’s computer laboratory. 
 
The National Mathematics Congress 
 
Skilled teachers are one  of the most  critical success factors for effective education,  while a focus on 
teacher  development  assures  a  bigger  outreach  and  impact.  LHUPL  therefore  supports  the  Annual 
Mathematics Congress which targets the development of mathematics and teaching skills of teachers 
across Namibia. The theme of the 11th Annual Congress held in April 2016 was ‘Making Connections: 
Linking  Concepts  and Context’  and provided more  than 300 teachers  from  all  14  regions  of  Namibia 
with  practical,  hands-on  experience  in  using  visualisation  in  the  classroom;  linking  playing  with 
learning;  linking  assessment  with  teaching;  and  using  scientific  calculators  amongst  others.  With  a 
donation of N$250,000, LHUPL maintained its role as the main sponsor of the event since 2009.

The Mathematics Enrichment and Support Programme 
 
This Programme was initiated by LHUPL six  years ago and supports gifted learners in reaching their 
full academic potential. Through curriculum-based after school classes provided throughout the year, it 
benefits  senior  secondary  learners  enrolled  for  higher  level  or  extended  level  mathematics.  Other 
activities  include  mathematics  spring  schools,  regional  mathematics  competitions  and  teacher 
mathematics  workshops.  On  average,  the  programme  benefits  200  learners  on  an  annual  basis. 
LHUPL’s contribution was N$220,000 during the past financial year. 
 
Ad-hoc Education Support Donations 
 
LHUPL  understands  the  value  of  celebrating  successes  and  therefore  spent  a  total  of  N$70,000 
towards supporting various performance recognition initiatives of local primary and secondary schools, 
the  University  of  Science  and  Technology,  as  well  as  the  Regional  Teachers  Awards  hosted  by  the 
Regional Directorate of Education, Arts and Culture.  
 
The mine also supported the Annual National Debating Championships to the tune of N$20,000. 
 
Environment 
 
Gobabeb Training and Research Internship Programme (GRTIP) 
 
The Gobabeb Training and Research Centre supports the development of scientific research skills of 
young  environmental  professionals through a five-month field-based  internship programme facilitated 
at its Centre located in the Namib Desert. It aims to build capacity for the sustainable management of 
Namibia’s natural resources.  
 
Students, chosen after an intensive selection process, are expected to design and implement original, 
independent research projects focused on the management and restoration of degraded ecosystems. 
Close  mentorship  and  supervision  to  ensure  scientific  quality  are  maintained,  while  critical  thinking, 
systematic problem solving and improved communication skills are fostered.  
  
LHUPL began its involvement in the GTRIP in 2014 with a pledge of N$1.2M over a 5 year period. To 
date, the Programme concluded the second round, with nine young Namibians who have successfully 
completed the Programme.  
 
Community 
 
Blue Waters Sports Club 
 
LHUPL has been in a long-term partnership with a local Sports Club registered in the Namibia Premier 
League.    The  Blue Waters  Sports  Club,  founded  in  1936,  is  the  second  oldest  active  sports  club  in 
Namibia, still full of history and culture. LHUPL’s support goes towards the promotion of youth sports 
in codes such as boys’ and girls’ soccer, boys’ and girls’ handball, netball, girls’ and boys’ cricket.  On 
average,  160  young  girls  and  boys,  mostly  from  schools  in  low  income  areas,  benefit  from  the 
Programme.    The  Programme  also  creates  short-term  employment  opportunities  for  at  least  10 
coaches and 20 soccer players contracted to play for the team in the National Premier League.  
 
Young Namibian athletes gain from national and international exposure during competitions.  The Club 
also has a programme supporting schools’ sports administration and coaching. 
 
In  addition,  LHUPL  supports  various  short-term  sports  development  and  promotion  activities.  During 
the past financial year, a total of N$331,500 was invested, N$250,000 thereof towards the Blue Waters 
Sports Club.

Food Assistance Programme 
 
LHUPL has been supporting two feeding schemes, Promiseland Trust and Eagle Christian Centre, for 
the  past  six  years.    Combined,  the  schemes  cater  for  up  to  600  disadvantaged  children  in  two 
surrounding  communities  on  a  daily  basis.  Both  have  expanded  their  activities  to  include  pre-school 
classes,  with  the  Promiseland  Trust  using  the  Montessori  Education  Model.    The  latter  also  has  a 
foster child programme in place.  During the reporting period, LHUPL invested a total of N$333,000 in 
the two schemes.  
 
While  agriculture  remains  one  of  the  backbones  of  the  Namibian  economy  in  terms  of  job  creation, 
LHUPL supported vegetable production projects in the Omaheke region to the tune of N$24,000 due 
to its additional potential for household food security assurance.  
 
Special Projects  
 
Poverty  and physical and mental disabilities often go hand in hand. People living with disabilities are 
often the most marginalised members of society  with limited access to basic public services such as 
education  and health.    They  are  mostly  isolated due to discrimination  and  stigmatisation.    Orphaned 
and Vulnerable Children (OVC) are also often kept from mainstream society and make up the highest 
percentage of disadvantaged children in Namibia. 
 
Through  funds  raised  during  its  Annual  Charity  Golf  events,  LHUPL  supports  various  projects 
focussed on providing care to disabled people and OVCs in an effort to contribute to the improvement 
of  their  living  conditions.  Projects  supported  during  the  past  financial  year  included  the  Walvis  Bay 
Child  and  Family  Centre,  which  was  registered  20  years  ago  as  a  non-profit  “child-centered” 
organisation dedicated to children in the community who are differently abled and suffer from diseases 
and disorders.  The Centre supports 108 people with varying physical and mental challenges through 
therapeutic  and  psychological  therapy  (children  and  affected  families);  skills  training  (gardening, 
needlework,  woodwork,  music,  visual  art);  sports  participation  and  external  exposure;  employment 
opportunities  to  21  previous  beneficiaries;  daily  feeding  schemes;  reintegration  into  school;  job 
placements  at  local  organisations  and  entrepreneurship  training  for  affected  mothers.  Apart  from 
donations,  the  Centre  sustains  it  activities  with  small  initiatives  towards  self-sustainability  such  as 
catering services, a vegetable garden, and the sale of self-made artefacts.  
 
LHUPL  also  supported  120  financially  vulnerable  children  enrolled  in  local  primary  and  secondary 
schools through school uniform donations.  
 
Australian Initiatives 
 
In  2011,  Paladin  made  a  five-year  financial  commitment  to  the  Hammond-Nisbet  Geoscience  Fund 
administered  by  the  University  of  Western  Australia  (UWA).  The  fund  supports  the  creation  of  an 
endowed professorship within UWA’s Centre for Exploration Targeting (CET).  This research-intensive 
position  focusses  on  mentoring  new  generations  of  geoscientists  in  interpretation  of  fieldwork  and 
structural geophysics and in applying this understanding to mineral systems and exploration targeting. 
 
CANADA  
 
Aurora  continues  to  maintain  an  active  presence  in  the  Labrador  communities.    Donations  focus  on 
education  and  training,  aboriginal  cultural  initiatives,  youth  and  sport.    During  the  year,  Aurora 
contributed  to  15  community  events  and  initiatives.    Community  activities  have  included  public 
meetings  to  inform  residents  of  Aurora’s  activities  and  to  seek  their  feedback.    Regular  contact  with 
Provincial  and  Nunatsiavut  government  officials  has  been  maintained  and  Aurora  continues  to  enjoy 
good support from the governments and local residents.   Aurora’s contribution to the economic well-
being of Labrador continues through extensive use of local contractors for camp support and by hiring 
up  to  20  local  staff  per  field  season,  a  practice  that  has  been  widely  appreciated  by  Nunatsiavut 
officials and residents.

Employee Charitable Foundation, supported by Paladin 
 
Friends and Employees of Paladin for African Children (FEPAC) is a charitable foundation established 
in  2008  by  Paladin  employees  to  fund  social  projects  that  are  outside  the  scope  of  the  Company’s 
CSR programmes. 
 
The charity supports four organisations in Malawi that assist orphaned children with educational needs 
and  vocational  training  courses.   These  include  two  organisations  that  support  kindergarten  aged 
children where they receive porridge for breakfast, which for many may be their only meal of the day, 
and age appropriate lessons. 
 
Two vocational brick laying training course began in FY2016 for two groups of 10 teenagers.  To date 
158 teenagers have completed these courses and have been given the tools of their trade to enable 
them to earn money to support their younger siblings.  On completion of the courses, the students also 
complete  a five-day, small  business training course to teach them the basic fundamentals for setting 
up their own small businesses. 
 
FEPAC also supports a school for the visually impaired and a school for deaf children.  Over the years 
FEPAC  has  helped  fund  the  construction  of  classrooms,  dormitories  and  teacher’s  houses  for  these 
schools as well as assisting with their monthly running costs. 
 
FEPAC is in the process of approving a capital donation to each of the organisations that is expected 
will  meet  the  cost  of  an  investment  in  a  self-sustaining  project.  These  self-sustaining  projects  have 
been  designed  to  generate  both  ongoing  food  and  income  for  the  organisation  that  will  exceed 
FEPAC’s  current  annual  funding  contribution.  The  projects  have  been  planned  to  give  the 
organisations that FEPAC has supported over the years the best chance of continuing their good work 
in a sustainable way for many years to come. 
 
OUR PEOPLE 
 
The  Company  has  spent  the  past  year  focussing  on  reviewing  its  workforce  throughout  all 
departments and projects with a view of efficiency, rationalisation and consolidation.  This has led to a 
continued decrease in total employee numbers seen across the Group. 
Turnover for the Group is detailed in the following table.

Diversity overall, and gender diversity specifically, remains a focus and, despite the overall headcount 
decreasing  over  the  period,  the  percentage  of  female  representation  within  the  workforce  has 
remained  reasonably  steady.    Supporting  a  diverse  workforce  remains  one  of  the  cornerstones  of 
Paladin’s  strategy  with  a  commitment  to  equitable  gender  representation  amongst  its  workforce, 
balanced with availability of appropriate candidates in the region of operation.  Further information on 
diversity can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement available on Paladin’s website.

Australia (Head Office & Mount Isa) 
 
The  Perth  head  office  currently  has  22  employees,  a  reduction  from  46  at  the  same  time  last  year.  
Females within the head office represent 31.81% of employees and 71.43% of all females employed 
hold roles within the professional, managerial or senior management categories. 
 
During  the  period,  the  12  month  rolling  total  turnover  was  50.25%  in  comparison  to  24.27%  at  the 
same  time  last  year.    In  light  of  the  continued  focus  on  consolidating  the  organisational  structure  22 
roles  were  made  redundant.  In  instances  of  natural  attrition  only  those  roles  that  were  deemed 
essential were replaced, resulting in a reduction of a further two roles.  
 
In line  with the continued focus on rationalising costs, there were no salary increases and the senior 
management  team  accepted  a  further  10%  salary  reduction.    All  executive  managers  participated  in 
performance reviews in an effort to reinforce both a culture of continuous improvement and provide an 
element to measure performance within the leadership team.   
 
The  year  ahead  will  see  a  continued  focus  on  retaining  key  skills  in  an  environment  of  cost 
rationalisation. In addition, a review of succession plans that are currently in place for key roles will be 
undertaken ensuring a robust strategy to address concerns should they arise.    
 
Exploration 
 
Group-wide  the  exploration  team  totals  11  spread  across  projects  based  in  Australia,  Malawi  and 
Canada.  Paladin places a large focus on the development of its geoscience capabilities  and has the 
benefit  of  exposing  its  professionals  to  a  number  of  different  geological  terrains  and  environments 
within  the  global  project  portfolio.  Additionally,  a  number  of  senior  technical  individuals  within  the 
Group  are  consistently  invited  to  present  papers  at  industry  conferences,  providing  yet  another 
opportunity  to  transfer  expert  knowledge  amongst  the  Group  and  aid  in  the  development  of  junior 
professionals.   
 
The Perth based exploration team is a small group predominantly comprised of senior technical roles 
focussed  on  providing  support  and  guidance  across  the  Group.  This  small  group  consistently  has 
minimal turnover and currently has an average tenure of 7.35 years of service within the team. 
 
As a result of the continued focus on reviewing the group’s workforce the Aurora Exploration, based in 
Canada, had eight roles that were made redundant, with four roles being retained. Those individuals 
retrenched all received severance packages in recognition of their service with the Company. This has 
impacted on the turnover figure for Aurora which has historically experienced low turnover.  When the 
Company  is  active  in  exploration,  it  also  employs  up  to  30  seasonal  staff  for  each  field  season.    Of 
these  individuals,  generally  80%  are  employed  from  the  surrounding  communities  of  Postville, 
Makkovik and Rigolet with the majority consistently re-employed for the past field seasons. 
 
Malawi (Kayelekera Mine) 
 
With KM remaining on C&M, the focus has continued to be on adapting the workforce and operations 
to better  suit  this  change.    The  current  financial  year  has  seen  the  operation  in  a more  settled  state 
within  C&M,  and  further  reviews  of  the  organisational  structure  during  the  year  further  decreases  to 
both the national and expatriate employee numbers throughout the year.  At year end there were 167 
national employees, an additional 9 expatriates.  Turnover has remained steady. 
 
Although cost reduction is a priority, a conscious effort has been made to ensure that the opportunity 
to develop high performing employees has been retained via ongoing study assistance programmes.  
A  number  of  employees  are  currently  undergoing  further  education  relevant  to  their  roles,  with  KM 
both  paying  the  fees  and  providing  paid  leave  for  study  and  examination  purposes.    Additionally, 
mentoring and one-on-one career development remains a focus for the leadership team. 
 
Cross-development opportunities are also made available where possible in order to provide exposure 
to other operations within the Paladin portfolio for key roles and individuals.

Namibia (Langer Heinrich Mine)  
 
In response to  Swakop  Uranium’s  ongoing  and aggressive  recruitment  campaign  for  its  Husab  Mine 
as well as recruitment drives by other large companies, LHM has struggled with the retention of skilled 
roles resulting in a 12 month rolling total turnover of 24.04%.  Hardest hit has been the Processing and 
Engineering department.  
 
LHM  facilitates  an  in-house  Processing  training  programme.   An  internal  competency-based  training 
programme  has  been  implemented  to  allow  recruitment  of  individuals  with  less  experience.   This 
strategy allows for a sustainable solution to the shortage of skilled labour currently  being experienced.  
The  Namibian  government  has  introduced  a  Vocational  Educational  &  Training  Levy  which  is  set  at 
1%  of  a  company’s  total  annual  payroll.  In  the  past  12  months  LHM  has  invested  N$2.5M  into  the 
training and development of its employees, representing 1.4% of total annual payroll. 
 
As in previous years LHM places a focus on attracting graduates and trainees allowing development of 
a pipeline  of future skilled individuals and potential  leaders.  To enable this, LHM offers a number of 
bursary  opportunities  within  the  year,  both  internal  and  external,  allowing  for  formal  training  and 
education  opportunities  to be  coupled  with internal  development  and mentoring.    There are  currently 
30  graduates  and  artisan  interns  within  the  disciplines  of  Engineering,  Metallurgy,  Supply  Chain, 
Finance, Geology, Mining and Radiation Management, and LHM places a large focus on transitioning 
those graduates into permanent roles within the organisation which has been consistently successful.  
LHM’s long standing relationship with the Namibian Institute of Mining Technology (NIMT) creates an 
opportunity  to  provide  the  hands-on  training  components  of  the  skilled  trades  and,  in  turn,  LHM  has 
access to a number of skilled artisans upon completion of their studies.  LHM has also embarked on 
an  internship  programme  for  newly  qualified  artisans,  providing  1  year  technical  internships  in  the 
various  trades. With  the  current  shortage  of  local  artisans,  the  relationship  with  NIMT  as  well  as  the 
internship programme, will play a significant and ongoing role in the ability to attract skilled individuals. 
 
During mid-July of 2016 the Mineworkers Union of Namibia (MUN) and LHM made a tremendous leap 
forward in terms of industrial relations, when the Recognition and Procedural Agreement (outstanding 
for approximately three years) was finally signed off by the parties. In a last desperate attempt to either 
agree  or  have  no  agreement  in  place,  parties  really  engaged  each  other  in  good  faith  and  finally 
agreed on terms which benefit both parties. This agreement will now regulate the relationship between 
the  MUN  and  LHM  and  provide  structure  and  procedures  to  the  parties.  This  agreement  further 
regulates the rights and duties of each party.  There are still four outstanding labour disputes between 
the  MUN  and  LHM,  which  should  most  likely  be  resolved  before  the  end  of  CY2016.    The  first 
retrenchment procedure was followed at LHM this  year, and at the end only one employee remained 
affected. Three alternative work offers are still pending. Should the offers not be accepted, the matter 
will be referred for conciliation, which aims to assist parties to come to a resolution.  
 
LHM  continues  to  benchmark  remuneration  levels  within  the  Mining  Industry,  with  a  remuneration 
review of all roles measured against peers  within the  Namibian mining industry  undertaken annually, 
allowing  LHM  to  ensure  that  competitive  remuneration  packages  are  offered.   The  Key  Employee 
Retention  Scheme  remains  active  to  assist  in  retention  of  key  individuals  and  top  performers.  
Furthermore,  the  Company  has  introduced  a  formal  performance  evaluation  system  which  was 
implemented in January 2016.

health  organisations  (e.g.  The  Cancer  Association  of  Namibia  and  Namibian  Blood  Transfusion 
Service), who provide employee wellness screenings and counselling events on site.  Membership to 
private health insurance is  a condition of employment  at LHU  and the Medical  Aid providers counsel 
employees on healthy lifestyle choices and in identifying the risks associated with unhealthy practices 
resulting in issues such as high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, HIV and other themes common 
to Namibia. 
 
The year ahead will see a continued focus on the internal training and development in response to the 
current tight labour market, coupled with retention measures to attempt to stabilise the turnover rate.

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE DATE 
 
Other than disclosed below, since the end of the year, the Directors are not aware of any other matter or 
circumstance  not  otherwise  dealt  with  in  this  report,  that  has  significantly  or  may  significantly  affect  the 
operations of the Group, the results of those operations or the state of affairs of the Group in subsequent 
years with the exception of the following, the financial effects of which have not been provided for in the 
30 June 2016 Financial Report: 
 
Strategic Process Achieves Agreements to Raise Over US$200M 
 
On  21  July  2016  and  29  July  2016,  the  Company  announced  the  outcome  of  its  strategic  initiatives 
process  with  respect  to  partnerships,  strategic  investment,  funding  and  corporate  transactions,  with  the 
result being two planned transactions to raise in excess of US$200M.  One pertains to a proposed sale of 
24% of Langer Heinrich Mine (LHM) and one pertains to a potential sale of up to 75% of Manyingee as 
set out below. 
 
Sale of 24% of LHM 
 
Paladin  currently  owns  75%  of  LHM  and  has  signed  a  non-binding  terms  sheet  with  CNNC  Overseas 
Uranium Holdings Ltd (COUH) (the existing 25% minority shareholder of LHM), to sell it a 24% interest in 
LHM.  If it proceeds on its current terms, the sale is expected to raise US$175M cash for the Company 
and  be  accompanied  by  long-term  arrangements  for  uranium  off-take.    The  proposed  transaction  is 
subject  to  the  parties  negotiating  and  executing  definitive  documentation,  including:  sale  and  purchase 
agreement;  shareholders  agreement;  and  documentation  for  the  uranium  off-take  arrangements.    We 
have been advised by COUH that any definitive agreement would also require the approval of the board 
of  COUH’s  ultimate  parent  company  and  third-party  government  and  regulatory  approvals.    Such 
approvals  would  include  China  regulatory  approvals  customary  for  an  international  transaction  of  the 
proposed  size.    Paladin  is  working  towards  a  formal  close  of  the  transaction  in  fourth  quarter  of  2016 
calendar  year.  Other  than  as  set  out  in  this  announcement,  the  other  key  terms  of  this  proposed 
transaction remain confidential.  
 
On completion of the transaction, Paladin will continue to hold 51% of LHM and be the operator. 
 
Sale of 75% of Manyingee  
 
Paladin currently owns 100% of Manyingee and has signed a binding terms sheet with MGT Resources 
Limited (MGT) for it to make a two-stage acquisition of 75% of Manyingee (excluding Carley Bore).  
 
On closing of the transaction, MGT will acquire a 30% initial interest in Manyingee for US$10M cash and 
will form a joint-venture over the  project  with Paladin (Manyingee JV). MGT will then have an option to 
acquire  an  additional  45%  of  Manyingee  JV  from  Paladin  for  US$20M  cash,  exercisable  for  12-months 
following Manyingee JV’s preparation of a plan to conduct a field leach trial for uranium extraction by in-
situ recovery method. 
 
Under the terms of the agreement, MGT will issue Paladin options to subscribe for new shares equivalent 
to 5%  of  MGT’s  shares  outstanding  for  a period  of  12-months from  closing  of  the  transaction  at A$0.06 
per share; and options to subscribe for new shares equivalent to 5% of MGT’s shares outstanding for a 
period of 24-months from closing of the transaction at A$0.08 per share. 
 
Paladin  will  issue  MGT  options  to  subscribe  for  new  shares  equivalent  to  2%  of  Paladin’s  shares 
outstanding for a period of 12-months from closing of the transaction at A$0.35 per share; and options to 
subscribe for new shares equivalent to 2% of Paladin’s shares outstanding for a period of 24-months from 
closing of the transaction at A$0.45 per share. 
 
The  transaction  is  conditional  on  definitive  documentation  and  a  vote  of  MGT’s  shareholders.  MGT’s 
directors have irrevocably agreed to vote in favour.  
 
LIKELY DEVELOPMENTS 
 
Likely  developments  in  the  operations  of  the  Group  constituted  by  the  Company  and  the  entities  it 
controls from time to time are set out under the section entitled Management, Discussion and Analysis.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS 
 
The  Group  is  subject  to  significant  environmental  regulation  in  respect  to  its  exploration,  evaluation, 
development  and  operational  activities  for  uranium  projects  under  the  laws  of  the  countries  in  which  its 
activities  are  conducted.    The  Group  currently  has  mining  and  processing  operations  in  Namibia  and 
Malawi (placed on care and maintenance in February 2014), as well as exploration projects in Australia, 
and  Canada.    The  Group’s  Policy  is  to  ensure  compliance  with  all  applicable  environmental  laws  and 
regulations in the countries in which it conducts business. 
 
Specific  environmental  regulations,  approvals  and  licences  for  the  exploration,  development  and 
operation  are  required  to  conduct  the  activities  at  each  site.    In  addition,  many  other  international  and 
industry  standards  are  also  applied  to  the  Group’s  activities,  including  those  specified  for  the  global 
uranium  industry.    These environmental  laws,  regulations  and  standards  relate  to environmental  factors 
such as radiation, water, flora, fauna, air quality, noise, waste management and pollution control. 
 
The Directors are not aware of any environmental matters which would have a significant adverse effect 
on the Group. 
 
REMUNERATION FOR THE YEAR AT A GLANCE 
 
Details of the remuneration received by the Key Management Personnel are prepared in accordance with 
statutory requirements and accounting standards, and are detailed further in the Remuneration Report. 
 
The disclosure below aims to provide an overall picture of the group-wide remuneration platform and not 
simply focus on Key Management Personnel.  Given the difficult business and operating conditions which 
have  persisted  throughout  the  year,  specifically  the  continuing  poor  uranium  price,  and  resulting  cash 
constraints  that  the  Company  faced  during  the  past  year,  with  the  exception  of  a  small  number  of 
employees  who  received  adjustments  for  parity  issues  seen  within  local  labour  markets,  there  were  no 
general salary increases granted across the Group.  
  

Paladin reduced its corporate staff by approximately 60% during the September quarter.  No salary 
increases at the corporate office. 
 
Ex-pat numbers at the Kayelekera Mine were reduced by 50%.
Number  of  Non-Executive  Directors  reduced  from  five  to  four  and  the  board  reduced  its 
remuneration  structure  with  an  effective  date  of  1  July  2015.    The  base  salary  for  Non-Executive 
Directors was reduced by 57% from A$150,000 to A$65,000 and the Non-Executive Chairman by 
59% from A$306,000 to A$125,000. 
 
A significant number of management personnel agreed a further 10% reduction in salary in addition 
to their original 10% reduction.  This 20% reduction was not offset by any non-cash compensation 
such as a choice of an issue of share rights, additional leave or an option of reduced working hours 
in salary.  
 
Cash bonuses totalling only US$19,000 were paid across the Group this year. 
 
A focus on rationalisation  and consolidation  of the  workforce continued  with a reduction  in overall 
headcount  across  the  Group  and  certain  roles  made  redundant  over  the  period.    Additionally, 
where natural attrition occurred, only those roles deemed to be critical were replaced.  
 
8,052,500(1) Share Appreciation Rights (SARs) were granted during the year. 
 
A total of 788,754 Share Rights  vested during the  year (0.05% of issued capital).  All  were issued 
on  1  December  2014  as  an  offset  to  10%  reduction  in  management  personnel’s  base  salaries  in 
prior years.
A  total  of  127,390  shares  (0.01%  of  issued  capital)  were  issued  on  the  vesting  of  577,500  SARs 
during  the  year  ended  30  June  2016.  This  represents  the  conversion  of  SARs  that  vested  upon 
cessation of employment and which were subsequently exercised.

REMUNERATION FOR THE YEAR AT A GLANCE (continued) 
 
Executive Remuneration - cash value of earnings realised (continued) 
 

Long-term  incentives  on  issue  at  balance  date  comprise  3,000,000  Options  (0.18%  of  issued 
capital) and 7,125,000(1)(2) SARs.
(1) The number of ordinary shares ultimately issuable upon vesting of the SARs will vary as the number of 
ordinary shares to be issued is based upon Paladin’s relative share price growth over the relevant vesting 
periods.  
 
(2) Based on the closing share price at 30 June 2016 of A$0.185 no shares (0% of issued capital) would be 
issuable. 
 
Executive Remuneration – cash value of earnings realised (unaudited) 
 
In keeping with the Company’s practice since 2011, the tables below set out the cash value of earnings 
realised by the Managing  Director/CEO and other executives considered to represent Key  Management 
Personnel (KMP) for 2016  and 2015 and the  intrinsic  value  of share-based payments that vested to the 
executives  during  the  period.    This  voluntary  disclosure  is  in  addition  and  different  to  the  disclosures 
required by  the Corporations Act and Accounting  Standards, particularly in relation to share rights. As a 
general  principle,  the  Accounting  Standards  require  a  value  to  be  placed  on  share  rights  based  on 
probabilistic  calculations  at  the  time of  grant,  which  may  be reflected  in the  remuneration  report  even  if 
ultimately  the  share  rights  do  not  vest  because  vesting  conditions  are  not  met.  By  contrast,  this  table 
discloses  the  intrinsic  value  of  share  rights,  which  represents  only  those  share  rights  which  actually 
vested and resulted in shares issued to a KMP. The intrinsic value is the Company’s closing share price 
on the date of vesting.  
 
The  Company  believes  that  this  additional  information  is  useful  to  investors  as  recognised  by  the  2009 
Productivity  Commission  Inquiry  Report  ‘Executive  Remuneration  in  Australia’.  The  Commission 
recommended  that  remuneration  reports  should  include  actual  levels  of  remuneration  received  by  the 
individuals named in the report in order to increase its usefulness to investors. 
 
The  cash  value  of  earnings  realised  include  cash  salary  and  fees,  superannuation,  cash  bonuses  and 
other  benefits  received  in  cash  during  the  year  and  the  intrinsic  value  of  long-term  incentives  vesting 
during the 2016 year.  The tables do not include the accounting value for share rights, share appreciation 
rights and options granted in the current and prior years, as this value may or may not be realised as they 
are dependent on the achievement of certain performance hurdles.  The accounting value of other long-
term benefits which were not received in cash during the year have also been excluded.  
 
All  cash  remuneration  is  paid  in  Australian  dollars  to  those  parties  listed  below  (with  the  exception  of      
Mr  A  Molyneux  and  Mr  D  Garrow,  who are  paid  in  US$),  therefore  the  tables  are presented  in  both  A$ 
and  US$  (being  the  functional  and  presentation  currency  of  the  Company).    The  detailed  schedules  of 
remuneration presented later in this report are presented in US$.

This  Remuneration  Report  outlines  the  Director  and  executive  remuneration  arrangements  of  the 
Company and the Group in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and its 
Regulations.    For  the  purposes  of  this  report,  Key  Management  Personnel  of  the  Group  are  defined  as

 
 
 
For the purposes of this report, the term ‘Executive’ encompasses the CEO, senior executives, managers 
and company secretary of the Parent and the Group. 
 
REMUNERATION APPROVAL PROCESS 
 
The Remuneration Committee is charged with assisting the Board by reviewing and making appropriate 
recommendations  on  remuneration  packages  for  the  CEO,  Non-executive  Directors  and  senior 
executives.    In  addition,  it  makes  recommendations  on  long-term  incentive  plans  and  associated 
performance hurdles together with the quantum of grants made, taking into account both the individual’s 
and the Company’s performance.  
 
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Mr Zhang, held one meeting during the year.  Messrs Crabb, 
Shumka and Llewelyn are also Committee members.  The CEO is invited to attend those meetings which 
consider the remuneration strategy of the Group and recommendations in relation to senior executives.  
 
Having regard to the recommendations made by the CEO, the Committee approves the quantum of any 
short-term incentive bonus pool and the  total  number of any  long-term incentive grants to  be made and 
recommends the same for approval by the Board.  Individual awards are then determined by the CEO in 
conjunction with senior management, as appropriate. The remuneration for the CEO is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee. 
 
Any salary reviews and bonus payments are effective from 1 January in the year.

KEY ELEMENTS OF KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL/EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION STRATEGY 
 
The overall focus of Paladin’s remuneration strategy is to: 
 
 
 
 

provide competitive and fair reward; 
be flexible and responsive in line with market expectations; 
align Executive interests with those of the Company’s shareholders; and, 
comply with applicable legal requirements and appropriate standards of governance.
The  above  strategies  also  need  to  recognise  the  economic  situation  of  the  Group  given  the  prevailing 
uranium prices.  
 
This  strategy  applies  group  wide  for  all  employees.  Information  in  relation  to  the  compensation  of       
Non-executive Directors is detailed later in this Remuneration Report. 
 
The overall level of compensation takes into account the Company’s earnings and growth in shareholder 
wealth  of  the  Company  together  with  the  achievement  of  strategic  goals  but  must  also  reflect  current 
economic  conditions.    Consideration  of  the  Company’s  earnings  will  be  more  relevant  as  the  Company 
matures from its development and consolidation phase to profitability which is of course highly dependent 
on prevailing uranium prices.   
 
Due  to  continued  poor  uranium  prices,  the  Company  has  taken  significant  steps  to  reduce  the 
remuneration for all Key Management Personnel/Executives.  
 
The  Board  is  cognisant  of  general  shareholder  concern  that  long-term  equity-based  remuneration  be 
linked to Company performance and growth in shareholder value. SARs issued under the LTI programme 
have a one to three-year performance period. These SARs will only vest at the end of a one to three-year 
period.  If  a  Key  Management  Personnel/Executive  resigns  during  this  period,  they  will  ordinarily  forfeit 
their shares. This promotes a focus on long-term performance as the value of the shares is linked to the 
ongoing performance of the Company.  This period represents an appropriate balance between providing 
a genuine and foreseeable incentive to Key Management Personnel/Executives and fostering a long-term 
view of shareholder interests.  
 
The table below compares the earnings per share to the closing share price for the Company's five most 
recently completed financial years.

Fixed Remuneration 
 
This is reviewed annually with consideration given to both the Company and the individual’s performance 
and effectiveness.  Market data, focused on the mining industry, is analysed with a focus on maintaining 
parity  or  above  with  companies  of  similar  complexity  and  size  operating  in  the  resources  sector  and 
becoming  an  employer  of  choice.  The  Company  did  not  engage  remuneration  consultants,  however  it 
subscribes to a number of remuneration surveys and reports including Boardroom Remuneration Review 
(Connect 4), and AUSREM. The Company also takes into consideration the annual publication, Executive 
and Board Remuneration Report produced by Ernst & Young.  
 
Despite  the  challenging  economic  times,  local  reviews  against  industry  salary  benchmarks  were 
undertaken and in instances where there were parity issues, adjustments were made accordingly as part 
of  the  effort  to  maintain  a  competitive  remuneration  structure.  There  were  no  salary  increases  at  the 
corporate office.

Variable Remuneration (continued) 
 
Short-term Incentives 
 
The  Company  provides  short-term  incentives  comprising  a  cash  bonus  to  Executives  of  up  to  30%  of 
base salary.  The bonus is entirely discretionary with the goal of focusing attention on short-term strategic 
and  financial  objectives.    The  amount  is  dependent  on  the  Company’s  performance  in  its  stated 
objectives  and  the  individual’s  performance,  together  with  the  individual’s  position  and  level  of 
responsibility.  This component is an “at risk” component of overall remuneration designed to encourage 
exceptional performance whilst adhering to the Company values.  Specific targets for individuals have not 
been  set  due  to  the  philosophy  of  achieving  a  common  goal  for  the  Company,  however,  the  following 
measures  are  taken  into  account  where  these  are  applicable  to  the  Key  Management  Personnel  and 
individual Executives and have been selected to align their interests to those of shareholders: 
 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d) 
(e) 
(f) 
(g) 
 
The  above  must,  however,  be  viewed  in  the  context  of  the  operating  environment  and  the  priorities  in 
terms of the allocation and preservation of cash. 
 
Given  the  priority  of  cost  reduction  and  cash  conservation  with  the  uranium  industry  continuing  to 
experience difficult  times,  cash bonuses  totalling  only  US$19,000  were paid across  the  Group  this  year 
(FY2015 US$Nil). 
 
The  expectation  is  that  short-term  incentives  will  not  be  reinstated  until  such  time  as  the  operating 
environment improves and, at that time, a more structured incentive programme linked both to individual 
and corporate performance will be implemented.  
 
CEO 
 
A  success  fee  of  up  to  100%  of  base  salary  can  be  achieved  under  the  terms  of  his  contract,  having 
consideration  to  operational,  financial,  environmental  and  health  and  safety  outcomes  achieved  during 
the  calendar  year  as  determined  by  the  Remuneration  Committee.    For  the  calendar  year  2015  no 
success fee was awarded in line with the philosophy applying to all staff referred to earlier.   
 
Mr.  Molyneux  will  be  entitled  to  the  full  amount  of  the  success  fee  plus  an  additional  success  fee  of 
US$225,000  in  the  event  that  during  the  current  calendar  year  a  transaction  results  in  a  change  of 
material influence, being:  
 
(a) approximately 20% or more equity issuance to a party which is not an existing shareholder, with rights 
of director appointments;  
(b) a change of control (defined as greater than a 50% change in Paladin Energy Ltd shareholding); or  
(c)  sale  of  a  material  asset  or  assets,  requiring  shareholder  approval,  with  such  success  fee  only 
pertaining to transactions that are recommended by the board of directors. 
 
Any success fee payable, relating to the 2016 calendar year, would be paid out in CY2017. 
 
Long-term Incentives 
 
The  Company  believes  that  encouraging  its  employees  to  become  shareholders  is  the  best  way  of 
aligning their interests with those of its shareholders.  In 2009, the Company implemented an Employee 
Performance Share Rights  Plan  (the  Rights  Plan)  together  with a Contractor  Performance Share Rights 
Plan  (the  Contractor  Rights  Plan).    These  plans  are  referred  to  jointly  as  the  Rights  Plans  and  were 
reaffirmed by shareholders at the 2015 Annual General Meeting.

COMPONENTS OF KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL/EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION (CONTINUED) 
 
Variable Remuneration (continued) 
 
CEO (continued) 
 
Long-term Incentives (continued) 
 
The  Rights  Plans  are  long-term  incentive  plans  aimed  at  advancing  the  interests  of  the  Company  by 
creating a stronger link between employee performance and reward and increasing shareholder value by 
enabling participants to have a greater involvement with, and share in, the future growth and profitability 
of the Company.  They are an important tool in assisting to attract and retain talented people.  
 
SARs are granted under the plan for no consideration. SARs are a right to receive a  bonus equal to the 
appreciation  in  the  company's  share  price  over  a  period.  SARs  benefit  the  holder  with  an  increase  in 
share price; the holder is not required to pay the exercise price, but rather just receives the amount of the 
increase in shares.  The number of ordinary shares ultimately issuable upon vesting of the SARs will vary 
as the number of ordinary  shares to be issued is based upon Paladin’s relative share price growth over 
the relevant vesting periods. SARs granted under the FY16 LTI Offer were granted in 3 tranches and will 
only  vest  if  the  holder  remains  employed  at  the  relevant  vesting  dates  (1  November  2016,  2017  and 
2018). 
 
The number of share rights able to be issued under the Plans is limited to 5% of the issued capital.  The 
5%  limit  includes  incentive  grants  under  all  plans  made in the previous  5  years  (with certain  exclusions 
under the Australian corporate legislation).  This percentage now stands at 0.4%.  
 
The  Board  is  cognisant  of  general  shareholder  concern  that  long-term  equity-based  rewards  should  be 
linked to the performance of the Company. The  holder of a SAR only receives  an amount equivalent to 
the  share  price  increase  (i.e.  the  net  appreciation  amount,  which  is  the  market  price  on  exercise  date 
minus market price on grant date) in shares. 
 
The Company does not offer any loan facilities to assist in the purchase of shares by employees.  
 
The CEO was granted 3,000,000 options upon appointment, on 10 August 2015, as follows:-
Date granted 
10 August 2015

Number  
1,000,000 
1,000,000

3,000,000
The options issued to the CEO have different exercise prices and provide a direct link between the CEO’s 
reward and shareholder return, and provide a clear line of sight between CEO performance and Company 
performance.  
 
Shares Acquired Under the Rights Plan 
 
Shares  to  be  allocated  to  participants  on  vesting  are  currently  issued  from  equity.    No  consideration  is 
paid on the vesting of the share rights and resultant shares carry full dividend and voting rights.  
 
Change of Control 
 
All  SARs  will  vest  on  a  change  of  control  event.    The  Remuneration  Committee  considers  that  this  is 
appropriate  given  that  shareholders  (or  a  majority  thereof)  would  have  collectively  elected  to  accept  a 
change of control event.  Moreover the number of SARs relative to total issued shares is very insignificant 
(0.4%) and thus are not considered a disincentive to a potential bidder.

COMPONENTS OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION 
 
In accordance with corporate governance principles, Non-executive Directors are remunerated solely by 
way  of  fees  and  statutory  superannuation.   The  aggregate annual  remuneration  permitted to be paid  to 
Non-executive Directors is A$1.2M (US$1.0M) as approved by shareholders at the 2008 AGM.  Fees paid 
for  the  year  to  30  June  2016  total  A$361,000  (US$262,721).    The  Board  adjusted  its  remuneration 
structure  with  an  effective  date  of  1  July  2015.  The  revised  structure  reduced  the  base  salary  for  Non-
Executive  Directors  from  A$150,000  (US$109,164)  to  A$65,000  (US$47,304)  and  the  Non-Executive 
Chairman from A$306,000 (US$222,694) to A$125,000 (US$90,970).

COMPONENTS OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION (continued) 
 
The  following  graph  is  provided  to  give  a  clearer  understanding  of  the  Non-executive  Directors’ 
remuneration.
Other Fees/Benefits 
 
In  addition,  the  Company’s  Constitution  provides  for  additional  compensation  to  be  paid  if  any  of  the 
Directors  are  called  upon  to  perform  extra  services  or  make  any  special  exertions  on  behalf  of  the 
Company or the business of the Company.  The Company may compensate such Director in accordance 
with such services or exertions, and such compensation may be either in addition to or in substitution for 
the  Directors’  fees  referred  to  above.    No  additional  fees  were  paid  during  the  year,  other  than  the 
Directors’ fees disclosed.  
 
Non-executive  Directors  are  also  entitled  to  be  reimbursed  for  reasonable  expenses  incurred  whilst 
engaged  on  Company  business.    There  is  no  entitlement  to  compensation  on  termination  of  non-
executive directorships.  Non-executive Directors do not earn retirement benefits (other than the statutory 
superannuation) and are not entitled to any form of performance linked remuneration.  
 
Rotation of Directors  
 
Mr  Rick  Crabb  and Mr  Philip Bailey  will  seek  re-election  at the 2016  Annual  General  Meeting, following

Presentation Currency - The compensation table has been presented in US$, the Company’s functional and presentation currency.  The A$ value has also been shown as this is considered to be the most relevant comparator between years, given that
in 2016 more than 57% of KMP’s contracts for services were denominated in A$ and this eliminates the effects of fluctuations in the US$ and A$ exchange rate.  Exchange rate used is average for year US$ 1 = A$1.37408
(1) Mr John Borshoff resigned on 10 August 2015.
(2) Amounts previously accrued for Mr Borshoff’s retirement benefit in previous years were paid to Mr Borshoff on completion of the six month notice period provided for in Services Contract upon resignation. The accounting credit has arisen due to the 
reduction in Mr Borshoff's base salary that resulted in the final payment being lower than the amount accrued and disclosed in previous years.
(3) Amounts previously accrued for Mr. Borshoff’s long service leave in previous years were paid to Mr Borshoff on completion of the six month notice period. The accounting credit has arisen due to the reduction in Mr Borshoff's base salary that resulted 
in the final payment being lower than the amount accrued and disclosed in previous years.
(4) Mr Sean Llewelyn resigned on 21 August 2015.
(5) Represents fees paid for services as CEO.
(6) Ms Gillian Swaby resigned on 21 August 2015. Includes twelve months payment in lieu of notice. Represents fees for Ms Gillian Swaby’s services as Group Company Secretary and EGM – Corporate Services, paid to a company of which Ms Gillian
Swaby is a director and shareholder.
(7) Mr Dustin Garrow retrenched on 21 August 2015. Includes six months payment in lieu of notice and severance pay.
(8) Amounts previously accrued for Mr Garrow’s long service leave in previous years. The accounting credit has arisen as number of years’ service requirement was not satisfied upon retrenchment.
* A reconciliation of this figure in A$ follows to enable a clearer understanding of how this number is calculated.

The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements have been grouped into six key categories, which 
are summarised as follows: 
 
Basis of Presentation 
 
This section sets out the group’s significant accounting policies that relate to the financial statements 
as a whole.  Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to 
which  it  relates.  Accounting  policies  determined  non-significant  are  not  included  in  the  financial 
statements.  There  have  been  no  changes  to  the  Group’s  accounting  policies  that  are  no  longer 
disclosed in the financial statements. 
 
Segment Information 
 
This section compares performance across operating segments. 
 
Capital Structure 
 
This section outlines how the group manages its capital and related financing costs. 
 
Performance for the Year 
 
This section focuses on the results and performance of the group. This covers both profitability and the 
resultant return to shareholders via earnings per share combined with cash generation. 
 
Operating Assets and Liabilities 
 
This  section  shows  the  assets  used  to  generate  the  group’s  trading  performance  and  the  liabilities 
incurred as a result. Liabilities relating to the group’s financing activities are addressed in the Capital 
Structure section. 
 
Other Notes 
 
This section deals with the remaining notes that do not fall into any of the other categories. 
 
NOTE 3.

NOTE 3.   BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) 
 
The  Financial  Report  complies  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  as  issued  by  the 
International  Accounting  Standards  Board.    The  Financial  Report  has  also  been  prepared  on  a 
historical  cost  basis,  except  for  available-for-sale  investments,  which  have  been  measured  at  fair 
value.  Where necessary,  comparatives have been reclassified and repositioned for consistency  with 
current  year  disclosures.  For  the  purposes  of  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the 
Company is a for-profit entity. 
 
The  Financial  Report  is  presented  in  US  dollars  and  all  values  are  rounded  to  the  nearest  hundred 
thousand  dollars  (US$100,000)  unless  otherwise  stated  under  the  option  available  to  the  Company 
under  Australian  Securities  and  Investments  Commission  (ASIC)  Corporations  (Rounding  in 
Financial/Directors’ Reports) Instrument 2016/191. The Company is an entity to which the Instrument 
applies. 
 
Changes in Accounting Policies 
 
Apart  from  the  changes  in  accounting  policies  noted  below,  the  accounting  policies  adopted  are 
consistent with those disclosed in the Financial Report for the year ended 30 June 2015. 
 
New Accounting Standards and Interpretations 
 
The  Group  has  adopted  all  new  and  amended  Australian  Accounting  Standards  and  AASB 
Interpretations  effective  from  1  July  2015.  The  nature  and  impact  of  each  new  standard  and 
amendment is described below:

amendments arising from the issuance of AASB CF 
2013-1.
Part B makes amendments to particular Australian 
Accounting Standards to delete references to AASB 
1031 and also makes minor editorial amendments 
to various other standards.
AASB 2015-3  Amendments to Australian Accounting 
Standards arising from the Withdrawal 
of AASB 1031 Materiality
No direct impact on accounts but the changes apply to

NOTE 3.   BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) 
 
Basis of Consolidation 
 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Paladin Energy Ltd and its 
subsidiaries as at 30 June 2016 (the Group).  
 
Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement 
with  the  investee  and  has  the  ability  to  affect  those  returns  through  its  power  over  the  investee. 
Specifically, the Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has: 
 

Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant  
activities of the investee); 
Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and 
The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.
The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee 
Rights arising from other contractual arrangements 
The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights
 
 
 
When  the  Group  has  less  than  a  majority  of  the  voting  or  similar  rights  of  an  investee,  the  Group 
considers  all  relevant  facts  and  circumstances  in  assessing  whether  it  has  power  over  an  investee, 
including: 
 
 
 
 
 
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that 
there  are  changes  to  one  or  more  of  the  three  elements  of  control.  Consolidation  of  a  subsidiary 
begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control 
of  the  subsidiary.  Assets,  liabilities,  income  and  expenses  of  a  subsidiary  acquired  or  disposed  of 
during the year are included in the statement of comprehensive income from the date the Group gains 
control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. 
 
Profit  or  loss  and each component of  other  comprehensive income (OCI)  are  attributed  to the equity 
holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-
controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements  of  subsidiaries  to  bring  their  accounting  policies  into  line  with  the  Group’s  accounting 
policies.  All  intra-group  assets  and  liabilities,  equity,  income,  expenses  and  cash  flows  relating  to 
transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. 
 
A  change  in  the  ownership  interest  of  a  subsidiary,  without  a  loss  of  control,  is  accounted  for  as  an 
equity transaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

De-recognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary 
De-recognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests 
De-recognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity 
Recognises the fair value of the consideration received 
Recognises the fair value of any investment retained 
Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss 
Reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously recognised in OCI to profit or loss or 
retained earnings, as appropriate, as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the 
related assets or liabilities 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.

Foreign Currency Translation 
 
Functional and Presentation Currency 
 
Items  included  in  the  Financial  Statements  of  each  of  the  Group's  entities  are  measured  using  the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency').  
The  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  are  presented in United  States  dollars  (US  dollars),  which  is 
the Company’s functional and presentation currency.   
 
Transactions and Balances 
 
Foreign  currency  transactions  are  converted  into  the  functional  currency  using  the  exchange  rates 
prevailing  at  the  dates  of  the  transactions.    Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the 
settlement  of  such  transactions  and  from  the  translation  at  year-end  exchange  rates  of  monetary 
assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  are  recognised  in  the  Income  Statement.  
Translation  differences  on  available-for-sale  financial  assets  are  included  in  the  available-for-sale 
reserve. 
 
Group Companies 
 
Some Group entities have a functional currency of US dollars which is consistent with the Company’s 
functional and presentational currency.  For all other Group entities the functional currency has been 
translated  into  US  dollars  for  presentation  purposes.    Assets  and  liabilities  are  translated  using 
exchange rates prevailing  at the  balance date; revenues and expenses are translated using average 
exchange  rates  prevailing  for  the  income  statement  year;  and  equity  transactions  are  translated  at 
exchange  rates  prevailing  at  the  dates  of  transactions.    The  resulting  difference  from  translation  is 
recognised  in  a  foreign  currency  translation  reserve.    Upon  the  sale  of  a  subsidiary  the  Functional 
Currency Translation Reserve (FCTR) attributable to the parent is recycled to the Income Statement.  
 
The following material operating subsidiaries have a US dollar functional currency: 
 

Paladin Finance Pty Ltd


Paladin (Africa) Limited
Langer Heinrich Uranium (Pty) Ltd

NOTE 3.   BASIS OF PREPARATION (continued) 
 
Significant Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions 
 
The  preparation  of  the  Group’s  consolidated  financial  statements  requires  management  to  make 
judgements,  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues,  expenses, 
assets  and  liabilities,  and  the  accompanying  disclosures,  and  the  disclosure  of  contingent  liabilities. 
Uncertainty  about  these  assumptions  and  estimates  could  result  in  outcomes  that  require  a  material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. 
 
The  carrying  amounts  of  certain  assets  and  liabilities  are  often  determined  based  on  estimates  and 
assumptions  of  future  events.    The  key  estimates  and  assumptions,  that  have  a  significant  risk  of 
causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities within the next 
annual reporting period, are dealt with elsewhere in the notes. 
 
NOTE 4.  GOING CONCERN 
 
As at 30 June 2016, the Group had a net current asset deficit of US$139.9M (30 June 2015: surplus 
US$231.8M), including cash on hand of US$59.2M (30 June 2015: US$183.7M).  Included within this 
cash on hand is US$0.6M (30 June 2015: US$31.2M), which is restricted for use in respect of supplier 
guarantees provided by LHM, (30 June 2015: restricted for use in respect of the LHM syndicated loan 
facility and supplier guarantees provided by LHM). 
 
The syndicated loan facility was repaid in full on 31 March 2016. 
 
Repayment  obligations  during  the next  twelve months  to 30 June 2017 in respect of interest  bearing 
loans and borrowings are summarised as follows:
  interest  payments  of  US$23.2M  for  the  2012  (due  2017)  and  2015  (due  2020)  unsecured
convertible bonds.
  US$212M principal repayment of 2012 unsecured convertible bonds maturing on 30 April 2017.
The  ability  of  the  Group  to  pay  its  debts  as  and  when  they  fall  due  and  thus  to  continue  as  a  going 
concern  is  dependent  upon  the  achievement  of  certain  strategic  and financing  initiatives,  as  outlined 
below. 
 
The Directors are satisfied that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern 
basis, due to:
  The following strategic initiatives announced on 21 July 2016:
o  A  non-binding  terms  sheet  signed  with  CNNC  Overseas  Uranium  Holdings  Ltd 
(COUH) (the existing 25% minority shareholder in LHM), to sell a 24% interest in the 
Langer  Heinrich  Mine.  The  sale  is  expected  to  raise  US$175M  in  cash  for  the 
Company with the Company working towards a formal close of the transaction in the 
fourth quarter of the 2016 calendar year.
o  A binding terms sheet signed with MGT Resources Limited (“MGT”) for sale of up to a 
75%  interest  in  the  Company’s  100%  owned  Manyingee  project.  On  closing  of  the 
transaction,  MGT  will  acquire  a  30%  initial  interest  in  Manyingee  for  US$10M  cash 
with an option to acquire an additional 45% interest within twelve months for US$20M 
cash. The transaction is conditional on definitive documentation and a vote of MGT’s 
shareholders expected to be concluded in the fourth quarter of CY2016.
  The Company’s history of successful capital raisings and other financing arrangements.
Should the Group not achieve the matters set out above, there is uncertainty whether the Group would 
continue  as  a  going  concern  and  therefore  whether  it  would  realise  its  assets  and  extinguish  its 
liabilities  in  the  normal  course  of  business  and  at  the  amounts  stated  in  the  financial  report.  The 
financial  report  does  not  include  adjustments  relating  to  the  recoverability  or  classification  of  the 
recorded  assets  amounts  nor  to  the  amounts  or  classification  of  liabilities  that  might  be  necessary 
should the Group not be able to continue as a going concern.

SEGMENT INFORMATION 
 
NOTE 5. 
 
Identification of Reportable Segments 
 
The  Company  has  identified  its  operating  segments  to  be  Exploration,  Namibia  and  Malawi,  on  the 
basis  of  the  nature  of  the  activity  and  geographical  location  and  different  regulatory  environments.  
The  main  segment  activity  in  Namibia  and  Malawi(1)  is  the  production  and  sale  of  uranium  from  the 
mines  located  in  these  geographic  regions.    The  Exploration  segment  is  focused  on  developing 
exploration  and  evaluation  projects  in  Australia  and  Canada.  Unallocated  portion  covers  the 
Company’s sales and marketing, treasury, corporate and administration. 
 
Discrete  financial  information  about  each  of  these  operating  segments  is  reported  to  the  Group’s 
executive management team (chief operating decision makers) on at least a monthly basis. 
 
The  accounting  policies  used  by  the  Group  in  reporting  segments  internally  are  the  same  as  those 
contained in the accounts and in the prior period. 
 
Inter-entity sales are priced with reference to the spot rate. 
 
Corporate  charges  comprise  non-segmental  expenses  such  as  corporate  office  expenses.    A 
proportion  of  the  corporate  charges  are  allocated  to  Namibia  and  Malawi  on  the  basis  of  timesheet 
allocations with the balance remaining in Unallocated. 
 
The Group’s customers are major utilities and  other  entities located mainly  in USA, Australia, China, 
Taiwan  and  UK.    These  revenues  are  attributed  to  the  geographic  location  of  the  mines  being  the 
reporting segments Namibia and Malawi.

Currently on care and maintenance due to low uranium price. Production ceased on 6 May 2014.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE 
 
The  group's  objectives  when  managing  capital  are  to  safeguard  its  ability  to  continue  as  a  going 
concern, so that it can continue to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders 
and  to  maintain  an  efficient  capital  structure  to  reduce  the  cost  of  capital.  Capital  includes  issued 
capital and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the parent. 
 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may issue new shares or sell assets to 
reduce debt. 
 
The  group  monitors  capital  on  the  basis  of  the  level  of  return  on  capital  and  also  the  level  of  net 
cash/debt and compliance with bank covenants, including the gearing ratio calculated as a net debt / 
(net  debt  +  equity).  The  group  manages  funds  on  a  group  basis  with  all  funds  being  drawn  by  the 
parent entity.

On 31 March 2015, the Company issued US$150M in convertible bonds with a coupon rate of

Secured bank loans 
 
(3)
Langer  Heinrich  Mine,  Namibia  -  US$70M  Syndicated  Loan  Facility  was  repaid  in  full  on  31 
March  2016.  At  30  June  2016,  US$Nil  (30  June  2015:  US$60.9M)  was  outstanding  under  the 
syndicated loan facility.
Recognition and measurement 
 
Bank loan borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.  Bank loan 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.  Any difference between the proceeds (net 
of  transaction  costs)  and  the  redemption  amount  is  recognised  in  the  Income  Statement  over  the 
period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
 
Borrowings  are  classified  as  current  liabilities  unless  the  Group  has  an  unconditional  right  to  defer 
settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance date. 
 
The component of convertible bonds that exhibits characteristics of debt is recognised as a liability in 
the  Statement  of  Financial  Position,  net  of  transaction  costs.    On issue  of  convertible bonds,  the  fair 
value  of  the  liability  component  is  determined  using  a  market  rate  for  an  equivalent  non-convertible 
bond  and  this  amount  is  carried  as  a  liability  on  the  amortised  cost  basis  until  extinguished  on 
conversion or redemption.  The increase in the liability due to the passage of time  is recognised as a 
finance cost.  The remainder of the proceeds is allocated to the equity component and is recognised in 
shareholders’ equity.  The carrying amount of the equity component is not remeasured in subsequent 
years.

As part of the sale of a 25% interest in the Langer Heinrich mining operation, US$96M (representing 
25%)  of  the  intercompany  shareholder  loans  owing  by  LHU  to  PFPL  were  assigned  to  CNNC  under 
the  same  interest  rate  (LIBOR  plus  a  margin  between  2%  and  4.25%)  and  conditions  as  those 
presently existing.  
 
Pursuant  to  the  intercompany  shareholder  loan  agreements,  repayment  dates  range  from  2016  to 
2021, however, under the Shareholders’ Agreement between CNNC and PFPL, each shareholder has 
agreed not to demand repayment without the prior written consent of the other shareholder. As neither 
CNNC nor PFPL can demand repayment, the repayment of the loans can be deferred.  Repayment is 
dependent  on  LHU  generating  sufficient  free  cash  flows  to  repay  the  loans  and  the  loans  have  not 
been  guaranteed  by  Paladin  Energy  Ltd  (Paladin).  During  the  quarter  ended  31  March  2016  a 
US$5.2M  distribution  was made by  LHU to CNNC by way of a repayment of the intercompany loans 
assigned.    US$10.4M  of  the  balance  has  been  classified  as  current  at  30  June  2016  due  to  the 
intention to repay within twelve months. 
 
All  loan  repayments  from  LHU  will  be  paid  on  a  pro  rata  basis  against  the  outstanding  balances,  
(i.e. 75% to PFPL and 25% to CNNC). 
 
On  consolidation,  PFPL’s  75%  share  of  the  LHU  intercompany  shareholder  loans  are  eliminated 
against  the  intercompany  shareholder  loans  receivable  recorded  in  PFPL  and  therefore,  they  do  not 
appear  on  Paladin’s  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position.    As  a  result  of  the  consolidation  of 
100% of LHU’s assets and liabilities, LHU's  total liability of US$96.7M to CNNC is recognised on the 
consolidated statement of financial position.

NOTE 10.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies
The Group’s management of financial risk is aimed at ensuring net cash flows are sufficient to:


meet all its financial commitments; and
maintain the capacity to fund corporate growth activities.
The Group monitors its forecast financial position on a regular basis. 
 
Market,  liquidity  and  credit  risk  (including  foreign  exchange,  commodity  price  and  interest  rate  risk) 
arise in the normal course of the Group’s business.  These risks are managed under Board approved 
directives  which  underpin  treasury  practices  and  processes.    The  Group’s  principal  financial 
instruments  comprise  interest  bearing  debt,  cash  and  short-term  deposits  and  available  for  sale 
financial assets.  Other financial instruments include trade receivables and trade payables, which arise 
directly from operations. 
 
The  Group’s  forecast  financial  risk  position  with  respect  to  key  financial  objectives  and  compliance 
with treasury practice is regularly reported to the Board.  
 
Market Risk 
 
Foreign Exchange Risk 
 
The  Group  operates  internationally  and  is  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk  arising  from  various 
currency exposures.  
 
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commitments, assets and liabilities that are denominated in a 
currency that is not the functional currency of the relevant Group company. 
 
The  Group’s  borrowings  and  deposits  are  largely  denominated  in  US  dollars.  Currently  there  are  no 
foreign  exchange  hedge  programmes  in  place.    However,  the  Group  treasury  function  manages  the 
purchase of foreign currency to meet operational requirements. 
 
The financial instruments exposed to movements in the Namibian dollar are as follows:
Financial assets 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Trade and other receivables 
 
 
 
Financial liabilities 
Trade and other payables 
 
Net exposure 
 
Based  on  the  Group’s  net  exposure  at  the  balance  date,  a  reasonably  possible  change  in  the 
exchange rate would not have a material impact on profit or equity.

NOTE 10.   FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued) 
 
Market Risk (continued) 
 
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group’s financial position will be adversely affected by movements 
in interest rates that will increase the cost of floating rate debt or opportunity losses that may arise on 
fixed  rate  borrowings  in  a  falling  interest  rate  environment.  Interest  rate  risk  on  cash  and  short-term 
deposits  is  not  considered  to  be  a  material  risk  due  to  the  short-term  nature  of  these  financial 
instruments. 
 
The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term debt. Floating rate debt exposes the Group 
to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed rate debt exposes the Group to fair value interest rate risk. All 
other  financial  assets  and  liabilities  in  the  form  of  receivables,  investments  in  shares,  payables  and 
provisions, are non-interest bearing. 
 
The  Group  currently  does  not  engage  in  any  hedging  or  derivative  transactions  to  manage  interest 
rate risk. 
 
The floating rate financial instruments exposed to interest rates movements are as follows:
Financial assets 
Cash and cash equivalents – short-term deposits 
 
Financial liabilities 
Interest-bearing liabilities 
 
Net exposure 
 
Based  on  the  Group’s  net  exposure  at  the  balance  date,  a  reasonably  possible  change  in  LIBOR 
would not have a material impact on profit or equity.

Liquidity Risk
The  liquidity  position  of  the  Group is managed  to ensure  sufficient  liquid funds  are available to meet 
the Group’s financial commitments in a timely and cost effective manner. 
 
The  Group  treasury  function  continually  reviews  the  Group’s  liquidity  position  including  cash  flow 
forecasts  to  determine  the  forecast  liquidity  position  and  maintain  appropriate  liquidity  levels. 
Sensitivity  analysis  is  conducted  on  a range of  pricing and market assumptions  to ensure  the  Group 
has the ability to meet repayment commitments.  This enables the Group to manage cash flows on a 
long-term  basis  and  provides  the  flexibility  to  pursue  a  range  of  funding  alternatives  if  necessary.   
Note 7 details the repayment obligations in respect of the amount of the facilities.

instrument  that  will  result  in  a  financial  loss  to  the  Group.    The  carrying  amount  of  financial  assets 
represents  the  maximum  credit  exposure.  The  Group  trades  only  with  recognised,  creditworthy  third 
parties.  In  addition,  receivable  balances  are  monitored  on  an  ongoing  basis  with  the  result  that  the 
Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. 
 
The  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  at  the  reporting  date  was  a  total  of  US$72.6M  (2015 
US$193.8M), comprising cash and receivables.

The Group uses various methods in estimating the fair value of a financial instrument.   The methods 
comprise: 
 
Level 1 – the fair value is calculated using quoted prices in active markets. 
Level 2 – the fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).

The  fair  value  has  been  determined  by  discounting  the  future  cash  flows  using  market  rates 
currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities. 
The  fair  value  has  been  determined  using  a  valuation  technique  based  on  the  quoted  market 
price  of  the  bonds  less  the  estimated  fair  value  of  the  equity  component  attributable  to  the 
conversion feature, which was valued using an option pricing model. The estimated fair value of 
the equity component was not considered material at 30 June 2016.
Quoted market price represents the fair  value determined based on quoted prices on active markets 
as at the reporting date without any deduction for transaction costs. The fair value of the listed equity 
investments are based on quoted market prices. 
 
For financial  instruments not quoted in active markets, the Group uses valuation techniques such as 
present value techniques, comparison to similar instruments for which market observable prices exist 
and  other  relevant  models  used  by  market  participants.  These  valuation  techniques  use  both 
observable and unobservable market inputs. 
 
For financial instruments that are recognised at fair value on a recurring basis, the  Group determines 
whether  transfers  have  occurred  between  Levels  in  the  hierarchy  by  re-assessing  categorisation 
(based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end 
of each reporting period. 
 
Capital Management 
 
When  managing  capital,  management’s  objective  is  to  ensure  adequate  cash  resources  to  meet  the 
Company’s  commitments  are  maintained,  as  well  as  to  maintain  optimal  returns  to  shareholders 
through ensuring the lowest cost of capital available to the entity.

Capital Management (continued) 
 
The  Company  utilises  a  combination  of  debt,  equity  and  convertible  bonds  to  provide  the  cash 
resources required. Management reviews the capital structure from time to time as appropriate. 
 
The  Group  treasury  function  is  responsible  for  the  Group’s  capital  management,  including 
management of the long-term debt and cash as part of the capital structure.  This involves the use of 
corporate  forecasting  models  which  enable  analysis  of  the  Group’s  financial  position  including  cash 
flow forecasts to determine the future capital management requirements.  To ensure sufficient funding 
for  operational  expenditure  and  growth  activities,  a  range  of  assumptions  are  modelled  so  as  to 
provide the flexibility in determining the Group’s optimal future capital structure. 
 
Group treasury  monitors  gearing and compliances  with various  contractual  financial  covenants.    The 
Company’s  project  finance  facility  is  subject  to  various  financial  undertakings  including  a  negative 
pledge, debt service coverage ratio, loan life coverage ratio and project life coverage ratio.  At the time 
of reporting, the Company was in compliance with all of the facility’s financial undertakings.

Recognition and measurement 
 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.  Amounts disclosed 
as revenue are net of duties and taxes paid. Revenue is recognised for the major business activities as 
follows: 
 
Sale of Uranium 
 
Revenue from sale of uranium is recognised when risk and reward of ownership pass, which is when 
title of the product passes from the Group pursuant to an enforceable contract, when selling prices are 
known  or  can  be  reasonably  estimated  and  when  the  product  is  in  a  form  that  requires  no  further 
treatment by the Group.  
 
Interest Revenue 
 
Interest revenue from investments in cash is recognised in the Income Statement as interest accrues 
using  the  effective  interest  method.    This  is  a method of  calculating  the amortised  cost  of  a financial 
asset and allocating the interest income over the relevant period using the effective interest rate, which 
is  the  rate  that  exactly  discounts  estimated  future  cash  receipts  through  the  expected  life  of  the 
financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.

Impairment charge of US$168.9M relating to the impairment of LHM Ore Stockpiles.  A change in 
LHM’s life of mine plan, in order to reduce costs and improve cashflows, has resulted in a change 
in  the  timescale  for  processing  the  ore  stockpiles.    The  stockpiles  are  now  forecast  to  be 
processed over the next three years compared to nine years under the previous life of mine plan.  
The lower short-term forecast prices over the next three years compared to medium to long-term 
forecast prices, when the stockpiles were originally planned to be processed, has resulted  in the 
net realisable value at 30 June 2016 being estimated as US$Nil.    Refer to Note 17.
(3)  2015 - The licence for Spinifex Well was surrendered on 22 September 2014. All capitalised costs

(4)  2015 - Impairment charge of US$237.5M, Queensland exploration assets US$229.1M and Bigrlyi 
project US$8.4M.  At 30 June 2015, due to the continuing depressed uranium price, US$229.1M 
(US$180.8M after tax) was recognised to reduce the carrying value of the Queensland exploration 
assets.  The  estimated  recoverable  amount  of  the  project  of  US$100.0M  was  determined  on  the 
basis  of  fair  value  less  costs  to  dispose  (level  3  fair  value  hierarchy),  using  a  valuation  range 
provided  by  recent  comparable  market  transactions  and  other  market  indicators  which  ranged 
from US$0.3/lb to US$7.5/lb.   The estimated recoverable amount for the Queensland exploration 
assets equated to US$0.75/lb, which is based on more recent market transactions and the current 
uranium market.  Bigrlyi was written down to a carrying value of US$Nil.

legislation; and
no  changes  in  tax  legislation  adversely  affect  the  Consolidated  Entities  in  realising  the  benefit 
from the deductions for the losses.
Recognition and measurement 
 
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are measured at the amount expected 
to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.  The tax rates and tax laws used to compute 
the amount are those that are enacted or substantially enacted, at the reporting date in the countries 
where the Group operates and generates taxable income. 
 
Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the 
statement of profit or loss.  Management periodically  evaluates positions taken in the tax returns  with 
respect  to  situations  in  which  applicable  tax  regulations  are  subject  to  integration  and  establishes 
provisions where appropriate.

INCOME AND OTHER TAXES (continued)
NOTE 13.  
 
Recognition and measurement (continued) 
 
Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognised  using  the  full  liability  method  for  temporary 
differences at the tax rates expected to apply when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, 
based  on  those  tax  rates  which  are  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  for  each  jurisdiction.    The 
relevant  tax  rates  are  applied  to  the  cumulative  amounts  of  deductible  and  taxable  temporary 
differences to measure the deferred tax asset or liability.  An exception is made for certain temporary 
differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability.  No deferred tax asset or liability 
is  recognised  in  relation  to  these  temporary  differences  if  they  arose  in  a  transaction,  other  than  a 
business  combination,  that  at  the  time  of  the  transaction  did  not  affect  either  accounting  profit  or 
taxable profit or loss. 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if 
it  is  probable that future taxable  amounts  will  be  available to  utilise those temporary  differences  and 
losses. 
 
Current  and  deferred  tax  balances  attributable  to  amounts  recognised  directly  in  equity  are  also 
recognised directly in equity.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable 
right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the  deferred tax assets and 
liabilities relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
 
Significant Accounting Estimates and Assumptions 
 
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities 
 
The  Group  is  subject  to  income  taxes  in  Australia  and  jurisdictions  where  it  has  foreign  operations.  
Significant  judgement  is  required  in  determining  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.    There  are  many 
transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary 
course of business. 
 
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to 
the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part 
of  the  deferred  income  tax  asset  to  be  utilised.    Significant  management  judgement  is  required  to 
determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and 
the  level  of  future  taxable  profits,  together  with  future  tax  planning  strategies.    The  utilisation  of  the 
Group’s net deferred tax asset at 30 June 2016 of US$36.3M is dependent on future profits arising in 
the  Namibian  tax  jurisdiction  in  excess  of  those  arising  from  the  reversal  of  deferred  tax  liabilities. 
Although  the  Group’s  result  in  the  current  period  in  the  Namibian  tax  jurisdiction  was  a  loss, 
management has assessed that the utilisation of the deferred tax asset is probable, due to the Group’s 
forecast future taxable income in that the jurisdiction (refer to Note 20 for further disclosure of the key 
inputs  into  the  forecast  pre-tax  cash  flows  for  the  LHU  mine)  and  the  Group’s  history  of  utilising 
Namibian tax losses. 
 
Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised 
to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to 
be recovered.

Basic Earnings Per Share 
 
Basic  earnings  per  share  are  calculated  by  dividing  the  profit  attributable  to  equity  holders  of  the 
Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. 
 
Diluted Earnings Per Share  
 
Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to 
take into account the after income tax effect associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the 
weighted average number of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to 
dilutive potential ordinary shares.  Diluted earnings per share is the same as basic earnings per share 
in 2016 and 2015 as the Group is in a loss position.

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 30 day terms.  Carrying value 
approximates  fair  value  due  to  the  short-term  nature  of  the  receivables.    An  allowance  for

Loans and Receivables 
 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 
not  quoted  in  an  active  market.    They  arise  when  the  Group  provides  money,  goods  or  services 
directly  to  a  debtor  with  no  intention  of  selling  the  receivable.    They  are  included  in  current  assets, 
except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance date which are classified as 
non current assets. 
 
Collectability  of  trade  receivables  is  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis.    Debts  that  are  known  to  be 
uncollectible are  written  off  when identified.    An  allowance for  doubtful  debts  is  raised  when there  is 
objective  evidence  that  the  group  will  not  be  able  to  collect  the  debt.    Financial  difficulties  of  the 
debtor,  default  payments  or  debts  more  than  60  days  overdue  are  considered  objective  evidence  of 
impairment.

2015 – Ore Stockpiles at LHM that are unlikely to be processed within 12 months of the balance sheet 
date are classified as non current. 
 
Inventory Expense 
 
Inventories  sold  recognised  as  an  expense  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  totalled  US$152.5M 
(2015: US$189.7M) for the Group.   
 
Impairment of Inventories 
 
During  2016,  the  carrying  value  of  ore  stockpiles  held  at  LHM  was  reduced  to  net  realisable  value 
resulting  in  an  impairment  loss  of  US$168.9M  (2015:  US$Nil)  for  the  year,  recognised  in  other 
expenses.  A change in LHM’s life of mine plan, in order to reduce costs and improve cashflows, has 
resulted  in  a  change  in  the  timescale  for  processing  the  ore  stockpiles.    The  stockpiles  are  now 
forecast to be processed over the next three years compared to nine years under the previous life of 
mine  plan.    The  lower  short-term  forecast  prices  over  the  next  three  years  compared  to  medium  to 
long-term forecast prices, when the stockpiles were originally planned to be processed, has resulted in 
the net realisable value at 30 June 2016 being estimated as US$Nil.  The net realisable value of the 
ore  stockpiles  is  dependent  on  a  number  of  key  factors  including:  uranium  price  (for  which  a 
combination  of  spot  and  forward  pricing  has  been  used  for  the  next  three  years),  future  processing 
costs, grade and recovery rates. 
 
During  2016,  work-in-progress  held  at  LHM  was  reduced  to  net  realisable  value  resulting  in  an 
impairment loss of US$14.6M (2015: US$8.0M) for the year, recognised in cost of sales. 
 
During  2016,  finished  goods  held  at  LHM  were  reduced  to  net  realisable  value  resulting  in  an 
impairment loss of US$4.6M (2015: US$Nil) for the year, recognised in cost of sales.   
 
During  2016  stores  and  consumables  held  at  KM  were  reduced  by  US$2.4M  (2015:  US$Nil)  due  to 
obsolescence.  This resulted in an obsolescence expense recognised in other expenses.   
 
Recognition and measurement 
 
Consumable  stores  inventory  are  valued  at  the  lower  of  cost  and  net  realisable  value  using  the 
weighted average cost method, after appropriate allowances for redundant and slow moving items.  
 
Finished goods and work in progress inventory are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value 
using  the  weighted  average  cost  method.   Cost  is  derived  on  an  absorption  costing  basis,  including 
both  fixed  and  variable  production costs  and  attributable  overheads  incurred  up  to the  delivery  point 
where legal title to the product passes.  No accounting value is attributed to stockpiles containing ore 
at less than the cut-off grade.

and production overheads. 
 
Significant Estimates and Assumptions 
 
Net Realisable Value of Inventories 
 
The Group reviews the carrying value of inventories regularly to ensure that their cost does not exceed 
net  realisable  value.    In  determining  net  realisable  value  various  factors  are  taken  into  account, 
including sales prices and costs to complete inventories to their final form.

paid ordinary shares.  The holding of these fully paid ordinary shares represents a 16.5% interest at 30 
June 2016 (2015: 16.7%)  of the ordinary shares of DYL, a uranium explorer listed on  the ASX.  The 
market value of the shares in DYL at 30 June 2016 is A$1.3M (US$0.9M) (2015: A$3.2M / US$2.4M) 
based on a share price of 0.4 Australian cents per share (2015: 1.0 Australian cents).  
 
At 30 June 2015 the Group held minor investments in other companies. 
 
Recognition and measurement 
 
Available-for-sale 
financial  assets,  comprising  principally  marketable  equity  securities,  are 
non-derivatives  that  are  either  designated  in  this  category  or  not  classified  in  any  of  the  other 
categories.    They  are  included  in  non  current  assets  unless  management  intends  to  dispose  of  the 
investment within 12 months of the balance date. 
 
Purchases  and  sales  of  investments  are  recognised  on  trade-date  which  is  the  date  on  which  the 
Group  commits  to  purchase  or  sell  the  asset.    Investments  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  plus 
transaction costs.  Financial assets are de-recognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the 
financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership.

Recognition and measurement (continued) 
 
Available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value.  Unrealised gains and losses 
which  arise from changes  in the  fair  value of  non  monetary  securities  classified  as  available-for-sale 
are  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income.   When  securities  classified  as  available-for-sale  are 
sold  or  impaired,  the  accumulated  fair  value  adjustments  are  included  in  the  Income  Statement  as 
gains and losses from investment securities. 
 
Fair value of Financial Instruments 
 
The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices.   
 
Impairment of Financial Instruments 
 
The Group assesses at each balance date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or 
group of financial assets is impaired.  In the case of equity securities classified as available-for-sale, a 
significant  or  prolonged  decline  in  the  fair  value  of  a  security  below  its  cost  is  considered  in 
determining  whether  the  security  is  impaired.    If  any  such  evidence  exists  for  available-for-sale 
financial assets, the cumulative loss which is measured as the difference between the acquisition cost 
and  the  current  fair  value,  less  any  impairment  loss  on  that  financial  asset  previously  recognised  in 
profit  and  loss  is  removed  from  equity  and  recognised  in  the  Income  Statement.    Any  subsequent 
increase in value is recognised in equity.

NOTE 20.  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (continued) 
 
Recognition and measurement 
 
All  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  stated  at  historical  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and 
impairment losses.  Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of 
the items.   
 
Subsequent costs are included in the  asset's carrying  amount or recognised  as a separate asset, as 
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to 
the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.  All other repairs and maintenance are 
charged to the Income Statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. 
 
Property, plant and equipment costs include both the costs associated with construction of equipment 
associated  with  establishment  of  an  operating  mine,  and  the  estimated  costs  of  dismantling  and 
removing the asset and restoring the site on which it is located. 
 
Land is not depreciated.  Depreciation on other assets is calculated using either the unit of production 
basis or the straight line method to allocate  their cost amount, net of their residual  values, over their 
estimated useful lives, as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An  asset's  carrying  amount  is  written  down  immediately  to  its  recoverable  amount  if  the  asset's 
carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. 
 
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts.  These 
are included in the Income Statement. 
 
Assets  that  have  an  indefinite  useful  life  are  not  subject  to  amortisation  and  are  tested  annually  for 
impairment.  Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  An impairment 
loss  is  recognised  for  the  amount  by  which  the  asset's  carrying  amount  exceeds  its  recoverable 
amount.  The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in 
use.  In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value 
using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset.  For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the 
lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). 
 
Significant Estimates and Assumptions 
 
Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment; Mine Development and Intangibles 
 
Property, plant and equipment; mine development and intangibles are tested for impairment whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.   
 
The  Group  conducts  an  internal  review  of  asset  values  at  each  reporting  date,  which  is  used  as  a 
source of information to assess for any indicators of impairment. Factors, such as changes in uranium 
prices,  production  performance  and  mining  and  processing  costs  are  monitored  to  assess  for 
indicators of impairment. If any indication of impairment exists, an estimate of the asset’s recoverable 
amount is calculated.  
 
An  impairment  loss  is  recognised  for  the  amount  by  which  the  asset’s  carrying  amount  exceeds  its 
recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and 
value  in  use. For  the purposes  of  assessing  impairment,  assets  are  grouped  at  the  lowest  levels  for 
which  there  are  separately  identifiable  cash  inflows  that  are  largely  independent  of  the  cash  inflows 
from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units).

NOTE 20.     PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (continued) 
 
Significant Estimates and Assumptions (continued) 
 
The  future  recoverability  of  the  property,  plant  and  equipment,  mine  development  and  intangibles  is 
dependent on a number of key factors including: uranium price, discount rates used in determining the 
estimated discounted cash flows, foreign exchanges rates, tax rates, the level of proved and probable 
reserves and measured, indicated and inferred mineral resources, future technological changes which 
could  impact  the  cost  of  production  and  future  legal  changes,  including  changes  to  environmental 
restoration obligations. 
 
The  recoverable  value  of  the  LHM  property,  plant  and  equipment  has  been  determined  based  on 
value in use (VIU). VIU calculation use pre-tax free cash flows based on financial  projections for the 
approved life of mine plan (LOM). The key operating assumptions and their basis of estimation are:

 



Future  production  based  on  the  latest  LOM  and  using  a  recovery  factor  of  87.8%  per 
management’s best estimates. 
Commodity price forecast ranging from US$26/lb to US$68/lb per TradeTech forecast pricing. 
Exchange  rate  forecast  of  USD/NAD  ranging  from  14.00  to  16.00  derived  from  external 
currency forecasters. 
Future  cost  of  production  ranging  from  US$18.00/lb  to  US$28.63/lb  based  on  the  current 
budget and management’s best estimates. 
Discount rate applied to cash flow projections of 8.5%.
These estimates and assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty. Therefore there is a possibility 
that  a  change  in  circumstances  will  impact  these  projections,  which  may  impact  the  recoverable 
amount.

Mine development 
 
Pre-production  costs  are  deferred  as  development  costs  until  such  time  as  the  asset  is  capable  of 
being operated in a manner intended by management and depreciated on a units of production basis.  
Post-production costs are recognised as a cost of production. 
 
Stripping (waste removal) costs 
 
As  part  of  its  mining  operations,  the  Group  incurs  stripping  (waste  removal)  costs  both  during  the 
development  phase  and  production  phase  of  its  operations.  Stripping  costs  incurred  in  the 
development phase of a mine, before the production phase commences (development stripping), are 
capitalised as part of the cost of constructing the mine and subsequently amortised over its useful life 
using  a  units-of-production  method.    The  capitalisation  of  development  stripping  costs  ceases  when 
the mine/component is commissioned and ready for use as intended by management.  
 
Stripping activities undertaken during the production phase of a surface mine (production stripping) are 
accounted  for  as  set  out  below.  After  the  commencement  of  production,  further  development  of  the 
mine  may  require  a  phase  of  stripping  that  is  similar  in  nature  to  development  phase  stripping.  The 
costs  of  such  stripping  are  accounted  for  in  the  same  way  as  development  stripping  (as  outlined 
above).

NOTE 21.  MINE DEVELOPMENT (continued) 
 
Recognition and measurement (continued) 
 
Stripping (waste removal) costs (continued) 
 
Stripping costs incurred during the production phase are generally considered to create two benefits, 
being  either  the  production  of  inventory  or  improved  access  to  the  ore  to  be  mined  in  the  future.  
Where  the  benefits  are  realised  in  the  form  of  inventory  produced  in  the  period,  the  production 
stripping costs are accounted for as part of the cost of producing those inventories. Where the benefits 
are realised in the form of improved access to ore to be mined in the future, the costs are recognised 
as a non-current asset, referred to as a stripping activity asset, if the following criteria are met: 
 
a) Future economic benefits (being improved access to the ore body) are probable; 
b) The component of the ore body for which access will be improved can be accurately identified; and 
c) The costs associated with the improved access can be reliably measured. 
 
If all of the criteria are not met, the production stripping costs are charged to the statement of profit or 
loss as operating costs as they are incurred. 
 
In  identifying  components  of  the  ore  body,  the  Group  works  closely  with  the  mining  operations 
personnel  for  each mining  operation to analyse each  of  the  mine  plans.  Generally,  a component  will 
be  a  subset  of  the  total  ore  body,  and  a  mine  may  have  several  components.  The  mine  plans,  and 
therefore  the  identification  of  components,  can  vary  between  mines  for  a  number  of  reasons.  These 
include, but are not limited to: the geological characteristics of the ore body, the geographical location, 
and/or financial considerations.  
 
The  stripping  activity  asset  is  initially  measured  at  cost,  which  is  the  accumulation  of  costs  directly 
incurred to perform the stripping activity that improves access to the identified component of ore, plus 
an allocation of directly attributable overhead costs. If incidental operations are occurring at the same 
time as  the  production  stripping  activity,  but  are  not  necessary  for  the  production  stripping activity  to 
continue as planned, these costs are not included in the cost of the stripping activity asset. 
 
If the costs of the inventory produced and the stripping activity asset are not separately identifiable, a 
relevant  production measure is used to allocate the  production stripping costs between the  inventory 
produced  and  the  stripping  activity  asset.  This  production  measure  is  calculated  for  the  identified 
component of the ore body and is used as a benchmark to identify the extent to which the additional 
activity  of  creating a future  benefit  has  taken  place.    The  Group uses  the  expected  volume of  waste 
extracted compared with the actual volume for a given volume of ore production of each component. 
 
The stripping activity asset is accounted for as an addition to, or an enhancement of, an existing asset, 
being  the  mine  asset,  and  is  presented  as  part  of  ’Mine  Development’  in  the  statement  of  financial 
position.  
 
The stripping activity asset is subsequently depreciated using the units-of-production method over the 
life  of  the  identified  component  of  the  ore  body  that  became  more  accessible  as  a  result  of  the 
stripping  activity.  Economically  recoverable reserves,  which comprise proven  and probable reserves, 
are  used  to  determine  the  expected  useful  life  of  the  identified  component  of  the  ore  body.  The 
stripping activity asset is then carried at cost less depreciation and any impairment losses. 
 
Significant Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions 
 
The Group has assessed that the useful lives of the individual identifiable components of the relative 
ore  bodies  are  short  and  that  the  strip  ratio  over  the  life  of  component  is  relatively  uniform. 
Accordingly, the Group has accounted for production stripping costs as a production cost in the years 
ended 30 June 2015 and 2016.

The  Group  uses  the  concept  of  a  life  of  mine  as  an  accounting  value  to  determine  such  things  as 
depreciation rates and the appropriate period to discount mine closure provisions.  In determining life 
of mine, the proved and probable reserves measured in accordance with the 2004 edition of the JORC 
Code  specific  to  a  mine  are  taken  into  account  which  by  their  very  nature  require  judgements,

45  million  Paladin  Energy  Ltd  shares.  Due  to  the  nature  of  the  asset  as  an  early  stage  exploration  project,  the  fair  value  of  the  asset  was  not  able  to  be 
measured reliably and therefore the 45 million shares issued were valued at the date of completion, being AU$0.18c per share based on the market price at 
that date. US$0.6M acquisition costs were capitalised to the exploration and evaluation asset.

rights to tenure of the area of interest are current; and
costs are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploitation of the area 
of interest or alternatively by its sale.
NOTE 22.  EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION EXPENDITURE (continued) 
 
Recognition and measurement 
 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure related to areas of interest is capitalised and carried forward to 
the extent that: 
 
1. 
 
2. 
 
 
Exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  is  allocated  separately  to  specific  areas  of  interest.    Such 
expenditure  comprises  net  direct  costs  and  an  appropriate  portion  of  related  overhead  expenditure 
directly related to activities in the area of interest. 
 
Costs related to the acquisition of properties that contain Mineral Resources are allocated separately 
to specific areas of interest.   
 
If costs are not expected to be recouped through successful development and exploitation of the area 
of interest, or alternatively by sale, costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. 
 
Exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  that  is  capitalised  is  included  as  part  of  cash  flows  from 
investing  activities,  whereas  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  that  is  expensed  is  included  as 
part of cash flows from operating activities.   
 
When a decision to proceed to development is made, the exploration and evaluation capitalised to that 
area is  transferred  to mine  development.   All  costs  subsequently  incurred to develop  a mine  prior  to 
the  start  of  mining  operations  within  the  area  of  interest  are  capitalised  and  carried  at  cost.    These 
costs  include  expenditure  incurred  to  develop  new  ore  bodies  within  the  area  of  interest,  to  define 
further  mineralisation  in  existing  areas  of  interest,  to  expand  the  capacity  of  a  mine  and  to  maintain 
production. 
 
Capitalised  amounts  for  an  area  of  interest  may  be  written  down  to  their  recoverable  amount  if  the 
area of interest’s carrying amount is greater than their estimated recoverable amount. 
 
Significant Estimates and Assumptions 
 
Carrying Value of Exploration and Evaluation Expenditure 
 
The  Group  reviews  the  carrying  value  of  exploration  and  evaluation  expenditure  at  each  reporting 
date.    This  requires  judgement  as  to  the  status  of  the  individual  projects  and  their  future  economic 
value.

Description of the Group’s Intangible Assets
1.
Right to supply of power
LHUPL  has  entered  into  a  contract  with  NamPower  in  Namibia  for  the  right  to  access  power  at  LHM.    In 
order to obtain this right, the power line connection to the mine was funded by LHM.  However, ownership of 
the power line rests with NamPower.  The amount funded is being amortised on a unit of production basis.  
 
2.
Right to supply of water
LHUPL has entered into a contract with NamWater in Namibia for the right to access water at LHM.  In order 
to obtain this right, the water pipeline connection to the mine was funded by  LHM.  However, ownership of 
the pipeline rests with NamWater.  The amount funded is being amortised on a unit of production basis.  
 
Recognition and measurement 
 
Intangible assets acquired separately or in a business combination are initially measured at cost.  The cost of 
an  intangible  asset  acquired  in  a  business  combination  is  its  fair  value  as  at  the  date  of  acquisition.  
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated  impairment  losses.    Internally  generated  intangible  assets,  excluding  capitalised  development 
costs,  are  not  capitalised  and  expenditure  is  recognised  in  the  Income  Statement  in  the  year  in  which  the 
expenditure is incurred.

NOTE 23.    INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued) 
 
Recognition and measurement (continued) 
 
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite.  Intangible assets with finite 
lives  are  amortised  over  the  useful  life  and  tested  for  impairment  whenever  there  is  an  indication  that  the 
intangible  asset  may  be  impaired.    The  amortisation  period  and  the  amortisation  method  for  an  intangible 
asset  with  a  finite  useful  life  are  reviewed  at  least  at  each  financial  year-end.    Changes  in  the  expected 
useful  life  or  the  expected  pattern  of  consumption  of  future  economic  benefits  embodied  in  the  asset  are 
accounted  for  prospectively  by  changing  the  amortisation  period  or  method,  as  appropriate,  which  is  a 
change  in  accounting  estimate.    The  amortisation  expense  on  the  intangible  assets  with  finite  lives  is 
recognised in profit or loss in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset. 
 
A summary of the policies applied to the Group’s intangible assets is as follows: 
 
Right to use water and power supply 
 
Useful lives   
 
Amortisation method used 
 
Impairment testing
Amortised over the life of the mine on a unit of production basis
Annually and more frequently when an indication of impairment exists.  The 
amortisation method is reviewed at each financial year-end.
Life of mine
The rights to use water and power supply have been granted for a minimum of 17 years from April 2007 by 
the relevant utilities with the option of renewal without significant cost at the end of this period.

Nature and Timing of Provisions 
 
Rehabilitation 
 
A provision for rehabilitation and mine closure has been recorded in relation to LHM and KM.  A provision is 
made  for  rehabilitation  work  when  the  obligation  arises  and  this  is  recognised  as  a  cost  of  production  or 
development  as  appropriate.  Additionally  the  provision  includes  the  costs  of  dismantling  and  demolition  of 
infrastructure  or  decommissioning,  the removal  of  residual  material  and  the remediation  of  disturbed  areas 
specific to the infrastructure to a state acceptable to various authorities.  The provision is estimated using the 
assumption that remediation will not take place until 3 to 19 years’ time. 
 
Demobilisation 
 
A provision for demobilisation has been recorded in relation to LHM for the costs of demobilising the mining 
contractor.

Recognition and measurement 
 
Provisions  
 
Mine  closure  and  restoration  costs  include  the  costs  of  dismantling  and  demolition  of  infrastructure  or 
decommissioning,  the  removal  of  residual  material  and  the  remediation  of  disturbed  areas  specific  to  the 
infrastructure.  Mine closure costs are provided for in the accounting period when the obligation arising from 
the  related  disturbance  occurs,  whether  this  occurs  during  the  mine  development  or  during  the  production 
phase, based on the net present value of estimated future costs. 
 
As  the  value  of  the  provision  for  mine  closure  represents  the  discounted  value  of  the  present  obligation  to 
restore, dismantle and close the mine, the increase in this provision due to the passage of time is recognised 
as a finance cost.  The discount rate used is a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessment of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. 
 
Provision  is  made  for  rehabilitation  work  when  the  obligation  arises  and  this  is  recognised  as  a  cost  of 
production or development.  The rehabilitation costs provided for are the present value of the estimated costs 
to  restore  operating  locations.    The  value  of  the  provision  represents  the  discounted  value  of  the  current 
estimate  to  restore  and  the  discount  rate  used  is  the  pre-tax  rate  that  reflects  the  current  market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. 
 
Employee benefits
Short-term benefits
Liabilities for short-term benefits, including wages and salaries, and accumulating sick leave expected to be 
settled within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised  as a current  liability  in respect of employees' 
services up to the reporting date and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities 
are settled.  Liabilities for non-accumulating sick leave are recognised when the leave is taken and measured 
at the rates paid or payable. 
 
Long Service Leave
The liability for long service leave is recognised in the provision for employee benefits and measured as the 
present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to 
the  reporting  date.    Consideration  is  given  to  expected  future  wage  and  salary  levels,  experience  of 
employee departures and periods of service.  Expected future payments are discounted using market yields 
at  the  reporting  date  on  corporate  bonds  with  terms  to  maturity  and  currency  that  match,  as  closely  as 
possible, the estimated future cash outflows. 
 
Significant Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions 
 
Rehabilitation Provision
The value of this provision represents the discounted value of the present obligation to rehabilitate the mine 
and to restore, dismantle and close the mine.  The discounted value reflects a combination of management’s 
assessment of the cost of performing the work required, the timing of the cash flows and the discount rate.  A 
change  in  any,  or  a  combination,  of  the  three  key  assumptions  (estimated  cash  flows,  discount  rates  or 
inflation  rates),  used  to  determine  the  provision  could  have  a  material  impact  to  the  carrying  value  of  the 
provision.

Recognition and measurement 
 
In  2012,  Paladin  entered  into  a  six-year  off-take  agreement  with  EdF,  a  major  electricity  generator  and 
distribution company in France, to deliver a total of 13.73Mlb U3O8 in the period from 2019 to 2024.  Uranium 
sold to EdF  under the contract will be  at prevailing spot prices at the time of delivery, subject to escalating 
floor and ceiling prices, with the floor price being at a significant premium to both current spot and long term 
reference prices.  The  off-take is  an  obligation  of  the  Company  and  it  is  intended to  be  fulfilled  through  the 
acquisition of U3O8 from the Company’s operating assets and joint ventures at the time of delivery. 
 
Under  this  agreement,  a  US$200M  cash  prepayment  was  received  in  2012.    The  prepayment  related 
to 44.51% of the total volume to be delivered under the contract, at the present value of the contracted floor 
price, determined using an imputed interest rate of 7.619%. 
 
The Group’s accounting policy is to recognise revenue from the long-term off-take agreement as a payment 
for future product to be delivered. Advance customer payments are unearned revenues at the time of receipt. 
 
Under  the  Group’s  accounting  policy,  the  unearned  revenue  is  not  accreted  to  the  future  value  of  the 
contracted  floor  price that  has  been prepaid. When the  product  is  delivered to  the  customer,  the  unearned 
revenue will be released to the income statement at its original carrying value. 
 
The  Company  has  granted  EdF  security  over  60.1%  of  the  Michelin  project  in  Canada.   Under  certain 
circumstances, the company may elect, or be required to replace the Michelin security with other appropriate 
security.

NOTE 28.  AUDITORS’ REMUNERATION 
 
The auditor of the Paladin Energy Ltd Group is Ernst & Young.
Amounts received or due and receivable by  
Ernst & Young (Australia) for:
  Audit or review of the financial report of the
consolidated Group
  Other services 
  Taxation services:
Tax compliance services 
International tax consulting 
Other tax advice 
 
Sub-total
Amounts received or due and receivable by related 
practices of Ernst & Young (Australia) for:
  Audit or review of the financial report of 
subsidiaries and audit related services
  Taxation services:
Tax compliance services 
International tax consulting 
Other tax advice 
 
Sub-total
The  level  of  non-audit  related  fees  was  driven  by  the  tax  compliance  requirements  of  multiple  jurisdictions 
and by the specialist advice requirements of potential acquisitions and group restructures.  
 
Whilst always striving to meet the highest corporate governance standards, Paladin is also cognisant of the 
need to retain the value of the best available specialist advice. Paladin engaged Ernst & Young because of 
their specialised experience in both Africa and the mining sector and Ernst & Young’s detailed understanding 
of the Paladin Group.

NOTE 28.  AUDITORS’ REMUNERATION (continued) 
 
In terms of the Company’s Corporate Governance Policy all non-audit services are reviewed and approved 
by the Audit Committee prior to commencement to ensure that they do not adversely affect the integrity and 
objectivity  of  the  auditor  and  that  the  nature  of  the  services  provided  does  not  compromise  the  Code  of 
Ethics for Professional Accountants APES 110 issued by the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards 
Board. 
 
All  non-audit  services  provided  by  Ernst  &  Young  were  allowable  services  that  received  the  sign  off  of  the 
audit partner confirming that, in his professional opinion, they do not in any way impair the independence of 
the firm. Where any service might be perceived to be subjective, Ernst & Young policy requires approval by 
the Oceania Independence and Conflicts Leader.

In relation  to the Manyingee Uranium  Project, the  re-negotiated  acquisition  terms  provide  for  a  payment  of 
A$0.75M  (US$0.56M)  (2015:  A$0.75M  (US$0.57M))  by  the  Group  to  the  vendors  when  all  project 
development approvals are obtained. 
 
Bank Guarantees 
 
As at 30 June 2016 the Group has outstanding US$450,713 (A$607,651) (2015: US$465,180 / A$607,651) 
as a current guarantee provided by a bank for the corporate office lease; a US$132,055 (A$172,500) (2015: 
US$143,538  /  A$187,500)  guarantee  for  tenements;  a  US$95,408  (A$128,630)  (2015:  US$98,471  / 
A$128,630)  guarantee  for  corporate  credit  cards,  and  a  US$10M  (2015:  US$10M)  KM  environmental 
performance guarantee. 
 
Contingent Liability 
 
A  dispute  arose  between  a  Group  company  and  a  contractor  in  relation  to  the  contract  for  the  Stage  3 
expansion  at  LHM.    The  contractor  was  seeking  payment  of  a  disputed  sum  of  N$151.1M  (30  June  2015:  
N$151.1M), which is approximately US$10.0M (30 June 2015: US$12.0M).  The Group denied the claim and 
vigorously  defended  it.    The  Group  also  counter  claimed  damages  from  the  contractor  and  cross-claimed 
from another contractor.  The precise quantum of the counter-claim and cross claim was never established, 
however the merits of the Company’s defences against the claims were considered to be good, and  it  was 
expected  that  in the final  result  the  Company’s  quantum  was  likely  to exceed any  residual  entitlement  that 
may have been due on the contractors’ claims. 
 
LHM  and  the  contractor  have  agreed  to  settle  all  litigation  associated  with  this  matter,  i.e.  all  claims  and 
counter claims.  The parties have signed the settlement documentation on the 19 July 2016 which resulted in 
no payment being made by either party.

Summaries of Share Appreciation Rights (SARs) Granted Under the Plans 
 
SARs are entitlements to receive a number of shares subject to remaining employed at the relevant vesting 
date.  At  the  relevant  vesting  date,  the  SARs  will  vest  and  the  holder  will  be  able  to  exercise  them  at  the 
exercise price during the exercise period. The exercise of SARs will occur on a cashless basis, i.e. the holder 
will not have to make an actual payment of the exercise price, but it will be taken into account in calculating 
the  number  of  shares  allocated  upon  exercise.  SARs  do  not  carry  a  right  to  vote  or  to  dividends  or,  in 
general, a right to participate in other corporate actions such as bonus issues.  
 
For  each  SAR  that  is  validly  exercised,  the  holder  will  be  allocated  shares  based  on  the  formula  below 
(rounded up to the nearest whole share).  The number of shares a holder will receive will be calculated using 
the following formulas:  
 
Shares to receive = SARs being exercised x (A-B)/A  
 
Where:  
A = volume weighted average price (VWAP) of a share for the five trading days before the date of exercise  
B = exercise price (e.g. A$0.20)  
 
Note: If A – B is less than or equal to zero at the time of exercise, the relevant SARs being exercised will not 
be exercised but will, instead, immediately lapse.

Recognition and measurement 
 
Share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees via the Employee Performance Share Rights 
Plan and the Contractor Performance Share Rights Plan (Rights Plans). 
 
The fair value of rights granted under the Rights Plans is recognised as an employee benefit expense with a 
corresponding increase in equity.  The fair value is measured at grant date and recognised over the period 
during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the rights.

Tax Consolidation 
 
Paladin  and  its  100%  owned  Australian  resident  subsidiaries  formed  a  tax  consolidated  group  (the  Group) 
with effect from 1 July 2003.  Paladin is the head entity of the Group.  Members of the Group have entered 
into  a  tax-sharing  agreement  that  provides  that  the  head  entity  will  be  liable  for  all  taxes  payable  by  the 
Group from the consolidation date.  The parties have agreed to apportion the head entity’s taxation liability 
within the Group based on each contributing member’s share of the Group’s taxable income and losses.

NOTE 33.  EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE DATE 
 
Other  than  disclosed  below,  since  the  end  of  the  financial  year,  the  Directors  are  not  aware  of  any  other 
matter or circumstance not otherwise dealt with in this report, that has significantly or may significantly affect 
the operations of the Group, the results of those operations or the state of affairs of the Group in subsequent 
years with the exception of the following, the financial effects of which have not been provided for in the 30 
June 2016 Financial Report: 
 
Strategic Process Achieves Agreements to Raise Over US$200M 
 
On 21 July 2016 and 29 July 2016, the Company announced the outcome of its strategic initiatives process 
with respect to partnerships, strategic  investment, funding and corporate transactions,  with the result  being 
two planned transactions to raise in excess of US$200M. One pertains to a proposed sale of 24% of Langer 
Heinrich Mine (LHM) and one pertains to a potential sale of up to 75% of Manyingee as set out below. 
 
Sale of 24% of LHM 
 
Paladin  currently  owns  75%  of  LHM  and  has  signed  a  non-binding  terms  sheet  with  CNNC  Overseas 
Uranium  Holdings  Ltd  (COUH)  (the  existing  25%  minority  shareholder  in  LHM),  to  sell  it  a  24%  interest  in 
LHM. If it proceeds on its current terms, the sale is expected to raise US$175M cash for the Company and 
be accompanied by long-term arrangements for uranium off-take.  The proposed transaction is subject to the 
parties  negotiating  and  executing  definitive  documentation,  including:  sale  and  purchase  agreement; 
shareholders agreement; and documentation for the uranium off-take arrangements.  We have been advised 
by  COUH  that  any  definitive  agreement  would  also  require  the  approval  of  the  board  of  COUH’s  ultimate 
parent company and third-party government and regulatory approvals.  Such approvals would include China 
regulatory  approvals  customary  for  an  international  transaction  of  the  proposed  size.    Paladin  is  working 
towards  a formal close of the transaction in fourth quarter of 2016 calendar  year.  Other  than as set out in 
this announcement, the other key terms of this proposed transaction remain confidential.  
 
On completion of the transaction, Paladin will continue to hold 51% of LHM and be the operator. 
 
Sale of 75% of Manyingee  
 
Paladin  currently  owns  100%  of  Manyingee  and  has  signed  a  binding  terms  sheet  with  MGT  Resources 
Limited (MGT) for it to make a two-stage acquisition of 75% of Manyingee (excluding Carley Bore).  
 
On closing of the transaction, MGT will acquire a 30% initial interest in Manyingee for US$10M cash and will 
form a joint-venture over the project with Paladin (Manyingee JV).  MGT will then have an option to acquire 
an  additional  45%  of  Manyingee  JV  from  Paladin  for  US$20M  cash,  exercisable  for  12-months  following 
Manyingee JV’s preparation of a plan to conduct a field leach trial for uranium extraction by in-situ recovery 
method. 
 
Under the terms of the agreement, MGT will issue Paladin options to subscribe for new shares equivalent to 
5%  of  MGT’s  shares  outstanding  for  a  period  of  12-months  from  closing  of  the  transaction  at  A$0.06  per 
share; and options to subscribe for new shares equivalent to 5% of MGT’s shares outstanding for a period of 
24-months from closing of the transaction at A$0.08 per share. 
 
Paladin will issue MGT options to subscribe for new shares equivalent to 2% of Paladin’s shares outstanding 
for a period of 12-months from closing  of the transaction  at A$0.35  per share; and options to subscribe for 
new shares equivalent to 2% of Paladin’s shares outstanding for a period of 24-months from closing of the 
transaction at A$0.45 per share. 
 
The  transaction  is  conditional  on  definitive  documentation  and  a  vote  of  MGT’s  shareholders.  MGT’s 
directors have irrevocably agreed to vote in favour.

NOTE 34.  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS 
 
Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective 
 
The  following Australian  Accounting Standards  that  have recently  been  issued or  amended but are  not  yet 
effective are relevant to the Group but have not been applied by the Group for the annual reporting period 
ending 30 June 2016:

Summary
AASB 9
Financial Instruments  AASB 9 (December 2014) is a new standard which replaces 
AASB 139. This new version supersedes AASB 9 issued in 
December 2009 (as amended) and AASB 9 (issued in 
December 2010) and includes a model for classification and 
measurement, a single, forward-looking ‘expected loss’ 
impairment model and a substantially-reformed approach to 
hedge accounting.
Application 
date of 
standard*
Application 
date for 
Group*
1 January 2018
1 July 2018
AASB 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2018. However, the Standard is available for early 
adoption. The own credit changes can be early adopted in 
isolation without otherwise changing the accounting for financial 
instruments.
Classification and measurement
AASB 9 includes requirements for a simpler approach for 
classification and measurement of financial assets compared 
with the requirements of AASB 139. There are also some 
changes made in relation to financial liabilities.
The main changes are described below.
Financial assets
a.  Financial assets that are debt instruments will be
classified based on (1) the objective of the entity's 
business model for managing the financial assets; (2) 
the characteristics of the contractual cash flows.
b.  Allows an irrevocable election on initial recognition to
present gains and losses on investments in equity 
instruments that are not held for trading in other 
comprehensive income. Dividends in respect of these 
investments that are a return on investment can be 
recognised in profit or loss and there is no impairment 
or recycling on disposal of the instrument.
c.  Financial assets can be designated and measured at 
fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition if 
doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a 
measurement or recognition inconsistency that would 
arise from measuring assets or liabilities, or 
recognising the gains and losses on them, on different 
bases.
Financial liabilities
Changes introduced by AASB 9 in respect of financial liabilities 
are limited to the measurement of liabilities designated at fair 
value through profit or loss (FVPL) using the fair value option.  
Where the fair value option is used for financial liabilities, the 
change in fair value is to be accounted for as follows:
  The change attributable to changes in credit risk are
presented in other comprehensive income (OCI)
  The remaining change is presented in profit or loss
AASB 9 also removes the volatility in profit or loss that was 
caused by changes in the credit risk of liabilities elected to be 
measured at fair value. This change in accounting means that 
gains or losses attributable to changes in the entity’s own credit 
risk would be recognised in OCI. These amounts recognised in 
OCI are not recycled to profit or loss if the liability is ever

repurchased at a discount.
Impairment
The final version of AASB 9 introduces a new expected-loss 
impairment model that will require more timely recognition of 
expected credit losses. Specifically, the new Standard requires 
entities to account for expected credit losses from when 
financial instruments are first recognised and to recognise full 
lifetime expected losses on a more timely basis.
Hedge accounting
Amendments to AASB 9 (December 2009 & 2010 editions and 
AASB 2013-9) issued in December 2013 included the new 
hedge accounting requirements, including changes to hedge 
effectiveness testing, treatment of hedging costs, risk 
components that can be hedged and disclosures.
Consequential amendments were also made to other standards 
as a result of AASB 9, introduced by AASB 2009-11 and 
superseded by AASB 2010-7, AASB 2010-10 and AASB 2014-1 
– Part E.
AASB 2014-7 incorporates the consequential amendments 
arising from the issuance of AASB 9 in Dec 2014.
AASB 2014-8 limits the application of the existing versions of 
AASB 9 (AASB 9 (December 2009) and AASB 9 (December 
2010)) from 1 February 2015 and applies to annual reporting 
periods beginning on after 1 January 2015.
AASB 2014-3 amends AASB 11 Joint Arrangements to provide 
guidance on the accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint 
operations in which the activity constitutes a business. The 
amendments require:
(a)
the acquirer of an interest in a joint operation in which 
the activity constitutes a business, as defined in AASB 
3 Business Combinations, to apply all of the principles 
on business combinations accounting in AASB 3 and 
other Australian Accounting Standards except for 
those principles that conflict with the guidance in 
AASB 11; and
(b)
the acquirer to disclose the information required by 
AASB 3 and other Australian Accounting Standards 
for business combinations.

Summary
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers replaces 
the existing revenue recognition standards AASB 111 
Construction Contracts, AASB 118 Revenue and related 
Interpretations (Interpretation 13 Customer Loyalty 
Programmes, Interpretation 15 Agreements for the 
Construction of Real Estate, Interpretation 18 Transfers of 
Assets from Customers,  Interpretation  131 Revenue—Barter 
Transactions Involving Advertising Services and 
Interpretation 1042 Subscriber Acquisition Costs in the 
Telecommunications Industry). AASB 15 incorporates the 
requirements of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB) and developed jointly with the US Financial 
Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
AASB 15 specifies the accounting treatment for revenue 
arising from contracts with customers (except for contracts 
within the scope of other accounting standards such as leases 
or financial instruments).The core principle of AASB 15 is that 
an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised 
goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the 
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in 
exchange for those goods or services. An entity recognises 
revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the 
following steps:
(a)   Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer 
(b)  Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the
contract
(c)   Step 3: Determine the transaction price 
(d)  Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance
obligations in the contract
(e)  Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity
satisfies a performance obligation
AASB 2015-8 amended the AASB 15 effective date so it is 
now effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or 
after 1 January 2018. Early application is permitted.
AASB 2014-5 incorporates the consequential amendments to 
a number Australian Accounting Standards (including 
Interpretations) arising from the issuance of AASB 15.
This Standard lists the application paragraphs for each other 
Standard (and Interpretation), grouped where they are the 
same. Accordingly, paragraphs 5 and 22 respectively specify 
the application paragraphs for Standards and Interpretations in 
general. Differing application paragraphs are set out for 
individual Standards and Interpretations or grouped where 
possible.  
The application paragraphs do not affect requirements in other 
Standards that specify that certain paragraphs apply only to 
certain types of entities.

AASB 2014-10 amends AASB 10 Consolidated Financial 
Statements and AASB 128 to address an inconsistency 
between the requirements in AASB 10 and those in AASB 128 
(August 2011), in dealing with the sale or contribution of assets 
between an investor and its associate or joint venture. The 
amendments require:
(a)
(b)
a full gain or loss to be recognised when a transaction 
involves a business (whether it is housed in a subsidiary or 
not)
a partial gain or loss to be recognised when a 
transaction involves assets that do not constitute a 
business, even if these assets are housed in a subsidiary.
AASB 2014-10 also makes an editorial correction to AASB 10.
AASB 2015-10 defers the mandatory effective date (application 
date) of AASB 2014-10 so that the amendments are required to 
be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2018 instead of 1 January 2016.
The Standard makes amendments to AASB 101 Presentation of 
Financial Statements arising from the IASB’s Disclosure 
Initiative project. The amendments are designed to further 
encourage companies to apply professional judgment in 
determining what information to disclose in the financial 
statements.  For example, the amendments make clear that 
materiality applies to the whole of financial statements and that 
the inclusion of immaterial information can inhibit the usefulness 
of financial disclosures.  The amendments also clarify that 
companies should use professional judgment in determining 
where and in what order information is presented in the financial 
disclosures.
This Standard inserts scope paragraphs into AASB 8 and AASB 
133 in place of application paragraph text in AASB 1057. This is 
to correct inadvertent removal of these paragraphs during 
editorial changes made in August 2015. There is no change to 
the requirements or the applicability of AASB 8 and AASB 133.

Leases
The key features of AASB 16 are as follows:
1 January 2019
1 July 2019
Lessee accounting
•  Lessees are required to recognise assets and
liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 
months, unless the underlying asset is of low value.
•  A lessee measures right-of-use assets similarly to
other non-financial assets and lease liabilities 
similarly to other financial liabilities.
•  Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially
measured on a present value basis. The 
measurement includes non-cancellable lease 
payments (including inflation-linked payments), and 
also includes payments to be made in optional 
periods if the lessee is reasonably certain to 
exercise an option to extend the lease, or not to 
exercise an option to terminate the lease.
•  AASB 16 contains disclosure requirements for
lessees.

Lessor accounting
•  AASB 16 substantially carries forward the lessor
accounting requirements in AASB 117. Accordingly, 
a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating 
leases or finance leases, and to account for those 
two types of leases differently.
•  AASB 16 also requires enhanced disclosures to be
provided by lessors that will improve information 
disclosed about a lessor’s risk exposure, particularly 
to residual value risk.
AASB 16 supersedes:
(a) AASB 117 Leases;
(b)  Interpretation 4 Determining whether an Arrangement 
contains a Lease;
(c) SIC-15 Operating Leases—Incentives; and
(d) SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving 
the Legal Form of a
Lease.
The new standard will be effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early application is 
permitted, provided the new revenue standard, AASB 15 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers, has been applied, or 
is applied at the same date as AASB 16.
This Standard amends AASB 112 Income Taxes (July 2004) 
and AASB 112 Income Taxes (August 2015) to clarify the 
requirements on recognition of deferred tax assets for 
unrealised losses on debt instruments measured at fair value.
This Standard amends AASB 107 Statement of Cash Flows 
(August 2015) to require entities preparing financial statements 
in accordance with Tier 1 reporting requirements to provide 
disclosures that enable users of financial statements to 
evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, 
including both changes arising from cash flows and non-cash 
changes.
This standard amends to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, 
clarifying how to account for certain types of share-based 
payment transactions. The amendments provide requirements 
on the accounting for:
► The effects of vesting and non-vesting conditions on the 
measurement of cash-settled share-based payments.
► Share-based payment transactions with a net settlement 
feature for withholding tax obligations.
► A modification to the terms and conditions of a share-based 
payment that changes the classification of the transaction from 
cash-settled to equity-settled.
