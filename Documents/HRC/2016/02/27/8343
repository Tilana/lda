</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the independent expert on the situation 
of human rights in Somalia, Shamsul Bari</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The unending saga of human rights deprivations in Somalia over the past two 
decades have now been compounded by another humanitarian crisis. The devastating 
drought currently ravaging the Horn of Africa, compounded by conflict and the denial of 
humanitarian assistance, has resulted in a declaration of famine in two regions of South- 
Central Somalia. Already in the course of the independent expert&#8217;s sixth visit to Somalia, in 
February 2011, the drought had taken a heavy toll on livestock and food reserves. The full 
impact of the drought can be seen on the Somali population, a large number of whom have 
been forced to flee their homes in search of food and succour. Deaths caused by 
malnutrition have been documented among new arrivals in refugee camps in Kenya and 
Ethiopia and into Mogadishu. The United Nations has already warned that, unless urgent 
measures are taken to increase the response, the famine will spread to the whole of southern 
Somalia within the next two months. This should not be allowed to happen and become 
another blot on the conscience of mankind.  
</p>
<p> Apart from the drought and famine, the armed conflicts between Islamist insurgents 
and the Transitional Federal Government, supported by the troops of the African Union 
Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), continues to cause deaths and injury to the civilian 
population. Indiscriminate shelling and firing in urban areas, and suicide and improvised 
explosive attacks by the insurgent group Al-Shabaab, are the main causes. 
</p>
<p> Recent offensive has resulted in territorial gains for AMISOM and Transitional 
Federal Government forces. On 6 August 2011, Al-Shabaab announced its withdrawal from 
positions it had held in Mogadishu for nearly two years. Although Al-Shabaab has been 
under military pressure in Mogadishu from the combined operations of AMISOM and 
Transitional Federal Government forces for some time, its sudden withdrawal came as a 
surprise.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 15/28, 
in which the Council, inter alia, renewed the mandate of the independent expert for one 
year and requested him to report to the Council at its eighteenth session. The present report 
covers the period from September 2010 to July 2011. 
</p>
<p>2 The independent expert undertook his sixth and seventh field visits to Somalia and 
neighbouring countries from 15 to 26 February, and from 3 to 8 July 2011, respectively. 
During the first trip, he visited Djibouti to participate in the orientation session of Somali 
delegates involved in the preparation for the universal periodic review for Somalia, due in 
May 2011. He then visited Kenya, from where he made a short visit to Mogadishu (the 
airport only), followed by travel to Somaliland, Puntland and Gulmudug. In July 2011, the 
independent expert visited Mogadishu again, this time travelling outside the airport region 
to visit Government officials at Villa Somalia. He also visited the Dadaab refugee camps in 
Kenya, which houses the largest number of Somali refugees in the world, making it the 
world&#8217;s largest concentration of refugees.  
</p>
<p>3. The most lasting impression left in the mind of the independent expert from these 
two visits was the devastating effects of the drought that has engulfed Somalia and the 
region since late in 2010. While in February the deleterious effects of the drought were 
observed more in its impact on livestock, a large number of which had perished, six months 
later the effects were evident on human beings, large numbers of whom were displaced 
from their homes and forced to seek refuge in other areas in the country or in neighbouring 
countries. At the time of writing, the drought situation had worsened a great deal and has 
become a famine already in two regions of Somalia. The United Nations has warned that 
famine will spread to all eight regions of southern Somalia within two months if decisive 
action is not taken immediately.  
</p>
<p>4.  The independent expert would like to put on record his deep gratitude to all United 
Nations and non-United Nations staff <b>that</b> helped him during his two visits to Somalia. He 
was particularly impressed by their dedication and hard work, in the most difficult 
circumstances, to cater to the needs of the Somali people. They deserve to be warmly 
recognized and commended by the international community. 
</p>
<p>5. The information contained in the present report is based on discussions with people 
the independent expert met during his sixth and seventh trips to Somalia and the immediate 
region. They include the Vice-President of Puntland, the new Prime Minister of Somalia 
and several Government ministers and senior officials in all the places he visited, United 
Nations country team members, important citizens and members of civil society. In 
addition, a large number of reports and other documentation prepared by the United 
Nations and non-United Nations agencies were consulted. Most of the information relating 
to development in the human rights and humanitarian fields, including developments 
relating to the political and security situation, was culled from United Nations reports. An 
effort has been made to provide a comprehensive picture of important developments in 
Somalia in order to properly contextualize the human rights situation for readers.    
</p>
<p><b> II. Drought and famine and the humanitarian situation 
</b></p>
<p>6.  While in 2010 the food security situation in the Horn of Africa saw some 
improvement thanks to two consecutive seasons of good rainfall and above-average crop 
production, the lack of rainfall in late 2010 and in 2011 has led to a rapid and serious 
increase in vulnerability and food insecurity.  </p>


<p>7. Loss of livestock, decreasing pastoralist incomes, poor harvests and high food prices 
in the pastoral and agricultural zones of Somalia have severely affected household access to 
food. In June, the United Nations estimated that almost 3 million people in Somalia faced 
food insecurity, almost one third of the overall population. In July, the United Nations 
estimated that acute malnutrition rates were over 20 per cent in the entire southern Somalia, 
reaching 38 per cent in Bay, Bakol and Gedo regions. 
</p>
<p>8. The devastating effects of the drought have been compounded by the ongoing armed 
conflict and insecurity, extreme underdevelopment, including in terms of infrastructure and 
the denial of humanitarian assistance by Al-Shabaab in the areas it controls. As a result, in 
July 2011, the United Nations declared a famine in Bakol and the Lower Shebelle regions 
of Somalia.  
</p>
<p>9. Drought and conflict-related displacement from southern Somalia and refugee flows 
into Ethiopia and Kenya steadily increased over the reporting period; in an average month 
in 2011, some 15,000 Somalis flee their country and arrive in Kenya and Ethiopia. 
According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 
in June 2011 alone, an estimated 54,000 refugees fled to Kenya and Ethiopia from Somalia, 
which represents three times the number of people who fled in May.   
</p>
<p>10. While conflict has been a fact of life for most Somalis for years, it is the drought that 
has taken them to breaking point. Totally destitute women and children walk for days to 
reach camps in Kenya and Ethiopia. According to UNHCR, more than 80 per cent of those 
fleeing Somalia are women and children. Men and boys are left behind to look after what is 
left of their possessions, or prevented from fleeing by Al-Shabaab when not already 
recruited to fight the jihad. The death toll of displaced Somalis continues to increase as 
many travel in last-minute desperation when food reserves have run dry, leaving them to 
make the journey with no resources. 
</p>
<p>11. In July, Al-Shabaab allowed the operations of actors such as the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in its 
territories, but maintained its ban on such agencies as the United Nations Political Office 
for Somalia (UNPOS), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) and several international non-governmental 
organizations. Already in April 2010, the Security Council designated Al-Shabaab for 
targeted sanctions for its obstruction of humanitarian aid; credible sources have indeed 
reported that it Al-Shabaab has extorted payment from humanitarian entities that work in 
areas it controls. Given these precedents and the claim by the Al-Shabaab spokesperson that 
the humanitarian emergency situation is &#8220;totally, 100 per cent wrong and baseless 
propaganda&#8221; fabricated by the United Nations for political purposes, the independent expert 
is concerned at the real scope of the opening announced by Al-Shabaab.  
</p>
<p>12. Overcrowding in receiving locations such as Dadaab is severe and is resulting in 
refugees not getting the assistance they need. A similar situation is found in Mogadishu, 
where reportedly 1,000 displaced people arrive daily. There is reportedly an upsurge in 
sexual violence against women. 
</p>
<p>13. The United Nations, international and national non-governmental organizations are 
reportedly working to respond to the crisis. However, as recognized by the United Nations 
in its reports, the overextended humanitarian aid, in particular in Mogadishu, is struggling 
to cope with the large influx of internally displaced persons. While the humanitarian 
community has increased efforts to meet people&#8217;s urgent needs in all affected areas, there is 
real concern that programmes may not be sustainable beyond the short term because of lack 
of funding.  
</p>
<p>14. International efforts to deal with the drought situation have been compounded by the 
fact that not only Somalia but the whole of Horn of Africa is experiencing the most severe </p>


<p>food crisis in the world today. Over 10 million people in the drought-stricken areas of 
Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Uganda are severely affected, with no likelihood of 
improvement until 2012.  
</p>
<p>15. Furthermore, humanitarian funding for Somalia is negatively affected by anti-
terrorism legislation in some donor countries that considers any form of assistance reaching 
an organization identified as associated with &#8220;terrorism&#8221; an indictable offence. As a result, 
some donor States have avoided funding humanitarian activities that might lead to aid 
leakage to Al-Shabaab. In Somalia, since early 2008, the United Nations has been engaged 
in negotiations with various donor countries seeking exemptions from prosecution in the 
case of lifesaving food and non-food assistance, but to no avail. The independent expert 
highlights the necessity of adequate funding to sustain the humanitarian effort and ensure a 
proper response.  
</p>
<p>16. Following his two recent trips to the region, the independent expert drew the 
attention of the international community through two press releases (one in March 2011, 
the other in July) to the terrible consequences of the drought in Somalia. In his latter 
statement, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter, was a joint 
signatory. They warned that unless immediate measures were taken, the situation would 
worsen. The independent expert was pained to discover that, despite clear warnings by all 
concerned, the international response was far from satisfactory.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Developments in the political sector 
</b></p>
<p>17. The political stand-off between the President of the Transitional Federal 
Government and the Speaker of the Transitional Federal Parliament took a serious turn in 
</p><p>2011. It threatened to bring political progress towards ending the transition to a standstill. 
The Speaker continued to maintain that elections for the Presidency, the Speaker and 
Speaker&#8217;s deputies should be held before the end of the transition, on 20 August 2011, 
while the President, citing security concerns and the need to carry out key transitional tasks, 
wanted elections to be postponed for a year. The confrontation reached a peak on several 
occasions, such as on 9 May, when Somali members of Parliament were prevented from 
leaving Mogadishu to attend a workshop to discuss modalities for elections, and on 19 July, 
when a shoot-out took place in Villa Somalia between guards of the President and of the 
Speaker.  
</p>
<p>18. The Security Council expressed its most serious concern at the political standstill 
among the Transitional Federal Institutions. The International Contact Group on Somalia 
met in Kampala, in June 2011. Participants urged the Somali leadership to reach consensus 
and complete the critical transitional tasks, most notably the constitution-making process 
through a credible and inclusive consultation process.  
</p>
<p>19.  Intense efforts by regional leaders and the United Nations resulted in the Kampala 
Accord, which was signed on 9 June 2011. The Accord provided for the postponement of 
elections for 12 months from August 2011, the resignation of the Prime Minister within 30 
days, the appointment and endorsement by Parliament of a new Prime Minister and 
Cabinet, and an undertaking by the Transitional Federal Government and the Transitional 
Federal Parliament to work together with the international community to establish a 
roadmap with benchmarks, timelines and compliance mechanisms for the implementation 
of priority tasks. The Transitional Federal Institutions, with the support of UNPOS and the 
United Nations country team are reportedly working on the said roadmap, which is 
expected to be adopted before the end of August 2011. An improvement in the security 
situation and progress in the adoption of the Constitution are central to the roadmap. </p>


<p>20.  Following the announcement of the Accord, demonstrations were held in 
Mogadishu against the President, the Speaker and the facilitators of the Accord, including 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia, which lasted for two days, 
during which at least three demonstrators died.  
</p>
<p>21. Subsequently, a new Prime Minister, Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, was endorsed by 
Parliament on 28 June with an overwhelming majority.  His nomination was also positively 
received by most key players. A new Cabinet was endorsed by Parliament on 23 July, with 
397 votes in favour. The 18-member Cabinet consists of all new appointees, chosen on the 
basis of the 4.5 formula and includes representatives from Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama&#8217;a.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Military advances and developments in the security sector 
</b></p>
<p>22.  In Mogadishu, African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and Transitional 
Federal Government forces maintained the significant gains made in early 2011, and further 
increased their area of control to include Bakara Market in May. The forces now fully 
control eight districts in Mogadishu. This has led to a significant improvement in the 
security situation. 
</p>
<p>23.  Al-Shabaab appears to have been weakened by rumours that senior leaders colluded 
in the killing of a senior commander and al-Qaida representative at a roadblock in 
Mogadishu, on 8 June. It appears to have been further weakened by the loss of senior 
officials and by drone strikes near Kismaayo in June and July. Continuing recruitment and 
taxation by the group suggest its capabilities have been reduced by fighting on several 
fronts. Occasional clan attacks against Al-Shabaab suggest growing opposition. 
</p>
<p>24.  Consequently, Al-Shabaab has increased its use of asymmetric warfare tactics 
against AMISOM and Transitional Federal Government TFG forces, including suicide 
bombings against a military position on 30 May, the seaport on 9 June, and the 
assassination of the Minister of the Interior and National Security, Abdishakur Sheik 
Hassan, on 10 June, by his own niece. 
</p>
<p>25. Since the signing of the Djibouti Agreement in 2008, the international community 
has provided assistance to the Transitional Federal Government to develop security and 
justice sector institutions. The Joint Security Committee and its working groups continue to 
strengthen the security coordination structures established within the Office of the President 
and the Prime Minister. 
</p>
<p>26. The Transitional Federal Government military has reached the estimated strength of 
10,000 men; its police have reached 7,000. However, there are concerns that the 
Transitional Federal Institutions remain under-supported in some key security areas and 
that additional funds are necessary to make basic security a priority. At the same time, lack 
of effective command and control structures and poor discipline among some Transitional 
Federal Government troops are a serious concern and have  resulted in recurring violence. 
</p>
<p>27. One trend of significant military and political significance that has emerged over the 
past month is the desertion of Al-Shabaab fighters. Some deserters are re-absorbed into 
communities, while others, estimated to be about 130, have surrendered to 
AMISOM/Transitional Federal Government forces and are currently accommodated in 
National Security Authorities facilities. In his talks with the Prime Minister, the 
independent expert encouraged the Transitional Federal Government, to develop, with 
United Nations support, the legislative and policy provisions necessary to cater for such and 
similar other persons.  </p>


<p><b> V. Developments relating to human rights in South-Central 
Somalia  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Protection of civilians 
</b></p>
<p>28. The protection of civilians remains a major concern in Mogadishu and other areas in 
the South, where fighting has been intense. In mid-February, AMISOM and the 
Transitional Federal Government launched a major offensive to expand Government 
control over Mogadishu, with a second front along the border with Ethiopia and Kenya, 
causing further displacement. In February alone, the fighting resulted in the displacement of 
24,000 people countrywide, 6,000 of whom in Mogadishu districts. 
</p>
<p>29. In Mogadishu, an increase in fighting results in an increase in civilian casualties, as 
testified by the surge in under-five casualties in Mogadishu in the period from March to 
May 2011. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in May 1,590 people with 
weapon-related injuries were admitted to the three main hospitals in Mogadishu, almost 
half of whom were children under five. Most suffered from blast-related injuries. Military 
operations conducted in highly-populated urban areas, failure to distinguish between 
civilians and combatants, deliberate and indiscriminate attacks, including the use of 
improvised explosive devices and suicide attacks by Al-Shabaab, account for a significant 
number of civilian deaths and injuries. The independent expert is extremely concerned at 
the impact of a military offensive in Mogadishu at this time of crisis and displacement. 
</p>
<p>30. AMISOM has taken some preventive measures to limit civilian casualties, such as a 
policy of no-indirect fire and the identification of no-fire zones, although specialized 
equipment and other measures are still needed. Some AMISOM personnel received training 
on international humanitarian law and protection of civilians in December, and further 
training is envisaged. AMISOM also carried out investigations into two separate incidents 
where its troops apparently carelessly opened fire against passers-by. As a result, three 
soldiers are serving prison sentences in Uganda. The independent expert encourages the 
African Union and the United Nations to strengthen their cooperation on issues of 
protection of civilians and recommends that the effectiveness of the African Union/United 
Nations working group to serve as a mechanism for coordination in this key area be 
reinforced. 
</p>
<p>31. Poor command and control over Transitional Federal Government forces and the 
loose integration of soldiers with militia and clan-based affiliation have led to a series of 
incidents resulting in violence not directly resulting from the conflict. On 30 January, for 
example, clashes between Transitional Federal Government police and a Transitional 
Federal Government special security unit near Banadir Hospital killed at least 16 people 
and injured 56 others. The Government publicly regretted the incident and arrested five 
individuals. Four persons were reportedly killed on 19 July in a shootout in Villa Somalia 
between guards of the President and of the Speaker. Reports of Government forces 
harassing and using violence against civilians have also been made. On 19 July, a student 
was shot dead by Government soldiers in Wabeeri district after he resisted the stealing of 
his computer. Al-Shabaab, on the other hand, continues to perpetrate serious violations of 
humanitarian and human rights law, including summary executions of civilians associated 
with the Government, unlawful arrest and detention and acts amounting to torture and other 
inhumane, cruel and degrading practices, such as flogging, amputation and stoning.  </p>


<p><b> B. Child protection  
</b></p>
<p>32. The widespread and systematic recruitment and use of children in armed conflict in 
Somalia continues to be a matter of utmost concern. Al-Shabaab continues its policy of 
active child recruitment. In May and June, it reportedly recruited over 180 children in 
Lower Juba; systematic recruitment from Bay and Bakol was also documented. Schools are 
increasingly targeted for recruitment. The Transitional Federal Government has publicly 
reiterated its policy of not recruiting children into the Somali national forces. However, no 
effective mechanism is in place to prevent such recruitment, as made evident by the 
identification in the Bihanga military training camp in Uganda of 46 underage recruits. In 
April, the minors were repatriated into Mogadishu, but only six of them have been 
reintegrated into civilian life with United Nations support. The whereabouts of the 
remaining 40 are unclear, and there are reports that they are still hosted in the Government 
Al-Jazeera Camp. The independent expert urges the new Cabinet to appoint a focal point 
for human rights and children and armed conflict issues on the basis of the positive example 
given by the Farmajo Government, and looks forward to concrete progress in the 
development and adoption of the action plan, as required by the Security Council in its 
resolution  1612 (2005).   
</p>
<p>33. According to United Nations monitors, in May and June, 463 grave violations 
against children involving primarily child recruitment and the killing and maiming of 
children in Mogadishu were reported. Child soldiers are often used in the frontline.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Rule of law  
</b></p>
<p>34. The weakness or virtual collapse of the structures designed to administer justice, 
including law enforcement and the protection of human rights, continues to impede 
progress towards the establishment of formal mechanisms for the rule of law. Given this 
situation, a range of non-State customary or religion-based (sharia) mechanisms are in place 
to deliver judicial and legal services to the population. At present, the judiciary in 
Mogadishu is housed in only a few buildings and house courts, and has limited personnel in 
need of further professional development. In April 2011, UNDP conducted the first judicial 
training in years. The six-month programme was aimed at judges, prosecutors and judicial 
support staff.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Freedom of expression and opinion 
</b></p>
<p>35. No journalist was killed in the period under consideration. However, journalists have 
continued to suffer injuries in the context of the ongoing armed conflict, and are subjected 
to arbitrary or unlawful arrests, threats and other forms of intimidation.  Al-Shabaab 
reportedly continues to place unlawful and arbitrary limits on freedom of opinion and 
expression, including by blocking radio signals and prohibiting listening to certain radio 
stations and news. Failure to obey these orders has been met with punishments to both 
media house staff and individuals caught listening to banned stations.  
</p>
<p>36. Cases of interference by the Transitional Federal Government with freedom of 
opinion and expression were also reported. Notable cases include the arrest and detention of 
two Shabelle Media personnel for three days in Mogadishu, only for them to be released 
without charge. In March 2011, Radio Kulmiye was closed by the National Security 
Agency for 48 hours, then allowed to resume broadcasting by the authorities. In June, 
Government forces stormed and stopped the operation of Jubba radio, a local FM station 
based in Mogadishu, for a few hours.  </p>


<p>37. The National Union of Somali Journalists reported to the independent expert that, on 
22 May, its offices were raided and robbed by four armed men, and alleged that 
Government forces extended no protection to Union staff and offices. The independent 
expert was unable to verify these claims.  
</p>
<p>38.  The independent expert hopes that the Transitional Federal Government will work 
closely with the media in the critical context of the transition period and the constitution-
making process. He would likewise expect the media to work professionally, with due 
respect for the ethics and principles governing the freedom of expression and opinion at this 
critical period in their country&#8217;s history. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Women&#8217;s rights  
</b></p>
<p>39. Domestic violence, sexual violence and such harmful traditional practices as female 
genital mutilation are some of the most common violations of women&#8217;s rights reported 
across all areas of Somalia.  
</p>
<p>40. A number of other violations remain invisible, and discrimination in all aspects of 
life overlooked. Deteriorated infrastructure and health-care services have an exponential 
impact on women&#8217;s health, with the effect that Somalia has among the highest maternal 
mortality and morbidity rates in the world. Women have also lower education levels, 
including at primary level, face work discrimination and greater poverty, the impact of 
which should be carefully evaluated when considering that around 70 per cent of Somali 
homes have women as household head.  
</p>
<p>41. Access to justice and equality before the law remains a challenge, as exemplified in 
cases of sexual violence that are settled by tribal elders who disregard the opinion and will 
of the victim, including with forced marriages between the victim and the perpetrator. In 
the course of the universal periodic review, several delegations focused on the urgent need 
to improve the human rights situation of women and children. The Transitional Federal 
Government delegation committed to eradicating female genital mutilation, and it was 
recommended that the practice be criminalized and awareness-raising campaigns 
conducted. Other recommendations on women's rights concerned the urgent need to address 
violence against women and to include women in political life and the peace process.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Universal periodic review of Somalia 
</b></p>
<p>42. In May 2011, the Human Rights Council reviewed the report of Somalia on the 
human rights situation in the country.1 Somalia was represented at the session of the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review by three women Ministers, one from 
Puntland. This, together with the fact that this was the first review of Somalia and 
engagement with a human rights review mechanism in two decades, drew a great deal of 
attention in the Council. 
</p>
<p>43. The large number of delegations participating in the review expressed general 
appreciation for the efforts of the Transitional Federal Government to present its report, and 
recognized the particular situation of Somalia. Linkages between the political and the 
human rights situations were highlighted, and the Government was called upon to pursue 
the peace process and expand its outreach across clan lines.  
</p>
<p>  
 1 A/HRC/WG.6/11/SOM/1. </p>


<p>44. The situation of women and children, the eradication of female genital mutilation, 
violence against women, women&#8217;s participation in political and public life, child 
recruitment, the situation of journalists and human rights defenders, besides the poor degree 
of enjoyment of core elements of economic and social rights, such as education and health, 
were all identified as areas where action was required. Other recommendations pertained to 
the adoption and ratification of international instruments, the finalization of the 
Constitution with strong human rights provisions, the abolition of the death penalty and the 
development of the required institutions, including the creation of a national human rights 
commission, the strengthening of the judiciary and others.   
</p>
<p><b> VII. Human rights situation in Somaliland 
</b></p>
<p>45. The independent expert visited Somaliland late in February 2011, and had useful 
meetings with Government Ministers and senior officials. He held meetings with United 
Nations officials and members of the civil society. He subsequently received information 
from individuals by e-mail. 
</p>
<p>46. In Somaliland, a degree of relative stability and functioning institutions have 
permitted some positive developments. In January 2011, the Act establishing the 
Somaliland National Human Rights Commission was promulgated by the President, and an 
Acting Chairperson was appointed. In July, seven Commissioners were also approved by 
Parliament. The Act meets basic international standards. However, the independent expert 
is concerned at the likelihood that the very limited human resources available to the 
Commission will de facto prevent it from carrying out its mandate effectively. The 
independent expert welcomes the work of UNPOS supporting the Commission, and invites 
the international community, and United Nations agencies in particular, to coordinate and 
intensify their support for the Commission. The independent expert is also pleased that 
Somaliland has launched a five-year justice strategy to address its shortcomings in an open 
and cooperative relationship with the international community.  
</p>
<p>47. The National Union of Somali Journalists reported that, over the past several 
months, authorities in Hargeisa have stepped up legal action against journalists and news 
media organizations, including charges of defamation, libel, false news and insults. The 
independent expert has not been able to verify the report; nevertheless, he is concerned that 
acts amounting to slander and defamation are dealt with through criminal legislation and 
carry a detention sentence. He therefore urges the Somaliland authorities to bring existing 
legislation into line with human rights so that such forms of conduct are dealt with as civil 
matters.  
</p>
<p>48. With regard to the situation of women, the fact that two women Ministers and one 
deputy were included in the Cabinet of 26 Ministers formed by President Silanyo should be 
considered a milestone. It is, however, also important that women&#8217;s representation be 
strengthened at lower levels and a quota system be considered. The gender policy officially 
adopted by the Parliament under the previous Government was in the process of being 
implemented.  
</p>
<p>49. Cases of sexual violence, even after being reported to the Police, continue to be 
taken out of the formal legal process and adjudicated through the customary system. 
Nonetheless, violence against women is either on the increase or increasingly reported, 
despite the attached stigma. The independent expert was informed that only two police 
stations in Hargeisa have in place a women&#8217;s desk staffed by female police officers. It is 
apparent that this policy needs to be substantially strengthened to contribute to promoting 
women&#8217;s access to justice.  </p>


<p>50. The prevalence of female genital mutilation and circumcision in Somaliland is 
almost universal. A total of 98 per cent of women aged between 15 and 49 have undergone 
the procedure, with 77 per cent of them subjected to the most severe form. There is no 
national law against female genital mutilation, although efforts have been made in the 
recent past to introduce relevant legislation. Moreover, there is no national policy or 
strategy for the eradication of this practice. The Government and many civil society 
organizations have initiated different efforts and outreach programmes to encourage 
communities to abandon the practice. In June 2011, religious leaders and the Minister for 
Religious Affairs issued a public declaration in which they stated that the practice did not 
have its basis in religion, and called for the abandonment of the practice. Most agreed that 
unless there was a Government policy to criminalize the act, mutilation will continue.  
</p>
<p>51. With regard to the participation of Somaliland in the universal periodic review 
process of Somalia, which was due in May 2011, the Minister for Labour told the 
independent expert that Somaliland was willing to cooperate with the Transitional Federal 
Government on the review. The relations of the previous Government with the Transitional 
Federal Government were poor, but the present Government has changed its approach. The 
Minister added, however, that the approach of the United Nations to the issue of 
Somalia/Somaliland was a violation of the right to self-determination by the people of 
Somaliland.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Human rights situation in Puntland 
</b></p>
<p>52. The independent expert visited Puntland on 23 and 24 February and had useful 
meetings with the Vice President and some members of the Puntland cabinet. He also met 
with the United Nations team, as well as members of the civil society in Garowe and 
Galkayo. The information on Puntland presented below is thus based on discussions held 
during that trip and information subsequently provided by different sources. 
</p>
<p>53. The overall security situation in Puntland remains relatively calm. However, since 
the beginning of 2011, there have been waves of violence and assassinations, mostly in 
Galkayo, Bossaso and areas around Galgala. Assassinations have targeted businessmen, 
elders, religious leaders, judicial officials and security and law enforcement officials. While 
some of these acts should be regarded as common criminal matters, others appear to be 
either clan-revenge killings or conducted by the Atam militia, reported to have close ties 
with Al-Shabaab. There are reports of peace talks between President Farole and Atam 
which have apparently resulted in preliminary agreements, including an announced 
amnesty. The independent expert welcomes these steps, but urges all parties to reflect the 
necessary balance between peace and justice and integrate core international law principles, 
such as on the limits to the permissible scope of amnesty laws.  
</p>
<p>54. The Government of Puntland has taken some measures to reduce violence and 
insecurity, including the deployment in April 2011 of additional security forces in Galkayo 
and the imposition of a night-time curfew in Bossaso, which was revoked in May. Some of 
the measures taken to address insecurity, however, appeared arbitrary and violated due 
process rights. For instance, in June, following the assassination of a former army colonel 
in Bossaso, security forces conducted a search operation that resulted in more than a 100 
people being arrested.  
</p>
<p>55. Nonetheless, killings, assassinations and other violent acts continued to be reported, 
and the Government has been widely criticized by sections of society for failing to address 
the problem. In June, the Governor of the Bari region resigned owing to the growing 
insecurity in the region and the reportedly poor cooperation of the central administration to 
address the insecurity. In July, a new Minister for Security was appointed.  </p>


<p>56. With regard to the situation of internally displaced persons, a concern in previous 
reports, a decrease in the number of forcible transfers of displaced males from Puntland 
towards the Galkayo area was noted. The independent expert recognizes the legitimate 
concerns of the Puntland authorities about infiltration of militant forces from the South, but, 
as expressed in his meeting with the Puntland authorities, he is concerned that an over-
reaction to such concerns may in some cases result in serious human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>57. The engagement of the United Nations with the Government on a policy for 
internally displaced persons seem to have acquired new vigour, but the general 
humanitarian situation of displaced persons remains precarious in many ways, particularly 
with respect to access to adequate housing, food and water, health and sanitation. Protection 
concerns remain, and cases of sexual and gender-based violence among the displaced, as 
well as within host communities, are prevalent. However, owing to the stigma attached to 
this type of violence, coupled with a weak criminal justice system, victims continue to use 
traditional structures to settle such cases, which encourages impunity.  
</p>
<p>58. In Galkayo, the independent expert was briefed by the Galkayo Education Centre for 
Peace and Development on its programmes to combat sexual and gender-based violence. 
Such violence takes place while women are involved in earning a livelihood for sheer 
survival, washing clothes, at the water well, fetching wood or in the house itself. According 
to the Centre, there is no recognition by the authorities of the critical nature of this type of 
violence, with the effect that prevention and response are inadequate. Significantly, the 
Centre reports that, of the 104 cases reported to the police in 2009, none had reached 
sentence at the time of the independent expert&#8217;s visit in February 2011.  
</p>
<p>59. The President of Puntland acknowledged the weak state of the criminal justice 
system during his opening remarks at the commencement of the twenty-sixth session of the 
Puntland Parliament. However, the decision made by the President in June 2011 to 
summarily dismiss some 20 judges to &#8220;clean up&#8221; the judiciary is likely to have a negative 
impact on its independence. It also seems to contravene provisions of the Puntland 
Constitution, which accords the power of dismissing judicial officials to the Judicial 
Service Council. 
</p>
<p>60. The exercise of freedom of expression remains a challenge, in particular among 
journalists, who reportedly face harassment and arbitrary arrest by authorities. For instance, 
on 29 June 2011, Puntland police arrested a journalist working for Hiiraan Online at his 
office in Bossasso for reportedly publishing a &#8220;false news report&#8221;. The journalist appeared 
in court on 30 June, where he was charged for &#8220;jeopardizing the security of Puntland and 
publishing false news&#8221; in accordance with the Somali Criminal Code. He was convicted 
and sentenced to a year of imprisonment, but also reportedly threatened by the authorities 
with deportation to Ethiopia because of his Ogadeni clan background. The handling of such 
conduct through criminal prosecution and restriction of right to liberty remains a problem in 
Puntland. The independent expert welcomes the request made by the Puntland authorities to 
the UNPOS human rights unit for assistance in the development of legislation compliant 
with human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>61. The independent expert welcomes the appointment in June 2011 of the Human 
Rights Defender to head the human rights institution in Puntland. The independent expert 
considers the establishment of human rights institutions compliant with human rights 
standards an invaluable step in the promotion of a human rights culture at the national level. 
The independent expert has been informed that the UNPOS human rights unit is providing 
technical assistance to facilitate its full establishment, and looks forward to the continued 
engagement of the United Nations system in this key area.  
</p>
<p>62. The independent expert also expresses his appreciation for the steps taken to expand 
the party system in Puntland and to advance the process of democratization. On 17 July </p>


<p>2011, nine members of the Puntland electoral commission were sworn into office. The 
commission will be responsible for preparing the necessary electoral legislation, organizing 
a referendum on the Constitution, the creation of political parties and conducting municipal 
elections. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Human rights situation in the regions of Sool, Sanaag and 
Cayn  
</b></p>
<p>63. The regions of Sool, Sanaag and Cayn lie at the border between Somaliland and 
Puntland and have been the object of a territorial dispute between the two administrations 
for the past 20 years. Puntland claims these two regions on basis of clan affiliation; 
Somaliland claims them on the basis of pre-independence colonial borders.  
</p>
<p>64. Reports of fighting between the Somaliland army and the Sool Sanaag Caynabo 
militia, at times backed by the Puntland army, are common. In February 2011, for example, 
there was heavy fighting in the Buuhoodle area, the combined effect of which, together 
with the drought throughout Somalia, was the displacement of nomadic populations from 
the area in anticipation of the fighting. There were no reports of civilian casualties as a 
result of the fighting, but this account is disputed by Sool Sanaag Caynabo sympathizers. 
The dispute over the regions is also conducted through political violence, as assassinations 
or attempted assassinations of Somaliland officials in Las Anod have been numerous, 
targeting police and judicial officials in particular. Such acts are often followed by a spate 
of arbitrary or unlawful arrests and detentions by the Somaliland administration. 
</p>
<p>65. The fact that the Sool and Sanaag regions are believed to hold significant oil 
deposits and that contracts for oil exploration have already been signed by Puntland is 
likely to fuel the conflict between the two administrations.  
</p>
<p><b> X. Situation in Gulmudug State 
</b></p>
<p>66. During his visit to the region in February 2011, the independent expert met with the 
Gulmudug authorities in South Galkayo. The Speaker of Parliament, representing the 
President of Gulmudug and members of the cabinet, briefed the independent expert at 
length and focused on the drought and the situation of internally displaced persons. The 
Speaker drew the independent expert&#8217;s attention to the devastating effects of the drought on 
the people and livestock of the region. He claimed that about a million livestock were 
already dead. If the drought continued, many human lives would also be lost soon. He 
added that there were 25,000 internally displaced persons living in 23 camps in South 
Galkayo. According to the Speaker, security standards were fair, but livelihoods were 
suffering. The Government required more assistance from the United Nations to protect and 
promote the rights of internally displaced persons, especially economic, social and cultural 
rights. He also connected the phenomenon of piracy to poverty in Gulmudug and lack of 
economic opportunities, explaining the need for income generation and development 
intervention in the region. 
</p>
<p><b> XI. Situation in Somalia 
</b></p>
<p>67. Since his appointment in May 2008, the independent expert has made seven visits to 
Somalia and the region. A constant feature of his reports submitted to the Human Rights 
Council on the visits has been his frustration that, despite the efforts made over the years, 
no end to the Somali crisis was in sight. Because of the complex, prolonged nature of the 
conflict, the situation has see-sawed between progress and regress.  </p>


<p>68. There were times when the independent expert was encouraged by some positive 
developments, but discouraged soon thereafter. While he thus swayed between optimism 
and pessimism, however, he has never given up hope. He still strongly believes that, despite 
many setbacks, the conflict in Somalia, like all conflicts, will come to an end sooner rather 
than later. He hopes that, in the not too distant future, the people of Somalia will be able to 
wake up from their long nightmare to find that normality has returned to their country. For 
this to happen, the international community must stay the course until the end and the 
Transitional Federal Institutions remain committed. The most recent trips of the 
independent expert have once again raised similar hopes, which he wishes to share with the 
Council. 
</p>
<p>69. While finalizing the present report, the independent expert learned about the 
withdrawal of Al-Shabaab from Mogadishu, a development that presents the Somali peace 
process with a major opportunity to move forward. For the first time in nearly two decades, 
with the exception of the brief rule by the Union of Islamic Courts, Mogadishu will come 
under an internationally-supported central authority.  A critical element at this stage is the 
need for an immediate injection of resources to the various players on the ground. This 
must be considered in conjunction with the need to address the existing humanitarian crisis 
sparked by the drought in the region. 
</p>
<p>70. During his visit to the Dadaab refugee camps in Kenya in early July, the independent 
expert spoke to newly arriving refugees from Somalia to learn about the circumstances that 
led them to flee. There was nothing new about what they said about the painful conditions 
in their country, except that this time these were compounded by the drought. They 
described how drought had gradually destroyed the livestock and all other means of their 
livelihood and how helpless they felt in the absence of any help from the authorities. They 
also mentioned how, during their long journeys, sometimes lasting over a month, they were 
helped in all possible ways by ordinary Somalis on the way, many of whom helped them 
carry their small children on their laps over long distances. In the face of such solidarity, 
the independent expert felt that the basic ingredients of national unity are there in Somalia 
to be put to use for nation-building before and after the war.   
</p>
<p>71. Most of those with whom the independent expert talked in Dadaab had come from 
territories controlled by Al-Shabaab. Since the latter had adopted a policy of not allowing 
the United Nations or other international agencies to bring assistance to areas they 
controlled, the people living there were left with no outside assistance, while Al-Shabaab 
too was unable or unwilling to provide for their needs. As a result, the population felt 
betrayed by them.  
</p>
<p>72. It may be recalled that, on previous occasions when the independent expert talked to 
refugees, in Kenya or Yemen, who came from Al-Shabaab controlled areas, most did not 
feel as strongly against them as they did this time around. The refugees were now very 
vocal about their disapproval of Al-Shabaab and its policies. This should be a warning to 
Al-Shabaab, and an opportunity for the Transitional Federal Government to be seized. The 
fact that Al-Shabaab recently decided to lift its ban, however temporarily, against outside 
assistance may be interpreted as their increasing concern about how people perceive the 
movement. 
</p>
<p>73. The independent expert had another positive impression from his talks with some 
youths in Dadaab refugee camps, some of whom had stayed for over two decades. They 
expressed gratitude to the international community for making it possible for them to obtain 
a good education during their stay in Kenya. They were now ready to go back to Somalia, if 
the opportunity came, to contribute to the education of their compatriots, who have long 
been denied this opportunity. Since the independent expert had discussed such a possibility 
with the Prime Minister during his talks the previous day in Mogadishu, this is a possibility 
to be explored. He is confident that such well-educated men and women refugees could not </p>


<p>only contribute to nation-building in Somalia but also become important players for 
confidence and peacebuilding. To begin with, they could help fulfil the dream of the new 
Prime Minster, Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, who told the independent expert that his 
Government wished to open at least one school and one hospital every month in Somalia.  
</p>
<p>74. The independent expert found his meeting with the new Prime Minister of Somalia 
and his cabinet colleagues in early July in Mogadishu to be very encouraging. The new 
Prime Minister has clearly brought some vitality to the Government. The fact that he was 
endorsed by an overwhelming majority of Somali Members of Parliament, a rare 
phenomenon, is a positive sign. He understands well the key challenges of governance in 
Somalia at this critical juncture of its history. His commitment to deal with them in a robust 
manner made a positive impression on the independent expert.  
</p>
<p>75. The independent expert agreed with the Prime Minister that the expectations of the 
international community from the Transitional Federal Government must be based on 
realistic considerations, keeping in mind the needs, capacity and resources of the 
Government. He also agreed that there was a need to clearly spell out the commitments of 
both the international community and the Government and, once obtained, to stick to them. 
However, the independent expert emphasized that, in view of the long history of distrust of 
the international community about the ability and willingness of the Government to ensure 
an efficient and corruption-free system of governance in Somalia, there was a need to 
establish trust and confidence on both sides. In this respect, the independent expert was 
pleased to learn from the Prime Minister that his Government was committed to a financial 
control mechanism to ensure proper utilization of international assistance. He would like to 
see the international community take up the offer of the Prime Minister to be a member of 
the Financial Integrity Board that the Government intends to set up. 
</p>
<p>76. Once trust is established, it is hoped that the international community will be 
encouraged to provide the Transitional Federal Government and the people of Somalia with 
assistance commensurate to their needs. The independent expert was pained to learn from 
the United Nations that the 2011 Consolidated Appeal for the Annual Programme for 
Somalia has to date been only half-funded. Taking into account the additional needs caused 
by the prolonged drought, the shortfall is predicted to be about 70 per cent. This will be a 
sad state of affairs.  
</p>
<p>77. The independent expert learned from the United Nations that, because of insufficient 
funding, it was unable to respond properly to the enormous needs caused by the 
unprecedented drought in Somalia. This is unfortunate not only because of its impact on 
famine relief, but also because it means fewer funds at a critical time, when the transition 
period is expected to conclude in a year&#8217;s time, when the Transitional Federal Government 
will yield its place to a constitutionally established Government. The independent expert 
cannot over-emphasize the point that there is now an important opportunity for the 
international community to work closely with the new Government and take advantage of 
the momentum created. 
</p>
<p>78. The independent expert also believes that the time is ripe now for the international 
community to work together with the Government to implement the commitment made by 
the Transitional Federal Government at the universal periodic review of Somalia, held in 
May 2011. The Government should be commended for its commitment to promote and 
protect human rights in Somalia even in the midst of war. It must now be helped to turn its 
commitments into reality. The role of the international community and the United Nations 
is critical in this regard.  
</p>
<p>79. An important point emerged from the discussions held by the independent expert 
with the AMISOM Force Commander at Mogadishu Airport on 26 February 2011. The 
Commander reminded the independent expert about the visit in 2009 of the Under-</p>


<p>Secretary-General for Political Affairs to Somalia, in which he made a commitment to 
establish the footprint of the United Nations in Mogadishu. He argued that, in the absence 
of the United Nations, which was the main stakeholder of international efforts in Somalia, 
AMISOM was compelled to perform functions, including political work, not related to its 
mandate. He elaborated on the importance of the presence of the United Nations in 
Mogadishu and argued that the security situation there was no worse than in Afghanistan, 
where the United Nations was deployed. 
</p>
<p>80. The independent expert informed the Force Commander that he had made the same 
point in many of his reports to the Human Rights Council. In his subsequent talks with 
members of civil society, the independent expert received the same message from them. 
Many argued that non-governmental organizations working on human rights in Mogadishu 
were often targeted by the insurgents (as much as the latter targeted the Government), but 
received no AMISOM protection. They felt that the presence of the United Nations in 
Mogadishu would make a difference. 
</p>
<p>81. During his latest visit to Mogadishu, however, the independent expert was pleased to 
learn that the presence of the United Nations there had increased significantly and 
preparations were going ahead to place more United Nations staff in Mogadishu. The 
independent expert considered this to be a very positive development. He was particularly 
pleased to learn that the new Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General for 
Somalia had decided to take up residence in Mogadishu in the near future. This will give a 
much-needed boost to all others working for the transition of Somalia from conflict to 
peace.  
</p>
<p><b> XII. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Transitional Federal Government 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> The recent withdrawal of the Al-Shabaab forces from Mogadishu should be 
seized upon by the Transitional Federal Government as an unique opportunity to 
demonstrate to the people of Somalia that not only have its efforts and those of the 
African Union and the international community borne fruit at last, but that the 
Government and the people of Somalia now have an opportunity to work together and 
move forward to the return of normality in Somalia. It is imperative that the 
Transitional Federal Government win over the whole-hearted support of the people so 
that it can stand up to the efforts of the insurgents to topple the Government through 
unconventional means, in which they would need the support of the people to succeed.  
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> An equally important task should be to ensure that the terrible drought that 
has engulfed Somalia receives adequate attention both from the Transitional Federal 
Government and the international community. This is an opportunity for the 
Government to display its commitment to the welfare of the people and its leadership, 
and to draw international attention to the plight of the people and their needs at this 
critical hour. In this effort, the Government should consider involving the people, 
including elders, which is likely to contribute to peace and reconciliation as well. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The independent expert supports most of the recommendations made by 
participating States at the universal periodic review of Somalia,2 and recommends 
that the Government decide, through a process of broad consultations, on how to go 
about implementing them and develop its own road map in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>  
 2 A/HRC/18/6. </p>


<p>85.<b> As the number of recommendations made during the universal periodic review 
is quite large, the Government should consider grouping or prioritizing them into 
categories, on the basis of the time required to implement them (such as short-term, 
medium-term and longer-term). The recommendations should be quickly 
disseminated to the people for their views and suggestions; this will be useful to ensure 
their support for the process. At the same time, the establishment of a ministerial task 
force to review and agree on the categorization and road-mapping would be useful.  
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> The Transitional Federal Government should establish appropriate 
mechanisms to communicate with the Somali people on a regular basis. This is 
essential to involve and motivate them in the affairs of the State, which in turn is 
essential for good governance, including obtaining their cooperation in many areas. 
To facilitate communication with the people, good use should be made of the 
sophisticated communications equipment reportedly received by UNPOS from New 
York to raise public awareness in the constitution-making debate. 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> An important confidence-building initiative of the Government should be the 
establishment of a national human rights commission, in compliance with Paris 
Principles, which has long been under consideration. Efforts must be made to consult 
with and seek help from Puntland and Somaliland authorities, who have acquired 
some experience in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> The Government should strengthen policy measures relating to human rights in 
line with the road map of the universal periodic review, including the adoption of a 
human rights action plan, improvement of the administration of justice and ensuring 
human rights and international humanitarian law training for the security sector, 
including the judiciary and police and armed forces. 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> The Government should ratify the core human rights conventions, including 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention</b> <b>on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, the</b> <b>Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the Rome Statute and the 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the protocols thereto, to 
demonstrate its commitment to human rights in all aspects of life. 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> The Government should take advantage of the constitution-making process, 
which offers an important opportunity to strengthen human rights protection by 
enshrining fundamental rights as principles underpinning all provisions, including the 
creation of an environment conducive to free debate, dialogue and reconciliation. The 
Prime Minister must succeed in completing the process by August 2012, the date of 
the end of the transition period. It is critical that Somalia have a Constitution by 
broad consensus to open a new page of its history as a normal State. 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The amnesty law that the Transitional Federal Government intends to table for 
adoption by the Parliament with regard to individuals who surrendered to 
Government and AMISOM forces, and other similar situations in the future, must be 
based on human rights and humanitarian law principles. As many of the deserters are 
reportedly minors, help from UNICEF would be useful. 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> The Government should consider appropriate measures to respond to the 
report by WHO that 43 per cent of the 933 weapon-related injuries reported by the 
three main Mogadishu hospitals in recent months were to children under five, 
compared to 3.5 per cent in April. The measures should be aimed at reducing or 
ending such occurrences in the shortest possible time.  </b></p>


<p>93.<b> The Government should bear in mind that accountability for civilian casualties 
in the context of the armed conflict and for loss of life resulting from the excessive use 
of force is critical for the proper respect of human rights and humanitarian law. 
While war and conflict are a serious impediment to credible investigations, it is 
necessary to at least establish mechanisms that strengthen the commitment of the 
Government and start the process. The mechanisms should be credible, transparent 
and impartial, in keeping with applicable international law.   
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The Government must adopt a strong human rights-based approach to security 
sector reform, with a particular focus on the identification of cases of violence against 
women, protection of victims and evidence-gathering. At the same time, it is vital that 
permanent, effective mechanisms are established to hold the perpetrators of such 
egregious violations, be they members of the armed forces, rebels or regular citizens, 
fully accountable.  
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> The Somali authorities at the national and subnational levels should consider 
establishing police stations near the camps for internally displaced persons, including 
women&#8217;s desks staffed by female police officers. 
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> The Transitional Federal Government should set up a fool-proof system to 
ensure that its policy of not recruiting children into the Somali national forces is 
strictly enforced by all concerned and the age limit is fully respected through 
strengthened vetting processes. The Government, together with AMISOM, must 
publicize its policy of zero tolerance on the use of children in armed conflict as often 
and as widely as possible, and ensure its strict observance with the support of 
UNICEF, under the oversight of a multipartite commission. 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> The Transitional Federal Government should take the measures necessary to 
stop all attacks against journalists and media organizations, and empower media 
workers to make their contribution at this critical juncture of the transition process 
and constitution-making. Media workers should behave professionally and abide by 
the ethics and principles governing freedom of expression and opinion. 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> The Government should launch a national awareness campaign on the situation 
of Somali women, and consider setting up specific funding channels to support local 
organizations involved in the protection of women&#8217;s rights and to provide assistance to 
victims of sexual and gender-based violence and discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> The Government should consider inviting refugees from camps in neighbouring 
countries with the necessary background to return home to help in its efforts to open 
schools and hospitals, as foreseen in the Prime Minister&#8217;s vision of opening one school 
and one hospital a month in south-central Somalia. 
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> The independent expert commends the Prime Minister&#8217;s expressed wish that 
Transitional Federal Government forces should gradually take over the protection of 
Somali institutions and citizens, bearing in mind that Somalia cannot depend for ever 
on AMISOM to ensure its security.  
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> The Transitional Federal Government should take all measures necessary to 
address the lack of effective command and control structures and poor discipline 
among some Government troops, which have resulted in recurring violence.  
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> While all parties to the conflict should respect their obligations under 
international humanitarian law and human rights law, the Transitional Federal 
Government should take the lead. All those who perpetrate abuses against the civilian 
population, in transgression of such obligations, should be held accountable in a 
timely and transparent manner. </b></p>


<p>103.<b> The Government should consider reappointing a focal point for human rights 
and children and armed conflict issues, as was done by the previous Government, and 
take concrete measures for the development and the adoption of the action plan 
required by the Security Council in its resolution 1612 (2005).  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Somaliland  
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> The Government of Somaliland should ensure necessary resources for the 
Somaliland National Human Rights Commission to carry out its mandate effectively, 
in particular monitoring and educational and complaint-hearing of functions.  
</b></p>
<p>105. <b> The Government should consider strengthening measures that contribute to 
promoting women&#8217;s access to justice. More female police officers should be stationed 
in important police station in Hargeisa and elsewhere, as necessary.  
</b></p>
<p>106.<b> As all acts amounting to slander and defamation are currently dealt through 
criminal legislation and carry a detention sentence, Somaliland authorities should 
consider bringing existing legislation into line with human rights so that such forms of 
conduct are dealt with as civil matters.  
</b></p>
<p>107.<b> The Somaliland and Puntland authorities must resolve their territorial disputes 
over the Sool, Sanag and Cayn</b> <b>regions by peaceful means. Somaliland should allow 
access of the international community, including the United Nations, to these regions 
to provide much needed humanitarian assistance to the drought-affected population. 
The Somaliland authorities should facilitate the visits of human rights agencies to 
monitor and investigate allegations of human rights violations committed by State and 
non-State actors on the ground. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Puntland  
</b></p>
<p>108.<b> Puntland authorities must take care in adopting measures to address insecurity 
so that they are not arbitrary, and respect due process rights. Situations like the one 
created in June, following the assassination of a former army colonel in Bossasso, in 
which security forces conducted a search operation resulting in the arrest of more 
than one hundred people, should be avoided. 
</b></p>
<p>109.<b> The Government must recognize the critical nature of sexual and gender-based 
violence, as reported by the</b> <b>Galkayo Education Centre for Peace and Development in 
South Galkayo, and ensure proper response and prevention. The fact that, of the 104 
cases reported to the police in 2009, none had reached sentence at the time of the 
independent expert&#8217;s visit in February 2011, must be considered seriously.  
</b></p>
<p>110.<b> The request by the Puntland authorities to the UNPOS human rights unit for 
assistance in the development of legislation compliant with human rights standards is 
a good initiative and should be followed up with similar cooperation in other areas.  
</b></p>
<p><b> D. The United Nations and the international community 
</b></p>
<p>111.<b> It is sad that the drought that has been slowly but steadily spreading death and 
devastation over different parts of Somalia for the past six months has not received 
due attention from the international community. The fact that the consolidated appeal 
for funds by United Nations agencies for their Somalia programme has been only half 
funded can be said to have contributed to this sad state of affairs. It is imperative that </b></p>


<p><b>the international community urgently contribute the necessary funds to the 
Transitional Federal Government and the United Nations to avert further disaster. 
</b></p>
<p>112.<b> The independent expert commends the decision of the Government of Kenya to 
keep its borders open for Somali refugees to seek asylum on its territory. Equally 
commendable is its decision to allow the extension of the Dadaab refugee camps to 
accommodate more Somali refugees. The independent expert urges the international 
community to provide Kenya with assistance to compensate local communities for the 
extra burden that they have to bear in this regard.  
</b></p>
<p>113.<b> United Nations agencies and their international partners should integrate the 
relevant universal periodic review recommendations in their planning and 
programming, and provide the Government of Somalia with the technical and 
financial support in the implementation of the recommendations.  
</b></p>
<p>114.<b> The United Nations and the international community, together with the African 
Union, should ensure appropriate funding to speed up the establishment of a civilian 
casualty tracking system and a fire direction centre within AMISOM so that these 
mechanisms can be set up as soon as possible.  
</b></p>
<p>115.<b> The efforts of UNICEF and its partners to support the implementation of 
programmes aimed at preventing the recruitment of children by armed groups and 
forces, and the reintegration of children previously associated with armed groups and 
forces, must be fully supported by the international community. 
</b></p>
<p>116.<b> Member States should consider taking part in supporting the Prime Minister&#8217;s 
vision of opening one school and one hospital a month. One way of doing so could be 
for individual States to sponsor one or more such schools and hospitals. 
</b></p>
<p>117.<b> The African Union and the United Nations should strengthen cooperation on 
issues relating to protection of civilians and ensure that the effectiveness of the their 
joint working group to serve as a mechanism for coordination in this key area is 
promptly reinforced.  
</b></p>
<p>118.<b> The UNPOS human rights unit, which is crucial to the promotion and 
protection of human rights in Somalia and for coordination among all United Nations 
agencies on human rights issues, has suffered from frequent staff turnover in the past 
three years. Utmost attention must be paid to ensure staff stability in the unit in order 
to avoid work and planning disruptions. 
</b></p>
<p>119.<b> The recent withdrawal of Al-Shabaab from Mogadishu makes the international 
community&#8217;s engagement with the Transitional Federal Government even more 
important at this critical time. There is now an added need for greater international 
presence in Mogadishu to prevent any vacuum that could undermine the capital&#8217;s 
stability and allow it once again to descend into warlordism. Most importantly, the 
international community should consider deploying an international protection force 
to facilitate the work of the United Nations and other international actors in 
Mogadishu.
