<p><i>Summary 
</i>The present report contains the findings and recommendations of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment on 
his mission to Jamaica, 12 to 21 February 2010. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur did not find that torture, in the classical sense of deliberately 
inflicting severe pain or suffering as a means of extracting a confession or information, 
constitutes a major problem in Jamaica. He did find, however, a general atmosphere of 
violence and aggression in almost all police stations, as well as discriminatory practices 
against detainees. At police stations, the overall conditions reflected a complete disregard 
for the dignity of detainees. Detention in such conditions for up to several years amounts to 
inhuman treatment. The conditions at remand and correctional facilities were generally 
better than in police stations; however, many prisons were found to be overcrowded, 
lacking sanitary facilities and any meaningful opportunities for education, work and 
recreation. The Special Rapporteur also received consistent allegations that corporal 
punishment was routinely applied in remand and correctional centres. The conditions for 
women were generally better, and there was a strict separation between male and female 
detainees. Children in conflict with the law, those deemed uncontrollable and those in need 
of care and protection from the State were held together in detention facilities without 
distinction. 
</p>

</p>
<p>Torture is not defined in criminal legislation in Jamaica, nor is Jamaica a party to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. This might explain why during the mission, the Special Rapporteur observed 
that the term &#8220;torture&#8221; was not part of the Jamaican lexicon. However, its absence in the 
law does not mean that it does not exist in practice. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur was encouraged by the fact that no death sentence has been 
executed since 1988, but remains concerned about the rise in fatal shootings by the police, 
which are often alleged to amount to extrajudicial killings, as well as the apparent lack of 
investigation and accountability for those responsible.  
</p>
<p>In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government 
of Jamaica implement fully its obligations under international human rights law. He urges 
the Government to ratify the Convention against Torture and the Optional Protocol thereto. 
Other recommended steps include ensuring prompt and thorough ex officio investigations 
for all allegations of ill-treatment or excessive use of force; reducing the time limits for 
police custody to 48 hours; establishing accessible and effective complaints mechanisms; 
and the rapid bringing into force of the Independent Commission of Investigation. Children 
in conflict with the law should be removed from adult detention facilities and clear 
guidelines for punishments should be established. He also recommends the abolition of the 
death penalty. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur recommends that relevant United Nations bodies, donor 
Governments and development agencies consider the administration of justice as the 
highest priority, in particular the fight against violent crime, policing and the penitentiary 
system.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment undertook a visit to Jamaica from 12 to 21 February 2010, at the invitation 
of the Government. The purpose of the visit was to assess the situation of torture and ill-
treatment in the country, including conditions of detention, and to initiate a process of 
cooperation with the Government aimed at eradicating torture and ill-treatment and 
reforming the administration of justice system. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur expresses his deep appreciation to the Government for 
extending an invitation to visit the country, which in itself is a sign of the Government&#8217;s 
willingness to open up to independent and objective scrutiny. He also appreciated the full 
cooperation extended by the authorities during the visit, and thanks the Government for 
issuing authorization letters providing him with access to all detention facilities. During the 
visit, he was able to have unannounced access to places of detention, have private 
interviews with the detainees, and had access to documentation. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with State officials, including the Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, Kenneth Baugh; the 
Minister for National Security, Dwight Nelson; the Attorney General and Minister for 
Justice, Dorothey Lightbourne; the Minister of State, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
Foreign Trade, Marlene Malahoo Forte; the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Foreign Trade, Evadne Coye; the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of 
National Security, Richard B. Reese; the Under Secretary for Multilateral Affairs, Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade, Vilma McNish; the Commissioner of Corrections, 
June Spence-Jarrett; the Acting Commissioner of Police, Owen Ellington; the Solicitor 
General, Douglas Leys; the Public Defender, Earl Witter; the Children's Advocate, Mary 
Clarke; the  Executive Director of the Bureau of Women's Affairs, Faith Webster; and the 
Chairperson of the Police Public Complaints Authority and former Chief Justice, Justice 
Lensley Wolfe. 
</p>
<p>4. Outside of Government, the Special Rapporteur met with a broad range of civil 
society organizations and lawyers. In addition, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with 
representatives of international organizations, including the United Nations country team, 
the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization and the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, and the diplomatic 
community. 
</p>
<p>5. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur visited prisons, police stations and other 
facilities (see appendix).1 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur wishes to acknowledge with appreciation the excellent 
support provided by the United Nations Resident Coordinator, Minh Pham, and the entire 
United Nations team for its excellent assistance prior to and during the visit; the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; Dr. Derrick Pounder, forensic 
</p>

</p>
<p>7. While still in the country, the Special Rapporteur shared his preliminary findings 
with the Government, which responded with constructive comments. On 15 June 2010, a 
preliminary version of the present report was sent to the Government. The Government 
provided comments on 27 July 2010, which have been included in the report.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International level 
</b></p>
<p>8. Jamaica is party to most major United Nations human rights treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women; the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; the Convention 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; and the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Jamaica is 
not yet party to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment or to the Optional Protocol thereto. 
</p>
<p>9. Jamaica had ratified the first Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, recognizing the competence of the Human Rights Committee to 
receive and consider individual complaints. However, on 23 October 1997, the Government 
of Jamaica notified the Secretary-General of its denunciation of the Protocol. 
</p>
<p>10. Jamaica is also party to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Additional 
Protocols to the Conventions of 1977, but not to the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional level 
</b></p>
<p>11. With regard to relevant regional human rights treaties in the context of the 
Organization of American States, Jamaica is party to the American Convention on Human 
Rights, but does not recognize the competence of the Inter-American Court of Human 
Rights. Jamaica has also ratified the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, 
Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women (Convention of Bel&#233;m do Par&#225;). 
However, Jamaica is not party to the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish 
Torture. 
</p>
<p><b> C. National level 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Constitutional and legislative provisions criminalizing torture 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Jamaican Constitution (Order in Council 1962), in its chapter III, governs 
fundamental rights and freedoms. These include the protection of the right to life; 
protection from arbitrary arrest or detention; freedom of movement; protection from 
inhuman treatment; freedoms of conscience, expression, assembly and association; and 
protection from discrimination. Article 17(1) of the Constitution prohibits the use of torture 
or inhuman or degrading punishment or other treatment. However, article 17(2) provides 
that punishment prescribed by other laws shall not be held to be inconsistent with the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>prohibition in section 17(1) as long as it concerns punishment that was legal at the time the 
Constitution was drafted. 
</p>
<p>13. There are several legislative provisions prohibiting the excessive use of force, 
although the only explicit prohibition of torture is found in the Constitution. For example, 
section 22 of the Offences against the Person Act (1864) criminalizes the infliction of 
serious bodily harm to another person.  
</p>
<p>14. Despite existing provisions prohibiting the excessive the use of force and inhuman 
treatment, there is no definition of torture as a crime in domestic legislation. This may be 
the reason why during the mission, the Special Rapporteur observed that the term &#8220;torture&#8221; 
is not part of the Jamaican lexicon. However, the absence of a crime of torture in the law 
does not mean that it does not exist in practice. 
</p>
<p>15. The Constabulary Force Act (1935) governs the general treatment of persons 
deprived of their personal liberty. This includes treating them with kindness and humanity2 
and not using harshness or unnecessary restraint towards them. 3  Section 15 of the 
Corrections Act (1985) states that a correctional officer may only use force against inmates 
when preventing escape, preventing harm to another life or in self-defence. The resort to 
the use of force should be only if other means are not available, and the use of a firearm 
should, where possible, be accompanied by a warning, used under the instructions of a 
superior officer, and be used to disable and not kill.  
</p>
<p>16. With regard to procedural safeguards, the Constitution provides for the right to be 
informed of the reasons for arrest &#8220;as soon as reasonably practicable&#8221; (section 15(2)); the 
right to be brought before a court &#8220;without delay&#8221; (section 15(3)(b)); be tried within a 
&#8220;reasonable time&#8221; (section 15(3)(b)); and the right to have a case reviewed by an impartial 
tribunal after six months for persons detained during a period of public emergency (section 
15(6)). 
</p>
<p>17. According to the Constabulary Force Act, a person may be detained &#8220;upon 
reasonable suspicion that he is in the course of committing or has committed or is about to 
commit an offence&#8221; (art. 50(B)). The Act also provides some safeguards that also apply for 
arrests based on warrants, including the right to be immediately informed of the reason for 
the arrest or detention and the right to be taken forthwith before a justice of the peace, who 
will determine whether there are reasonable grounds for arrest and detention (art. 50(F)(2)). 
According to section 50(G)(1) of the Constabulary Force Act, &#8220;forthwith&#8221; denotes within 
12 hours. If the justice of the peace considers that the arrest or detention is required in the 
interest of justice, he can order that a person be remanded for 24 hours, after which the 
detainee is taken before a resident magistrate. A resident magistrate, however, never 
reviews the legality of an arrest per se. 
</p>
<p>18. For cases concerning detention when there is intent to hold an identification parade, 
section 63(A) of the Judicature (Resident Magistrates) Act applies. According to the 
Resident Magistrates Act, a magistrate is to make enquiries at least once a week into each 
person detained pending an identification parade. At that time, the magistrate may extend 
the remand period or order that the person be taken before a court within 24 hours. 
However, there are no limits in the legislation to the time either an adult or a juvenile may 
be held in custody pending an identification parade. 
</p>
<p>19. According to the Bail Act (2000), any detained individual has the right to bail 
immediately upon detention at a police station. If an individual is not charged within 24 
hours, a determination on bail is made by the justice of the peace or a resident magistrate 
(section 3(2)). Where individuals are charged with murder, treason or treason-felony, bail 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 2 Rule 156. 
 3 Rule 522. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>7 
</b></p>
<p>may only be granted by the resident magistrate (section 3(4)). In most other cases, a police 
officer can decide on bail. 
</p>
<p>20. There are no provisions in the legislation concerning the use of confessions obtained 
through torture or other coercive means. However, this is prohibited by common law.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Complaints and investigations of acts of torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>21. There are three different bodies in Jamaica mandated to receive and investigate 
complaints regarding police misconduct: the Police Public Complaints Authority, the 
Bureau of Special Investigations and the Office of Professional Responsibility. The Bureau 
of Special Investigations and the Office of Professional Responsibility are institutions 
within the Jamaican Constabulary Force, while the Police Public Complaints Authority is a 
State-funded independent body. The Authority and the Bureau of Special Investigations 
will be replaced by the Independent Commission of Investigation, created under the 
Independent Commission of Investigation Act (2009). However, there is no clear time 
frame for when the Commission will start its work. 
</p>
<p>22. The Police Public Complaints Authority is an independent, non-police agency 
tasked with investigating all allegations of misconduct by the Jamaican Constabulary Force. 
The investigative staff is made up solely of civilian personnel. The role of the Authority is 
to appraise the investigations and decide whether the police acted unlawfully. When the 
Authority considers that a criminal offence may have been committed, it reports the case to 
the Director of Public Prosecutions for further action.  
</p>
<p>23. According to the Independent Commission of Investigation Act, a person may 
submit a complaint to the Independent Commission of Investigation regarding the conduct 
of a member of the security forces or any specified official which (a) resulted in the death 
of or injury to any person or was intended or likely to result in such death or injury; (b) 
involved sexual assault; (c) involved assault or battery by the member or official; (d) 
resulted in damage to property or the taking of money or of other property; (e) although not 
falling within any of the preceding paragraphs, is in the opinion of the Commission of a 
grave or exceptional nature (section 11(1)). Section 12(1) of the Act also requires police 
officers to report any such incidents within 24 hours, and forthwith if the incident resulted 
in the death of or injury of a person. 
</p>
<p>24. The Office of the Public Defender was established in 1999 to replace the Office of 
the Ombudsman. The Public Defender may investigate and give recommendations 
concerning any complaints of injustice as a result of any action taken by an authority or an 
officer of member of such authority, or where any person has suffered, is suffering or is 
likely to suffer an infringement of their constitutional rights as a result.4 Unlike in the case 
of the Police Public Complaints Authority, the Public Defender is mandated to initiate ex 
officio investigations. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>25. Sections 2 and 3 of the Offences against the Person Act state that the death penalty 
may be imposed for capital murder when the victim is a public official, witness or juror. It 
may also be imposed for murder in the course of robbery, burglary or sexual violence. A 
pregnant woman who is found to be guilty of these offences may not be put to death. In 
addition, juveniles may not be sentenced to death.5 The death penalty has not been carried 
out since 1988, pursuant to the 1993 Privy Council decision of <i>Pratt and Morgan v. 
Jamaica</i>. In the decision, the Privy Council stated that &#8220;in any case in which execution is to 
</p>

</p>
<p>take place more than five years after sentence, there will be strong grounds for believing 
that the delay is such as to constitute &#8216;inhuman or degrading punishment or other 
treatment&#8217;&#8221;.6 On 26 November 2008, parliament voted to keep the death penalty. At the 
time of the visit, six people remained on death row. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Juvenile justice 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Child Care and Protection Act (2004) establishes criminal responsibility at age 
12 (section 63). Upon arrest, a child must be taken forthwith before a court. If this is not 
possible, the office of police in charge of the police station informs the Office of the 
Children&#8217;s Advocate, releases the child on bail or detains the child in a children&#8217;s remand 
centre until the child can be brought before a court (section 67). All matters dealing with 
charges against a child or in relation to a child in need of care or protection are heard by the 
Children&#8217;s Courts (section 72(1)) and the parents or legal guardians of the child are 
required to attend the court at all stages of the proceedings (section 69(1)). 
</p>
<p>27. The Child Care and Protection Act also states that children should be kept separate 
from adults at police stations and courts (sections 66(a) and (b)). However, if the court so 
decides, a juvenile may be committed to an adult correctional centre (section 68(b)). In 
certain circumstances, including murder or manslaughter, treason or infanticide, and if the 
court is of the opinion that no other methods are suitable, a juvenile may be sentenced to up 
to 25 years of imprisonment (section 75(8)). 
</p>
<p>28. Section 9 of the Child Care and Protection Act prohibits assaulting and physically or 
mentally ill-treating a child, punishable by fine or imprisonment with hard labour not 
exceeding five years. Additionally, a child in a place of safety or children&#8217;s home has the 
right to be free from corporal punishment (section 64(d)). In this regard, a children&#8217;s home 
may be visited at all reasonable times by any person authorized by the minister or by an 
officer of the Jamaican Constabulary Force, not below the rank of Deputy Superintendent, 
for the purpose of ensuring that the children receive adequate care and attention (section 
54). 
</p>
<p>29. The Child Care and Protection Act also created the Office of the Children&#8217;s 
Advocate to protect and enforce children&#8217;s rights. The Children&#8217;s Advocate may conduct 
investigations into complaints of authorities infringing on a child&#8217;s rights.7 The Children&#8217;s 
Advocate may also bring non-criminal proceedings to court concerning the rights or best 
interests of children.8 
</p>
<p>30. Juveniles may be detained if they are in need of care and protection, if deemed 
uncontrollable or if in conflict with the law. With regard to an &#8220;uncontrollable child&#8221;, there 
is no clear definition or criteria for its identification in the legislation. The wide discretion 
currently allowed to the judiciary has led to a relatively large number of detentions of 
children under such orders. According to the Office of the Children&#8217;s Advocate, in 2008 
alone, almost 20 per cent of children in detention facilities were there for uncontrollable 
behaviour. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Domestic Violence Act of 1996 was amended in order to give women the 
possibility of applying through the court system for a protective order (section 3(1)). It also 
gives police officers the same possibility concerning children in situations of domestic 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>violence (section 3(2)(b)(v)). The violation of a court-issued protection order is punishable 
by a fine and/or by a prison term of up to six months (section 5(1)). However, owing to 
additional gaps in the legislation, the Government has recently engaged with civil society to 
make the necessary amendments. 
</p>
<p>32. Regarding the protection of victims, women may receive renewable protection 
orders. However, their enforcement is not clear, because the law does not foresee patrolling, 
but a police officer may arrest a suspect who is believed to be in breach of a protection 
order.9 Existing shelters and crisis centres for women are operated by civil society, but they 
receive financial subsidies from the Government. In terms of implementation, the 
Government has carried out media campaigns and public education programmes to 
sensitize women on gender-based violence at the community level, including at churches 
and in civic groups. Education on gender-based violence is also offered at all school levels. 
Nevertheless, there is no national plan of action to combat domestic violence. When it 
enters into force, the Sexual Offences Act will provide greater protection to victims, 
including victims of marital rape. 
</p>
<p>33. The Trafficking in Persons Act, adopted in 2007, criminalizes the trafficking in 
persons and provides for victims&#8217; assistance. A national task force against trafficking in 
persons was established as an intergovernmental agency with the responsibility of 
providing advisory functions to the Government and coordinating national efforts at 
combating trafficking. The Bureau of Women&#8217;s Affairs is mainly responsible for 
prevention, the Ministry of National Security and the Ministry of Justice for protection, and 
the police and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution for prosecution in cases of 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Assessment of the situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Prevailing violence in the country 
</b></p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur is aware of the difficult security situation faced in Jamaica 
and its escalating crime rate. The root causes of this high level of violence in the country 
are, among others, the drug trade and the trade in firearms, links of criminal gangs to 
political parties, corruption, poverty and other socio-economic disparities within the 
country and within cities themselves. The Special Rapporteur therefore considers it 
essential to address the root causes of this culture of violence, including through 
comprehensive policies that can help to bring this high crime rate down. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the high number of murders 
committed each year, including the large number of people who are killed in police 
operations in circumstances that are not always clear. The Special Rapporteur heard 
accounts of murders as a result of excessive use of force by the Jamaican Constabulary 
Forces or the Jamaica Defence Forces, which in some cases may amount to extrajudicial 
executions. He was also concerned that many investigations are not prompt or effective, 
and that prosecutions in cases involving the security forces are rare.10

investigations by the Office of the Department of Public Prosecution and, if necessary, referral to the 
Coroner&#8217;s Court to ensure the greatest degree of accuracy in rulings and the preservation of the 
credibility, probity and integrity of the investigation and judicial systems. The structure of the 
investigative system results in a lengthy period of investigations. This does not render them </p>

</p>
<p><b> B. Acts of torture and ill-treatment in places of detention 
</b></p>
<p>36. On the basis of discussions with public officials, judges, lawyers and representatives 
of civil society, interviews with victims of violence and with persons deprived of their 
liberty (often supported by forensic medical evidence), the Special Rapporteur did not find 
that torture, in the classical sense of deliberately inflicting severe pain or suffering as a 
means of extracting a confession of information, was a major problem in Jamaica. This is 
due in part to the safeguard in the legislation providing for a lawyer or a justice of the peace 
to be present during all interrogations. He did, however, find many cases, corroborated by 
medical evidence, of people being subjected to different degrees of beatings for the purpose 
of punishment, which can also amount to torture. This was the case, for example, in the 
events which took place at Horizon Remand Centre on 8 February 2010 (see paragraphs 42-
45 below). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Conditions of detention 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur was particularly concerned at the conditions of detention in 
police stations, reflecting a complete disrespect for the human dignity of detainees and 
prisoners, made worse by a general atmosphere of violence and aggression from both the 
police and detainees. In correctional facilities, the conditions differed significantly between 
facilities, although they were generally better than in police stations. It was also evident 
during the interviews that detainees had no knowledge of or trust in any complaints 
mechanisms available to them. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur found a poor 
completion of complaint entries in the police registers. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Police stations 
</b></p>
<p>38. The conditions in police stations can generally be regarded as inhuman and the 
treatment arbitrary. The Special Rapporteur found detainees held in cells that were 
overcrowded, filthy and infested with rats, cockroaches and lice. In addition, many of the 
cells were in complete darkness, and had poor ventilation and an unbearable stench. 
Detainees were forced to stay in their cells for most of the day, with very limited time 
allowed out of their cells. As a result, they were dependent on police officers to allow them 
to use the toilet in the corridors. When the officers refused, they were forced to urinate and 
defecate in plastic bags, bottles and plates, in front of their cellmates. The majority of 
police stations did not have mattresses; detainees were therefore forced to sleep on concrete 
beds and, when the cells were overcrowded, on the floor. Visits were infrequent and only 
for a few minutes. In many instances, detainees could not see their families. When they 
were allowed, they had to speak through grills. Access to medical care also depended on the 
goodwill of the authorities. 
</p>
<p>                                                                                                                                                                                                 
ineffective, but is intended to provide prosecutors with enough evidence to proceed against persons 
who may have committed an offence. In addition, under section 94 of the Constitution, the 
Department is empowered to undertake criminal proceedings against any person where it considers it 
desirable. A decision not to prosecute by the Department does not amount to refusal or reluctance on 
frivolous grounds, but rather that it may be unable to prosecute the matter if there is not enough 
evidence to charge anyone. Persons alleging an incorrect decision by the Department not to prosecute 
have the right to seek judicial review in the Courts. 
</p>
<p>  The Government also provided statistics from the Bureau of Special Investigations on fatal shooting 
incidents. For the period 2005 &#8211; 2009, there were 1,004 fatal incidents and 1,188 fatalities. 
Furthermore, 111 police officers were charged during the same period for offences ranging from 
shooting with intent to murder. Of these, 448 cases were forwarded to the Coroner&#8217;s Court. The 
Department made 17 rulings for murder, and 34 police officers were charged. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>11 
</b></p>
<p>39. Despite differences in the conditions of the police lock-ups visited, none complied 
with international standards with regard to the treatment of detainees. The worst conditions 
were found at May Pen, Denham Town, Kingston Central and Montego Bay police stations, 
while those in the stations at Alligator Pond and Duhaney Park for women were clearly 
better.  
</p>
<p>40. The sheer duration of policy custody makes the problem of inhuman conditions 
more severe. Appalling conditions might be bearable for a maximum of 48 hours, but the 
fact that detainees remain there for several months or even years amounts to inhuman 
treatment. It is also inhuman for police officers to have to work under such conditions, such 
as those seen in May Pen and Montego Bay police stations. Police lock-ups in Jamaica are 
used as de facto remand centres, where persons awaiting trial can be held for several 
months or years, despite current practices worldwide of holding detainees at police lock-ups 
for up to 48 or maximum 72 hours. The Special Rapporteur interviewed one detainee who 
had been held for five years and four other detainees who had been held for more than four. 
</p>
<p>41. The solution to the problem at police lock-ups is not simply to renovate or alter 
existing facilities, as is currently being done at Hunt&#8217;s Bay police station. Rather, the 
concept of police custody should be modified to short-term detention not exceeding a 
maximum of 48 hours. A person who is charged within 48 hours should then be either 
released on bail or transferred to a remand facility, under a different authority from the 
police. The Special Rapporteur was concerned that the current model of extremely long 
periods of police custody in unbearable conditions was intended to cause such personal 
distress as to force detainees to confess. If this is the explicit purpose of such prolonged 
police detention, it may even be qualified as torture. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Remand centres 
</b></p>
<p>42. The conditions found at the Horizon Remand Centre were better than in the police 
stations, but were still extremely harsh, despite the fact that remand detainees are supposed 
to be presumed innocent until found guilty. In addition, although Horizon was only at 58 
per cent of its capacity, with 609 detainees, there were several human rights concerns, 
including a lack of water, sometimes for a number of days. Additionally, as in police 
stations, the Special Rapporteur received many allegations of arbitrary treatment of 
detainees by warders. Many of the detainees noted that the warders were able to take in 
mobile phones and marihuana, which they then sold to detainees. 
</p>
<p>43. On 8 February 2010, disturbances broke out at Horizon as a result of frustration with 
the conditions of detention and treatment by the warders. The Special Rapporteur visited 
the detention facility several days after the disturbances and was able to speak to both the 
detainees and the authorities regarding the events. However, the testimonies of the 
detainees differed greatly from the description provided by the authorities. According to the 
authorities, the disturbances had started when 24 detainees who were outside their cells 
managed to cut open all the locks and release the other detainees. In order to prevent a 
breakout, the warders called for police back-up, and the violence that ensued was only in 
self-defence. The detainees claimed that they had not had water for four days, so they 
started shaking the grills and throwing stones and other debris. They were warned by the 
warders to stop, and when they did not, the warders left the building and returned with 
police and military officers as back-up. The authorities then proceeded to suppress the 
detainees through excessive use of force by forcefully taking them out of their cells and 
beating them with iron bars and pipes.  
</p>
<p>44. As a result of the disturbances, more than 70 people were injured, including almost 
60 detainees. All of the injured were taken to a doctor; 35 detainees were taken to the 
hospital, and 15 were admitted. No officers were hospitalized as they only suffered minor 
injuries. The medical evidence obtained indicated that the overall pattern of injuries was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>assaultive and indicative of the use of blunt force with a series of blows to the body. The 
medical evidence strongly corroborated the allegations of the detainees, who suffered 
broken limbs and other defensive-type injuries, some even requiring hospitalization. This 
led the Special Rapporteur to conclude that severe pain was intentionally inflicted for the 
purpose of punishment, amounting to torture.  
</p>
<p>45. At the time of the visit, both an internal and a police investigation were in progress. 
The Public Defender was also carrying out an investigation into the incident. The Special 
Rapporteur hopes that the results of the investigation will lead to appropriate administrative 
and, if applicable, criminal action against those responsible.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Correctional centres 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur visited facilities that demonstrated a broad spectrum of 
conditions, ranging from fairly poor to those that could be considered best practices. St. 
Catherine and Tower Street Adult Correctional Centres, the two main prisons, are very old 
constructions originally built for &#8220;storing&#8221; people but are not suitable for modern 
correctional purposes, including rehabilitation and re-socialization. They were found to be 
overcrowded, lacking in sanitary facilities and offering limited opportunities for education, 
work and recreation. According to the testimonies of several detainees, opportunities for 
work were only available for those who already knew the different trades offered. In 
addition, as highlighted above (see paragraphs 39 to 45 above), basic services such as 
electricity, the use of toilets and access to medical attention depended on the goodwill of 
the warders. Detainees also reported that they could purchase marijuana and mobile phones 
from the warders. 
</p>
<p>47. Homosexuals detained at St. Catherine and Tower Street correctional centres were 
held in the &#8220;vulnerable persons unit&#8221; as a protective measure. However, their separation led 
to a loss of privileges of a punitive character, such as work and recreation, including the use 
of the library and playing field. In the security section in the Tower Street centre, detainees 
were locked up in dark, solitary cells without a toilet or water, and had nobody to call for 
help.  
</p>
<p>48. The prisoners in death row in the Gibraltar 1 section in the St. Catherine centre were 
held in isolation. They were allowed to go outside for one or two hours each day, but were 
not able to see any other prisoners. The cells had no toilets and the detainees complained 
about the presence of maggots and other insects in the cells. 
</p>
<p>49. The conditions at the detention facilities for children and women were generally 
better than those for adult males. Fort Augusta Adult and Juvenile Correctional Centre, the 
female prison, had much better conditions. However, the Special Rapporteur expressed 
concern at the fact that child detainees were not separated from the adults. The Diamond 
Crest Juvenile Correctional Centre had the best conditions among all those visited, and 
should serve as a best practice model for other correctional centres for both boys and girls. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Children 
</b></p>
<p>50. Children and juveniles in need of care and protection, uncontrollable juveniles and 
those in conflict with the law are often held together without distinction. The lack of 
separation makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to address the individual needs of 
children, be it in terms of protection or rehabilitation. Additionally, there should not be one 
single model for all children in detention with regard to levels of security, access to 
education, recreation and family visits. Regarding uncontrollable children, the Special 
Rapporteur was greatly concerned at the lack of a clear definition or criteria for the 
identification of an uncontrollable child and the wide discretion afforded to the judiciary, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>13 
</b></p>
<p>which led to a relatively high number of detentions of uncontrollable children. He was 
further concerned by the fact that many children seemed to receive disproportionately long 
sentences for minor infractions.  
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur witnessed two opposite ends of the spectrum in the 
conditions of detention in the places visited. At Diamond Crest Juvenile Correctional 
Centre for girls, the Special Rapporteur could sense an overall positive atmosphere and the 
well-being of the girls. The openness of the facility and the genuine interest of the staff 
were very reassuring. The girls went to school, had the opportunity to practice sports and 
spend time outside and do other recreational activities. Perhaps more important was the fact 
that their dormitories did not have locks and the grills surrounding the veranda by the 
dormitories remained open most of the day.  
</p>
<p>52. The Hill Top Juvenile Correctional Centre for boys is a closed facility. The Special 
Rapporteur received complaints of ill-treatment, although the punishment cells were 
apparently not used very frequently. The boys also went to school and were allowed to play 
sports outdoors for several hours each day, although they were not allowed to go outside 
during the weekends. 
</p>
<p>53. By contrast, St. Andrew Juvenile Remand Centre for boys was governed by a 
system of repression and regular corporal punishment. Only the boys who had been 
sentenced were allowed to go outside for specific projects, while those on remand were 
never allowed to leave the buildings, thus deprived of any recreational activities in the open 
air. The Special Rapporteur also received numerous allegations of corporal punishment, 
including beatings on the buttocks with wooden boards and being forced to kneel for 
prolonged periods of time with their hands in the air. The acting overseers admitted that 
kneeling was used as punishment. They seemed to be aware of the use of corporal 
punishment by certain warders, and although they stated that an internal investigation was 
initiated when a boy presented a complaint, they did not give the impression of taking 
serious measures to deal with the situation. At the time of the visit, four persons were 
interdicted, but their investigations had been ongoing for almost four years, with no 
concluding date in sight. 
</p>
<p>54. Also worrying was the fact that the Fort Augusta Correctional Centre for Women 
and the Horizon Remand Centre for men are adult institutions that also hold children. At 
Fort Augusta, although the girls had separate dormitories, they were not segregated from 
the women, in contravention of international human rights standards. This was also the case 
at police stations, where the Special Rapporteur expressed concern that children were held 
together with adults, as was the case at Montego Bay police station. The current practice of 
confining children in institutions equipped and staffed for adults cannot meet their special 
needs. Children should be placed in adequate, specialized facilities. 
</p>
<p><i>  Incident at the Armadale Juvenile Correctional Centre 
</i></p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur interviewed several girls who had witnessed the fire at the 
Armadale Juvenile Correctional Centre on 22 May 2009. In addition, he was provided with 
a copy of the report of the Armadale enquiry, although it has not yet been made public. The 
Commission of Enquiry was tasked with investigating the causes and consequences of the 
fire; the response of the management to the outbreak of the fire; the behaviour of the 
children detained at the institution before and during the fire; and the response of the 
emergency services and the effect these had on the origin, control and consequences of the 
fire. 
</p>
<p>56. According to the report, the Office dormitory, which was consumed by the fire, 
contained seven double-bunk beds with 14 mattresses, and measured 20 feet by 12 feet. The 
dormitory had been considered unfit for occupancy by the Property Manager for the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>Correctional Department since May 2007. Despite attempts to move some of the girls to 
other offices, 23 girls were held at the Office dormitory on 22 May. 
</p>
<p>57. In addition to the overcrowding, the girls had been in lockdown since 7 May. 
Lockdown was used as a form of collective punishment, in contravention of international 
human rights standards. The recurrent use of lockdown deprived the girls of all outdoor 
activities for extended periods. All meals were served in the dormitory, and no knives, forks 
or spoons were provided. The use of the bathroom was restricted to one hour in the 
mornings. Additionally, most classes were cancelled during lockdown. According to the 
report, new arrivals were placed in lockdown for two weeks at Armadale. 
</p>
<p>58. On the day of the fire, six girls attempted to break out by removing the grills 
covering the windows. The girls threw faeces, urine, water and other articles at the officers, 
who hit the girls with sticks to keep them inside. The supervising correctional officer then 
summoned assistance, and two police officers arrived at Armadale. One of the officers 
threw a teargas canister into the dormitory, which fell onto a bed and started the fire upon 
contact with a foam mattress. A second fire started when the smoke from the teargas 
combined with an accelerant found in the dormitory. The door of the dormitory was never 
opened, so the girls had to jump out through the front and rear windows. One of the 
correctional officers continued hitting the girls to ensure they stayed inside, despite the fact 
that the dormitory was on fire. Seven girls died as a result of the fire, and many others were 
injured. 
</p>
<p>59. The report concludes that the use of teargas was an unlawful use of force by the 
police officer, and that the dormitory door should have been promptly unlocked. In 
addition, most of the fire extinguishers were not recharged, despite continuous requests 
addressed to the Department of Correctional Services. The report recommends that 
lockdown be discontinued and that the Commissioner of Corrections and the Children&#8217;s 
Court be made aware when a facility reaches its maximum capacity so that no additional 
child is sent there. It also recommends that a board of visiting judges be appointed to 
conduct regular visits and review the facilities at juvenile correctional centres. Lastly, it 
recommends that the statements and evidence obtained by the enquiry and the final report 
be submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration on whether any 
criminal acts were committed. 
</p>
<p>60. On 2 March 2010, the Prime Minister addressed parliament on the report of the 
Armadale enquiry. He stated that, although resource constraints imposed a heavy burden on 
officers working in juvenile detention facilities, they &#8220;cannot explain or excuse negligence 
or inertia&#8221;.11 He also noted that the Correctional Services should not be responsible for 
juvenile correctional and remand facilities, because they are trained to deal with adult 
criminal offenders and not with children in conflict with the law. In this regard, he outlined 
several measures under way to address some of the problems concerning children in 
correctional facilities, including placing juvenile correctional and remand facilities under 
the Child Development Agency. Additional measures include renovating certain buildings 
and transferring certain children to ensure that children in remand are held in separate 
facilities from those under correctional orders. 
</p>
<p>61. Taking into account the conclusions of the report, as well as the interviews held with 
the girls and one official who was at Armadale on the day of the fire, the Special 
Rapporteur considers that the deaths and the physical and psychological suffering of the 
girls could have been prevented. The frequent use of lockdown, made particularly worse by 
the overcrowding and unhygienic conditions, was not conducive to the rehabilitation of the 
girls, as it created a climate of tension and frustration. Most of the girls were also not 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>15 
</b></p>
<p>receiving appropriate medical and psychiatric treatment, furthering their anxiety. In 
addition, the girls were not classified according to their cause of detention; some girls in the 
Office dormitory were there under court orders, while others were there only because they 
were in need of care and protection from the State. The Special Rapporteur expects that 
those responsible be brought to justice and held accountable. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Women 
</b></p>
<p>62. Detention facilities for women were generally more open and offered better 
conditions than those for men. There was a strict separation of male and female detainees. 
Duhaney Park Police Station for female detainees should serve as an example of 
professional and humane police lock-ups. 
</p>
<p>63. At the Fort Augusta Correctional Centre, the Special Rapporteur received credible 
allegations of excessive use of force by the authorities. Despite the fact that some of the 
cases were well known to the authorities, they did not feel responsible for initiating ex 
officio investigations or taking any other action. They justified their inaction on the grounds 
that no formal complaints had been lodged; thus, no officials were sanctioned for their acts. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Persons with mental disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>64. Persons with mental disabilities deprived of their liberty are not held in a separate 
psychiatric institution, but detained in a special wing of different correctional centres. In the 
case of the Fort Augusta Correctional Centre, female detainees with mental health problems 
were scattered amidst the other detainees. At police stations, they were held together with 
other detainees. In the St. Catherine Correctional Centre, most of the detainees with 
psychiatric illnesses interviewed were forced to sleep on a concrete floor. The lack of 
adequate medical attention and the conditions of their detention are damaging to the 
physical and mental health of these particularly vulnerable persons. Persons with mental 
disabilities, and particularly those suffering from a severe mental illness, should be placed 
in specialized, secure psychiatric institutions. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Capital and corporal punishment 
</b></p>
<p>65. No death sentence has been executed since 1988, following the judgement in the 
<i>Pratt and Morgan v. Jamaica</i> case. People are nonetheless sentenced to death; the 
sentences are then commuted to life imprisonment after several years. However, the Special 
Rapporteur was concerned about the increase in fatal shootings by the police, often 
allegedly amounting to extrajudicial executions. He was also concerned by the apparent 
lack of investigation and accountability for those responsible. During the mission, some of 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors insinuated that legal executions, now de facto 
abolished, had been replaced by extrajudicial executions, carried out by the police who took 
the law into their own hands. 
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur was informed that there were several ministerial orders 
banning corporal punishment, including in schools, which he took as a positive sign. While 
the Child Care and Protection Act prohibits the application of corporal punishment in State-
run facilities, which the Special Rapporteur notes as a positive development, it does not 
include any provisions banning corporal punishment in the domestic sphere. The Special 
Rapporteur was concerned that the use of corporal punishment appears to be deeply 
entrenched in Jamaican society. The Special Rapporteur witnessed as much at the St. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>Andrews Juvenile Remand Centre, where the use of corporal punishment on boys was 
rather frequent, as well as in detention facilities for adults. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p><b>67. The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to the Government of Jamaica 
for the excellent cooperation extended by the authorities during the course of the visit, 
which he interprets as a sign of the Government&#8217;s willingness to open up to 
independent and objective scrutiny. He also appreciates the challenges faced by the 
Government in dealing with the very high level of crime, violence and insecurity in the 
country. 
</b></p>
<p><b>68. On the basis of his discussions with public officials, judges, lawyers and 
representatives of civil society, interviews with victims of violence and with persons 
deprived of their liberty, often supported by forensic medical evidence, the Special 
Rapporteur found only isolated instances of torture in the classical sense of 
deliberately inflicting severe pain or suffering as a means of extracting a confession of 
information. However, he found a considerable number of cases where persons were 
subjected to different degrees of beatings as a form of punishment, which could 
amount to torture. In addition, the Special Rapporteur found that detainees had no 
knowledge of or trust in any complaints mechanisms available to them. 
</b></p>
<p><b>69. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur observed that the term &#8220;torture&#8221; is 
not part of the Jamaican lexicon. This may be due to the fact that, despite existing 
provisions prohibiting the excessive use of force and inhuman treatment, there is no 
definition of torture as a crime in domestic legislation. In addition, Jamaica is not 
party to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment. However, the absence of a crime of torture in the law does 
not mean that it does not exist in practice. 
</b></p>
<p><b>70. The overall conditions in police stations reflected a complete disregard for the 
dignity of detainees. Police lock-ups are designed for only very short time of detention, 
but in practice, these cells are used as pre-trial detention facilities, holding detainees 
suspected of crimes for up to four or five years in absolutely appalling conditions. 
Detention for several weeks or even months in these conditions amounts to inhuman 
and degrading treatment.  
</b></p>
<p><b>71. Although the conditions in correctional facilities were better, they still varied 
and were generally overcrowded, lacked water and sanitary facilities, as well as 
meaningful opportunities for education, work and recreation, necessary for the 
rehabilitation and re-socialization of detainees. Consistent allegations of routine 
corporal punishment were also received from facilities for adults and children. The 
conditions for women were generally better, and there was a strict separation between 
male and female detainees. The situation for persons with mental disabilities, held 
together with other detainees rather than in separate psychiatric institutions where 
they could receive adequate medical attention, was a concern. 
</b></p>
<p><b>72. With regard to children, the Special Rapporteur expressed concern over the 
fact that children in need of care and protection by the State, those deemed 
uncontrollable and those in conflict with the law were held together in detention 
facilities without distinction. Equally disturbing was the lack of a clear definition or 
criteria for the identification of an uncontrollable child, and the wide discretion </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b>afforded to the judiciary to make this decision. Another concern was the fact that 
children were held together with adults in police stations, as was the case in the 
Horizon Adult and Juvenile Correctional and Remand Centre, where boys and girls 
were held in the same facility as adults, albeit in separate sections, and in the Fort 
Augusta Adult and Juvenile Correctional Centre, where the girls were not segregated 
from the women. 
</b></p>
<p><b>73. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged by the fact that no death sentences 
have been executed since 1988. However, he expressed concern at the increasing 
number of fatal shootings by the police, often allegedly amounting to extrajudicial 
executions, as well as the apparent lack of investigation and accountability in a large 
number of these cases. 
</b></p>
<p><b>74. The Special Rapporteur was concerned about the narrow scope of offences to 
be investigated by the Independent Commission of Investigation. Only allegations of 
misconduct of a &#8220;grave and exceptional nature&#8221; are investigated by the Commission, 
leaving victims vulnerable to a subjective and discretionary interpretation of these 
terms. He therefore recommends that the Commission be equipped with sufficient 
powers and resources to investigate any form of police misconduct, including threats, 
intimidation or discrimination by the police, as well as allegations of extrajudicial 
killings, torture and other ill-treatment. In particular, all individual cases of torture 
and ill-treatment described in the appendix to the present report should be 
investigated without further delay, and the perpetrators brought to justice. 
</b></p>
<p><b>75. In recent years, the Government has undertaken several initiatives to address 
domestic and gender-based violence. However, the effectiveness of the enforcement 
mechanisms remains unclear. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to the adoption 
of the necessary amendments to the Domestic Violence Act and the entry into force of 
the Sexual Offences Act as preventive tools.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>76. In the spirit of cooperation and partnership, the Special Rapporteur makes the 
recommendations below to the Government, aimed at preventing torture and ill-
treatment and improving conditions of detention. He is assured that every effort will 
be taken to implement his recommendations and stands ready to offer his full 
cooperation and assistance in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b>77. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Issue, by the highest authorities, a public condemnation of torture and 
ill-treatment, including excessive use of police force;

<p><b>Appendix 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Places of detention visited and interviews conducted 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur conducted unannounced visits to detention facilities and was 
able to hold private interviews with detainees in all facilities he visited. If detainees did not 
wish that their interviews are recorded, the information provided is only reflected in the 
general findings of the report. Some detainees only agreed to an anonymous publication of 
their interviews. 
</p>
<p><b>  Denham Town Police Station, Kingston  
Visited on 12 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General Information 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur was received by Superintendent Arthur Brown and 
Superintendent Hugh Bish. At the time of the visit, 25 persons were in custody, including 
one convicted person. 
</p>
<p>3. The police station was equipped with two cells, one small and one large. The smaller 
cell was completely dark and the larger one had a light in the corridor. Both cells were 
extremely dirty and the air was hot and stale. Detainees could meet their lawyers in the 
entrance area of the lock-up. They could receive visits on Sundays and Wednesdays, but 
they had to speak with their visitors from behind two grills and the entrance area. Thus, the 
detainees could only communicate with their families by shouting. According to the 
detainees, wards used pepper spray within the cells very often, up to several times per 
week. The officers reported that they used pepper spray if the detainees got &#8220;boisterous&#8221; or 
if there were fights. The last time batons were used had been, according to the officers, 
months ago. 
</p>
<p>4. One of the detainees had been there since 31 July 2008. Remand facilities could 
allegedly not accommodate them, so they had to stay at the police station. Identification 
(ID) parades could in principle be done within 48 hours, but often took much longer. 
Detainees were taken before a judge only after the ID parade. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p>5. <b>Antonio Andersen</b>, (left cell) aged 25, had been arrested on 17 March 2009 at 3:45 
p.m. on the street in Kingston. Although he did not resist the arrest, the officers used heavy 
force and beat him on the head. He was taken to Kingston Rockforth Police Station where 
he was again beaten on the head and on other parts of the body. He spent the afternoon at 
that police station, before being transferred to Denham Town Police Station. At the latter, 
he was handcuffed and hit on the chest and on the head with a large book, in order to make 
him confess. Approximately three months later, an ID parade was organised. On 3 June 
2009 he was taken to court for the first time, where he was charged with kidnapping and 
raping his girlfriend. At Denham Town Police Station, the officers regularly used pepper 
spray, which they sprayed indiscriminately through the bars and into the cell. This occurred 
sometimes as often as three times per week. The police provided the detainees with food, 
but the food was raw and awful. The water provided made him sick. On Wednesdays and 
Sundays, the families could visit and bring food. However, the detainees could not talk to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>21 
</b></p>
<p>them. Only some nice officers allowed the detainees to talk with their visitors through the 
grills of two locked doors. The air in the cells was always stale and it smelled badly, 
because the toilet was also inside the cell. Sometimes they were up to 20 detainees in the 
cell. The whole place was very messy and infested with cockroaches and other insects. He 
did not see a doctor and could not afford a lawyer. The lawyer appointed by the judge did 
not come to visit him. He had been beaten a week before the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur. The officers, and in particular Officers Gilbert and Arthur Brown, often beat 
detainees with batons. The Special Rapporteur recommends that these allegations be fully 
investigated by an independent monitoring body. 
</p>
<p>6. <b>Paulo Mills</b>, (right cell) aged 25, had been detained in Denham Town Police Station 
for 21 months. In the corridor attached to the small cells, the light was switched on for 24 
hours per day. The detainees were locked into the small cells from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. At 
night, they had to urinate into a bottle, since there was no toilet in their cell. The officers 
often used pepper spray on the detainees. 
</p>
<p><b>  Horizon Adult and Juvenile Correctional Centre and Remand Centre 
Visited on 12 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General Information 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur was received by Superintendent Hector Smith and Director 
of Security Clifton Rogers. The Remand Centre had a capacity of approximately 1,000 
detainees. 605 persons were in custody at the time of the visit, including 40 convicted 
prisoners, 562 remandees and 3 women, of which two were minors. 
</p>
<p>8. On 8 February 2009, detainees had started protesting against the lack of water and 
the conditions in general. According to the Superintendent, 58 detainees were injured in the 
following unrest, three of whom were still in hospital. 17 guards were reportedly injured, 
two of them severely. 
</p>
<p>9. Access to the UN Special Rapporteur was denied.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Halfway Tree Police Station, Kingston 
Visited on 13 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur was received by Inspector Winston Brown, Custody Officer 
and Inspector Lorna Foller-Burchell (Ms). At the time of the visit 81 detainees were held in 
18 cells, with a maximum capacity of 90. 
</p>
<p>11. The police station had been cleaned up recently. The lock-up was comparably better 
lit and more spacious. However, the cells had no toilets or water inside. Toilets outside the 
cells lacked flushing water. The authorities indicated that there was a court adjoined to the 
police station, and that Resident Magistrates ordered the remand of detainees from this 
court. They furthermore stated that because of the drought in the country, the detainees did 
not get enough water, especially on the second floor. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p>12. <b>Roger Nandoo</b>, aged<b> </b>22, had to use bottles in order to urinate as he was often 
denied access to the toilet. He had been beaten in September 2009 with a hockey stick in 
the chest and was still under medication for that reason. The beatings stopped ever since </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>Mr. Brown became the new custody officer. The officer who had beaten him had been 
transferred to another facility. 
</p>
<p>13. <b>Delmor Johnson</b>, aged 46. He indicated that the police had taken off his clothes and 
shoes, and that he had been forced to stay without clothes for one month.  
</p>
<p>14. <b>Kevin Aard</b>, aged 21, had been at the police station since 15 January. He had been 
at court on 12 February. He had been beaten by members of a private security company, 
because they thought that he had robbed the girl he had been with. The security officers 
called the police who took him to the station. He had signed a paper and has pleaded guilty 
with explanation. The other detainees beat him, but the police officers tried to separate 
them. 
</p>
<p>15. <b>Cell 1</b>. There were five persons in the cell. <b>Marlon Morrison</b> indicated that 
although he had already been convicted, he was still being held at the police station. He had 
been sentenced to two years hard labour and was awaiting transfer to Richmond Farm 
Prison. He complained that he had no lawyer. The other detainees noted that legal aid 
lawyers were a guarantee that detainees went to prison. 
</p>
<p>16. <b>Cell 3</b>. There were five persons in the cells, and they complained about lice in the 
cells. 
</p>
<p>17. <b>Cell 4</b>. There were three persons in the cell. They complained about the concrete 
beds, the lack of and the quality of the food, as well as the lack of water. They had all been 
held there between two to three weeks without seeing a judge.  
</p>
<p>18. <b>Dale Staurus, Mr. Rambaram, Mr. Calvin and Walter Mitchell, cell 6</b>. There 
were five people in the cell, and they noted that they had not received food that day. They 
also complained about the bad medical situation and the lack of medication. One of the 
detainees was an asthma patient, who indicated that he was not always given his 
medication. There were lice under the beds, although the detainees indicated that the station 
had been &#8220;done up recently&#8221;, including fumigation and cleaning. They could receive 
visitors three times per week, but they could only see them once per week, and they had to 
talk through the grills. One of the detainees had been there for five weeks without seeing a 
judge. The detainees did not complain about physical abuse, but noted that they are not 
always allowed to use the bathroom, forcing them to urinate in plastic bottles. Mr. 
Rambaram had not been assaulted, but he had seen other people being beaten. He indicated 
that the cell had been severely overcrowded, but that some detainees were removed the 
prior week. In addition, the cells were fumigated and the bathroom cleaned. They had not 
had any water for two or three days. If he behaved well, he would receive good treatment 
from the officers.  
</p>
<p><b>  Constant Spring Police Station 
Visited on 13 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur was received by Superintendant Altimoth Campbell and 
Inspector Miller. At the time of the visit there were 30 persons in custody; the capacity of 
the lock-up was 20.  
</p>
<p>20. The conditions of detention were extremely bad and the cells were overcrowded. 
One of the cells, which had been previously used as a punishment cell, but which was now 
used as an ordinary cell due to the overcrowding, was in complete darkness. There were no 
toilets or water in the cells. The detention registers were not properly kept; according to the 
register, women and children had been detained in the police station. Some detainees had </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>23 
</b></p>
<p>already been convicted but were sent back to the police station by the judge. For the police 
officers it seemed to be too cumbersome to take a detainee from the remand centre to court, 
so they were kept in police lock-ups, which were closer to the courts. If somebody 
complained of abuse, the officers reportedly advised them of their rights and took them to 
the doctor. However, according to the officers, there had been no complaints within the last 
two months. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p>21. <b>Aldy Cameron</b>, aged 35, had been detained on 9 December 2009. At 3:45 a.m., he 
had heard a shot fired outside his home. Approximately 30 police officers kicked open the 
door and proceeded to detain him. His girlfriend had also been detained, but had since been 
released. Upon arrest, he was shackled and beaten. His girlfriend was also beaten and had a 
miscarriage as a result. Upon arrival at the mobile reserve police post, his clothes were 
removed. He was beaten with a baton; a cattle-prod was used on his testicles, stomach and 
neck; and water was thrown at him. This took place for about 45 minutes, as the officers 
questioned him about a past robbery and possible future robberies. He was held there for 
eight hours, and then transferred to Constant Spring Police Station, where he had not been 
interrogated or beaten. Upon arrival at Constant Spring, he complained to the officer in 
charge about the ill-treatment, but was not taken to the hospital. He had not been presented 
before a judge, as he was waiting for an ID parade. With regard to the conditions of 
detention, he noted that there were seven persons in his cell, that it was hot, that there was 
only proper drinking water at certain times, and that he had to ask an officer to use the 
toilet. He indicated that the detainees had been told that &#8220;some people were coming&#8221;, and 
thus the cells were much cleaner than usual. Concerning the guards, he stated that they were 
police officers and that no one was beaten. He had been visited by a lawyer, but they met in 
an office with a police officer present. Finally, he complained about the lack of fresh air, 
and the fact that they had to spend most of their time inside the cells. 
</p>
<p>22. <b>Fitzroy Matthias</b>, aged 30, had been arrested on 28 December 2009, was taken to 
Spanish Town and later to Constant Spring. At the time of the arrest, 12 jeeps stopped his 
car, and several officers threatened to kill him, but the superintendent stopped them. He was 
handcuffed, but not shackled. He added that his lawyer had been present during the 
interrogation, but complained that he could not see his family when they visited him. 
Remandees were normally forced to sign their statements. He had been before a judge on 
two occasions. He complained about the lack of electricity in his cell, which was the 
smallest at the station, and the fact that he had to call an officer to go to the bathroom. He 
was examined by a doctor upon a judge&#8217;s order, but the examination took place in the 
presence of a police inspector. He had been first arrested in 1998, and had spent two years 
in remand custody. At the time, he was beaten by a police officer at Spanish Town in order 
to obtain the name of the person who had committed the crime. He had been arrested 
several times afterwards, but did not remember any other beatings. 
</p>
<p>23. <b>Leon Edith</b>, aged 30, had been arrested in August 2009 by a sergeant and brought to 
Constant Spring. Upon his arrest, the police tried to make him run away to shoot him but he 
did not leave. He had been handcuffed to a bar in a room and interrogated by four officers 
(among which one was from the Murder Investigation Team (MIT)) who beat him on the 
ears with their hands, and on the body with batons. He was punched in the stomach and on 
the chest by an officer with a small baton as he refused to sign a paper. One officer took 
pictures. After he had been on ID parade he was again forced to sign a paper, but he 
refused. He was harassed two more times for that purpose and beaten on the ears. He did 
not complain to the judge when he met him in September, since the police would deny it. 
He also thought there was no reason to talk to the Public Defender. At the tribunal, the main 
witness was also the police officer who arrested him. He was going to go to court again the 
following Monday. Concerning the conditions, he complained that the inmates only had 20 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>to 30 minutes to shower. There were seven people in his cell, but at times there were up to 
nine. They could not use the toilets often enough, and their requests were often ignored. 
</p>
<p>24. <b>Hughlande Graham</b>, aged 29, had spent the last 24 hours handcuffed to a bar, after 
being arrested for allegedly robbery, and was waiting for an ID parade. He had wounded on 
the right hand that reached his bone and was in urgent need of medical care, but had not 
seen any doctor yet. 
</p>
<p>25. <b>Oswald Walters</b>, aged 35, had worked for a truck company and slept on the 
premises because it was too dangerous to travel back to his neighbourhood due to a gang 
war. On 9 December 2009, he voluntarily went to Constant Spring Police Station to give a 
testimony but was locked up instead. He also saw his employer give money to the police 
two weeks later and was told by the police that he had allegedly stolen a truck. He was 
remanded by the judge but had no lawyer or legal aid because he thought they were useless. 
He suffered from a hernia and was operated on in the hospital during his detention at the 
police station. Medication was prescribed to him but he had not received it yet. He had been 
beaten on his ribs, abdomen, toes and knee when he resisted going into the cell. On another 
occasion, he had been beaten with batons by two officers. There were five people in his 
cell, and the police wanted to transfer him to Tavern Police Station due to the 
overcrowding. However, he would have had to sleep on the floor, which was bad for his 
asthma, and so he refused. When his family brought food, he could not see them or talk to 
them, and the police would take some of it. 
</p>
<p><b>  Horizon Adult and Juvenile Correctional Centre and Remand Centre 
Visited on 14 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur was received by Superintendent Hector Smith. The Remand 
Centre has a capacity of approximately 1,000 detainees. 609 persons were in custody at the 
time of the visit, including 40 convicted prisoners, 566 remandees and 3 women, of which 
two were minors. 
</p>
<p>27. Although the conditions of detention were better than in police custody, they were 
still quite harsh. The management seemed to be unable to deal with the detainees. Beatings 
by prison guards and police were reported to be routine practice. There were no recreational 
facilities, and the remand detainees and convicted prisoners spent most of the time in their 
cells, i.e. on concrete bunks without mattresses, sheets or blankets. The cells were equipped 
with a steel toilet and running water, which only worked occasionally. There was a general 
feeling of arbitrariness from the side of the guards, and detainees complained generally that 
the rules were not known to them, and that they often changed. Each building had 4 
Security Posts (SP) per floor. Each SP had 6 cells of 8 detainees each.  
</p>
<p><i>  Disturbances on 8 February 2010 
</i></p>
<p>28. As a result of the unrest, 70 people had been injured; all of them had seen a doctor. 
35 of them had been taken to the Kingston Public Hospital; 15 were admitted and 20 were 
treated and sent back to Horizon. However, no officers had been hospitalized since none 
were seriously injured. There was an ongoing police investigation. The Superintendent 
informed the Special Rapporteur that nine posts had been damaged and that the damaged 
section had not yet been repaired. There were two blocks for adults and one for females and 
juveniles. According to Superintendant Smith, the unrest had started when 24 detainees, 
who were outside their cells, released the other detainees in SP18. The Special Rapporteur 
interviewed both correctional officers and detainees who were injured during the 
disturbances, some of them in the Medical Wing of Horizon Remand Centre and others in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>25 
</b></p>
<p>the Hospital of Tower Street Correctional Institution (see below). He strongly urges the 
Government of Jamaica to conduct a thorough investigation into all complaints documented 
in this report and to bring the perpetrators to justice. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Correctional officers 
</i></p>
<p>29. <b>Damian Lawrence</b>, aged 23, correctional officer injured during the riot. He was a 
member of the patrol team, so when the riot started he was outside when he heard the 
whistle blowing. He saw the fire, numerous officers and most of the inmates out of their 
cells. The firemen arrived and since he had a shield and a baton he went inside with them. 
An inmate threw a security camera at him from the second floor. He fell down and had a 
blackout. The inmates were also throwing liquids and other objects. In the front, there were 
too many officers and the fire was too strong for inmates to escape, so they had to exit from 
the back, still throwing improvised weapons. He hit quite a few inmates and went to the top 
floor, where inmates were trying to access the roof to escape, but when he was hit by a 
piece of concrete on his knee, he decided to leave and go to the doctor. In SP 18, where the 
unrest started, a lot of contraband (marijuana, knives, cell phones, etc.) was circulating. 
Incidents of this type were very rare. He thought that the water shortage might have led to 
the riot. The inmates complained that they were not getting enough water for the showers. 
The water was brought by trucks and was used both for showers and drinking, but the 
trucks were not as frequent and the only water left was for drinking. 
</p>
<p>30. <b>Mickloth Hutchinson</b>, correctional officer, had been working in the section 
concerned on the day of the unrest. He had been hit on the back once by an unidentified 
object and fell, but was able to get up again immediately. He felt pain and had received 
painkillers. The doctor who came to the remand centre after the unrest was very busy with 
all the other severely injured persons. He had suffered a minor scratch on the back, which 
he did not want to show to the forensic expert. He was back at work the next day. He did 
not know what hit him in the back, or who threw the object. He was not aware of any 
investigations and wanted to leave this to the responsible authorities. The unrest was 
triggered by newly-applied tighter security rules that were in force for approximately one 
month. According to these rules, the supply of marijuana and the use of cell phones were 
strictly prohibited. After some of the detainees had started to riot, he had gone downstairs to 
get his riot shield and headgear. Additionally, the Jamaica Defence Force was called in for 
support. 12 police officers and 10 soldiers were deployed inside the cell area; others 
guarded the outside area. Detainees had to be restrained through the use of shields and 
batons. The unrest lasted for 30 to 45 minutes. The detainees had lit a fire, which was 
extinguished by fire fighters. No teargas or pepper spray had been used. When he reached 
the scene, some of the detainees had apparently been injured by other detainees because 
they had refused to participate in the unrest. One of his colleagues had received a blow to 
his eye and was on sick leave for 14 days. 
</p>
<p><i>  Medical wing  
</i></p>
<p>31. Those detainees who had serious injuries had been transferred to the Kingston 
Public Hospital or to the two prison hospitals at St. Catherine and Tower Street prisons. 
Adults and juveniles were held together in the Medical Wing, but not women. 
</p>
<p>32. <b>Raymond Morgan</b>, aged<b> </b>51, had already been detained in the medical wing when 
the disturbances happened and described them as an outsider. He had been arrested on 20 
June 2009 and held in Kingston Central Police Station until 13 August 2009, when he was 
moved to Horizon. He had not been subjected to any physical abuse. He described the 
general conditions at Horizon as continually deteriorating and the Superintendent as </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>26</b> 
</p>
<p>incompetent for a managerial post (&#8220;he was a tailor before and has no education for this 
job&#8221;). Three weeks before the disturbances he had written a long letter of complaint to the 
Superintendent but had not received any answer. The main problems were disrespect for the 
detainees and arbitrary actions by prison warders. The rules of the prison were not clear and 
their application was arbitrary; corruption was also a problem, including the running of the 
tuck shop. Drugs were brought in by the prison staff. The detainees could receive one visit 
per week for only two to three minutes. Since 13 August 2009, he had only been outside the 
building twice. Detainees were not provided with anything to read or any recreational 
activities. Three weeks earlier, some juveniles had been beaten. Because more and more 
searches were conducted by the wards in the last weeks, the situation had become tense. 
During the last weeks there had been a genuine food and water crisis which led to the 
disturbances.    
</p>
<p>33. <b>Denver Pink</b>, aged 36, had been arrested on 5 June 2009 and held at Constant 
Spring Police Station until the end of July, where he had been beaten. The warders had 
flooded the cells and used tear gas against the detainees. In August 2009 he had been 
transferred to the Portmore (100 Man) Police Station, where conditions were worse than at 
Constant Spring, because there was no toilet or water in the cells. At the end of August or 
beginning of September 2009, he had been transferred to Horizon, which he described as 
the worst place. The decision whether or not to move a detainee to the remand centre was 
made by the police and involved corruption. Detainees were regularly beaten and received 
no proper medical treatment. Since he had become sick with a hernia and gall bladder 
problems, he received a ticket for a special diet, but he did not receive proper food. The 
hygienic conditions were terrible: lice and cockroaches infested the cells, detainees could 
not flush the toilet and had to urinate in bottles; they could not wash the dishes, which were 
covered with bugs; and the dirt and smell were unbearable. Because of the water shortage, 
there had been no water at all on Sunday or on Monday morning. When the water arrived at 
4 p.m., many detainees were let out of their cells to fetch water, and it became clear that 
there would not be enough water for all. He had been in his locked cell at SP 21 (top floor), 
one floor above the fire. The police came into the cell, dragged him out and beat him with 
iron bars on his legs, head and nose. His nose had been fractured. While he tried to run 
away, he heard a gunshot being fired. He had been further beaten and had lost 
consciousness. He woke up at the hospital at 8 p.m. The findings of the forensic expert of 
the Special Rapporteur corroborated his allegations of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>34. <b>Norval Cunnings</b>, aged 25, indicated that on the day of the riot the detainees had 
been without water for four days. They started shaking the grills and the guards said that 
they would discipline them. He had been beaten by six guards with a baton in his cell. 
Although another detainee had broken the lock to his cell, he had stayed inside and told his 
cellmates to stay inside; otherwise the warders would restrain them. Several soldiers and 
police approached his cell and told him to come outside. When he refused, he was beaten 
with guns and iron pipes. He tried to hold on to the leg table with his left hand while 
protecting his head with his right arm, but was dragged outside while the police continued 
beating him. Once dragged outside his cell, he tried to run away but was once again beaten, 
including by a warder known as &#8220;Busthead&#8221;. He was beaten with an iron pipe on his hips, 
back, ribcage and his legs were held apart while another guard beat him once on his 
testicles. In addition, he was beaten on his chest with a flat metal bar. He was also 
threatened and told that &#8220;he must die&#8221;. He noted that he heard shots, but did not see who 
had fired them or if someone had been hurt. He was taken to the medical center by other 
inmates, and later to the hospital, where he was informed that he had a broken arm and two 
broken ribs. He was also given pain medication for his testicles. He had several other 
injuries on his body, including stitches on his head, an open wound on his leg and several 
marks on his head, neck and chest. One of the warders, Officer Sterling, saw him at the 
medical unit and pretended to be surprised that he was still alive. Two days later, he went </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>27 
</b></p>
<p>back to check on him, and threatened him once more. Officer Sterling usually assaulted the 
detainees once they were back from court and during searches. He had not been informed 
about the possibility of lodging a complaint for ill-treatment. With regard to the conditions 
of detention, he noted that the food was not prepared properly and that there were 
cockroaches in it sometimes. The findings of the forensic expert of the Special Rapporteur 
strongly corroborated the allegations of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>35. <b>Marvin Wilson</b>, aged 25, had been a jailer and was outside his cell getting water 
when the unrest started. The detainees began throwing stones and other debris, so he went 
back to his cell. The warders tried to calm down the detainees, and left when they realized 
they could not. A short while after, approximately 100 people came in, including the 
warders, soldiers and police with iron pipes and guns. He did not see anyone being shot, but 
heard shots being fired. During the disturbance, the officers warned the detainees that if 
they caught someone with a &#8220;jammer&#8221; they would kill them. The police came into his cell 
and used the iron pipes to beat him all over his body. He was beaten on the face with a 
baton by an officer called &#8220;Busthead&#8221;. He fell on his back and tried to shield himself with 
his arms and legs. He pretended to be dead when the beating was severe, but he was taken 
out of his cell by the police, where they continued to beat him. He lost consciousness and 
woke up outside the medical wing later that night. The doctor indicated to him that he had 
to go to the hospital. He was taken to the hospital, where he was told that his finger and arm 
were broken. He also received stitches on his elbow. A few days after the riot, he was 
interviewed by two women who were carrying out an investigation on behalf of the 
Commissioner of Corrections. Apart from the riot, he had not been beaten nor had any 
trouble in the ten months that he had been detained at Horizon Remand Centre. The 
findings of the forensic expert of the Special Rapporteur corroborated the allegations of ill-
treatment. 
</p>
<p>36. <b>S.H.</b>, aged 30, suffered fits since he had been beaten on the head by a police officer 
on 25 October 2009. He was driving as a passenger in a car, when a police vehicle stopped 
them. A police officer ordered the three persons in the car to get out and made them lie on 
the ground facing the police car. He searched their car and claimed that he had found a gun 
inside. S.H. was taken to the Guanaboa Vale Police Station, where four police officers beat 
him. The officers hit him on the head with batons and a hard book. One officer grabbed and 
pressed his throat in order to stop the airflow. Eventually, he fainted. During the beating his 
hands were tightly cuffed on the back. He had marks from the handcuffs and bruises from 
falling on the floor. He was then taken to the hospital in Spanish Town, where he received 
stitches on the right eyebrow. The doctor told him that he was suffering from brain damage 
which caused fits. He had never had any fits before the beating. He underwent a number of 
tests and was given five different pills. Ever since, he had problems remembering things. 
After being released from the hospital he was taken back to the police station, where he fell 
on three occasions and had fits. He was taken to court for the first time the week before the 
visit of the Special Rapporteur. Afterwards he was transferred to the remand centre, where 
he once again suffered from fits and lost consciousness. He was hospitalized once again for 
three days. He had chest pains due to the medication, and could not sleep, so he was given 
sleeping pills. He felt that the authorities had been hiding him from the judge. When he was 
at court, the same officer who had hit him on the head was also present. The officer 
threatened him not to tell the judge that he had beaten him, otherwise he would get in 
trouble. He did not have a chance to speak to the judge and had not seen a lawyer. Since his 
arrival in the remand centre he had been in the medical unit. Although the officers did not 
beat the detainees in the medical unit, they often ignored his requests for assistance. He was 
not seen by a doctor at the remand centre and was still taking the medication he had 
received at Spanish Town Hospital. 
</p>
<p>37. <b>Dennis Beagle</b>, aged 39, heard gunshots in the remand centre on Monday morning, 
8 February 2010. He witnessed police officers and soldiers running around on the second </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>floor of SP 19 with guns, bars, riot shields and batons in their hands. Some of the detainees 
had been outside of their cells in order to get water. They were making a lot of noise 
because of the lack of water and the food. In the days before the disturbance, the detainees 
had received only one bucket of water for each cell. There was no water that day, and the 
stench from the toilets had become unbearable. The food, which should be distributed three 
times per day, came once at 4 p.m. The detainees who were outside their cells started 
shouting and cursing at the warders, and refused to get back to their cells. The warders then 
started to beat them. The warders and soldiers forced open the locks on the cells and 
ordered the rest of the detainees out, but he refused to come out. Officers Darkins, Facey 
and an officer called &#8220;Busthead&#8221; came into his cell and hit him and two cellmates with iron 
water pipes, long sticks and batons, while the soldiers stood outside of the cells pointing 
guns at them. However, they still refused to leave their cells. He was beaten for 
approximately one minute on the right shoulder, the left elbow and the left knee. The object 
he was hit with on the knee was a tall, round, hollow iron pipe. The iron pipe had caused a 
hole in his knee. When he fell to his knees, he was beaten on the arm and shoulder with a 
long, round wooden stick, with a diameter of approximately 7 cm. and over one meter in 
length. Officer Facey hit him on the head with an iron pipe and he fainted. He woke up in 
the public hospital at night with a nosebleed. There was a lot of blood on him. Since there 
were so many injured detainees at hospital, he was not properly treated and was sent back 
the very same evening. He received stitches on his knee and on his head. All of his 
belongings were destroyed and his clothes were soaked with blood and water. Officer 
Darkins came to the medical unit at Horizon, and asked if he was dead yet. He reported 
Officer Darkins to the Commissioner of Corrections, who removed him from the medical 
unit. Some people came to question the detainees the day before the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur and asked them why they had smashed the place. They did not explain who 
they were and talked to the detainees individually. He was certain that the warders would 
continue to abuse the detainees, as they had been beaten often before the unrest. He had 
been beaten three times since he came to the remand centre in early 2004. Sometimes he 
was taken to court, and although he had a legal aid lawyer, he did not see him often. 
Detainees had no access to telephones. Sometimes he could see his family through a glass. 
His family brought him food and other things, which were often stolen. The warders sold 
marijuana and mobile phones to the detainees. He had not seen the Public Defender. All the 
warders who were involved in the beatings during the unrest were still on duty. 
</p>
<p><i>  Women&#8217;s Section 
</i></p>
<p>38. There were two girls downstairs in the women&#8217;s sector for being &#8220;uncontrollable&#8221;, 
and a British woman at the first floor awaiting deportation. The facilities were fairly 
spacious and had a door leading to the open air with some space to walk or do exercise 
outside.  
</p>
<p>39. In the section for boys, 28 boys were held in eight cells. The boys stated that they 
could go out of their cells into the main area from 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 1:00 to 
3:30 p.m. In addition, they were sometimes allowed to play football outside. 
</p>
<p>40. <b>T. M.</b>, aged 15, was arrested on the street in February 2007 after running away from 
the children&#8217;s home, and had spent three days at a police station in Kingston. She had 
received a three-year sentence for &#8220;uncontrollable&#8221; behaviour by the Family Court, which 
she had to complete at Horizon. The last time she had been beaten was on 25 October 2009. 
She was normally beaten when she refused to go back to her cell. She could mix with adult 
women, but not with men or boys. Her father was dead and her mother had left for England, 
although her aunt and grandmother visited her every Saturday. She could only see them for 
about five minutes. At the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur she and P.F. were 
locked down and could not leave their cells or go outside to the fresh air. They watched TV 
all day and night, with the volume fully on. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3

</b></p>
<p>41. <b>P.F.</b>, aged 17, had no family and had spent most of her life in children&#8217;s homes and 
places of safety. In May 2006, she arrived at Horizon and should have been released in May 
2009, but nobody wanted to take her. She hoped to find a foster family or someone else to 
take her before she reached the age of 18, at which age she would have to be released and 
would end up on the streets. She was used to living alone and preferred that to sharing a cell 
with T.M. She had been beaten with iron sticks and belts. She felt like a dog. She had been 
previously detained at Armadale, where the conditions were better than at Horizon. 
</p>
<p>42. A<b> detainee</b>, aged 37, British citizen, had been arrested at the airport for smuggling 
drugs. She had been serving her sentence at Fort Augusta between 12 June 2009 and 23 
January 2010, and had been transferred to Horizon to await her deportation to the United 
Kingdom. She complained about the quality of the food and the lack of activities. She had 
to spend 20 hours a day in her cell which was equipped with a toilet and water. She was not 
allowed to do exercise outside in the fresh air. She complained that the TV was on all the 
time, with loud volume, but that there was no remote to stop it. 
</p>
<p><i>  Juveniles Section (boys) 
</i></p>
<p>43. <b>J.W.</b>, aged 17, had been detained at the remand centre for approximately one year. 
He had been arrested on 3 December 2008 and was taken to Half Way Tree Police Station, 
where he was detained for approximately five months. He had been forced to rob somebody 
by three men at gunpoint. He was caught by private security officers, who had hit him on 
the back. The police then took him to Half Way Tree Police Station. On the way to the 
station the police officers said that they would kill him and throw his body away. At the 
police station, he tried to explain that he had been forced to rob the person, but the police 
officers punched, kicked and hit him with batons in order to make him confess. He received 
two electric shocks with a device that looked like a pistol emitting electricity. He was 
sitting with his hands cuffed behind his back and his feet tied to the chair and could feel the 
electricity throughout his body. He saw twinkling stars, just like when receiving a blow. A 
police officer hit him in the face and told him not to faint. His hand was placed on the 
horizontal part of the grill and an officer slammed down an iron bar on it. The name of one 
of the police officers was Officer Rose. The warders at the remand centre also beat the 
inmates. When the warders were in a bad mood, they took it out on the detainees and 
abused them. He had been beaten a number of times by different warders. In January 2009, 
he had been beaten on the head by Officer Shango for not hurrying up when leaving the 
washing facilities; he bore a 5-6 cm. long scar on his scalp. The second scar on his head (3 
cm.) was caused by Officer &#8220;Busthead&#8221;. On his right arm he was hit by Officer Hutchinson 
with a baton, which left a scar of 5 x 3 cm. In addition, he had a scar on his knee from 
falling on the floor when a warder swung his baton at him. After the unrest, the warders let 
out their anger on the juvenile detainees. Last time he had been beaten was the day of the 
disturbance. The warders tried to get the detainees out of the cells; if the detainees refused 
to come out, the warders would go in. Everybody at the remand centre got beaten from time 
to time. One could in principle complain to the Superintendent but would later be punished 
by the warders for complaining. He was afraid that he would also be punished by the 
warders for speaking to the Special Rapporteur on Torture. He did not receive any visits, 
and his father only came to the court hearings. No classes were held for the juveniles. He 
also complained that the food was infested with cockroaches. Every Thursday, the juveniles 
could go out and play football. A psychologist came to see him and gave him medication, 
but he did not take it. Often he felt like hanging himself. 
</p>
<p><i>  Maximum security sections  
</i></p>
<p>44. SP 7 and SP 11 were under the control of the Jamaican Defense Force. The 
Superintendant had no authority over these sections. The military officers in charge seemed </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>30</b> 
</p>
<p>to be more professional and better trained than the correctional officers. All prisoners were 
in solitary confinement. The corridor and the cells of SP 7 were fairly clean.  
</p>
<p>45. <b>SP 7</b> housed four high level convicted prisoners, including a member of the military.  
</p>
<p>46. <b>Kevin Tindale</b>, aged 34, was arrested on 12 February 2005 in Montego Bay by 
officers of the Kingfish Unit. He was held for about one month at Hunts Bay Police Station 
in Kingston, where he was subjected to beatings and put on an ID Parade. He was convicted 
on various counts and sentenced to 30 years imprisonment. Since March 2005, he had been 
held at Horizon SP 7. The detainees could receive visitors once a week, were confined to 
single cells, could take a daily 10-minute shower and had no TV in their cells. He 
complained about the quality of the food, the lack of rehabilitation measures and beatings 
by the soldiers. 
</p>
<p>47. <b>Donald &#8220;Zeeks&#8221; Phipps</b>, aged around 50, was a very well-known former gang 
leader and Matthews Lane strongman. He had no particular complaints about the conditions 
at Horizon. 
</p>
<p>48. <b>Eldon Calvert</b>, aged 25, had been arrested on 21 January 2008 during a joint 
operation and was scheduled to attend Court in April 2010. He explained that the conditions 
in SP7 and SP11 under the Jamaican Defense Force were very harsh. The detainees 
underwent searches several times per night, sometimes every two hours, where they were 
completely naked, with bright lights on. They could receive visits on Thursdays, but the 
military was always present and listened to their conversations. They were in complete 
isolation and could not talk to the other detainees in the section. They did not have TVs or 
games and were locked down 23 hours a day. 
</p>
<p>49. <b>SP 11 </b>was less clean because the three detainees had protested against their 
conditions by destroying their mattresses and throwing them out in the corridor together 
with other items. There were three high level convicted prisoners. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>Jeff Campbell Yunadale</b>, aged 28, had been detained in a solitary cell at Horizon 
since June 2005; he was awaiting release in 2013. He had been convicted in 2007. The 
inmates of the two high-security sectors were allowed to play football once a week. There 
had been a water shortage, so he could not shower every day. His visits had been suspended 
for one month in January, without any apparent reason. He was allowed to receive 2,000 
Jamaican dollars every month to buy products in the shop. 
</p>
<p>51. <b>Oraine Baldie</b>, aged 34, had been detained in the remand centre for two years. He 
was moved by the soldiers from one cell to another every night in order to harass him. Each 
night, the soldiers turned on the lights in his cell and woke him up. The soldiers regularly 
searched his cell, including at night, and beat and kicked him around. Three weeks before 
the interview, a soldier had claimed that he could smell marijuana. Four soldiers searched 
into his cell and kicked him through so that he hit his thigh on the concrete. He displayed a 
large bruise on his thigh. The soldiers had batons but did not use them. In fact, the soldiers 
sold marijuana and cell phones within the detention facilities. On 7 February 2010, he did 
not receive any food. The next day, he got food, but then again no food was provided. On 
10 February a sergeant told him that the boss had ordered that the high security detainees 
should not get any food or water. He only received food again on the 13th. In protest over 
the lack of water and food the three detainees in the wing had started to throw rubbish and 
faeces into the corridor. The whole cell was infested with cockroaches that crawled into his 
ears while he was sleeping. About one year before, he had been assaulted by a soldier who 
beat him simultaneously with both hands on the ears. He still did not receive any drinking 
water and his bible was taken away from him. He could go out of his cell once a day for 
five minutes in order to take a shower. </p>

<p>52. <b>Joel Andam</b> was serving two 20 year sentences and would be eligible for parole 
after 20 years. He had been in a single cell at Horizon since 26 May 2004. He was locked 
up all day, except for a daily ten-minute shower. He added that he had only been outside on 
a few occasions. He had been in the same cell since August 2009, and he complained that it 
was too hot because it was right underneath the roof. His cell was infested with 
cockroaches. He showed a document to the Special Rapporteur indicating that he had been 
beaten. The detainees in his floor had been protesting against the 23-hour lockup since 7 
February. On 10 and 11 February, they were not given food or water, and they were not 
allowed to shower because they refused to clean up the trash and faeces they had thrown on 
the corridor as a sign of protest. They were given water on 12 February, and were given 
food and allowed to shower on the 13th. He complained that there were no fixed rules and 
that the treatment depended on the mood of the staff. He could receive visits on Thursdays 
for 15 minutes. In the past, it was possible to buy food from the tuck shop, but recently he 
could only do so three times per week. He was able to communicate with other prisoners 
because the corridor in front of his cell opened onto the cells below. 
</p>
<p><b>  Crossroads Police Station 
Visited on 15 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur was received by Sergeant Lascelles Faulder. According to 
the officer on duty, the lock-up at the police station had been closed since 2007. There was 
only one chair with handcuffs at the reception area, where detainees were held until they 
were transferred to Halfway Tree Police Station. In addition, there were handcuffs attached 
to the handrail of the outside staircase. The Special Rapporteur assumed that persons were 
also kept sitting on the stairs while being handcuffed to the handrail. There were two cells 
in the back yard, which according to the officer were no longer used because they were not 
suitable for detainees, mainly due to poor ventilation. The police station was not on the list 
of lock-ups provided to the Special Rapporteur on Torture by the Ministry of National 
Security. A man who had been working for many years at the police station told the Special 
Rapporteur that sometimes the police still kept detainees in the lock-ups for short periods. 
The last time somebody had been detained was around Christmas 2009. The Special 
Rapporteur could smell recent urine in one of the cells although there was a well-
functioning toilet just next to the lock-up. The Special Rapporteur concluded that the cells 
were still used sometimes, though illegally. There were no custody records available. 
</p>
<p><b>  Kingston Central Police Station 
Visited on 15 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur was received by Superintendent Cornel Messam, Inspector 
Juliette Row, Sub-Officer in Charge, Inspector Francis and Inspector H. Cunnings. At the 
time of the visit, 159 male detainees, including 3 juveniles, were held in cells on two levels. 
The police station had a capacity of 176 inmates. 
</p>
<p>55. The juveniles were held downstairs in four cells, separate from the main building. 
The detainees upstairs were held for minor misdemeanours, while those downstairs were 
persons suspected of more serious crimes. None of the cells had light and the ventilation 
was poor. The conditions of detention were worse on the ground floor. There was a 
punishment or &#8220;dom&#8221; cell on each floor. There were showers and toilets outside the cells on 
both floors. Detainees told the Special Rapporteur that the lock-up was cleaned just before </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>the visit. However, the Special Rapporteur still witnessed rats and other vermin within the 
lock-up. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>A detainee</b> had been arrested one month before the visit of the Special Rapporteur. 
He had been locked in the cell and had no legal assistance. He complained about being in 
the cell all day. He was only allowed outside once per day to shower, and had to be taken to 
the toilet by an officer. He also complained about the quality of the food. His father visited 
him, but they could not touch each other. He did not report any beatings. 
</p>
<p>57. <b>Marlon Clarke</b>, aged 28. On 8 January 2010, he was walking in the streets when he 
heard an explosion and noticed he could no longer feel his foot. He did not know who shot 
him, but was sure it had not been the police. He was taken to the hospital by a taxi driver. 
He was then arrested in the hospital and taken to Central Police Station on 13 January. That 
day was also the last time he saw a doctor. He was prescribed pills and painkillers, but had 
already used them all a week ago; the pain was so strong that he could not sleep at night. 
He had asked for an appointment with the doctor but this request has been ignored. 
</p>
<p>58. <b>Andr&#233; Francis</b>, aged 19, had been arrested in the parking lot of a church by four 
female and a male officer on 13 February 2010. He was searched and they found marijuana 
in his ear. One of the women questioned him about his age and address. Since his replies 
seemed to be wrong, the man beat him on the chest more than five times. He was taken to 
the Central Police Station and had not been asked anything about the drugs yet. His family 
visited him the day before the interview and brought him water. He had no lawyer and 
expected to go to court a few days later. The cell doors remained open all the time since he 
arrived so he could use the toilets at night. Before that, the juveniles used to be locked 
inside the whole day. 
</p>
<p>59. <b>A detainee</b>, aged 48, had been arrested in October 2008 by the Kingfish police and 
brought to Central Police Station. His father used to sell marijuana, but they arrested him 
instead of his father. He was hit on the throat by two police officers. Later he was 
interrogated at Kingfish for over an hour by the same officers. They called him a liar, 
became angry, and threatened to beat him. He was then taken back to Central Police 
Station, where he was interrogated once in an office. In April 2009, he had to be operated 
on due to a hernia at Kingston Public Hospital.  
</p>
<p>60. <b>Dalton Reid</b>, aged 39, had been arrested in 2005 and taken to Tower Street General 
Penitentiary until 10 February 2010, when he was taken to Central Police Station. He was 
not allowed to see a doctor because he was serving a life sentence. He fainted once but was 
not taken to the hospital and was told to sit on a bench for an hour. He would rather go back 
to Tower Street, where inmates were treated better. There were five detainees in his cell; he 
had to sleep on concrete and suffered from the lack of air. He found the guards ignorant and 
sometimes violent. Detainees usually woke up at 4 a.m. to wash their face; then they 
received tea and had to go back to the cells until their food came. He knew that the 
marijuana in Central Police Station did not come from the family or other visitors, who 
only brought food. 
</p>
<p>61. <b>H.F.</b>, aged 17, was arrested on 31 December 2009 at his home. He was taken to Port 
Royal Police Station and was accused of having sex with his 15-year-old girlfriend. He had 
to share a cell with eight adults. When one of them tried to light a fire in the cell, the police 
officers sprayed teargas and pepper spray into the cell. All the detainees were beaten with 
batons on the feet while handcuffed on a chair, as a form of collective punishment. 
However, the general treatment in Port Royal Police Station was better than in Central 
Police Station. He had been to court four times and the judge decided that he should be 
transferred to Central Police Station. The officers in Central Police Station ignored the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>33 
</b></p>
<p>detainees when they were shouting for them. A fat police officer had slapped him in the 
face once when he was shouting to be taken to the toilet. In addition, the officer raised his 
baton and threatened to beat him. He did not eat meat but the officers kept bringing him 
meat. They told him that he had to eat the food before he could receive visits. Food was 
provided three times per day. At 4 a.m. each day the detainees had to get up to take a 
shower. In general, he felt that the officers in Central Police Station did not treat the 
detainees correctly. He had to share a cell with a mentally unstable elderly man for about 
three weeks. He had shared a cell with two adult males in Central Police Station. His family 
had not been informed that he had been transferred from Port Royal to Central Police 
Station. His next court hearing was scheduled for 3 March; his parents and lawyer usually 
went with him to court. During the interview, he pointed out a rat that was running along 
the corridor. 
</p>
<p>62. <b>Steve Moran</b>, aged 39, had been arrested on 3 November 2009 in the street in 
Crossroads by three police officers, who handcuffed him and took him to Crossroads Police 
Station, where he spent two hours. Later he was transferred to Central Police Station, where 
he had spent the last four months. A female police officer had questioned him and he had 
talked to a lawyer. He was badly treated in Central Police Station. The food and the tea 
provided were of very poor quality. He could receive visits two times per week. His family 
took food for him, but this was often restricted by the police. He was locked down all day 
and had to shout if he needed to use the bathroom. The officers only went to the cells when 
they were in the right mood, even if a detainee was sick. The night before the visit, one 
detainee fell sick but the officers let him wait for 30 minutes. He was lying on the floor and 
crying of pain. Sometimes the detainees had to beg the officers for three to four days in 
order to be taken to a doctor. Five months before, a former cellmate had been beaten on the 
eye by the officers. Poor people were not respected by the officers. He was allowed out of 
the cell for five minutes at 5 a.m. in the morning in order to have a shower and to get 
breakfast. The detainees were then locked in again until the evening, when they had got 
their dinner. The cells were infested with flees and rats and the whole place smelled very 
bad because the detainees were forced to urinate in plastic bottles. There was a special 
separation cell on each floor where detainees could be locked in for one or two days when 
they got in a fight.

<p><b>  Hunt&#8217;s Bay Police Station 
Visited on 15 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur was received by Superintendent Hewitt Delroy, Inspector 
Aaron Fletcher, Officer Carl Malcolm (Deputy Superintendant in charge of crime), Custody 
Officer Dalton Leslie and Inspector Joeff Scott (Ms). 
</p>
<p>64. The lock-ups had been closed in early December for renovation. According to 
Inspector Fletcher, reconstruction was needed because the detainees needed better 
treatment. He added that no interrogations took place at Hunt&#8217;s Bay, and once the 
detainees&#8217; identity was verified, they were taken to other police stations. 
</p>
<p>65. Most of the officers, above all Superintendent Hewitt Delroy, were very obstructive, 
uncooperative, aggressive, and openly threatened the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s team during the 
visit. Although the lock-up was not operative, the Special Rapporteur encountered a man in 
the &#8220;Interview Room&#8221; who was apparently very scared. According to the officers, he had 
been detained and taken to the police station by a mobile police brigade, but there were no 
record about who had taken him and who had received him. Since the lock-up was out of 
operation, there was no custody register book. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s overall impression </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>confirmed the extremely bad reputation of this police station. The Special Rapporteur 
strongly urges the Government to take disciplinary measures against Superintendent Hewitt 
Delroy for having obstructed and aggressively threatened the Special Rapporteur and his 
team. 
</p>
<p>66. <b>Ricardo Livingston Palmer</b>, aged 25, had been threatened to death by the police. 
He started crying and begged the Special Rapporteur to help him. He was so scared that he 
was shaking. There had been trouble with the police in his community for some days, since 
the police had reportedly killed a man a few days before. The people had created a road 
block to prevent police from entering the day after, but they came and started shooting. He 
was part of the crowd. The day of the arrest, he saw the police at noon and ran to another 
community. He entered a random house to hide. Police circled the house and the woman at 
the house went out screaming and fearing for her life, leaving him alone inside. The police 
went in and took him out while he begged not to be killed. They put him in a van together 
with ten officers. He was beaten on the face and on the mouth. He was then taken to Hunt&#8217;s 
Bay, where he had not been beaten, but questioned about his origin and possession of a gun. 
The station record included Mr. Palmer&#8217;s allegation that police officers had beaten him on 
both of his eyes and mouth. An additional comment indicated that there were no visible 
signs of assault anywhere in his body. 
</p>
<p>67. As the police officers maintained that Mr. Palmer was not in police custody, the 
Special Rapporteur demanded that he be released. After discussing for a long time, he was 
finally allowed to leave with his family, who had gone to the station to pick him up. 
</p>
<p><b>  Fort Augusta Adult and Juvenile Correctional Centre 
Visited on 16 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur was received by Superintendent Reuben Kelly and 
Superintendent Dorothy Hawkin. At the time of the visit, 188 female inmates, including 40 
girls, were detained. One baby was at the facility with the detained mother. 
</p>
<p>69. There were ten dormitories, including three for children in between the adult dorms. 
During the day, girls and women were together. Some of the girls were sent to Fort Augusta 
for &#8220;safe custody&#8221; because of unruly behaviour in other homes. Remandees were usually 
separated from those convicted, unless there was overcrowding. During the day Fort 
Augusta was operated as an open facility, and both the girls and the women attended 
classes or workshops (leather craft, hairdressing, computer classes, etc.). Women with 
mental disabilities and aggressive behaviour were isolated from other inmates. Isolation for 
a maximum of 30 days and no visits were used as means of punishment. However, there 
was no register for the punishment cells, and information was only recorded in the dorm 
books. 
</p>
<p>70. In general, the Special Rapporteur had a fairly good impression of the facility. 
However, he was concerned about the fact that girls were detained together with adult 
women, in contravention of international standards. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Y. H</b>, 14. She had been detained at Fort Augusta for a year, and had been previously 
held in two different places of safety. She had been transferred to Fort Augusta because she 
had injured a house mother at Windsor. She had been sentenced to three years detention. 
She indicated that she had been beaten in early December 2009. The officers wanted to put 
her in a separate dorm, and when she refused and held on to the bed, she was beaten three </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>35 
</b></p>
<p>times with an electric wire. It was the only time she had been beaten, although she had been 
placed in the punishment side cell on several occasions. The longest she had stayed there 
was one week. Other punishments included banning visits. She had two U-shaped scars on 
her right lower back produced by an electric wire. Her sister was also detained at Fort 
Augusta, but in a separate dorm. Most girls were there for uncontrollable behaviour. 
Regarding other detainees, she added that the girls sometimes fought and that the adult 
women cursed her. She went to school everyday.  
</p>
<p>72. <b>M. C.</b>, aged16, stayed in dorm no. 1. She had been held at Stony Hill, Horizon, and 
Armadale. She had been at Fort Augusta since August 2009. The week before the visit of 
the Special Rapporteur she had had an argument with another girl and was moved to the 
isolation dorm, where she was locked down for a week. She had not been beaten while at 
Fort Augusta, but still felt that the treatment at Armadale had been better. She reported her 
experience of the fire at Armadale in May 2009. 
</p>
<p>73. <b>N. S.</b>, aged 14, had been at Fort Augusta since July 2009. The week before the visit 
of the Special Rapporteur, she had thrown her porridge away and had been slapped in the 
back by a guard, and told to behave by the school teacher. She fought constantly with the 
officers, who searched for marijuana. The officers used pepper spray and batons to control 
the detainees. She wished the detainees were not treated like pigs and complained about the 
beatings. 
</p>
<p>74. <b>S.D.</b>, aged 16, had been detained in Fort Augusta for three years and six months, 
since she was 14, for refusing to obey her parents. Before that, she had stayed with 
strangers in a &#8220;comforting home&#8221; in Kingston and in a place of safety for three months, 
from which she ran away. Her father had taken her back to the place of safety. She was 
involved in a riot there, for which the management called the police. She got into a fight 
with the police and was beaten. She was then taken to the police station and a judge 
sentenced her to prison. She was detained at Armadale, but was transferred to Fort Augusta 
after she ran away. In April 2008, she was involved in a riot in Fort Augusta. In the course 
of the riot she and other inmates were beaten by the officers. She got beaten on her 
shoulders, fingers, abdomen and knees with batons and wooden boards. She knew the name 
of the female officer who beat her. She experienced some swellings and was taken to see 
the doctor, who gave her painkillers. Afterwards, she was taken to the punishment cell at 
the back of the dormitory, which was infested with rats and insects and was full of faeces. 
After the riot the punishment cells were packed with girls. The girls were permanently 
locked down and could only go out to catch water during two months. She understood that 
children had to be punished but thought that they were excessively punished at Fort 
Augusta and that they had no rights. Additionally, she felt that the officers were treating the 
girls as if they were adults without understanding the special needs of children. Her mother, 
with whom she was going to live with in a month, would visit her. She could also attend 
school and go to the computer lab. She added that the adult inmates did not want the 
juveniles around and one of them had tried to set her on fire on one occasion. She had 
splashed kerosene on her and then threw a burning tissue at her. The juveniles also fought 
among each other. The food was of poor quality; it was not properly cooked and it made 
her sick. At home, her now deceased father had regularly beaten her with a board, a water 
hose or other tools. The only thing she had to remember him were the scars on her face 
from the beatings. 
</p>
<p>75. A<b> detainee</b>, aged between 25 and 28. She was taken to Fort Augusta in November 
2009. At the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur, she had been in the punishment cell 
for some days as she had been seen with contraband material. Since she was 
claustrophobic, she suffered from the lack of air and space, as she was only taken out for 
meals. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>36</b> 
</p>
<p>76. <b>Tracy Roach</b>, aged 43, had been detained at the airport. She was questioned there 
by the police, and although there was no ill-treatment, their behaviour was demeaning. She 
was then taken to Duhaney Park Police Station, where she was interrogated without a 
lawyer or a Justice of the Peace. She later had access to a lawyer. She had first pleaded not 
guilty because she was scared, but later changed her plea. She was detained at Duhaney 
Park for one month and was never beaten. However, she suffered from depression and had 
gone through drug withdrawal without receiving the necessary medication. Her skin was 
breaking and her body was going through shock, but she had not been taken to the hospital 
until she fainted. Concerning Fort Augusta, she noted that no one was abused, but that the 
warders performed strip searches. She complained that she had not received her medication 
in two weeks, but she was able to see a psychiatrist. 
</p>
<p>77. <b>Janet Douglas</b>, aged 39, was arrested on 24 November 2000 and spent three months 
in a police station, at Horizon, and finally transferred to Fort Augusta in 2001. She had been 
verbally ill-treated by warders but never beaten by them. In March 2009 she went through a 
new trial since the first one was deemed unfair. She was then put in a new dorm, together 
with convicted women. One of them had threatened to kill her one night. She complained 
and the guards found a knife on the other woman. On 19 June 2009, she got into a fight and 
was then surrounded by ten officers who assaulted her. She fell on the floor and was 
dragged from dorm 5 to dorm 2. She sustained 29 medically recorded injuries and suffered 
from a back problem which forced her to walk with a crutch. She was taken to Kingston 
Public Hospital only five days later. She complained that the guards should be more 
receptive to the medical needs of the detainees. Since she did not lodge a formal complaint, 
this incident was not properly investigated.  
</p>
<p>78. The Superintendent told the Special Rapporteur that her wounds were probably 
&#8220;self-inflicted&#8221;. However, the findings of the forensic expert of the Special Rapporteur 
were strongly supportive of the allegations, and self-infliction was not a credible 
explanation for the type, number and pattern of injuries. 
</p>
<p>79. <b>S.S.B.</b>, aged 25, was arrested on 26 October 2009 at the airport. She was taken to the 
narcotics office in Spanish town, where she spent a couple of hours. Narcotics officer Jones 
told her that she did not have to go to prison if she cooperated. She told the truth about her 
crime and provided the officers with names. A Justice of the Peace was present during the 
interrogation. However, on 2 December 2009 she was sentenced to 18 months in prison. 
She was transferred to Duhaney Park Police Station, where she stayed from 26 October to 
17 November 2009. The police station was severely overcrowded with six persons per cell, 
and the detainees had to sleep on the floor. There was no light in the cell. The detainees 
were only allowed out of the cell for a shower; the toilet and a sink were within the cell. 
She suffered from stomach problems, for which she was provided with some medication in 
Fort Augusta. Her wrists bore marks from the tight handcuffs. The detainees reportedly 
bribed the officers for certain privileges or services. She added that girls should not be 
detained in a prison for adults and that they were constantly fighting with each other.

<p><b>  Portmore (100 Man) Police Station, St. Catherine South 
Visited on 16 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General Information 
</b></p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur was received by Sergeant Marcher, Custody Officer and 
Deputy Superintendent Foster Turner (Ms). At the time of the visit, 86 persons were in 
custody in 13 cells; the maximum capacity of the lock-up was 69. 
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur perceived a violent atmosphere at the police station. A 
detainee was openly threatened not to speak to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s team. Although the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>37 
</b></p>
<p>conditions of detention were inhuman, the cells at Portmore Police Station were somewhat 
better than at other police stations. Some detainees reportedly had to wait for more than six 
months before they went on an ID parade. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Lynford Brown</b>, aged 19, had been at Portmore Police Station for one week but had 
not yet been charged. He had been detained with eleven other persons by approximately 40 
police officers. All the detainees were ordered to walk in a straight line while the officers 
pointed their guns or rifles at them. They were taken to the police station, where they had 
their picture taken. They were all released except for him. He was not allowed any visits or 
phone calls for two days. His lawyer and family were able to visit him two days later, 
although he did not receive any of the things they had brought for him. He had not been 
provided any food or water by the police for three days, and had to rely on other detainees. 
When his mother visited him, he was taken out to see her. However, he was unaware that 
because he was waiting for an ID parade, he should not have been seen by anyone. As a 
result, one of the police officers grabbed him by his shirt, verbally abused him and pushed 
him back to his cell. He complained that he could not use the showers. He concluded by 
saying that the detainees were afraid to speak to the Special Rapporteur because of 
reprisals. 
</p>
<p>83. <b>Philip Simpson</b>, aged 29, was arrested on 11 January 2010, after he voluntarily 
went to the police station as a witness on a shootout case in his community. He was not 
allowed to see a judge or his family until an ID parade was conducted. He thought the 
police station had been cleaned before the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit and that he had been 
expected. Sergeant Marshon was wearing a uniform for the first time and he was allowed to 
take a shower for the first time in a month. He complained about the arbitrariness of 
Officers Jarrett Coach and Marshon. 
</p>
<p>84. <b>Antonio Simpsons</b>, aged 23, was arrested on suspicion of murder but had not been 
to court yet. He had been successively detained at Bridgeport police station for juveniles, 
Spanish Town and Portmore, which he judged to be the worst in terms of violence. He 
thought the ID parade was not run properly and took too long to organise. In his case the 
witnesses were also detainees, which complicated and slowed down the process. He was 
beaten once by Officer Coach when he got in a fight with another detainee. Coach beat him 
with two batons for five minutes while he lay in his cell. 
</p>
<p>85. <b>Gillry Edwards</b>, aged 20, was arrested on 5 November 2009 on the street in 
Portmore. He had been at his girlfriend&#8217;s place and was on his way home. He was carrying 
a suitcase with stolen goods, which had been given to him by a friend, when the police, 
who were travelling in an unmarked car, stopped him. One of the officers pulled out his gun 
but held it down. He was taken to his place where he lived with his friend. There, he was 
slapped in the face and beaten on the stomach. Afterward, he and his friend were taken to 
the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) at Portmore Police Station. Three CIB officers 
questioned them without the presence of a lawyer or a Justice of the Peace. In the back 
room of the CIB office they were beaten on the back while handcuffed and lying over a 
chair. The officers beat Mr. Edwards with doubled-over cables on his back and side and 
with batons on his back. Afterwards, his neck was swollen, his face was red, he had a mark 
on his left side and his left arm was bruised. The other officers in the CIB office were 
laughing and saying that they should kill him. The beating went on for three to four hours; 
the officers wanted to find out where the stolen goods were from. He and his friend were 
cuffed to the bars of a window in the office. He was forced to bend down and an officer put 
a gun in his mouth, threatening to kill them. The officers came from another police station. 
They stayed handcuffed on the bars the entire night; the handcuffs were extremely tight. In 
the cell, he had to sleep on the cold concrete floor. He indicated that the cells were infested </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>38</b> 
</p>
<p>with cockroaches and lizards. Sometimes there were up to 14 detainees in his cell. He had 
not been beaten since his interrogation. He did not have a lawyer and thought that nobody 
would care if he complained about the ill-treatment. His family did not visit him. In the 
morning, the detainees got one cup of tea and one slice of bread; at 5 p.m. they received 
two dumplings, one slice of bread and one cup of tea. Every time they re-entered the cell-
block, the detainees had to undress entirely in order to be searched for illegal goods. He 
was sure that he would be beaten again after the Special Rapporteur had left. 
</p>
<p><b>  May Pen Police Station, Clarendon 
Visited on 16 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur was received by Deputy Superintendent<b> </b>Ian Mowatt, 
Corporal Gayle and Inspector Johnson, Sub-Officer. At the time of the visit, there were 103 
detainees in two corridors of 6 six cells each. The maximum capacity of the lock-up was 75 
inmates. 
</p>
<p>87. Together with the Freeport Police Station in Montego Bay, May Pen Police Station 
displayed the worst conditions of detention of all facilities visited by the Special 
Rapporteur. Detainees were kept in overcrowded, dark, filthy and awfully smelling cells on 
both sides of a U-shaped corridor. The darkest cells with the worst conditions were in the 
back, opposite the foul-smelling toilets and showers. The hygienic conditions were terrible. 
The cells had no toilets or water inside. Detainees had to urinate in bottles and defecate in 
plastic bags since they only had access to the toilets twice a day. Food poisoning was 
reportedly frequent. Some detainees had been held in May Pen for three years.  
</p>
<p>88. At the debriefing, the Deputy Superintendent responsible for monitoring the lock-
ups,<b> </b>Ian Mowatt, gave a very frank self-assessment of the police station. According to him, 
the lock-up was constantly overcrowded (capacity 75, de facto always around 100 
detainees), had a too-high remand rate (80%), no toilets and water in the cells, insufficient 
medical care, and not enough light or water. He conceded that there were complaints about 
excessive use of force by police officers, but stated that there was not enough evidence to 
bring charges against the officers. In general, he called the conditions &#8220;sub-human&#8221; and 
made two important recommendations, which the Special Rapporteur fully supports: Judges 
should regularly visit the facilities at the police lock-ups; and the responsibility for 
detaining persons on remand should be taken away from the police. The Special Rapporteur 
strongly urges the Government to close down this police detention facility. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p>89. A <b>detainee</b>, aged 25, indicated that he had been originally detained at May Pen 
Police Station. Then he was taken to Horizon Remand Centre, but had been sent back to 
May Pen. He had been beaten with batons in 2009; beatings were common after searches. 
He added that the food at Horizon was much better than at May Pen. During the day, he 
was allowed to go outside in the morning, to use the toilet and clean the cell. However, he 
had to call the officers to use the toilet at other times during the day. 
</p>
<p>90. <b>Jeremy Antonio Chambers</b>, aged 27 had been arrested 10 months before the visit 
of the Special Rapporteur and had been beaten on the way to court. He had additionally 
been beaten by the police because they found a mobile phone in his cell. During a search 
four weeks prior, he was beaten with a baton on his shoulder, elbows, and stomach. There 
were no beatings if the officers did not find any prohibited items in the cells. He suffered 
from a heart problem and had been taken to the hospital on five occasions. He complained 
that there was often no water at the station and that there were many people sick with </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>39 
</b></p>
<p>diarrhoea. There were many fights among the detainees. The big cell was for those who 
were sick, and those who had already been charged were held in the other cells.  
</p>
<p>91. <b>Alfonso Wint</b>, aged 59 had been detained at May Pen for two days, after a conflict 
with his neighbours. He suffered from asthma, which became worse as a result of sleeping 
on the floor in his cell. Other detainees beat him while the officers watched. He had been 
beaten once on his leg and face with the registry book by officers at Four Parks Police 
Station. He had asked to see a doctor but was not taken. His knee was still swollen and he 
could not stretch it. During a previous detention, warders had broken his right hand and 
since he had not received proper medical care he could no longer use it properly. He was in 
very poor physical condition. He had not been allowed to inform his family that he was in 
detention. He said that that both detainees and officers were trying to kill him slowly. 
</p>
<p>92. <b>Oneil Woolough</b>, aged 39, had been arrested on Sunday morning before the visit. 
He cried heavily while talking to the Special Rapporteur. He was beaten by Officer Joe 
Marshall on the abdomen and the left ear with a baton. Since he had a stomach problem and 
because of the very poor quality of the food, he had severe diarrhoea but no access to the 
bathrooms except in the morning and in the evening. The other detainees in his cell did not 
accept him and threatened to kill him if he could not wait to go to the toilets. He was taken 
to the doctor who told him not to eat rice and to have a strict diet. However, he was given 
rice and improper food. Officers had thrown very hot water at him, which had caused a first 
degree burn on his chest down to the hip bone. His cheek was swollen because he had been 
hit by an officer with a baton. Due to an uncoordinated system of distribution of medicines 
between the hospital, the pharmacies and the police stations, detainees had to wait for more 
than two days to receive their treatment. 
</p>
<p>93. <b>Robert Ishainl</b> <b>Sr.</b>, aged 41, was arrested on 3 December 2009 by the police in the 
streets and was taken to Lionel Town Police Station. On 20 January he was transferred to 
May Pen and went to Court for the first time the day before the visit of the Special 
Rapporteur. He was never beaten, but was called a &#8220;mad man&#8221; by the officers. He was a 
reggae musician. He complained about the impossibility to go to the toilets more than twice 
a day. 
</p>
<p>94. <b>Robert Powle </b>was arrested a week before the visit of the Special Rapporteur after a 
police search in the area where he had a fruit shop. They found marijuana and he was 
pushed harshly into the police car. He had a lawyer and waited to get out on bail. He had a 
bandage on his forehead because he had fallen against the wall in the bathroom and was 
subsequently taken to the hospital. He thought that detainees were not treated like human 
beings and complained about the lack of access to the toilet. 
</p>
<p>95. <b>S.R.</b>, aged 24, had been arrested on 25 December 2009. He was immediately taken 
to May Pen Police Station and had remained in the same cell. On the day he was detained a 
police officer hit him on the face with the end of a gun. The police threatened to kill him. 
They stomped with their shoes on his chest while he was lying on the floor. He had not put 
up any resistance during the arrest, so there was no reason for the beating. One month later 
the judge ordered that he should be taken to hospital for an examination. In early to mid-
January, the police conducted a search of the cells for marijuana and mobile phones. They 
found something in his cell and started beating the detainees. Five officers beat the 
detainees in the corridor and then in their cells. He was beaten on his arms, shoulders, 
hands and legs. His arm and leg were both broken due to the beatings and several of his 
toes were dislocated. He feared that his right middle finger may have also been broken. He 
was taken to hospital for treatment after the beatings. The detainees could only go to toilet 
when the officers allowed it, and their decision was arbitrary. Some officers would tell 
them to use a bag or a plate or to defecate on their hands and then eat the faeces. The 
frequency of showers also depended on the officers&#8217; mood. They had experienced a water 
shortage for two to three weeks. Some of the detainees got sick from the water. On </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>Sundays, detainees could receive visits by family members for five minutes in the visiting 
area. The findings of the forensic expert of the Special Rapporteur corroborated the 
allegations of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>96. <b>Lucan Francis</b>, aged 21, had been detained at May Pen Police Station for three-and-
a-half months. He was arrested on 18 November 2009 at his home. During the arrest, the 
officers used force and he was beaten in front of his family. He received a blow with a 
baton on his ear and fainted. He was taken to the hospital and received four stitches. He was 
handcuffed and shackled. Ten days before the visit of the Special Rapporteur, four police 
officers searched his cell for phones and marijuana, but they did not find anything. He was 
held in a cell together with three other inmates. An officer called &#8220;Ghetto&#8221; asked him what 
he was being charged with and then beat him on his feet, legs and knee with a black steel 
baton, which was thinner but longer than a normal baton. He received six blows on the right 
knee, which was swollen for three days. The officers conducted searches twice a month, 
normally after family visits. The officers also used electroshocks to control the detainees 
during the searches. The food and tea were of a very poor quality. Sometimes the detainees 
had to defecate on plates because they were not allowed to use the toilet. His cell was 
infested with cockroaches. 
</p>
<p>97. <b>A.T.</b>, aged 24, remandee, had been detained at May Pen Police Station since 11 
August 2008. In early February his cell, which he shared with five other inmates, was 
searched by police officers. The detainees had to wait outside the cell during the search. An 
officer came out of the cell with a blunt instrument and asked for the owner of the object. 
None of the detainees had been aware that such an object had been in the cell. Three 
officers, including &#8220;Jumpy Brown&#8221; and Officer Grant started beating them while four other 
officers stood by watching. He was beaten with batons on his shoulder and his back and 
received a blow on the eye which bled. He was called into the cell and told to kneel down. 
Again the officers wanted to know who the object belonged to. When he did not answer, 
Officer Young applied electric shocks to him with a new black instrument of 10 x 5 
centimetres. The officer applied the instrument six times on his naked torso, each time 
repeating the question. After the first shock to his abdomen he fell on his side and was 
shocked on his left side. Officer Young told him to get back on his knees. He could feel the 
electric current in his stomach. He was taken to the hospital because his eye was bleeding. 
He told the doctor about the beating and the electric shocks but nothing happened. These 
kinds of searches took place once or twice a month and took place in a mostly violent 
manner. There was a particularly abusive team who conducted the searches. He had been 
ill-treated five time since he arrived at May Pen Police Station. He was beaten with fists 
once. In addition, the detainees had to wait for months if they requested to go to a hospital. 
The officers often turned back the food the visitors brought. There had been a recent lack of 
water. 
</p>
<p>98. <b>Jason Rose</b>, aged 19, had been detained on 14 February 2010 at home. The police 
had kicked in the door of his home; they were looking for a gun. He and a girl who was 
present were beaten by ten officers for approximately ten minutes. Officer Grant punched 
his chest and put a black cloth over his head. He was slapped in the face and on the ears. 
The officers used guns, torches and batons to beat them. Both the girl and he were taken to 
the police station. Because the girl was only 17, he was accused of carnal abuse. </p>

St Elizabeth 
Visited on 17 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>99. The Special Rapporteur was received by Superintendent Marlette White and Deputy 
Superintendent Molly Plummer. At the time of the visit, 36 girls were in detention in 10 
dorms; two babies were at the facility with their mothers. In total 41 staff were working at 
Diamond Crest. 
</p>
<p>100. Diamond Crest had opened on 28 May 2009 to accommodate 15 girls who had been 
detained at Armadale, but was now also open to other girls. There were 24 girls who had 
been convicted, 11 were there for uncontrollable behavior and one for care and protection. 
They had academic, vocational and recreational activities during the day. Counselling 
sessions with a psychiatrist and a chaplain were offered. After the fire at Armadale, the girls 
had received an intense counselling programme. The grills on the veranda were closed at 
7:00 p.m., but the dorms did not have locks on the door. The girls could receive visitors 
during the weekend and sometimes during the week as well. There had been no escape 
attempts. The disciplinary measures employed at Diamond Crest included extra chores and 
the banning of visits and/or telephone calls, depending on a decision by the disciplinary 
committee. There were no isolation or punishment cells. Ten dormitories with three or four 
sets of bunks housed the girls. Babies could stay at Diamond Crest up to one year, but in 
most cases were taken away after six months.  
</p>
<p>101. One of the house mothers who had worked at Armadale noted that the fire occurred 
in one dorm, which was on the ground floor of an office building. She added that some of 
the more than 20 girls had to share a bed because of the overcrowding at Armadale. 
</p>
<p>102. Diamond Crest Juvenile Correctional Centre certainly constituted a best practice. 
During the visit all girls were outside in the garden area, playing games, doing sports, 
singing and enjoying themselves. The conditions of the dorms were excellent. The 
Superintendent, a trained social worker, and her Deputy, a social worker and psychologist, 
seemed to be highly professional and human rights minded. There were no complaints of 
ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>L. S.</b>, aged 17, had been detained at Armadale, but was not injured in the fire. She 
did not report any ill-treatment, and noted that a doctor visited Diamond Crest three times 
per week, and a psychiatrist once per week.  
</p>
<p>104. <b>V. E.</b>, aged 15, had been at Diamond Crest for two months, after she was sentenced 
to three years for being uncontrollable. Some of the girls beat her and did not want to be her 
friends. She had been at Grandville, a place of safety, but ran away. She had originally run 
away from home because her father beat her. 
</p>
<p>105. <b>S. F.</b>, aged 16, had been sentenced to four years, and had been in custody for almost 
two years. She had been detained at Armadale for a long time. The girls were frequently 
locked down at Armadale. There were more recreational and academic activities at 
Diamond Crest, and the food was better as well. She had never been beaten at Armadale, 
but other girls had. The day of the fire, some girls were misbehaving and planning to 
escape, after they had been in lock-down for eight days. They were able to take the grill off 
the window, but it looked fixed from the outside. Because the girls were misbehaving, the 
police officers came and threw tear gas through the window inside the dormitory. The tear 
gas blazed, even though none of the girls had lighters. Although she thought about it every </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>42</b> 
</p>
<p>night, she was not traumatized, as she kept herself active when she felt depressed. 
However, she added that some of the girls who had been in the Armadale fire also 
misbehaved at Diamond Crest. 
</p>
<p>106. <b>C. A.</b>,<b> </b>aged16, had been sentenced to 18 months, and had already completed nine. 
The day of the fire, she was on the top bunk when she felt the tear gas. She tried to get out 
of the window, but a girl was stuck due to her weight. There were 23 girls at Armadale, and 
only two windows from where they could get out. She was the last one to exit. Although the 
fire did not get to her skin, she could feel it tingling; a major section of her body was burnt.  
</p>
<p>107. <b>R.W.</b>, aged 17, was sentenced by a court on 20 July 2009 to one year imprisonment 
for the possession of marijuana and an offensive weapon. At Armadale Juvenile 
Correctional Centre for Girls, she had been ordered to wash the dishes once but she refused. 
She walked out of the kitchen and was told by the warders to go to her dorm. When she did 
not follow the order, a male officer bent her arm backwards and pushed her. She pushed 
him back and six other officers came and bent her arm again, which had been hurt. One of 
the female officers, Ms. White, said that she would kill her. She was put into an office and 
had to wait there for 30 minutes. She was given a pill that made her sleepy and was taken 
back to her dorm. The officers often cursed her. 
</p>
<p>108. <b>S.T.</b>, aged 17, had been initially detained in Armadale since February 2009. She was 
sentenced to one year imprisonment for the possession of marijuana. Because the 
conditions in Armadale were very bad, some of the girls wanted to run away. There were 
about 20 girls in the &#8220;office dorm&#8221;, which had three bunk beds. The girls managed to dig 
the window grill out of the wall but when they tried to escape at night, they were caught by 
the staff. The police was called and the girls were forced back into the dorm. The girls were 
singing, screaming and mocking the police. When she smelled the teargas she jumped out 
of the window; she was the second girl to get out of the dorm. The teargas came first, and 
then the fire. She thought that maybe one of the girls had lit a mattress in order to distract 
attention from their escape. She was traumatized from the events.

<p><b>  Alligator Pond Police Station, Manchester, St Elizabeth 
Visited on 17 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information  
</b></p>
<p>109. The Special Rapporteur was received by Inspector Clyde Rumsay, Constable Sekou 
Smith and Sergeant Donovan Boothe. At the time of the visit, four male detainees were 
held at the police station. 
</p>
<p>110. The police station was small and displayed more humane conditions than the others 
the Special Rapporteur had seen in Jamaica. There were only four detainees held at the 
police station, who had been transferred the day prior from Mandeville Police Station, 
allegedly because of the visit of the Special Rapporteur. Conditions of detention in 
Mandeville were described by the detainees as appalling. In comparison, Alligator Pond 
was cleaner and the cell doors were open during the day. Detainees could go to the toilet 
and shower whenever they wanted in the very clean facilities. However, there was a 
problem with cockroaches and mosquitoes and the detainees complained that the light in 
the corridor was always on. </p>

<p><b>  St. Catherine Adult Correctional Centre, Spanish Town 
Visited on 17 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>111. The Special Rapporteur was received by Acting Superintendent R. Williams, Acting 
Assistant Superintendent Isak Grizzle and Norman Powell, overseer officer. At the time of 
the visit, 1,263 detainees were held in the facility, which had a maximum capacity of 850. 
</p>
<p>112. At the time of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit, the prison&#8217;s occupancy rate was almost 
50% over its maximum capacity. In addition to four main buildings (Blocks A, B, C, D) 
there were three special buildings: the Side Cells with four sections, also called VPU 
(Vulnerable Prisoners Unit), which held persons with mental disabilities, homosexuals and 
other vulnerable groups; Gibraltar (including six death row prisoners in Gibraltar 1 on the 
1st floor); and the New Hall. Section 1 in Block A was called security section. The cells in 
the security sector had doors with no windows. Detainees serving a life sentence were not 
separated from others. The last execution had taken place in February 1988. The gallows 
were still there, but the officers could not find the keys to show them to the Special 
Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>113. The prison buildings, which had reportedly been built in order to &#8220;store&#8221; slaves on 
their passage to America, still reflected the atmosphere of a storehouse for human beings. 
The cells were generally paltry and detainees had no possibility of any meaningful 
occupation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases  
</b></p>
<p><i>  Vulnerable Persons Unit 
</i></p>
<p>114. <b>Mark Reid</b>, aged 29, was detained in a solitary cell in the sector reserved for 
homosexuals; he had to serve a 25-year sentence. He had to be in a single cell for his own 
protection, because he was afraid of being killed if he had to share a cell. He was allowed to 
leave the cell from 6:00 to 11:30 a.m. and from 1:00 to 2:30 p.m. He could receive two 
visits per month. He added that there were no beatings in that sector, but complained that he 
did not receive enough food. 
</p>
<p>115. <b>Gibson Bunting</b>, aged 47, had been at St. Catherine for 30 years, for a crime he 
committed as a child. His parole had been denied because of an alleged mental illness. 
There were no beatings at St. Catherine, but he had been beaten at a police station. He 
complained about having to defecate in pitchers when the detainees were not allowed to use 
the toilets. 
</p>
<p>116. <b>Ricardo Lee</b>, aged 39, British national, had been detained at St. Catherine for five 
years. He had asked to be placed in the vulnerable persons unit for protection, as he had 
been attacked by other detainees. He expressed fear that everyone would know in which 
sector he was detained upon his release, and that his life would be threatened. He did not 
have a lawyer. There was a lot of violence among the prisoners and between the prisoners 
and the guards. He also complained about not being able to use the library because there 
was a common belief that if other prisoners touched any book that he had touched, they 
would become homosexuals. He was confronted with the same attitude with regard to the 
gym and the playing field. As a result, he could not associate with any other prisoners, and 
could only walk around in his unit. He also expressed fear about speaking to the authorities, 
as he did not trust them. He requested that stamps and envelopes be provided to those 
prisoners who could not afford them. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>44</b> 
</p>
<p>117. A <b>detainee</b>, aged 35, had been beaten daily by the correctional officers. One of the 
officers had taken everything from his cell during a search, but the search had not been 
supervised by any other officers. He had been beaten on the stomach with a baton, and 
slapped on his face in early January. He had been at St. Catherine for ten years, and 
expected to be released in June 2010. 
</p>
<p>118. A<b> detainee</b>, aged approximately 50, HIV positive and homosexual, had been 
charged for a murder and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. He always received his 
medicine but reported that because he complained that he was not getting the special diet he 
needed, he was beaten by a warder who broke one of his ribs. Warders would often enter 
his cell and insult him. He was also very scared of other detainees because of the heavy 
discrimination against homosexuals. In church they had a special section for homosexuals. 
If they sat on other benches, they were beaten by the others. Because of this stigma 
homosexuals were also prevented from doing many activities. Many detainees spent many 
more years in jail than what they were sentenced for because their parole hearings were 
constantly postponed. 
</p>
<p>119. <b>D.S.</b>, aged 62, had been held in a single cell for the last six months. He was unhappy 
about being alone in a cell but he appreciated that he was in the special wing for his own 
safety. The quality of the food was bad. At 9 a.m. each day he was allowed to be out of his 
cell for half an hour; at 2 p.m. he could go out for one hour. He was beaten by officers at 
the beginning, but not anymore. However, detainees who got violent were subdued by the 
guards. 
</p>
<p>120. A <b>detainee</b> had been in St. Catherine for eight years. He had been beaten by the 
officers about five or six years before. The officers treated the inmates like scum. He did 
not get along with other people because of a medical condition and was therefore put in a 
single cell in the special wing. He felt it was a privilege to be in a single cell and had a 
radio to keep him company. There was no activity for the detainees except for going to 
church, which he did three to four times per week. 
</p>
<p>121. <b>F.D.</b>, aged 44, was detained in a dark, single cell. Because he did not receive any 
visits he had no money to buy a light bulb. He did not dare to ask for one because he was 
not sure whether it was allowed to have light in the cell. He was HIV positive and received 
some medication, although not regularly. In October or November 2009 he was beaten with 
a baton on his stomach, back and mouth by a warder for the possession of an illegal 
weapon. His teeth were still shaking from the beatings. He did not see a doctor and did not 
lodge a complaint. In 2008 he was beaten with a baton on his arms and legs by a warder 
because he was suspected of having traded marijuana. He saw a medical officer and limped 
for a while because of the beatings. He liked to be in a single cell because he was afraid that 
the other inmates would kill him for having had sex with a minor. 
</p>
<p>122. <b>Nicholas McIntosh</b> and other detainees complained about discrimination of 
homosexuals, who were segregated and had no access to church, the gym, school and other 
common activities.

<p><i>  Gibraltar 1, Death row 
</i></p>
<p>123. <b>Massi Nissa Adams</b>, aged 27, had been condemned to death on 11 November 2009. 
He was arrested in 2005 and first detained at Kingston Central Police Station before being 
transferred to the Horizon Remand Centre in 2005, where he was kept in SP 13 and SP 18 
for four years prior to his sentencing. He was not beaten at St. Catherine; he could only go 
outside to the yard for one hour each day. With regard to visits, there was one visit every 
two weeks, and the visits only lasted between three and five minutes. He had no possibility 
to contact his family by telephone. When he was allowed outside his cell, he could only 
meet the other five death row prisoners. His sentence was being appealed.<b>  </b></p>

<p>124. <b>Lenox Swaby</b>, aged 28, had been condemned to death on 28 January 2010. He had 
no complains except for the poor quality of the food. Prior to St. Catherine he had been 
detained at Horizon and described the conditions there as much worse, mainly because of 
the water shortage. 
</p>
<p>125. <b>Calvin Powell</b>, aged 27, condemned to death. He had been at Mandeville police 
station from 16 December 2006 to March 2007. He was then transferred to Horizon, where 
he was held from March 2007 to 18 December 2009. From there he went to Central Police 
Station until 27 January 2010 and finally taken to St. Catherine. He had been tortured at 
Mandeville Police Station. He was beaten several times with a baton during his 
interrogation. In addition, he was forced to sit naked on a metallic chair, with his hands 
handcuffed behind his back, while he was electrocuted with a cable which was tied to a 
light bulb, and water was poured on his body. His testicles were also squeezed, in an effort 
to extract a confession. He did not confess and so the officers beat him with batons on his 
legs until he could not feel them anymore. He had to sign a document that was later used to 
sentence him to death. He had no lawyer. The officers who forced him to sign the paper 
were Dalfy Graveney and Kalin McKenzie. When he appeared before a judge, he stated 
that the confession had been forced, but the prosecutor laughed. He was then taken to 
Horizon, where the detainees were always locked up and in some cases did not have water. 
With regard to St. Catherine, he complained about the lack of toilets. He could see visitors 
two times per month, but they could only bring clothes. His sentence was being appealed. 
</p>
<p>126. <b>Jeffrey Perry</b>, aged 35, condemned to death. He had received his final sentence on 
16 January 2009 and was taken from Horizon Remand Centre to the Gibraltar 1 block at St. 
Catherine&#8217;s on 22 January 2009. At times the guards tended to be abusive. At Horizon 
Remand Centre, he was once beaten and kicked by four officers in his cell in 2005. He was 
not injured. The officers had beaten him as an additional punishment for the crime he had 
committed. He had not been ill-treated by the police during or after arrest. When he was 
transferred to St. Catherine&#8217;s he was interviewed at the reception area, was searched and 
received a medical check. He could go out two times per day, in the morning for two and a 
half hours and in the afternoon for two hours. He got on well with the other inmates. They 
played football, domino, and cards or did exercise. They could get books from the library. 
The condemned prisoners were not allowed to have a family day and did not receive any 
food from outside. The food they received was not as palatable as he would like it to be but 
he was grateful for receiving it. The cells were infested with maggots, rats and cockroaches. 
The pigeons under the roof defecated on the corridor, making it a breeding ground for 
maggots. Some evil warders would come around the block and tell the condemned that they 
soon would be taken to the gallows. It was rather arbitrary if the detainees received 
batteries for the TV. There was no guard on the wing and if they had to go to toilet they had 
to urinate in a bottle. 
</p>
<p>127. <b>Garfield Campbell</b>, aged 32, condemned to death. Since 1997, he had been 
detained in diverse lock-ups. In 2004, he was released on bail. In 2005 he was finally 
sentenced to death. In 1998, he had been severely beaten by police officers at Metcalf 
Remand Centre in order to find his weapon. He was beaten with a long piece of iron and the 
officers nearly killed him. 
</p>
<p>128. <b>Peter Dougard</b>, aged 42, was sentenced to death in November 2007 for murder. In 
2005, he was detained for one month at Half Way Tree Police Station, where he 
experienced a high level of violence. Between 2005 and 2007 he was detained at SP4 of the 
Horizon Remand Centre, where he was kept without sunlight and with bad food. In 
November 2007, he was transferred to St. Catherine. He complained about the quality of 
the food, corruption, lack of work and the hygienic conditions. In the morning and 
afternoon, prisoners were allowed out of their cells for 1 to 2 hours each. He claimed to be </p>

sentence. 
</p>

</i></p>
<p>129. <b>Patrick Reid (Rambo)</b>, aged 45, had been detained at St. Catherine for almost nine 
years. During searches, which took place at least once a week, his artwork was always 
destroyed and water was poured on his belongings. He complained about the lack of a toilet 
in the cells, as well as about being slapped or beaten if he answered back to the guards. 
However, the last time he had been beaten was in 2008. He was not allowed to cook in his 
cell and that food brought by his family was not given to him. Only those prisoners who 
knew a trade were taken to the workshops. 
</p>
<p>130. A<b> detainee</b>, aged 45. There were three persons in his cell, and they had all been 
there for three years. He was serving a 40-year sentence. He complained about being beaten 
during a search the week before, after the guards found a mobile phone in his cell. He was 
beaten on his back with a baton, and was taken to the hospital, where he received pain 
medication. If detainees complained about the prison, they were removed and taken to 
another prison with worse conditions. 
</p>
<p>131. A <b>detainee</b>, aged 31. He complained about having to use plastic bags and bottles to 
urinate and defecate. When he could use the toilets, there were only six for the whole 
sector. He stated that the Superintendent transferred the power to conduct searches to 
syndicate warders, who would take away their light bulbs when they so wished. He had 
been last beaten in 2007, after the warders had conducted a search. He also complained 
about the very limited opportunities for education and general rehabilitation. He declined to 
give his name due to fear of reprisals. 
</p>
<p>132. <b>N. L.</b>, aged 42, was serving a life sentence; he had been at St. Catherine since 1992. 
He had been sentenced to death in 1994, but because of the judgment of the Privy Council 
in Pratt and Morgan, his sentence had been commuted in 2002. He behaved well and 
therefore he did not suffer any abuse. He was happy to take part in the computer and 
mechanic workshops. He received money from his family, which he could use to buy 
different items in prison. 
</p>
<p>133. <b>Ian</b>, a detainee, had formerly been on death row, but his sentence had been 
commuted after five years on death row. There were three persons in his cell. He stated that 
the warders were often frustrated or had personal problems which led them to beat the 
detainees.  
</p>
<p>134. A<b> detainee</b>, aged 24, had often been beaten with batons and kicked by the guards in 
the five years he had been kept at St. Catherine. He said clothes brought to the detainees by 
relatives were often turned back. He also complained to be detained with two other inmates 
in one small cell with only one mattress. No rehabilitation programme was provided to the 
detainees and he could not learn anything or develop any skills. This system was breeding 
criminals and people could only become worse under these conditions. His cellmates 
approved.  
</p>
<p>135. <b>Roniel Smith</b>, aged 28, was convicted to 20 years imprisonment in February 2002. 
He had first been detained at the New Hall building in St. Catherine. On 27 January 2007 
he had disobeyed an order by the female warder Ms. Angus. She had slapped him and 
transferred him to solitary confinement in Gibraltar 2. Between 9 and 11 a.m. and 1 and 3 
p.m. he could be outside of his cell. He complained about the lack of recreational and 
rehabilitation facilities, but he followed education classes five times a week. He could 
receive visitors twice a week for five to seven minutes each. In November 2007, the warder 
Mr. Brown beat him with a wooden baton. His arm was broken and he was hospitalized. </p>

<p>136. <b>Paul Allen</b>, aged 43, was arrested in November 2006 and first detained at the 
Freeport Police Station in Montego Bay. In June 2007 he was sentenced to 43 years 
imprisonment for robbery, rape and other crimes. His case was on appeal. He was injured at 
Freeport and taken to hospital. With regard to St. Catherine, he complained about the lack 
of meaningful rehabilitation activities. He could leave his cell between 9 a.m. and 12.30 
p.m. and between 1.30 and 3.30 pm. He was in a single cell upon his own request. 
</p>
<p>137. <b>Birris F. Robinson</b>, aged 52, was convicted to life imprisonment in 1983 and hoped 
to be released in 2011. Since he was serving a life sentence, he had to be in a single cell. He 
complained about the arbitrary practice of the Parole Board and he thought parole should be 
compulsory after a certain period. The conditions in St. Catherine were more or less the 
same than 20 years before, but there was less violence than before. The last violent event 
had happened some two weeks before the visit of the Special Rapporteur. Between 9 and 11 
a.m. and from 1 to 3 pm, he could leave his cell, but there were no proper work and 
recreation facilities. He added that there should be more training and education facilities.  
</p>
<p>138. <b>Tony Jones</b>, aged 50, was arrested on 1 September 1984 and sentenced to death on 
6 March 1985. He had spent ten years on death row at Gibraltar 1, between 1985 and the 
commutation of his sentence in 1995. Between 1995 and 2004 he was imprisoned at Tower 
Street, and since then in Town Hall of St. Catherine. He hoped to be released on parole 
soon. The prison conditions were getting worse, in particular with respect to the food and 
beatings. In 1987, a prison warder had broken his arm. In 2009, there had been a brutal 
attack against another prisoner. On Friday before the visit of the Special Rapporteur, a 
warder had arbitrarily smashed the bulb of his TV. His mattress was old, and there was no 
toilet inside the cells; thus the detainees had to use a bucket. They could go to school and 
do some sports. 
</p>
<p>139. <b>Dwayne Bryan</b>, aged 29, was held in a punishment sector with harsher conditions. 
His cell was searched approximately three times per month. If the warders found anything 
suspicious, they would break the light bulb in retaliation. He was banned from having a 
light bulb. Whether a cell had light or not was completely arbitrary. The detainees were 
regularly beaten by the warders, for being late or for any other reason. At the moment, three 
detainees were in the hospital for injuries they sustained as a result of beatings. He had been 
hit on the head and ribs eleven months prior by a warder. He had stitches and one rib was 
broken. The stitching was done in the prison. Since he did not feel well after the beatings, 
he had to be taken to hospital for X-rays. 
</p>
<p>140. <b>Alexander Boothe</b>, aged 29, had been in St. Catherine since 22 February 2005. In 
October 2004 he was beaten on the head by Constable Lindsey at Manchester Police 
Station. In addition, he was handcuffed behind his back to the grill. He had to sit on a bench 
with his feet lying on a chair. The officer beat him with a baton on the soles of his feet in 
order to obtain information about a gun. Despite an injury to his head he was not taken to 
hospital until two days later. In St. Catherine he had always been in a single cell, which he 
preferred. Some detainees were beaten by the warders if they asked for trouble. The food 
was horrible. 
</p>
<p>141. <b>W.I.</b>, aged 35, had been in St. Catherine since October 2008; he was sentenced to 
life imprisonment. During his detention, he had been beaten twice by warders; the last time 
was in December 2009. He had gotten into a fight when the warders came and dragged him 
out of the cell. Five officers beat him with batons all over his body for 15 minutes. He had 
not lodged a complaint. 
</p>
<p>142. <b>Vergil Smith</b>, aged 52, had been in St. Catherine since 1996; he was sentenced to 
life imprisonment. He had never had any problems in prison until 3 July 2009. Officer Lilly 
had been sitting outside his cell on the corridor. He wanted to have money from him and 
came into the cell to look for money in the book he was reading. The book fell down and he </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>48</b> 
</p>
<p>wanted to pick it up. At that moment, officer Lilly grabbed him at the throat and punched 
him into the face. After the assault he went to the medical wing of the prison. Officer Lilly 
went by to see him there and threatened him not to make any complaint. However, he still 
complained to the Superintendent, but thus far nothing had happened and the complaint was 
still pending. 
</p>
<p><i>  Security Section A1 
</i></p>
<p>143. <b>Marc Dacosta</b>, aged 28 had been beaten with a baton on his head and all over his 
body in late 2009, because the warders thought he had thrown something over the wall of 
the prison. He stated that the warders used excessive force because they lacked training. He 
asked to be placed in that sector for his own safety. He complained about the food, and 
noted that the prisoners who already had some skills were given preference to attend the 
workshops. Families could provide the detainees with mattresses.  
</p>
<p>144. <b>Valentin Bowes</b>, aged 31, had spent six months from May to October 2007 at May 
Pen Police Station, where he was heavily beaten by criminal investigation officers at the 2nd 
floor in order to extract a confession. In October 2007 he was sentenced to 20 years and 
transferred to St. Catherine. His appeal was still pending. He complained about the chaos, 
arbitrariness and lack of rules. The warders were not educated and corrupt. In particular at 
the Tuck Shop they extracted money from the detainees. Although prisoners could leave 
their cells between 9 and 11 a.m. as well as from 1 to 3 p.m., they had nothing to do 
because of a serious lack of education and rehabilitation facilities. There were specific 
commandos of some 20 warders beating up one prisoner. 
</p>
<p>145. <b>Wayne Morris</b>, aged 31, had been in custody since 1999 and had spent nine years at 
the 3rd floor of New Hall in St. Catherine, where the conditions were extremely arbitrary. In 
summer 2009, he got several blows on his head because he did not go back into his cell 
quickly. He was then transferred to the Security Section where he felt safer from the 
officers. 
</p>
<p>146. <b>Raul Khouri</b>, aged 33, had been beaten by a warder in 2009 after a search during 
which a mobile phone was found. Officer Murray had slapped him on the face outside of 
his cell. He had reported the beating but was only told to go and report another time. There 
were no clear rules for the detainees or warders. He was not allowed to go out for 
recreation. 
</p>
<p><b>  St. Andrew Juvenile Correctional and Remand Centre for Boys  
(&#8220;Stony Hill&#8221;)  
Visited on 18 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>147. The Special Rapporteur was received by Daniel Morrison, Acting Overseer, Devon 
Hannam, Acting Overseer, Marcia Chen, Welfare Case Manager and Donovan Campbell, 
Safety Management Officer. At the time of the visit, 46 boys were held at Stony Hill. The 
facility had 61 staff, including 42 correctional officers. 
</p>
<p>148. The Special Rapporteur had a troublesome impression of the institution after his 
visit. The centre was comprised of one enclosed block with four dormitories, each with six 
bunk beds. There were three showers and four toilets for the boys. The dormitories were 
unlocked between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., but the boys were not allowed to leave the enclosed 
area. There were five boys in special confinement due to an outbreak of chicken pox. The 
Acting Overseers indicated that they needed additional staff, bedding and educational and 
recreational activities. They reported that sanctions included the banning of visits (reviewed </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>49 
</b></p>
<p>after five days) and extra chores. They added that corporal punishment was not allowed, but 
admitted that it still happened. They acknowledged that forced kneeling was used as a 
punishment. In case a complaint was presented by one of the boys, an internal investigation 
was initiated. If the officer was found to have subjected a boy to corporal punishment, he or 
she would be the subject of another investigation. Sanctions were then determined by the 
Commissioner of Corrections. There were currently four members of staff interdicted, i.e. 
suspended with either half or no pay, but the investigation had been ongoing for almost four 
years. Sanctions also included fines, transfer to other institutions or dismissal.  
</p>
<p>149. The daily routine was the following: at 5.30 a.m. the boys woke up to exercise, then 
they could take a cold shower and clean their cells; at 8 a.m. breakfast was provided. Then 
some time was reserved for devotion. From 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and from 1:30 to 3 p.m. 
classes were held; recreation time was from 3 to 4.30 p.m., supper at 5 p.m., and at 6 p.m. 
the boys were locked in their cells again. There was more or less no time or possibility for 
individual recreation and privacy. 
</p>
<p>150. Regarding outside activities, the officers indicated that remandees were not allowed 
to go outside because of the security risk or risk of a lawsuit if something were to happen to 
one of the boys. Those with court orders could go outside if there was a specific project, 
such as work. The boys were thus kept inside despite the fact that there was outside space 
for exercise). During the debriefing, the management held that there was a general rule that 
remandees were not allowed to go outside, but were unable to substantiate. The Special 
Rapporteur had the general impression that the warders were arbitrarily depriving the 
juveniles from going outside the closed compound. Beating was routine practice at Stony 
Hill. Officer Morgan was most often named by the boys to have beaten them and also to 
have subjected them to other forms of corporal punishment. The Special Rapporteur urges 
that a criminal investigation should be conducted against Officer Morgan and the Senior 
Management of Stony Hill. They should be suspended from duty pending the results of the 
investigations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p>151. A<b> boy</b>, aged 15, indicated that on the last Sunday in January, the warders beat him 
with a folded belt on his hands and back. He was also beaten on the chest and mouth. As a 
punishment, he was forced to kneel on the cold floor for half a night, wearing only his 
underwear. His punishment ended when he had to use the toilet. As a result of the beating, 
his lip was bleeding and his back had peeled. He had a scar on his back right shoulder and 
hand, bruises on his back and finger, and a swollen arm. The officers gave him pain 
medication, but did not take him to see a doctor. He added that he had been beaten because 
the officers did not like him. He also stated that verbal abuse occurred daily. He had 
complained about the beatings to the Superintendent, and although the Superintendent had 
spoken to those involved, he did not think anything would be done. He had been told by the 
other boys to inform the judge of the beatings, but his court date had been postponed after 
the last beating. His visits had also been suspended for one month because he had been 
fighting, according to the officers. He also added that the boys were beaten daily, especially 
if they made trouble. The punishments also included beatings with wooden boards on the 
buttocks and forced kneeling with the hands stretched out. However, none of the boys 
watched while others were being beaten. Before his detention, he had been taken to 
Halfway Tree Police Station, where he was held in solitary confinement for one week. The 
findings of the forensic expert of the Special Rapporteur corroborated the allegations of ill-
treatment. The Special Rapporteur was concerned about the absence of any record of 
examination or treatment within the medical file. 
</p>
<p>152. <b>D.R.</b>, aged16, had been on remand at Stony Hill for one month. He complained 
about the strict discipline and the daily routine, including the early wake up, cold shower </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>50</b> 
</p>
<p>and &#8220;donkey food&#8221;. In principle, the detainees could be visited every day, but this privilege 
was often restricted for disciplinary purposes. In addition, they were regularly beaten by 
warders. The most violent of the warders was Officer Morgan. The bathroom was not 
working and needed to be fixed. 
</p>
<p>153. <b>P.J.,</b> aged17, had been at Stony Hill for two months, since early January. There was 
regular violence and not enough food. Four days before the visit of the Special Rapporteur, 
he had a fight with another boy in the dorm. As a sanction, Officer Witter hit him with a 
long wooden stick and Officer Morgan with a cricket pad. Officer Morgan also slapped him 
on the face. Then he had to kneel down and hold up a chair in the air for two hours. Both 
warders ordered the boy with whom he had the fight to punch him on the mouth. The 
findings of the forensic expert of the Special Rapporteur corroborated the allegations of ill-
treatment. 
</p>
<p>154. <b>C.S.</b>, aged 16. He had been at St. John Bosco Children&#8217;s Home from March to 
August 2009 for being &#8220;uncontrollable&#8221;. From August to 1 October 2009, he was at Alpha 
Boys Home and at Stony Hill since 1 February 2010. The latter was by far the worse 
because the children were locked up and subjected to constant violence, fighting and 
beatings. As a punishment, they had to kneel down, clean the dorm and the bathroom, wash 
the walls, were beaten and could not receive visits for up to two or three months. Usually, 
his mother could visit him every two weeks. 
</p>
<p>155. <b>D.M.</b>, aged 12, had initially spent one month at the Alpha Boys Home in Kingston 
for being &#8220;uncontrollable&#8221;. He had been at St. Andrew for a week, which was far worse. At 
the Alpha Boys Home, the guards did not beat children, but in St. Andrew this was a 
regular practice. On 16 February, he had to kneel down with his hands up while Officer 
Morgan beat him on the buttocks with a brown wooden board, roughly one meter long. 
</p>
<p>156. <b>D.D.</b>, aged 16, had been at Freeport Police Station since August 2009 and was 
transferred to Stony Hill some days before the visit of the Special Rapporteur. In Freeport 
he had been beaten with batons and had to sleep on the concrete floor. He found Stony Hill 
comparably better, although the toilets were very dirty and his family could not visit him 
since they lived far away. 
</p>
<p>157. <b>M.A.</b>, aged 15, had been in St. Andrew since November 2009 and had been 
previously held at Central Police Station. He had been beaten by the officers in St. Andrew 
and felt homesick. 
</p>
<p>158. <b>T.C.</b>, aged 16, was arrested on 21 January 2010 and taken to Central Police Station. 
On 11 February, he was transferred to St. Andrew. He had not been beaten but complained 
about the bad hygienic conditions.  
</p>
<p>159. A <b>boy</b>, aged 16, had been held at St. Augustine Place of Safety for one year and was 
transferred to St. Andrew three weeks prior to the visit of the Special Rapporteur. He was 
charged for attempted murder and had no lawyer. He was HIV positive since birth and both 
his parents had died of the disease some years before. He had regular access to a doctor. He 
preferred St. Augustine because he had more freedom and could go out more. He had no 
money to buy water or snacks. He would like to use the computers and improve his skills, 
but there were too many people and he almost never had access. He felt very bad and lonely 
at St. Andrew because the other boys called him names and sometimes beat him. He was 
never hit by an officer. 
</p>
<p>160. <b>M.J.</b>, aged 14, had been detained in the remand centre for one and a half months. He 
had been beaten by the warders two weeks before the visit. He was in dorm number 1 and 
had a fight with another boy. Three warders came and took him to the front office, where he 
was told to bend over the table. A fat officer, who drove a Kingfish car, took a belt closet, 
doubled it and beat him on the buttocks. He wore shorts. He did not count the blows but </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>51 
</b></p>
<p>thought he was hit about eight times. He was then ordered to kneel in the corridor for about 
15 minutes. He was then allowed to go back to his cell. His buttocks were swollen from the 
beatings but he did not complain to anybody. He had not seen a judge yet. The warders beat 
the boys often. They had a long stick in the corner of the office which they used to beat 
them. They also used their own belts or the ones hanging in the office. He had not seen a 
doctor but the medical officer had given him some treatment without examining him. The 
cells were equipped with enough beds for the detained boys but not with enough 
mattresses; thus, some of them had to sleep on the floor. Sometimes they were not given 
their dinner snack bag. Officer Morgan was particularly dreaded by the boys because he 
incited the boys to beat each other. He would hold one of them while another detainee 
would punch him in the mouth. 
</p>
<p><b>  Duhaney Park Police Station for Female Detainees 
Visited on 18 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>161. The Special Rapporteur was received by Inspector Marlene I. Bailey (Ms). At the 
time of the visit, 14 female detainees were held in Duhaney Park Police Station. 
</p>
<p>162. The cells at Duhaney Park were fairly clean, with running water and flushing toilets. 
In addition, there was no overcrowding. The doors of the cells were open and the detainees 
could walk on the corridor. However, they had to sleep on concrete beds and had no 
privacy when using the toilets. A woman who was six months pregnant found it particularly 
hard to sleep on the concrete bed. The officer in charge made a highly professional 
impression and emphasized that she wished to treat the detainees as human beings with 
dignity. She had only been on the job for one month. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p>163. <b>L.T.R.</b>, aged 40, had been at Duhaney Park Police Station for one month. She had 
been taken from her home and was not allowed a phone call, even though her son had been 
left alone at the house. She was not allowed clean clothes or sanitary napkins for four days, 
even though she was menstruating. She was also not allowed visits or phone calls until she 
was charged, ten days after her detention. She indicated that there were no fights, and that 
she could receive two-minute visits on Sundays. 
</p>
<p>164. <b>R.R.</b>, aged 26, a national of Trinidad, had been detained at the airport two weeks 
before and had already been sentenced. During her interrogation at the airport, she had been 
handcuffed on to an iron bar for approximately four hours, without a lawyer. She was then 
taken to a first police station, and later to Duhaney Park. She indicated that she had not 
been questioned at Duhaney Park, and that she did not really interact with the other women. 
She complained about sleeping on the floor, the presence of cockroaches and the quality of 
the food. She would be transferred to Fort Augusta the following week.  
</p>
<p>165. <b>B.S.</b>, aged 39, mother of three girls (aged 22, 17 and 15), who had to take care of 
themselves on their own since the father had left her and did not provide any money. As a 
result, she started dealing drugs. She was arrested at the Kingston airport on her way to 
Trinidad and Tobago and was taken to the hospital for x-rays. On 7 February 2010 she was 
transferred to Duhaney Park, and on 11 February she was presented before a judge. There 
were no beatings, but some police officers used humiliating language. The food was alright. 
In the morning they received two pieces of bread, scrambled eggs and black tea, and white 
rice, chicken and biscuits for lunch and dinner. If the police officers were nice, the cell 
doors were open all day. The Superintendent was a nice woman and male guards were not 
allowed in the lock-ups. Her cell had five concrete beds but without any mattresses. She </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>52</b> 
</p>
<p>could receive visits on Wednesdays and Sundays but she could only talk to them through 
the bars for a few minutes. She was only allowed one telephone call to inform her family of 
her arrest and would like to use the telephone more frequently. 
</p>
<p>166. A<b> detainee</b>, aged 28. She was detained in the morning of 15 February 2010 at a 
communal farm by four police officers, three of whom were uniformed. They threatened to 
shoot her and put her into a police jeep. One of the officers received a call and asked her 
whether she knew a certain man. She replied that he was her boyfriend. They also asked her 
whether he was part of the gang that was stealing old iron. She was taken to the holding 
area of Denham Town Police Station for a few hours, where she was told that her boyfriend 
had been killed by the police. Later a police officer told her that somebody had been killed 
in a shootout soon after her detention. However, he had no weapons, so she thought he 
would have been killed by the police. She was charged by the police of having received 
stolen goods. On 15 February, she was taken to Duhaney Park, where she read in a 
newspaper that her boyfriend had been killed in a shootout. She thought he was a victim of 
an arbitrary killing by the police. At Duhaney Park, she was treated well by the police. She 
would go to court the following day. There were only female guards in the lock-up. The 
day before, the detainees received breakfast at 10 a.m., and lunch and dinner together 
already at 11 a.m. She complained about cockroaches in the lock-up.  
</p>
<p>167. A<b> detainee</b>, aged approximately 40, had been arrested for possession of marijuana 
on 27 January 2010. She complained that she was hungry all the time as the detainees did 
not get enough food, and that the officers were not responsive when she called them. 
</p>
<p>168. A <b>detainee</b>, aged approximately 45, was arrested and taken to Central Village Police 
Station in Spanish Town before being taken to Duhaney Park. She thought Central Village 
was worse, although she complained that at Duhaney Park she could not go out and see the 
sun. She said that her phone calls had been denied and that she could not call her family 
since she had arrived. She had the feeling that the rules were arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>169. A<b> detainee, </b>aged approximately 35,<b> </b>arrived at Duhaney Park the night before the 
visit of the Special Rapporteur, after she had been taken out of a plane for drug possession. 
She had not been brutalized but complained about the lack of hygiene at the lock-up, the 
insufficient quantity of food and the lack of privacy when she used the toilet. 
</p>
<p>170. A<b> detainee</b> was arrested on 6 February 2010. Countless police officers from a 
&#8220;flying squad&#8221; came to her sister&#8217;s house where she was staying. The commanding officer 
ordered her to go downstairs. He was sitting on the stairs and she was standing in front of 
him. He started questioning her and when she answered he called her a liar. He beat her on 
the forehead with a hockey stick. The second blow caused her forehead to burst and bleed. 
Her hands were cuffed. Another officer took his belt and beat her many times. She was also 
beaten with the belt buckle all over her body. She had a scar on her forehead and numerous 
bruises on her left shoulder and arm as well as on the front side and back of her left thigh. 
Her lawyer, to whom she had shown the bruises, had taken pictures of the injuries and took 
her to Kingston Public Hospital. She would like to complain about the ill-treatment when 
she would be taken to court. The findings of the forensic expert of the Special Rapporteur 
corroborated the allegations of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>  Maxfield Park Children&#8217;s Home 
Visited on 18 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>171. The Special Rapporteur was received by Superintendant Laura Brayham (Ms). At 
the time of the visit, there were 99 children (64 boys and 35 girls) at the Children&#8217;s Home. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>53 
</b></p>
<p>172. The children&#8217;s home was a permanent home for children. It had been privately run, 
but the Office of the Children&#8217;s Advocate had recently taken it over because of financial 
difficulties. The facilities and the female Superintendent made a positive impression on the 
Special Rapporteur. She claimed that the children (boys and girls from baby age up to 18) 
were not deprived of liberty, and that the bars were only for their protection. 
</p>
<p><b>  Tower Street Adult Correctional Centre, &#8220;General Penitentiary&#8221;, 
Kingston 
Visited on 18 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p>173. The Special Rapporteur was received by Superintendent Leroy Fairweather, Deputy 
Superintendent Winston C. Anderson and Vice Deputy Superintendant Vincent McDovell. 
At the time of the visit 1,647 male detainees were held at the prison, including one boy. 
</p>
<p>174. The prison had a capacity of 900, but held 1,647 prisoners at the time of the visit, 
including one juvenile. The prison was comprised of eight blocks (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H), 
divided into North and South Sections, a Hospital Ward and Security Cells (also called Jail 
Section), which were likely used as solitary punishment cells, although this was denied by 
the officers. Sections E, F, G and H South were reserved for homosexuals and other 
vulnerable prisoners. Sections H and F North were Security Sections. The George Davis 
Centre was originally for female prisoners and was later used for prisoners with mental 
disabilities. According to the officers, there were no major incidents and no complaints 
about any beatings since 2007. In 2009, five prisoners had died. During the debriefing, 
Superintendent Fairweather admitted that overcrowding was a serious problem, and that he 
had to use single cells for three prisoners.  
</p>
<p>175. The prison was built in 1840 and was not made for providing rehabilitation to 
prisoners. Only 350 of the 1,650 prisoners had the possibility to receive education or work 
in the few workshops (carpentry, tailoring, wielding) available. There was also a serious 
shortage of staff. 463 staff members were employed at the prison, working in three shifts. 
Sanctions consisted primarily of revoking privileges, such as visits. Children could visit 
their fathers at least three times a year (e.g. at Christmas). 
</p>
<p>176. There were 147 schizophrenic detainees at Tower Street, who were not receiving 
appropriate medical treatment. There were three part-time psychiatrists who were there for 
a total of three days per week.  
</p>
<p><b>  Individual Interviews 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Special Location/ &#8220;Gay Section&#8221; (E, F, G, H South) 
</i></p>
<p>177. <b>Eustace Hanson</b>, aged 38, had been sentenced to death in 1990 and had spent four 
years on death row in St. Catherine. In 1994 his sentence was commuted to life 
imprisonment, and he was transferred to Tower Street. He spent two years at the Security 
Section of F and H North, but he was later transferred to the gay section, where conditions 
were better. He had been beaten a long time before, but not in recent years. Prisoners could 
be placed in the &#8220;punishment cells&#8221; for up to three months.  
</p>
<p>178. A <b>detainee</b> had been sent to Tower Street in October 2008; he was sentenced to four 
years imprisonment. He felt discriminated by the other inmates because he was homosexual 
and had been beaten by officers with batons. He was a musician and would like to use the 
instruments in the prison, but the other inmates used them and they refused to let him join. 
He was not accepted in the Rasta choir either because he was a homosexual. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>54</b> 
</p>
<p>179. A <b>detainee</b> had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1978. In 1992 he was badly 
beaten by some officers but did not complain. In 2008, he was wrongly accused by an 
officer and subsequently kicked and boxed by four officers, among which was Officer Blair 
Grove. He was taken to the hospital but did not lodge any complaints. The named officer 
came to his section very often. 
</p>
<p>180. <b>Michael Freemantle</b>, aged 55, was a well-known prisoner who had won a case 
before the UN Human Rights Committee in the 1990s; but had not received any reparation 
as awarded by the Human Rights Committee. He was arrested in 1985 and sentenced to 
death on 21 January 1987. In 1995, this sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. 
Since he had been detained for almost 25 years, he should be eligible for parole and had 
applied to the Parole Board. The last time he had been abused by a prison warder was in 
1997, but on 9 January 2010 he had been abused by a fellow prisoner. The Special 
Rapporteur strongly urges the Government of Jamaica to pay all applicants who were 
successful with their individual complaints before the UN Human Rights Committee an 
adequate compensation as indicated in the Committee&#8217;s final views, including Mr. 
Freemantle. 
</p>
<p>181. <b>Stephen Morrison</b>, aged 35, was sentenced to nine years imprisonment and had 
served his sentence since 2006 in Tower Street. Although he complained about the lack of 
education and rehabilitation facilities (workshops were only available for a few prisoners), 
he maintained that this prison ran rather smoothly. 
</p>
<p><i>  Security Cells 
</i></p>
<p>182. The room for the warders was empty. Detainees were locked up in dark solitary 
confinement cells without a toilet or water and had nobody to call for help. During the 
debriefing with the officials, the Superintendent admitted that due to a shortage of 
personnel, no staff was in the building during the nights, but prisoners could shout if they 
needed help. There were three small sections with a total of ten cells. There was no light in 
the cells, but only outside in the corridor. In principle, it seemed that the prisoners in the 
security cells were allowed to leave the cells like other prisoners in the morning and 
afternoon, but there were exceptions when prisoners were kept in complete solitary 
confinement. The Special Rapporteur holds the opinion that this cannot be done for the sole 
purpose of security and that it definitely amounts to a punishment. 
</p>
<p>183. <b>Dwight Hawden</b>, aged 30, was kept in cell no. 10 in complete darkness. He was 
sentenced in 2006 to life imprisonment but hoped to be eligible for parole after 15 years. He 
was usually kept in Section E South, but Officer Tamo had decided the Friday before the 
visit of the Special Rapporteur to put him in a &#8220;punishment cell&#8221;. Between September and 
November 2009, he had been locked up in this sector for two months. The only light in the 
cell came from a tiny opening in the direction of the &#8220;Gay Section&#8221;, which he could also 
use to communicate with other prisoners outside.  
</p>
<p>184. <b>Clinton Gordon</b>, aged 49, was sentenced to death in 1990. This sentence had been 
commuted to life imprisonment in 1993. He should soon be eligible for parole but he 
needed an employment letter in order to be released on parole. Since he was serving a life 
sentence, he was in a single cell in the E North Section. Because of lack of space, the 
officers had brought two other men into his cell. He protested, so he was moved to the 
security cells in December 2009, where he was again in a single cell. The conditions were 
much worse here, the cell was dark, and he considered this a misuse of the security cells. 
He would prefer to be together with others than to be alone in the security cell. He could 
usually leave his cell during the day, depending on the warders. 
</p>
<p>185. <b>Ricardo Salmon</b>, aged 28, had been in the security cell for eight months. He had 
been stabbed once by another inmate and taken to the Kingston Public Hospital. Two </p>

<p>officers broke two of his teeth in August 2009 and on another occasion. He complained and 
the National Commission decided to remove these officers from their positions. They also 
decided he should have his teeth replaced but this had not been done yet. He stated that 
there was much violence between inmates as well as by the officers. 
</p>
<p>186. <b>Michael Gammon</b>, aged 38, was arrested in 2000 and taken to St. Catherine. He 
was then transferred to Horizon into SP12 and finally to Tower Street in November 2009. 
He stated that he could not associate with the other inmates because they would blackmail 
him because he came from a very wealthy family. He requested to be isolated. He had a 
radio in his cell and said the officers were trying to rehabilitate him and were good guys. 
</p>
<p><i>  Security Section H North  
</i></p>
<p>187. <b>A detainee</b>, aged 40, had been sentenced to life imprisonment and had spent 14 
years in Tower Street. He hoped to be eligible for parole within one year. He complained 
about the bad prison conditions. There were no toilets, and the detainees had to urinate and 
defecate into large plastic cans. The toilets and showers in this section were in bad 
conditions, the food and medicine they received was of poor quality, and they could only 
receive two visits per month of two to three minutes each. In August 2009 he was heavily 
beaten by a prison warder for no apparent reason. 
</p>
<p>188. <b>Omar Facey</b>, aged 27, had spent three years and one month in Tower Street. One of 
his legs had been amputated in 2005, and he urgently needed medical assistance. He 
complained that there were no mattresses in his cell. Although visitors often came from far 
away, they were allowed only short visits of a maximum of 15 to 20 minutes. He noted that 
the conditions of detention were deteriorating; for example, detainees used to receive toilet 
paper and soap twice a month, but now they received them only once a month. 
</p>
<p>189. <b>Raymond Gowie</b>, aged 35, had been at Tower Street since May 2008 and had been 
previously at Horizon for four years. He preferred Horizon and said that at Tower Street 
everybody had to pay when there was a problem with an inmate. He also complained about 
the attitude of the warders. 
</p>
<p>190. <b>Clive Barige</b>, aged approximately 50. His death sentence was commuted to life 
imprisonment on 3 July 1992, with eligibility for parole after 15 years. He had received 14 
different dates to go to parole but it was cancelled at the last minute every time. He said 
inmates were treated like animals. 
</p>
<p>191. <b>Andrew Turner</b>, aged 36, had been sentenced to 20 years and had served eleven 
years in Tower Street. For the last four years, he had major problems with his right eye and 
was afraid of going blind. He had not received proper medical treatment. 
</p>
<p><i>  Prison Hospital  
</i></p>
<p>192. Some detainees who had been severely injured during the unrest at the Horizon 
Remand Centre on 8 February 2010 were held at the prison hospital. 
</p>
<p>193. <b>Lance Mathias</b>, aged 26, had been in his cell on the 3rd floor in SP 22 at Horizon 
Remand Centre when the disturbances occurred. Although the other detainees had smashed 
the locks of their cells, he and his cellmate had stayed in their cells because they did not 
wish to participate in the violent events. However, prison warders were looking for him by 
name, and pulled him out of his cell. He had been beaten with an iron pipe by Officer 
Sente. He had a fractured left jaw and injuries to his legs. The findings of the forensic 
expert of the Special Rapporteur corroborated the allegations of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>194. <b>Deryck Agan</b>, aged 27, had been in his cell on the 2nd floor in SP 19 at Horizon 
Remand Centre. He was arrested on 8 May 2009 and taken to May Pen Police Station, 
where he was beaten so heavily that he sustained a fractured bone on his forehead. On 11 </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>56</b> 
</p>
<p>May 2009 he was transferred to Horizon. Although he had serious pains, he did not see a 
doctor for a long time. He then received painkillers. In June and July 2009, there were 
several incidents involving serious beatings by warders in SP 4 and SP 19. During the three 
weeks before the events of 8 February, the officers had gone on strike. Consequently, there 
were only ten warders for eight SPs. In addition, there was a serious water shortage. Even 
when the water finally arrived, the warders refused to work. They then allowed a bigger 
group of detainees from SP 17 to fetch water. The detainees were so angry about the bad 
prison conditions that they started to destroy the building. They took iron bars and other 
tools and quickly smashed most of the locks in seven SPs in the following order: SP 17, 18, 
22, 21, 19, 20 and 24. The warders ran away and came back with soldiers and police. The 
soldiers took control of the situation without injuring anybody. Police officers then came 
with riot shields and black batons and started to beat up detainees. The prison guards even 
used metal batons and shotguns. They were looking for specific inmates by name, including 
Mr. Agan. He was taken out of his cell and beaten by Officer &#8220;Discipline&#8221; with a baton. 
Officer &#8220;Discipline&#8221; then told the other officers present that Mr. Agan was from a particular 
suburb of Kingston and that he and his friends had killed a police officer. At that moment, 
six police officers and five warders started to bean him with batons and metal pipes. He was 
hit on the head and lost consciousness. The findings of the forensic expert of the Special 
Rapporteur strongly corroborated the allegations of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>195. <b>Ricardo Wright </b>had been transferred from Horizon Remand Centre following the 
disturbances. He had been beaten with an iron bar and a baton, resulting in two fractured 
fingers and other injuries on his face and over the lower part of the breastbone. The findings 
of the forensic expert of the Special Rapporteur strongly corroborated the allegations of ill-
treatment. 
</p>
<p>196. <b>Darron Francis</b> had been transferred from Horizon Remand Centre following the 
disturbances. He noted that Officer Sente had beaten him with a metal pipe and that his 
wrist was broken when he tried to raise his arm to defend himself. The findings of the 
forensic expert of the Special Rapporteur strongly corroborated the allegations of ill-
treatment. 
</p>
<p>197. <b>Andrei Bent</b> had been transferred from Horizon Remand Centre following the 
disturbances. He had been kicked and beaten all over with a pipe and at one point lost 
consciousness. He had a fracture in his forearm, which he attributed to raising his arms to 
defend himself. 
</p>
<p>198. <b>Nicholas Merkle</b> had been transferred from Horizon Remand Centre following the 
disturbances. He had been beaten with iron pipes. He lost consciousness and woke up in the 
hospital. The findings of the forensic expert of the Special Rapporteur strongly 
corroborated the allegations of ill-treatment.

<p><b>  Windsor Children&#8217;s Home for Girls, St. Ann&#8217;s Bay 
Visited on 20 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>199. The Special Rapporteur was received by Superintendant<b> </b>Mollins (Ms) and Deputy 
Superintendant Curtis (Ms). At the time of the visit, there were 48 girls between the ages of 
12 and 18 detained there. 
</p>
<p>200. The youngest girl at Windsor was a 12-year-old; the majority of the girls were 13 to 14 
years. The two-story building resembled a prison and not a children&#8217;s home, with bars in 
the corridors and on the windows. The dorms were clean and all doors were open. The 
bathrooms and toilets were clean and well-kept. Each girl had her own bed with a mattress </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>57 
</b></p>
<p>and sheet. They also had cupboards and a sink with water and sanitary articles in their 
rooms. There were four to six beds per dorm. On the lower floor there was a cell which the 
girls called the &#8220;dark room&#8221;, which was used as a punishment cell. However, the room was 
not really dark, and the girls who were locked there as a punishment could also leave the 
room during the day. It was equipped with a bed.  
</p>
<p>201. The girls at Windsor were detained there for different reasons: some were deemed 
&#8220;uncontrollable&#8221;, some were orphans, and others were held there for their own protection 
(e.g. after having been sexually abused). 
</p>
<p>202. The evening before the visit of the Special Rapporteur, one girl had allegedly stabbed 
another girl with a knife. The injured girl had been taken to hospital, and the Superintendent 
was on her way back from Kingston to investigate the incident. All girls had been locked 
down because of the incident, meaning that they could not go outside of the building or 
leave the respective floors in the building. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p>203. <b>C.</b>, aged 14. She had been at the children&#8217;s home for almost a year. She indicated 
that the house mothers beat her on the head and verbally abused her. She had also been 
beaten by hand on her legs, back and head. She indicated that she had to take medication, 
but could not afford to pay for it. As a form of punishment, she had to clean the bathrooms, 
and she believed she had to do more work than the other girls.   
</p>
<p>204. <b>S.B.</b>, aged 16, did not remember when she had arrived at Windsor. She wanted to go 
home, but did not have any family members she could live with. She stated that the house 
mothers had beaten her in her face and back when she had tried to escape. She added that 
she did not like the other girls because they stole her personal items. 
</p>
<p>205. <b>J.A.F.</b>, aged 17, had to spend three years at Windsor for being &#8220;uncontrollable&#8221;. She 
complained primarily about the food. The girls had to get up between 6 and 7 a.m. The new 
arrivals went to school at the compound; the others went to school outside. At 1 p.m. they 
came back, had lunch and usually spent the afternoon outside playing games or doing 
sports. They could also work on computers. She alleged that at St. Ann&#8217;s Police Station she 
and her friend were discriminated and treated roughly (called &#8220;dogs&#8221;) because they were 
lesbians. She also alleged that at Windsor girls were discriminated against because of their 
colour of skin: If one had a lighter colour, she would get a nicer room, a TV and other 
privileges.  
</p>
<p>206. A<b> girl</b>, aged 16, had allegedly attacked another girl the evening before the visit of 
the Special Rapporteur. There had been a fight between the two girls; in the course of the 
events, the other girl had been stabbed with a knife. Although only these two girls were 
involved in the incident, the girl denied having stabbed the other. After the attack, one of 
the staff separated the two girls, and with the help of other girls, they pushed her out of the 
room. Then they took the wounded girl to the hospital and reported the incident to the 
police. She had no complaints regarding the conditions at Windsor. Some housemothers 
were nicer than others, but there were no beatings. Some men worked in the compound (as 
gardeners or for repair works) but they were not allowed to go inside the dormitories. If a 
girl left the compound or committed other offences, she would get locked into the &#8220;dark 
room&#8221; downstairs, sometimes for two days. If one had parents, she could be visited 
regularly.  
</p>
<p>207. <b>C. H.</b>, aged 14, had been at Windsor since March 2009. She complained about 
having a mental illness and other diseases, and seemed to show symptoms of schizophrenia. 
She indicated that she needed a brain examination which was very expensive. She was also 
scared and her neck hurt. Although she received medicine, the illness seemed to get worse. 
If a girl tried to leave the compound, she would be sent to the &#8220;dark room&#8221;. This had </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>58</b> 
</p>
<p>happened to her two days before. She had left the compound to go for a walk and returned 
by herself, but the housemothers put her into the &#8220;dark room&#8221; and told her she could not to 
leave the dormitory for two weeks. The &#8220;dark room&#8221; was not really dark, there was some 
light, but it was hot and there were many mosquitoes. Other punishments included cleaning, 
but there were no beatings. The food was alright; they got rice, chicken, peas, sandwiches, 
etc. 
</p>
<p>208. Joint interview with five girls, <b>M.</b>, aged 16 (seven months at Windsor for protection 
as a rape victim); <b>N.</b>, aged 16 (eight months at Windsor for being &#8220;uncontrollable&#8221;); <b>H.</b>, 
aged 15 (two months at Windsor for her own care and protection); <b>C.</b>, aged 16 (two years at 
Windsor for her own protection and for being &#8220;uncontrollable&#8221;); and <b>K.</b>, aged 15 (one 
month at Windsor for her own care and protection). The girls went to school outside of the 
compound. During certain holidays, they could go together to a hotel; some went home for 
holidays. There were no beatings at Windsor, but some housemothers were unfair, did not 
respect them and did not know how to deal with children. Sometimes, children were locked 
in the &#8220;dark room&#8221; for up to a week. Most disciplinary sanctions consisted in cleaning or 
doing other work. The food was sometimes cold. They had been locked down since the 
previous night.  
</p>
<p>209. <b>D. K.,</b> aged 14, had been at Windsor since 2005; prior to that she was kept at 
Maxfield, then Glenhope. She preferred Maxfield because she could go out of the 
compound. Many girls tried to escape from Windsor. They spent a lot of time playing 
sports like basketball and football. But at the time of the visit, they were in lock-down for a 
few days because a girl had stabbed another one. The girls often fought among each other. 
She had only been beaten once by a housemother, who slapped her on the back in 
December 2009. The housemothers were usually nice. The meditation room was a 
punishment room for girls who misbehaved or tried to escape. They usually spent less than 
ten days there. She had never been punished.

<p><b>  Hill Top Juvenile Correctional Centre for Boys, Bamboo, St. Ann 
Visited on 20 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>210. The Special Rapporteur was received by Joseph Small, Acting Overseer and Caulter 
Lawrence, Acting Overseer. At the time of the visit, 100 boys between 13 and 18 years old 
were in detention. The capacity of the centre was 96. 
</p>
<p>211. The prison consisted of a number of buildings, including the dormitories, 
workshops, agricultural buildings and educational facilities. The roughly 100 boys lived in 
three dormitories. There were two punishment cells for solitary confinement. The officers 
seemed to make efforts to vary the diet of the boys, and respect their dietary restrictions. 
However, there were consistent complaints about the quantity of food. 
</p>
<p>212. During the debriefing with Officer Small, the Special Rapporteur raised consistent 
allegations of beatings and the fact that the boys were locked in during the whole weekend. 
He unconvincingly explained that it was due to a lack of staff. 
</p>
<p><b>  Individual cases 
</b></p>
<p>213. <b>R. M.</b>, aged 15, had been at Hill Top for four months. Previously, he had spent two 
months at Montego Bay Police Station. He had been sentenced to imprisonment until his 
18th birthday for uncontrollable behaviour, as a result of troubles with his mother. He noted 
that he did not like sports and that he would prefer to play board or video games. He added 
that boys who were beaten were taken to the punishment cell, but that it had not happened </p>

</b></p>
<p>to him. He indicated that he would like to have more free time after dinner. His mother had 
visited him two weeks prior. 
</p>
<p>214. <b>F. W.</b>, aged 16. He stated that he did not get in trouble, and as a result had not been 
beaten at Hill Top. However, he noted that another boy had been beaten with a broomstick 
and dragged across the floor a few days before the visit. He had been at Hill Top since 
April 2009 for uncontrollable behaviour. He would be released when he turned 18. He 
complained that he did not receive enough food and that he was hungry every day. He also 
complained that the dormitories were sometimes locked-down for no apparent reason, and 
that the Superintendent beat the boys with a belt or a stick. He had been sick a few days 
before, and was taken to the doctor and given medication. He concluded that the judge sent 
them to Hill Top so that they could improve their behaviour and be able to go home; 
instead, they were beaten by the warders. 
</p>
<p>215. <b>D.G.</b>, aged 17, was arrested in late August 2008 and spent 14 nights at Portland 
Police Station on a cold bunk. Instead of toilets, the detainees had to use buckets in the cell. 
Then he spent nine days at St. Andrew Remand Centre before he was transferred to Hill 
Top in September 2008. He expected to be released on 3 September 2010. In the 
&#8220;Middlesex Dorm&#8221;, there were 41 boys who were split into four or five gangs. The daily 
routine was fairly strict: at 6 a.m. the boys had to wake up, shower, and clean the cells; at 
8.30 a.m. they received breakfast; at 9 a.m. they gathered for devotion; at 9.30 a.m. classes 
started (mathematics, English, social studies, science, etc.); from 12.30 to 2.30 p.m. the 
boys had lunch break; at 3 p.m. a muster check was conducted and then they could go for 
recreation outside (football, cricket, volley ball, table tennis, domino etc.); at 4.45 p.m. 
another muster check was conducted; at 5 p.m. they had supper; at 5.30 p.m. they had to go 
back to their dormitories (quiet time, meditation, TV, etc.); and bedtime was at 10 p.m. 
During the weekends, the boys had to stay in their dormitories. There were different types 
of punishments: taking away things like soap or new clothes; banning visits for up to two 
months (normally, they could receive visits every day); being put into the solitary 
punishment cells for up to three days; and confinement to the &#8220;sick boy area&#8221; where he had 
been last Monday from morning to evening. Sometimes, they were also beaten with hands 
and fists. According to him, Officer Brown was the most violent warder. The 
Superintendent was alright and Officers Small and Lawrence were very nice.  
</p>
<p>216. <b>M.C.,</b> aged 16, had arrived at Hill Top in November 2008 and expected to leave the 
facility in November 2010. The Superintendent was nice, but there had been a warder who 
beat him with a belt on the palm of his hand. The warder had since resigned. 
</p>
<p>217. <b>D.C</b>., aged 16, had been at Freeport Police Station from May 2007 to September 
2007. He noted that it was terrible, with six to eight people in the cell, sleeping on concrete. 
At Hill Top he liked that he learned a lot, and felt more protected than being outside in his 
community, where he would be dead by now. He had suffered greatly when both his 
parents recently passed away successively and he was not allowed to go to their funerals. 
He felt lonely and missed them a lot. He thought of them every night. 
</p>
<p>218. <b>E.</b>, aged 16, had been at Top Hill since February 2009. Prior to that, he had spent 
three days at Hanover Police Station with two others in a cell. When they started to fight, 
the police used pepper spray which caused burns, but they were not beaten. Then he spent 
another three days at Stony Hill (St. Andrew Remand Centre) which he considered to be 
better than Hill Top. At Hill Top, the officers treated them like animals and sometimes they 
beat and kicked them. On 22 December 2009, Officer Basil had also beaten him. The 
Superintendent also practiced corporal punishment in his office in the form of six strokes 
on the buttocks with a leather belt. He complained in particular that during weekends they 
were not allowed to go out of the dormitories. His mother died in 2004, and his father lived 
in Hanover but visited him only rarely. Visits took place in the Common Room, but usually </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/52/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>60</b> 
</p>
<p>only for 15 minutes. His birthday was on 9 March and he wished that his father would visit 
him. 
</p>
<p>219. <b>D.B.</b>, aged 17, had been detained at Hill Top since January 2007 and expected to be 
released in May 2010. When he came to Hill Top he could not read but he learned it in the 
meantime. Nevertheless, he had many wishes: better teaching and teaching materials, better 
mechanical training, a locker in the dorms for storing personal things, more food, better 
clothes, a toothpaste and a toothbrush. The Superintendent was a good person but Officer 
Ayle was beating the boys with a belt. 
</p>
<p>220. <b>B.B.</b>, aged 17, had been detained in the facility for eight months. Before that, he 
spent one year and four months at the Horizon Remand Centre and six months at Hunts Bay 
Police Station. At Hill Top the juveniles were treated badly. Some of the warders beat them 
with a big stick, which was bigger than a baton, on the legs and chest. On 16 February 
2010, he was in bed and was joking around with his friends. Five warders came into the cell 
and started beating him. They took him out of the cell. Officer Miro, who was the shift 
leader, kicked and punched him at the corner of the corridor. The warder butted him on the 
head, hit him in the eye with his elbow, and on the chest with his knee. Then he was taken 
to the reception office, where he was beaten with the branch of a willow tree measuring 
seven centimetres in diameter and one meter in length. Five officers beat him all over his 
body and in particular on his right leg. He was bleeding from his mouth. Later he was taken 
back to the cell and went to sleep after he had washed himself. This had not been the first 
time he was beaten. It happened often when detainees were beaten when they were making 
jokes. In addition, they were also put in a badly smelling punishment cell when they got 
into fights. The last time he had been in that cell was on 15 February for one night. 
Sometimes the juveniles were locked into the punishment cells alone, sometimes with one 
or two others. He was often put there and had to stay in for one or two nights. There was 
light in the room and a bucket instead of a toilet. He was never beaten on the buttocks and 
never had to kneel as a punishment but had to do push-ups or clean the floor or run for a 
certain time. The boys had to get up at 6:30 a.m., took a bath, had some free time and had to 
clean the cell. At 8:00 a.m. they had breakfast and at 9:00 a.m. devotion. They had classes 
such as mathematics or mechanics until 11:00 a.m. Then they could play football and had 
lunch at noon. Later they either took a nap or played inside the cells. In the afternoon they 
had classes and ate supper at 5:00 p.m. After that time they were locked down again. The 
lights in the cells were on all night. Sometimes the boys fought in the dormitory and the 
warders would normally separate them. Some of the warders were &#8220;gangsters&#8221;, because 
they did not give the boys any water or other things. Sometimes there was not enough food 
for all the inmates, partly because the kitchen workers, who were also inmates, stole it. He 
did not receive any visits and could not get phone calls. He sold his hygienic articles in 
order to get some clothes. In 2009, one boy tried to hang himself with his shirt on the bars. 
He was beaten for his suicide attempt. 
</p>
<p>221. <b>R.G.</b>, aged 16, had been detained in the facility for two months. Before that, he had 
been detained at Freeport Police Station in Montego Bay. At Hill Top Correctional Centre 
he had not been treated badly or beaten because he did not cause any trouble. He had never 
been detained in the punishment cell. He had one more year to serve. His family did not 
come to visit him. Every day somebody was fighting in the dorm. He had found nails in the 
food, in a cake and in the rice, which were placed there by the warders, who often did evil 
things. Other detainees had been beaten with a belt. In Montego Bay he had spent five 
months in the police station, together with other boys. When the boys were making too 
much noise they were beaten in their cells with batons by the police officers. All of the 
boys were beaten almost every day by nearly all the officers on duty. They had to spend the 
entire day in the cell and could never go out. He had not been interrogated there. After 
Montego Bay, he was sent to St. Andrew for three days, where the conditions were better </p>

Hill Top was very dirty. 
</p>
<p><b>  Montego Bay Police Station (&#8220;Freeport&#8221;), Montego Bay 
Visited on 20 February 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b>  General information 
</b></p>
<p>222. The Special Rapporteur was received by Superintendent Winston Milton, Inspector 
Moore and Inspector Shore, Custody Officer. At the time of the visit, there were 159 
detainees at the lock-up, including nine females, nine children, 11 convicted and 113 
remandees. 
</p>
<p>223. Freeport Police Station was one of the worst police lock-ups the Special Rapporteur 
had ever seen. 159 detainees, including women and juveniles, were kept like animals in 
overcrowded, dark and filthy cells for up to four years. There was only one corridor with a 
number of cells on each side. At the initial part of the corridor, there were six cells where 
women and juveniles were kept separated from the men. The wires of the doors were so 
tight that very little light and air came into the cells and the detainees were almost 
suffocating because of the heat and lack of oxygen. The cell doors were closed all day and 
the cells had no windows. There was a toilet and water in each cell. 
</p>
<p>224. In the back section of the corridor, behind a barred door, the men were detained in 
similar cells. Most cell doors were closed but some were open, and some men were in the 
shower or on the toilets, which were all extremely dirty. Further down the corridor, it 
became darker, filthier and smellier. The Special Rapporteur observed that the lock-up was 
infested with cockroaches and other insects, which in the pitch dark cells could only be 
seen with the help of a flashlight.  
</p>
<p>225. The whole lock-up was very noisy and the entire atmosphere was extremely violent 
and tense. Inter-prisoner violence and regular beatings by police staff with black batons 
were reported to be the norm. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s opinion, such a working 
atmosphere was inhuman even for police staff.  
</p>
<p>226. The head of the lock-up agreed with the Special Rapporteur that the conditions of 
detention were inhuman. In a conversation with the Superintendent, the latter indicated that 
the situation was not ideal, but that he had to work with what he had. He added that he had 
never received any complaints of ill-treatment or abuse, and that he often went from cell to 
cell, speaking to the detainees. However, he stated that there were some incidents of 
violence among the detainees. With regard to medical treatment, he indicated that detainees 
were taken to see a doctor when they so requested. The Special Rapporteur strongly urges
