<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This addendum contains a summary of key findings and examples from a series of 
reports prepared on behalf of the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General 
(the Special Representative) on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and 
other business enterprises, appointed pursuant to resolution 2005/69 of the Commission on 
Human Rights.  The reports map the obligations of States to regulate and adjudicate corporate 
activities under the United Nations core human rights treaties.  The addendum outlines the 
overall trends appearing from treaty-specific reports, and makes preliminary observations as to 
how the treaty-based human rights machinery may be applied to further strengthen human rights 
protection and promotion in the context of corporate activity. 
</p>
<p> The treaties, as interpreted by their respective treaty bodies, require States to play a key 
role in effectively regulating and adjudicating corporate activities with regard to human rights.  
This role is generally considered as being part of the State duty to protect against abuse by third 
parties.  Treaty body commentaries from the past decade show a trend towards increasing 
pressure on States to fulfil this duty in relation to corporate activities, regardless of whether the 
entities in question are privately or publicly-owned or controlled. 
</p>
<p> Moreover, while older treaties are more likely to speak generally about the duties of 
States to protect against interference with the enjoyment of rights, more recently-adopted treaties 
explicitly mention private businesses in this respect.  All of this indicates the emergence of clear 
State obligations to prevent and punish corporate abuse, where failure to do so will be considered 
a violation of treaty obligations. 
</p>
<p> The State duty to protect applies to all rights.  However, some rights have been discussed 
more frequently in relation to the role of States in curbing abuse arising from corporate activities.  
These include the rights to non-discrimination and equality; minority rights; labour rights; 
privacy rights; rights related to health and living conditions; the prohibitions related to racial 
hatred and harmful gender stereotypes and prejudices; and rights enjoyed by indigenous peoples, 
including cultural rights. 
</p>
<p> The treaty bodies also tend to focus on certain types of companies and business sectors 
requiring regulation, although this does not detract from the broad duties of States to protect 
against all abuse by all types of entities.  For example, in providing recommendations to 
particular States in the employment context, the treaty bodies not only refer generally to 
&#8220;employers&#8221;, but have also expressed particular concern about the mining, manufacturing and 
agricultural industries.  The treaty bodies also frequently recommend that States take steps to 
regulate and adjudicate the acts of mining, extractive, logging and property development 
companies, especially in the context of resource exploitation in the lands and territories of 
indigenous peoples.  In relation to health, the treaty bodies not only refer to private health-care 
providers but also to pharmaceutical companies, marketing companies and extractive and 
manufacturing companies engaging in activities which could threaten food and water resources.  
Finally, the media and communication networks are discussed with respect to the sexual 
exploitation of children, and to their role in preventing or spreading prejudices on the basis of 
race, sex or in relation to persons with disabilities. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.1 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p> States are required to take a variety of measures in order to effectively protect against 
corporate abuse.  They must generally monitor compliance by third parties and in most cases 
introduce legislative measures to prohibit abuse and proscribe certain behaviour; establish 
administrative and judicial mechanisms to effectively and impartially investigate all complaints 
and bring perpetrators to justice; and facilitate the provision of effective remedies, including the 
provision of reparation to victims, where appropriate.  The treaty bodies have also called for 
measures to increase awareness amongst the private sector of the human rights impact of their 
activities and to encourage the development by private businesses of codes of conduct in respect 
of human rights. 
</p>
<p> There is less guidance as to whether the State may fulfil its duty to protect by focusing on 
the acts of natural persons within the offending business enterprise or whether it is obliged to 
regulate and adjudicate the business enterprise as an entity.  The reason may be that, in line with 
significant discretion given by the treaties on implementation, the treaty bodies are focused on 
protection against abuse and of the enjoyment of rights.  Nevertheless, newer treaties, in 
particular the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography and the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, seem at a 
minimum to contemplate liability for business enterprises. 
</p>
<p> Most of the treaty bodies have not discussed whether States are required to exercise 
extraterritorial jurisdiction over the acts of business enterprises abroad.  Indeed, the strongest 
pattern one can ascertain is a trend towards the treaty bodies recommending that States influence 
the overseas actions of business enterprises over which they can exercise jurisdiction, although 
States appear to have wide latitude in deciding which measures should be used to that effect.  
None of the treaties or treaty bodies suggests that exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction is 
prohibited, although it is clear that States should act within the limits imposed by the principle of 
non-intervention under international law. 
</p>
<p> This research has shown that the treaty-based human rights machinery has been paying 
increasing attention to the regulation of States and adjudication of corporate activities and 
already plays an important role in elaborating the duties of States.  However, even more 
guidance from the treaty bodies on the scope and content of State obligations arising from the 
treaties regarding such activities could further support States in the fulfilment of these duties and 
bring additional clarity to rights-holders and business enterprises.  To this end, it would seem 
beneficial if the treaty bodies were to engage in discussions amongst themselves on this issue, as 
well as to address more specifically these duties. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This addendum to the report of the Special Representative of the United Nations 
Secretary-General (SRSG) on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and 
other business enterprises, appointed pursuant to Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 2005/69, summarizes information, trends and preliminary findings contained in a 
series of reports examining States&#8217; obligations in relation to corporate activity under the 
United Nations&#8217; core human rights treaties.<b>1</b>  Each report in the series is specific to a particular 
treaty and maps the scope and content of States parties&#8217; responsibilities to regulate and 
adjudicate the actions of business enterprises under that treaty,<b>2</b> and as clarified by the relevant 
treaty body.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>2. The mapping of States&#8217; obligations under the human rights treaties has been undertaken 
to assist the SRSG in implementing paragraph (b) of his mandate from the then Commission on 
Human Rights to &#8220;elaborate on the role of States in effectively regulating and adjudicating&#8221; 
business enterprises with regard to human rights.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The following treaties were considered as part of this series<i>:  </i>the International Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD); the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights (ICESCR); the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against 
Women (CEDAW); the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment (CAT), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC); the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members 
of their Families (ICRMW); and the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities (ICRPD).  See the individual reports for more detail.  All reports will be made 
available as they are completed at http://www.business-humanrights.org/Gettingstarted/ 
UNSpecialRepresentative.  Given time and resource constraints, a summary of the ICRPD 
(adopted by the General Assembly in December 2006) will supplement the individual treaty 
reports in the series but it is not analysed in detail here.  This Convention, which has not yet 
entered into force, contains specific references to business. 
<b>2
</b>  It should be noted that the reports do not discuss direct obligations for corporations - their 
</p>
<p>focus is on State obligations. 
<b>3
</b>  The human rights treaty bodies are committees of independent experts that monitor 
</p>
<p>implementation of the core international human rights treaties<i>.  </i>They are usually established 
under the provisions of the treaty that they monitor.

</p>
<p>3. The reports analyse a representative sample of primary materials associated with each 
treaty:<b>5</b>  the treaty provisions; general comments or recommendations by the Committees;<b> 
</b>concluding observations on States&#8217; periodic reports;<b>6</b> and Opinions on communications as well 
as Decisions under Early Warning Measures and Urgent Procedures.<b>7 
</b></p>
<p>4. The reports are based on references by the treaties and treaty bodies to States&#8217; duties to 
regulate and adjudicate corporate activities.<b>8</b>  However, as it is less common for the treaty bodies 
to refer explicitly to corporations, the reports also highlight more general references to State 
obligations regarding acts by non-State actors. 
</p>
<p>5. It should be noted that the research focused on States&#8217; obligations in relation to rights 
impacted by corporate activities, rather than on corporate entities as possible rights-holders.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>6. Finally, while basic research has been completed for all of the treaties, not all of the 
treaty-specific reports have been finalized and this addendum therefore summarizes only 
preliminary trends.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  The ICRMW report relies to some extent on secondary sources because of the scarcity of 
</p>
<p>primary sources from the recently established Committee on Migrant Workers (CMW). 
<b>6
</b>  Due to time and resource constraints, the research was limited to examination of concluding 
</p>
<p>observations and decisions from the eight most recent sessions of the various treaty bodies.  See 
each report for information on the specific research methodology used.  As the research for most 
of the treaties was concluded by November 2006 or earlier for some of the treaties, information 
from the treaty bodies&#8217; most recent sessions could not always be included. 
<b>7
</b>  The ICCPR, CAT, ICERD, CEDAW and ICMW all have associated individual complaints 
</p>
<p>mechanisms.  CEDAW and CAT also have procedures for urgent inquiries.  CERD has an early 
warning procedure. 
<b>8
</b>  Drawing on the SRSG&#8217;s mandate, this report uses &#8220;regulation&#8221; to refer to treaty body language 
</p>
<p>recommending legislative or other measures designed to prevent or monitor abuse by business 
enterprises, and &#8220;adjudication&#8221; to refer to judicial or other measures to punish or remediate 
abuse. 
<b>9
</b>  The United Nations human rights treaties have not been interpreted to protect the rights of 
</p>
<p>corporate bodies.  This is in contrast to e.g. the European Convention on Human Rights, many 
rights of which have been extended to benefit companies or other (non-state) legal entities. 
<b>10
</b></p>
<p>  While research on all treaties has been done, at the time of writing, only reports for ICERD, 
ICRMW, ICCPR and ICESCR have been finalized or are in the process of being finalized.  Thus 
readers should be aware that more specific references to those four treaties in this addendum 
should not be seen as any indication that the CRC, CAT and CEDAW are less relevant for this 
project. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  THE DUTY TO PROTECT 
</b></p>
<p>7. The treaty specific reports show that in discussing corporate activity, the treaty bodies are 
mainly concerned with States&#8217; obligations to protect rights against interferences occurring in the 
context of that activity - in other words, States&#8217; obligations as part of the duty to protect.  The 
treaty bodies describe the duty to protect against human rights violations as being part of the 
duty to ensure enjoyment of rights.  States have positive obligations to prevent and punish third 
party interference with the enjoyment of rights.<b>11</b>  Failure to abide by these obligations may 
amount to a violation of the State&#8217;s treaty obligations.<b>12</b>  An examination of the treaties and 
treaty bodies&#8217; commentary and jurisprudence (as will be discussed below) confirms that the duty 
to protect includes preventing corporations - both national and transnational, publicly or 
privately owned - from breaching rights and taking steps to punish them and provide reparation 
to victims when they do so. 
</p>
<p>8. Unlike secondary rules of State attribution, the duty to protect has been interpreted by the 
treaty bodies to be a substantive duty which will only be breached if the State fails to take steps 
to prevent and punish abuse.<b>13</b>  Where the State does act to fulfil its positive obligations by the 
adoption of all reasonable measures which could be expected in the circumstances but is still 
unable to prevent interference, it is unlikely to be considered to have breached any treaty 
obligations - it will not be held responsible for corporate abuse per se. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  CAT requires instigation, consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in 
</p>
<p>an official capacity to an act of torture in order for the Convention to apply.  This means the duty 
to protect only arises from that Convention where the third party abuse has somehow been 
instigated, acquiesced in or consented to by the State.  However, &#8220;acquiescence&#8221; has been 
interpreted quite broadly so that the State&#8217;s failure to police abuses by non-State actors may 
amount to acquiescence. 
<b>12
</b></p>
<p>  For example, CESCR general comment 18 on the right to work explains that violations of the 
duty to protect could include the failure to &#8220;regulate the activities of individuals, groups or 
corporations so as to prevent them from violating the right to work of others&#8221;.  General 
comment 18, &#8216;The Right to Work&#8217;, UN Doc. E/C.12/GC/18, adopted 24 November 2005 at 
para. 35.  (Hereinafter referred to as CESCR general comment 18.) 
<b>13
</b></p>
<p>  The secondary rules of State responsibility are beyond the scope of this addendum.  Suffice 
to say that the State may be held accountable where corporations perform public functions or 
are state-controlled.  See the International Law Commission&#8217;s articles on &#8220;Responsibility 
of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts&#8221;, adopted in November 2001 by the ILC 
(UN Doc. A/56/10 2001) and taken note of by the United Nations General Assembly 
(Res 56/83); both available at http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N01/477/97/ 
PDF/N0147797.pdf?OpenElement.  For detailed commentary, see James Crawford, &#8220;The 
International Law Commission&#8217;s Articles on State Responsibility&#8221; (Cambridge<i>:  </i>CUP, 2002). </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>9. The Human Rights Committee (HRC), which monitors the implementation of the ICCPR, 
refers specifically to the need to act with &#8220;due diligence&#8221; in fulfilling the duty to protect.<b>14</b>  
However, while the Committee on the Elimination against Women (CEDAW) has also adopted 
the concept, mainly in relation to violence against women,<b>15</b> other treaty body references are 
more piecemeal and do not suggest that the concept is widely used within the United Nations 
treaty bodies system. 
</p>
<p>10. The emphasis on the duty to protect does not mean that other State duties usually 
associated with human rights, such as the duties to respect, promote and fulfil, are irrelevant to 
strengthening corporate responsibility and accountability.  Indeed, the Committee on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has confirmed that the States parties can violate the duty to 
respect if they fail to take into account their Covenant obligations &#8220;when entering into bilateral 
or multilateral agreements with other States, international organizations and other entities such as 
multinational entities.&#8221;<b>16</b>  States can also be found to breach the duty to respect if State-owned or 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>14
</b>  General comment No. 31, &#8216;The Nature of the General Legal Obligation Imposed on States 
</p>
<p>Parties to the Covenant&#8217;, adopted 29 March 2004 (80th Session), at para. 8, reproduced in 
&#8216;Compilation of General Comments and general recommendations Adopted by Human Rights 
Treaty Bodies&#8217;, UN Doc. HRI/GEN/1/Rev.7, 12 May 2004, at 192.  (Hereinafter referred to as 
&#8220;UN Human Rights Compilation&#8221;) (General comment hereinafter referred to as HRC general 
comment 31).  The concept of &#8220;due diligence&#8221; as applied to human rights law is generally 
associated with the Inter-American Court of Human Rights&#8217; decision in <i>Velasquez Rodriguez</i> 
which confirmed that States could be held responsible for private acts where they fail to act with 
&#8220;due diligence&#8221; to prevent or respond to violations.  Velasquez Rodriguez Case, Judgment of 
July 29, 1988, Inter-Am.Ct.H.R. (Ser. C) No. 4 (1988) paragraphs 166-174.  The case concerned 
violations by State sponsored forces but the opinion notes that States have similar obligations to 
prevent or respond to private acts not directly attributable to the State.  See at para. 172:  &#8220;An 
illegal act which violates human rights and which is initially not directly imputable to a State (for 
example, because it is the act of a private person or because the person responsible has not been 
identified) can lead to international responsibility of the state, not because of the act itself, but 
because of the lack of due diligence to prevent the violation or to respond to it as required by the 
Convention &#8230;&#8221; 
<b>15
</b></p>
<p>  For example, see general recommendation 19, &#8216;Violence against women&#8217;, 11th Session (1992) 
at para. 9, UN Human Rights Compilation at 246.  (Hereinafter referred to as CEDAW general 
recommendation 19.)  The Committee refers to article 2 (e) of the Convention which calls on 
States to take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination by any person, organization or 
enterprise and provides that &#8220;under general international law and specific human rights 
covenants, States may also be responsible for private acts if they fail to act with due diligence<b> </b>to 
prevent violations of rights or to investigate and punish acts of violence, and for providing 
compensation&#8221;.<b>

</p>
<p>controlled enterprises or other companies exercising public functions (in situations where their 
acts may be attributed to the State) do not refrain from abuse or if the State has laws or policies 
which facilitate abuse by business enterprises.<b>17</b>  Furthermore, the treaty bodies suggest that it is 
important for States to promote human rights awareness for business enterprises. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  REFERENCES TO BUSINESS ENTERPRISES 
</b></p>
<p>11. This Part focuses on treaty provisions and treaty body commentaries which explicitly and 
implicitly refer to State obligations in relation to acts by business enterprises, including 
particular sectors or industries.  Implicit references are considered to be where the treaties or 
treaty bodies refer generally to the duty to protect against third party abuse and it can be implied 
that corporate abuse must also be prevented. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Treaties 
</b></p>
<p>12. References to business enterprises in the actual treaties are not very common.  When 
treaties do refer to business, they tend to mention particular sectors rather than generally 
referring to private business.  There are exceptions, however, with the newer treaties being more 
explicit in their references to business. 
</p>
<p>13. Of the older treaties, CEDAW is most explicit in referring to business by requiring States 
in article 2 (e) to take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women by any 
enterprise.  In relation to more recently adopted treaties, the Optional Protocol to the CRC on the 
Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography (OPSC), adopted in May 2000, 
requires States to prohibit practices such as the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, including taking action against &#8220;legal persons&#8221; where appropriate.<b>18</b>  The ICRPD 
(which has not yet been researched in detail for the purposes of this project), adopted in 
December 2006, is the most explicit and refers directly to both private enterprises and private 
entities.  For example, article 4 requires States parties &#8220;to take all appropriate measures to 
eliminate discrimination on the basis of disability by any person, organization or private 
enterprise.&#8221;  Article 9 requires that States ensure private entities<b> </b>offering public services and 
facilities &#8220;take into account&#8221; accessibility to persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>14. The treaties are also increasingly referring to particular sectors, implying that the State 
must regulate and adjudicate the acts of business enterprises in those sectors.  Starting with the 
older treaties, article 5 (f) of ICERD requires States parties to undertake to prohibit and eliminate

</p>
<p><b>17
</b>  See note 15. 
</p>
<p><b>18
</b>  See art. 3 (4) OPSC.  Note that the CRC report will also briefly discuss the Optional Protocol 
</p>
<p>on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (OPAC).  It was considered less relevant for 
this addendum as unlike the OPSC it does not specifically mention legal persons or commercial 
industries. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.1

</p>
<p>racial discrimination in the right of access to places or services intended for use by the general 
public, including transport, hotels, restaurants, cafes and theatres.  As explained further below, 
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) has interpreted this 
provision as requiring States to regulate so as to prevent private owners of such facilities 
from engaging in racial discrimination.  Article 13 (b) of CEDAW seems to necessitate 
regulation of the banking industry by requiring States to eliminate discrimination in economic 
and social life, including concerning the right to bank loans, mortgages and other forms of 
financial credit.  Similarly, article 14 (2) (g) requires States to take appropriate measures to 
ensure equal rights for rural women, including access to agricultural credit and loans and 
marketing facilities. 
</p>
<p>15. Article 17 (a) of the CRC requires States to encourage the mass media to disseminate 
information of social and cultural benefit to children.<b>19</b>  Furthermore, the Preamble to the OPSC 
specifically expresses concern about sex tourism<b> </b>and the availability of child pornography on 
the Internet.  It also stresses the importance of closer cooperation between governments and the 
Internet industry in combating child pornography. 
</p>
<p>16. There are a number of ways in which the treaties implicitly require States to protect 
against corporate abuse.  First, some of the treaties specifically require States to regulate the acts 
of third parties or organizations, which - unless explicitly stated otherwise - may include 
business enterprises, depending on the particular context.  For example, article 2 (1) (d) of 
ICERD requires States to prohibit and end racial discrimination by any &#8220;persons, group or 
organization&#8221;.  Article 16 (2) of the ICRMW provides that migrant workers and members of 
their families are entitled to &#8220;effective protection&#8221; by States parties against &#8220;violence, physical 
injury, threats and intimidation, whether by public officials or by private individuals, groups or 
institutions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>17. Second, a treaty may require particular State actions to protect rights which would be 
difficult to fulfil without regulation or adjudication of the acts of third parties, including business 
enterprises.  For example, a State&#8217;s duty to ensure the enjoyment of rights under a treaty may 
require that the State takes appropriate or effective measures, including proscriptive legislation 
and sanctions, to prevent abuse.<b>20</b>  Indeed, such directions often concern rights which relate to 
certain contexts and situations in which business enterprises are so closely involved that it is 
unlikely the State could fulfil its obligations without regulating these entities.  Examples 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>19
</b>  The CRC also requires some monitoring of private social welfare institutions and educational 
</p>
<p>institutions (the latter are also mentioned in CEDAW and ICESCR) but this is not explored in 
detail here as such institutions are not considered as falling within the mandate&#8217;s conception of 
business enterprises. 
<b>20
</b></p>
<p>  Examples abound from the treaties and appear in the individual treaty reports.  
Once finalized, all reports will be made available at http://www.business-humanrights.org/

</p>
<p>include provisions dealing with employment situations and access to services 
without discrimination.<b>21</b>  The treaty bodies tend to interpret these provisions as including 
a requirement for States to protect against abuse by all third parties, including business 
enterprises. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Treaty body commentaries 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) General comments and recommendations22 
</b>18. There are no general comments or recommendations focusing solely on States&#8217; duties to 
protect rights in the context of corporate activities - rather, they tend to refer to business 
enterprises as part of discussions regarding various rights or vulnerable groups requiring 
protection.  General comments and recommendations in this context tend to mention specific 
business sectors, such as the extractive industry or pharmaceutical companies.  In addition, many 
general comments and recommendations refer to protection against corporate abuse in broad 
terms, for instance by confirming State duties to protect against abuse by &#8220;the private sector&#8221;, 
&#8220;the labour market&#8221;, &#8220;employment&#8221;, &#8220;the informal sector&#8221;, or in relation to &#8220;privately provided 
services&#8221;.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>19. Beginning with the more explicit references, general comments from CESCR dealing 
with the right to work, the right to health, and the right to water specifically confirm the State&#8217;s 
duty to protect against abuse by business enterprises.<b>24</b>  In fact, every CESCR general comment 
since general comment 12 on the right to adequate food in 1999 asserts, usually explicitly, that in 
order to fulfil the duty to protect States must regulate and adjudicate the acts of business 
enterprises. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>21
</b>  See for example OPSC art. 3; CRC art. 3(3), 19 and 32; and ICERD art. 2(1)(d) and 5(f). 
</p>
<p><b>22
</b>  Only general comments or recommendations relating to ICESCR, ICERD, CEDAW, the CRC 
</p>
<p>and the ICCPR are discussed.  The CMW has not yet published any general comments and CAT 
only has one general comment which is not relevant to this research (see general comment No. 1, 
&#8216;Implementation of article 3 of the Convention in the context of article 22&#8217;<i>,</i> 27 November 1997, 
contained in annex IX of UN Doc. A/53/44 and UN Human Rights Compilation at 291.

</b></p>
<p>  These terms are used by CESCR, CERD, CEDAW, and CRC in their general comments.

comment 14.) </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.1

</p>
<p>20. General comments from the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) also highlight 
that the State has ultimate responsibility for preventing abuse by the private sector, including 
business enterprises.<b>25</b>  For example, general comment 5 on measures of implementation 
confirms that &#8220;the process of privatization of services can have a serious impact on the 
recognition and realization of children&#8217;s rights&#8221;,<b>26</b> and that even where services have been 
privatized, the State must ensure private sector compliance with the convention.<b>27</b>  The 
Committee specifically defines the phrase &#8220;private sector&#8221; as including businesses.<b>28</b>  The most 
recent general recommendation from CEDAW confirms the Committee&#8217;s view that States must 
protect women against discrimination by private enterprises in the public as well as private 
spheres.<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p>21. Some general comments also refer to specific business sectors.  For example, CESCR 
general comment 15 on the right to water focuses on public and private water providers, 
stressing that the &#8220;obligation to protect requires States parties to prevent third parties from 
interfering in any way with the enjoyment to the right to water.  Third parties include 
individuals, groups, corporations and other entities as well as agents acting under their 
authority.&#8221;<b>30</b>  General comment 14 on the right to the highest attainable standard of health

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.1 
 page 15 
 
</p>
<p>discusses food and medicine manufacturers and the extractive and manufacturing industries.  For 
example, it provides that the duty to protect includes &#8220;the duties of States &#8230; to control the 
marketing of medical equipment and medicines by third parties&#8221;<b>31</b> and highlights that the State 
could violate the duty to protect if among other things it fails to regulate the activities of 
corporations; protect consumers and workers; &#8220;discourage production, marketing and 
consumption of tobacco, narcotics and other harmful substances&#8221; and &#8220;enact or enforce laws to 
prevent the pollution of water, air and soil by extractive and manufacturing industries&#8221;.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>22. Similarly, the CRC mentions the need to &#8220;regulate or prohibit information on and 
marketing of substances such as alcohol and tobacco, particularly when it targets children and 
adolescents&#8221;.<b>33</b>  And in general comment 28 on the equality of rights between men and women, 
the HRC said that States should &#8220;take the lead in implementing all measures necessary to 
eliminate discrimination against women in all fields, for example by prohibiting discrimination 
by private actors in areas such as employment, education, political activities and the provision of 
accommodation, goods and services&#8221;.<b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>23. Among other things, CERD has focused on companies involved in major infrastructure 
and extractives projects affecting indigenous peoples.  For example, general recommendation 23 
on the rights of indigenous peoples notes that indigenous peoples have lost resources to 
commercial companies<b> </b>and calls for recognition and protection of indigenous people&#8217;s rights to 
&#8220;own, develop, control and use their communal lands, territories and resources&#8221;.<b>35</b>  Where 
deprivation of land or resources does occur, States should &#8220;take steps to return those lands and 
territories&#8221;.<b>36</b>  The implication is that States are obliged to regulate and adjudicate the acts of 
commercial companies to prevent abuse of rights enjoyed by indigenous peoples and to ensure 
effective remedies, including reparation, where necessary. 
</p>
<p>24. Further, CERD general recommendation 27 on discrimination against the Roma notes 
that States should &#8220;encourage awareness among professionals of all media&#8221; regarding the need to 
avoid dissemination of prejudicial material and even recommends that States encourage

<p>actors in a number of ways, including &#8220;third parties&#8221;, &#8220;private actors&#8221;, &#8220;private entities&#8221;, &#8220;legal 
persons&#8221; and &#8220;private agencies&#8221;.  Unless stated otherwise, the treaty bodies&#8217; use of these terms 
implies that States must take action against abuse by a broad range of non-State actors, including 
business enterprises. 
</p>
<p>27. A good example in this respect is the HRC&#8217;s most recent general comment 31 on the 
nature of the general legal obligation imposed on States parties to the Covenant, which contains 
strong wording about the duty to protect against violations by private persons or entities.<b>46</b>  It 
says that &#8220;the positive obligations on States Parties to ensure Covenant rights will only be fully 
discharged if individuals are protected by the State, not just against violations of Covenant rights 
by its agents, but also against acts committed by private persons or entities&#8230;&#8221;<b>47</b>  The HRC 
confirms that States could breach their Covenant obligations where they permit or fail &#8220;to take 
appropriate measures or to exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate or redress the 
harm caused by such acts by private persons or entities&#8221;.<b>48</b>  Other general comments from the 
HRC also implicitly refer to corporations by confirming the State&#8217;s duty to protect against 
private actions and abuses by &#8220;private agencies&#8221;, &#8220;legal persons&#8221; and &#8220;private bodies&#8221;.<b>49</b>

<p><b>(ii) Concluding observations

reports on their compliance with the relevant treaty.  They provide general guidance as well as 
recommendations on specific issues of concern, which may relate to State obligations regarding 
the activities of particular businesses or sectors operating in the State. 
</p>
<p>29. When issues before the treaty bodies involve activities related to business activity, 
concluding observations often contain general expressions of concern about such activities, 
rather than specifying whether or how States are expected to regulate or adjudicate the entities 
behind those activities.<b>50</b>  The Committees&#8217; focus is on the protection of rights - whether the

<p>  This should be contrasted to discussions about labour rights, in which the Committees 
regularly provide directions as to which measures which must be taken to protect against abuse 
by employers. </p>

<p>violation is caused by a State organ, a business entity or any other private actor seems less 
relevant than the result (the protection and promotion of human rights).<b>51</b>  Yet expressions of 
concern from the Committees about corporate activities strongly imply that in order to achieve 
this result, States are expected to take steps to regulate and adjudicate the acts of business 
enterprises involved in such activities. 
</p>
<p>30. The following table provides examples of the various types of business enterprises/ 
sectors referred to in concluding observations.<b>52</b>  The fact that the Committees have referred to 
particular sectors should not be taken as a sign that they do not consider States responsible for 
protecting against abuse by other types of enterprises.  On the contrary, Committees may 
examine States&#8217; obligations in relation to any corporate act in any field of activity.

</p>
<p>31. Many concluding observations also refer generally to the need to protect against abuse by 
employers, especially in order to prevent and punish forced labour, unsafe working conditions 
and discrimination.  Most of these recommendations are drafted broadly so that they require 
action against both private and public employers. 
</p>
<p>32. Further, concluding observations from CESCR, CERD and CEDAW in particular tend to 
express concern about major infrastructure development and extractives projects affecting 
indigenous peoples.  While the Committees do not always specify that the State should take steps 
to regulate and adjudicate the activities of companies involved in such projects, the implication 
appears to be that they should do so in order to address the Committees&#8217; concerns.<b>53</b> 
</p>
<p>33. Concluding observations also highlight that States are responsible for abuses associated 
with both privately and publicly run detention facilities.<b>54</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(iii) Decisions under individual communications  
</b>34. The ICCPR, CAT, ICERD, CEDAW and ICRMW all have associated individual 
complaints mechanisms for alleged violations by a State party of rights under its jurisdiction.<b>55</b> 
35. Both the HRC and CERD have shown a willingness to declare admissible 
communications concerning a State&#8217;s failure to protect against abuse by business enterprises.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>53
</b>  For example, CERD&#8217;s concluding observations in relation to the protection of indigenous 
</p>
<p>peoples apply to cases of both public and private extractive companies active in indigenous 
areas.  Even when private mining companies seem to be the main cause of environmental 
pollution in indigenous areas, CERD emphasizes the State obligation to remedy any health or 
environmental damage in this respect, without mentioning the need to adjudicate the company.  
This does not necessarily mean that States should not adjudicate companies.  It means that 
what is most important is the protection of rights and redress for any violation thereof.

<p>  At the time of writing, analysis of the CEDAW and CAT decisions remained incomplete so 
the trends in this section only apply to the ICCPR (under the First Optional Protocol) and ICERD 
procedures.  The ICRMW procedure is not yet operative.  References to ICERD trends relate to 
Individual Communications and Decisions under Early Warning Measures and Urgent 
Procedures. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.1 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>Indeed, the HRC has rejected arguments from States that such communications are inadmissible, 
making it clear that the State may be held responsible under the First Optional Protocol for 
failing to protect against third party abuse.<b>56</b> 
</p>
<p>36. The HRC communications concerning business enterprises tend to involve discrimination 
by companies in their roles as employers or complaints regarding interference with the rights of 
indigenous peoples by mining, logging and property development companies.<b>57</b>  Similarly, 
CERD communications in this area mainly relate to racial discrimination by various private 
companies, such as textile, construction or insurance companies, and in relation to access to 
services, such as banking/lending services, recreational venues and private housing agencies.<b>58</b>  
Further, Decisions under Early Warning Measures and Urgent Procedures have expressed 
concern about large scale mining operations and companies, including multinationals. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Trends 
</b></p>
<p>37. The above analysis highlights the ever-increasing recognition by the treaty bodies of 
States&#8217; obligations to protect against human rights abuses arising from corporate activities, 
especially in the last five to ten years.  For example, of the eight CESCR general comments 
which explicitly refer to business enterprises, it is the four most recent (with a date range 
of 1999-2005) which most strongly identify a duty to protect in relation to corporations.  And 
nearly all of the Committee&#8217;s general comments since 1999 discuss the duty to protect as 
requiring State action against abuse by third parties.  Further, the HRC&#8217;s most explicit statement 
on the duty to protect in relation to private entities comes from 2004. 
</p>
<p>38. The treaty body commentaries together with newly adopted treaties expressly mentioning 
State duties regarding business activities indicate the emergence of a concrete duty for States to 
prevent and punish a wide range of corporate abuse, where failure to do so will be considered a 
violation of treaty obligations.

<p><b>III.  MEASURES STATES ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE 
A.  Monitoring 
</b></p>
<p>39. The State&#8217;s duty to take steps to prevent and punish abuse may necessitate a variety of 
measures.  In particular, the treaty bodies require in most cases that abuse is prohibited by law, 
that alleged violations are properly investigated, that the State brings perpetrators to justice and 
that victims are provided with an effective remedy. 
</p>
<p>40. The treaty bodies also highlight the importance of consistent, independent monitoring by 
States of third party compliance, even before abuse has been alleged.  For example, CESCR 
requires that States put in place effective monitoring mechanisms in the labour context and in 
relation to privatized social services.<b>59</b>  Such mechanisms must be properly equipped and 
resourced.<b>60</b>  It also appears that States&#8217; reporting obligations require monitoring of corporate 
conduct, particularly privatized business entities providing social services.  Indeed, CEDAW 
maintains that &#8220;States parties should report on how public and private health care providers 
meet their duties to respect women's rights to have access to health care&#8221;.<b>61</b>  CERD has 
recommended that independent monitoring bodies be set up to conduct environmental 
impact assessments before any operating license is issued, as well as health and safety checks 
on the sites of gold mining activities.<b>62</b>  Furthermore, the obligation to ensure effective

</p>
<p>participation of indigenous peoples in infrastructure development decisions implies that 
States must monitor whether participating business enterprises are consulting with such 
communities.<b>63</b> 
</p>
<p>41. National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) are seen as important players in relation to 
monitoring third party compliance in general.<b>64</b>  Some treaty bodies have now also recognized 
that it is important for such institutions to consider complaints and issues in relation to &#8220;private 
actors and entities&#8221;.<b>65</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Regulation 
</b></p>
<p>42. Most treaties impose obligations on States to adopt legislative measures as a means to 
ensure enjoyment of rights.  Consequently, the treaty bodies have generally confirmed that 
adopting appropriate legislation to prevent and address third party abuse is among States&#8217; 
minimum obligations under the treaties in order to fulfil the duty to protect.<b>66</b> 
</p>
<p>43. The treaty bodies generally do not specify the required content of legislation or other 
forms of regulation.  It is more common for commentaries simply to refer to the State&#8217;s 
obligation to take legislative measures to prevent abuse.  This follows from the treaties 
themselves which give States some latitude in deciding how to implement provisions.  
Nevertheless, the treaty bodies have given some specific guidance in relation to the protection 
of specific rights or concerning specific sectors. 
</p>
<p>44. The role of legislation in relation to corporate activities is discussed most frequently in 
relation to the employment context.  The treaty bodies confirm that, inter alia<i>,</i> States must 
legislate to prohibit discrimination, forced labour, child labour and unsafe working conditions.  
</p>
<p>

general comment 23); and CERD general recommendation 23, at para. 4 (d).

<b>66
</b></p>
<p>  Note that this section provides trends in relation to the treaty bodies&#8217; recommendations to 
States on how to best regulate the acts of business enterprises so as to prevent abuse.  Neither it 
nor the next section on adjudication is intended as a general analysis of treaty implementation in 
domestic systems. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.1 
 page 23 
 
</p>
<p>Legislation is also seen as key in relation to discrimination in access to services and protection 
against industrial accidents or actions likely to jeopardize rights related to health and living 
conditions.  Indeed, CESCR has highlighted that legislation may be &#8220;indispensable&#8221; for 
protection in relation to non-discrimination more generally and in relation to health.<b>67</b>  And its 
general comment 15 specifically refers to the need to restrain third parties, including 
corporations, from interfering with the right to water and provides that a State could violate the 
duty to protect by failing to &#8220;enact or enforce laws to prevent the contamination and inequitable 
extraction of water&#8221;.<b>68</b> 
</p>
<p>45. States are expected to take legislative or administrative measures to protect local 
communities and prevent violations by business enterprises in the course of conducting large 
infrastructure or mining projects, particularly those affecting indigenous peoples.<b>69</b>  In this 
respect, CERD emphasized that:  &#8220;Development objectives are no justification for 
encroachments on human rights, and that along with the right to exploit natural resources there 
are specific, concomitant obligations towards the local population.&#8221;<b>70</b> 
</p>
<p>46. Accordingly, treaty bodies have recommended various measures, such as: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; States should adopt a legislative framework that clearly sets forth the broad principles 
governing exploitation of land, including the obligation to abide by strict 
environmental standards and equitable revenue distribution.<b>71</b>

<p>&#8226; States should gather information on and monitor the possible environmental effects of 
large development or mining projects before they get underway.<b>72</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Rules and procedures should also be put in place to ensure the right of affected 
communities, especially indigenous peoples, to participate in decisions related to 
these projects,<b>73</b> including ensuring that their free and informed consent is sought 
before allowing a development project to start.<b>74</b> 
</p>
<p>47. Some Committees appear to have introduced a balancing test in relation to rights held by 
individuals related to their involvement in business enterprises.  Such rights include those 
relating to the protection of moral and material interests resulting from scientific, literary or 
artistic productions.<b>75</b>  For example, CESCR has said that States parties must prevent 
unreasonably high medicine, food and education costs resulting from protecting intellectual 
property.<b>76</b>  Products should be denied patentability where &#8220;commercialization would jeopardize 
the full realization&#8221; of other rights.<b>77</b>  The Committee even suggests human rights impact 
assessments before increasing intellectual property protection.  The implication from all of these 
statements is that States must regulate intellectual property rights holders (including those 
claiming rights as part of their participation in business enterprises) to protect other rights.

in its next report on &#8220;environmental policies formulated by the State party, in particular, policies 
to reduce atmospheric pollution, and to evaluate the impact of large infrastructure development 
projects on the environment&#8221;.  It is difficult to see how China could evaluate such impacts 
without seeking information from participating business enterprises, whether privately or 
publicly owned.  See also CERD concluding observations for Suriname, UN Doc.

<p>48. Some of the treaty bodies require &#8220;temporary special measures&#8221; in an effort to facilitate 
equal participation in various aspects of society.  Assorted measures are suggested in this 
respect, such as legislative measures (the adoption and implementation of a national strategy, 
programs and projects to ensure the rights of a specific group in relation to employment, housing 
or education), promotional measures (incentive schemes for employers or special training 
programs to increase participation for marginalized groups in the labour market),<b>78</b> as well as 
penalty schemes for employers.<b>79</b>  While the treaty bodies rarely say expressly that States should 
regulate corporations to ensure respect for such special measures, it would seem difficult for 
States to implement such measures effectively without some form of regulation and adjudication. 
49. All forms of regulation must be enforced so as to provide real protection against third 
party abuse - States must provide the policies and resources necessary to implement and enforce 
legislation, including monitoring mechanisms as discussed above and adjudicative measures as 
discussed next.<b>80</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Adjudication 
</b>50. The treaty bodies generally do not mention the term adjudication.  However, they 
regularly call for investigation, sanction by judicial, administrative, legislative or other 
authorities and remediation of violations by third parties, including business enterprises.  Such 
measures are generally related to the right to an effective remedy for human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b>(i) Investigation 
</b>51. Several treaty bodies confirm that a State&#8217;s failure to adequately investigate and redress 
violations will be deemed a violation of the duty to protect.  The HRC&#8217;s general comment 31 
highlights that a failure to investigate violations by private actors or entities could amount to a 
&#8220;separate breach of the Covenant&#8221;.<b>81</b>  Such investigations should be carried out &#8220;promptly, 
thoroughly and effectively through independent and impartial bodies&#8221;.<b>82</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>78
</b>  See for example CESCR concluding observations, China, UN Doc. E/C.12/1/Add.107, 
</p>
<p>13 May 2005, at para. 121, where the Committee recommended the Macao Special 
Administrative Region to &#8220;take effective measures to promote the integration of people with 
disabilities into the labour market, including through providing incentives to employers and 
strengthening the system of job quotas for persons with disabilities&#8221;. 
<b>79
</b></p>
<p>  See for example CERD general recommendation 27. 
<b>80
</b></p>
<p>  Examples abound, especially in CESCR, CEDAW and CRC concluding observations which 
frequently express concern that labour codes are not adequately enforced in the private sector.  
See by way of example only:  CEDAW:  concluding observations, Paraguay, UN Doc. A/60/38

</p>
<p>52. Concluding observations from CESCR in particular make it clear that the State must 
investigate allegations of abuses by employers, suggesting that inspection mechanisms should 
not only have general monitoring functions but also the ability to investigate allegations and 
impose penalties on offenders.  CERD has confirmed the importance of investigating all 
allegations of both indirect and direct discrimination, even if such investigations do not always 
result in prosecution.<b>83</b>  Indeed, it found a State liable for failing to properly investigate the &#8220;real 
reasons&#8221; behind a bank&#8217;s loan policies which had discriminatory effects.<b>84</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(ii) Prosecution leading to sanctions and remedies 
</b>53. The treaty bodies regularly confirm that the State is obliged to ensure that third party 
abuse is punished, including abuse by business enterprises, and that the perpetrators, whether 
public or private, are brought to justice.  Indeed, as discussed below in section D, some treaties 
even suggest that legal as well as natural persons should be punished. 
</p>
<p>54. The treaty body commentaries reiterate the importance of sanctions in order to enforce 
compliance.  Indeed, the HRC considers that a State&#8217;s failure to bring perpetrators to justice for 
&#8220;recognized breaches of domestic or international law&#8221; could amount to a violation of the 
Covenant.<b>85</b>  Other treaty bodies also recognize the importance of sanctions where third parties, 
including business enterprises, fail to comply with regulations, especially in employment 
contexts.  In particular, the treaty bodies tend to support penalties in relation to employers&#8217; 
violations regarding non-discrimination, failure to provide fair wages and equal pay for work of 
equal value, failure to provide safe working conditions, slave labour, child labour and 
trafficking.<b>86</b> 
</p>
<p>55. There is less guidance as to the type of sanctions which should be imposed, for example 
whether they should be monetary and whether they should be imposed through the criminal, civil 
or administrative regimes, thereby reflecting the general latitude given to States in terms of treaty 
implementation.

</p>
<p><b>(iii) The right to an effective remedy 
</b>56. The treaties tend to speak broadly of the right to an effective remedy.  Examples include 
article 2 (3) of the ICCPR, where States undertake to ensure that any persons whose rights are 
&#8220;recognized as violated shall have an effective remedy, notwithstanding that the violation has 
been committed by persons acting in an official capacity&#8221;, and article 6 of ICERD which 
requires States to assure &#8220;to everyone within their jurisdiction effective protection and remedies, 
as well as the right to seek just and adequate reparation or satisfaction&#8221;.  Even where the 
particular treaty does not specifically require the State to provide effective remedies, the treaty 
bodies commonly imply such an obligation, whether the primary perpetrator was a State or 
non-State actor.<b>87</b> 
</p>
<p>57. States should ensure appropriate processes are in place to assist rights-holders to bring 
claims against corporate abuse.  For example, CESCR&#8217;s general comment 4 provides that the 
right to adequate housing requires remedies such as the right to appeal a planned eviction or 
demolition, the right to obtain compensation after an illegal eviction and the right to complain 
about illegal actions by public or private landlords.<b>88</b>  Article 71 of the ICRMW provides that in 
relation to compensation for the death of a worker or a member of his or her family, States 
parties &#8220;shall, as appropriate, provide assistance to the persons concerned with a view to the 
prompt settlement of such matters&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>58. Further, CERD has reiterated the importance of the State ensuring equal access to the 
justice system, including through defining clear and just criteria to resolve land claims by 
indigenous communities.<b>89</b>  CEDAW and the CRC also discuss the need for &#8220;protective 
measures&#8221; such as refuge, rehabilitation, counseling and support for victims, with CEDAW 
emphasizing the importance of such measures in situations relating to trafficking, sexual 
exploitation (including prostitution) and gender-specific violence in the workplace, regardless of 
whether public or private actors were primarily responsible.<b>90</b>

<p><b>(iv) Reparation 
</b>59. The treaty bodies generally consider the requirement to provide effective remedies as 
necessitating some form of reparation, which they interpret broadly to include compensation, 
restitution, guarantees of non-repetition, changes in relevant laws and public apologies.<b>91</b>  Treaty 
bodies do not generally privilege any form of reparation. 
</p>
<p>60. Nevertheless, the treaty bodies have suggested that compensation or restitution through 
the return of land may be considered the most effective form of reparation in certain situations 
involving business enterprises, in particular where indigenous peoples have lost land or resources 
due to major development projects or resource exploitation activities.<b>92</b> 
61. While the treaty bodies do not generally interpret the treaties as including a right to 
compensation per se, the Committees frequently recommend compensatory measures to 
redress abuse.<b>93</b>  For example, CESCR&#8217;s general comment 17 on moral and material interests 
relating to scientific, literary and artistic productions suggests that a failure by a State to ensure 
that third parties adequately compensate authors for harm could amount to a breach of the 
Covenant.<b>94</b> 
</p>
<p>62. Similar to the situation with sanctions, it seems that States have wide discretion 
as to whether reparation should be provided through criminal, civil or administrative 
actions.  In other words, there does not appear to be a general obligation to make civil actions 
available.<b>95</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Natural v. legal persons 
</b></p>
<p>63. While the above analysis confirms that the duty to protect requires States to regulate and 
adjudicate the acts of business enterprises, there is less guidance from the treaties and the treaty

<p>  CERD suggests that when compensation is provided, it should be &#8220;adequate, fair, prompt and 
just&#8221;.  (See footnote 61 ICERD Report, available at http://www.business-humanrights.org/ 
Gettingstarted/UNSpecialRepresentative.)  It is possible to imply a similar requirement from the 
other treaty body commentaries, especially because of the common references to &#8220;adequate&#8221; 
compensation.

</p>
<p>body commentaries regarding whether the State may fulfil this duty by focusing on the acts of 
natural persons within the &#8220;offending&#8221; business enterprise or whether it is obliged to regulate and 
adjudicate the business enterprise in its own right.  For instance, is there any requirement to 
ensure that legal persons are sanctioned as well as or instead of natural persons?  The reason for 
the lack of guidance may be that the treaty bodies are focused on protection against abuse and 
enjoyment of rights and give States wide discretion as to how they ensure enjoyment. 
64. While some treaties and their respective treaty bodies do not seem to express a preference 
for regulation or adjudication of legal persons as opposed to natural persons - or are inconclusive 
in this respect,<b>96</b> newer treaties, in particular the OPSC to the CRC and the ICRMW, seem at a 
minimum to contemplate liability for business enterprises.  For example, article 3 (4) of the 
OPSC to the CRC provides that &#8220;subject to the provisions of its national law, each State Party 
shall take measures, where appropriate, to establish the liability of legal persons for offences 
established in paragraph 1 of the present article.  Subject to the legal principles of the State Party, 
such liability of legal persons may be criminal, civil or administrative.&#8221;  While this provision 
means that the required criminal penalties discussed in earlier paragraphs of article 3 may not 
apply to legal persons, the treaty at least recognizes liability for business enterprises, though it is 
clear that States have discretion in deciding how to establish such liability. 
</p>
<p>65. The CRC clearly supports States establishing such liability for legal persons.  In its 
concluding observations regarding the OPSC, the CRC has expressed concern at situations where 
&#8220;legal persons may not be held liable for offences established in article 3, paragraph (1) of the 
Optional Protocol&#8221; and has encouraged States to &#8220;extend liability&#8221; for those offences to &#8220;legal 
persons&#8221;.<b>97</b>  Indeed, in line with the OPSC&#8217;s preamble, the CRC has specifically focused on the 
Internet industry in this regard, encouraging States to adopt specific legislation on the obligations 
of Internet service providers and recommending that States introduce legislative provisions to 
combat the dissemination of child pornography, &#8220;including the full mandatory cooperation of 
Internet providers in this regard&#8221;.<b>98</b>

</b>  This is the case concerning CERD&#8217;s decisions on communications.  The Committee seems to

expressing a clear opinion on a privileged procedure.  See ICERD Report, available at

and pornography, especially through the Internet&#8221;. </p>

</p>
<p>66. Further, in outlining measures required to combat trafficking, article 68 (1) (b) of the 
ICRMW provides that such measures &#8220;shall include&#8221; imposing effective sanctions on &#8220;persons, 
groups or entities&#8221; involved, suggesting that States are encouraged to impose sanctions directly 
onto entities such as business enterprises assisting in illegal movements of migrant workers. 
</p>
<p>67. Finally, as mentioned above, the treaty bodies frequently express concern about the need 
to provide effective remedies for indigenous peoples affected by major infrastructure projects 
involving corporations.  This may imply a need for States to ensure that such effective remedies 
include the ability to bring actions directly against such corporations for compensation. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Promotional measures 
</b></p>
<p>68. The treaty bodies encourage States to adopt various kinds of promotional measures aimed 
at corporations.  Such measures include steps to provide human rights education for private 
actors or at least to encourage such actors to consider human rights in their activities.  CESCR in 
particular has recognized the importance of ensuring that promotional measures, including 
educational ones, accompany legislative measures.  In its general comment 5 on persons with 
disabilities, CESCR recognized that alongside legislative measures, promotional measures may 
be needed as a means of seeking to eliminate discrimination within the private sphere.  The 
Committee emphasized that in this respect, &#8220;[T]he Standard Rules place particular emphasis on 
the need for States to &#8216;take action to raise awareness in society about persons with disabilities, 
their rights, their needs, their potential and their contribution.&#8217;&#8221;<b>99</b>  Similarly, the ICRPD stresses 
the importance of awareness-raising, including promoting &#8220;recognition of the skills, merits and 
abilities of persons with disabilities, and of their contributions to the workplace and the labour 
market&#8221;, and &#8220;encouraging all organs of the media to portray persons with disabilities in a 
manner consistent with the purpose of the present Convention&#8221;.<b>100</b> 
</p>
<p>69. Concluding observations by various treaty bodies recommend awareness-raising for 
employers in relation to working conditions and non-discrimination.<b>101</b>  It is also common to see 
directions to States to raise awareness amongst the media, as well as the Internet industry, of the 
need to eliminate stereotypes and dissemination of harmful material.<b>102</b>  And the treaty bodies

</p>
<p>suggest States have significant educational obligations regarding recently privatized companies 
carrying out government functions, such as private contractors in detention facilities and private 
health providers.<b>103</b> 
</p>
<p>70. Second, the treaty bodies also encourage promotion of human rights through the 
involvement of the private sector in adopting legislation which establishes national policies and 
mechanisms to protect rights.<b>104</b> 
</p>
<p>71. Finally, some of the treaty bodies, particularly CRC, CERD and CESCR, suggest a role 
for States in encouraging private entities to develop or amend codes of conduct and institutional 
charters that would include the respect and promotion of various rights.  For example, CESCR&#8217;s 
general comment 12 on the right to food mentions that the private business sector has 
&#8220;responsibilities&#8221; in realizing the right and that &#8220;the State should provide an environment that 
facilitates implementation of these responsibilities.  The private business sector - national and 
transnational - should pursue its activities within the framework of a code of conduct conducive 
to respect of the right to adequate food, agreed upon jointly with the Government and civil 
society.&#8221;<b>105</b> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  BUSINESS AND RIGHTS SPECIFIC INFORMATION 
</b></p>
<p>72. This section discusses the rights most commonly discussed by the treaty bodies when 
elaborating on the duty to protect against corporate abuse, as well as the types of business 
enterprises/sectors most frequently mentioned.  It is purely illustrative of past and current trends 
and does not intend to suggest that the treaty bodies may or will focus only on certain types of 
abuses by certain types of business enterprises.  Rather, the above analysis confirms that States 
have a broad duty to protect against the abuse of all rights which business enterprises are capable 
of violating. 
</p>
<p>73. The most commonly discussed rights and prohibitions are the right to non-discrimination 
and equality; minority rights; labour rights; privacy rights; rights related to health and living 
conditions; prohibitions related to racial hatred and harmful gender stereotypes and prejudices; 
and rights enjoyed by indigenous peoples, including cultural rights.  The treaty bodies also 
frequently express concern about rights enjoyed by minorities (particularly in relation to access 
to services), children (especially in the employment context and in relation to the dissemination 
of child pornography) and women (also especially in employment contexts).

the existence of legal responsibilities for corporations under international law. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.1 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p>74. Furthermore, the treaty bodies seem more likely to discuss certain sectors.  For example, 
in providing recommendations to particular States in the employment context, the treaty bodies 
not only refer generally to &#8220;employers&#8221;, but have also expressed particular concern about the 
mining, manufacturing and agricultural industries, mainly where those industries are prevalent in 
those States.  Regarding rights enjoyed by indigenous peoples, particularly in relation to health, 
living conditions, cultural rights and access to justice, the treaty bodies frequently recommend 
that States take steps to regulate and adjudicate the acts of extractive, logging and property 
development companies. 
</p>
<p>75. Concerning privacy rights and the prohibitions against incitement of racial or religious 
hatred or harmful gender stereotypes, the treaty bodies have discussed marketing, advertising 
and media companies.  Internet service providers have also been mentioned in relation to the 
State&#8217;s duty to protect against exploitation of children, particularly through preventing the 
dissemination of child pornography. 
</p>
<p>76. In relation to health, the Committees not only refer to health-care providers but also 
companies marketing medical equipment and medicines to ensure that consumers remain fully 
informed; companies producing and marketing tobacco and narcotics; and extractive and 
manufacturing companies capable of polluting food and water resources.<b>106</b>  As suggested above, 
CESCR also indicates some regulation of pharmaceutical companies may be necessary, at least 
in limiting their intellectual property rights where such rights could result in &#8220;unreasonably high 
medicine, food and education costs&#8221;.<b>107</b> 
</p>
<p>77. Finally, most of the treaty bodies have reiterated States&#8217; duties to monitor and 
regulate private companies which provide government services to ensure that such services are 
provided without discrimination and in full compliance with international human rights 
obligations.<b>108</b> 
</p>
<p>78. The treaty bodies do not often separately discuss State-owned enterprises.  It is 
understood that under general international law the issue of whether particular business entities 
are State-owned or not is of less importance in deciding whether their acts can be attributed to 
the State; if a company has a legal personality distinct from the State, it will be treated like any 
other entity.  What matters is whether the business entity performs governmental duties or acts 
under the instructions, direction or control of the State.<b>109</b>  However, given mounting concern in 
the public space about human rights protection and State-owned enterprises, the intention here 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>106
</b>  See CESCR, general comment 14, at paragraphs 35 and 51. 
</p>
<p><b>107
</b>  General comment 17, at para. 35. 
</p>
<p><b>108
</b>  As indicated above, it is not always clear if the treaty bodies are focusing on the duty to 
</p>
<p>protect in this regard or if they are relying on the duty to respect by using secondary rules of state 
attribution to hold the state responsible for such companies&#8217; behavior given they perform 
government functions. 
<b>109
</b></p>
<p>  See arts. 5 and 8 of the International Law Commission Articles on State responsibility - see 
footnote 13 for additional references. </p>

</p>
<p>was to focus briefly on specific trends from the treaty bodies&#8217; commentaries in relation to 
State-owned enterprises performing business operations similar to non-state business 
enterprises.<b>110</b> 
</p>
<p>79. When the treaty bodies do discuss State-owned enterprises, they hold States responsible 
for abuse carried out by such enterprises even where the State argues that it has minimum control 
over the enterprise&#8217;s daily decision-making.<b>111</b>  What is less clear is whether the treaty bodies 
consider the State&#8217;s responsibility to stem from the duty to protect (in situations where the 
enterprises may considered in the same way as private businesses) or from the duty to respect (if 
State-owned enterprises are considered State organs or agents).  CESCR has discussed 
responsibility for violations by State-owned entities in the context of the duty to respect.  For 
example, general comment 14 on the right to the highest attainable standard of health provides 
that the duty to respect requires the State to refrain from &#8220;unlawfully polluting air, water and 
soil, e.g. through industrial waste from State-owned facilities&#8221;.<b>112</b>  General comment 15 on the 
right to water also suggests that States could breach the duty to respect by allowing water 
pollution by State-owned facilities.<b>113</b> 
</p>
<p>80. In any case, it appears that the State is responsible for ensuring State-owned enterprises 
do not abuse human rights, either as part of the obligation to respect (if State-owned enterprises 
are considered State organs) or as part of the obligation to protect (if they are considered private 
businesses). 
</p>
<p><b>V.  EXTRATERRITORIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Scope 
</b></p>
<p>81. The treaties and treaty body commentaries were examined to identify any requirements 
for States to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction, predominantly prescriptive extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>110
</b>  For the purposes of this report, it was not possible to explore various legal definitions of 
</p>
<p>government control or ownership, including the exact situations in which a corporation may be 
considered government owned.  Accordingly, trends in relation to State-owned enterprises were 
derived from commentary where the Committee expressly provides that it is discussing a 
State-owned or controlled business enterprise, or where it is implied that the State has a 
controlling interest in a business enterprise. 
<b>111
</b></p>
<p>  For HRC decisions dealing with State-owned enterprises, see for example<i>:  Love et al. 
v. Australia</i>, communication 983/2001, UN Doc. CCPR/C/77/983/2001, 28 April 2003 
at para. 4.6; <i>Hopu and Bessert v. France</i>, communication 549/1993, UN Doc.

<p>jurisdiction,<b>114</b> over transnational corporations or State-owned enterprises which commit abuses 
overseas.  The main scenario in mind is where a corporation considered to have the nationality of 
State A (where State A is a party to the particular convention) commits abuses of treaty rights 
in State B. 
</p>
<p>82. The treaties and treaty body commentaries were also examined to see whether, even if 
there is no express duty to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction, States are permitted to do so. 
83. Accordingly, this section focuses on trends in relation to the exercise of extraterritorial 
jurisdiction rather than those concerning international cooperation or situations in which the 
State&#8217;s treaty obligations may be interpreted to extend to areas outside their territory though 
subject to their jurisdiction, i.e. areas within their power or effective control.<b>115</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Main trends 
</b></p>
<p>84. Most of the treaty bodies have not discussed State duties regarding extraterritorial 
jurisdiction in detail or with great clarity.  At the very least though, none of the treaties or treaty 
bodies suggest that exercising extraterritorial jurisdiction is prohibited though States should 
only exercise jurisdiction over acts abroad within the limits imposed by the principle of 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>114
</b>  Prescriptive extraterritorial jurisdiction involves a State regulating persons or activities 
</p>
<p>outside its territory, usually through legislation.  Prescriptive extraterritorial jurisdiction differs 
from other forms of extraterritorial jurisdiction, such as situations in private international law 
where a national court applies another nation&#8217;s law, and executive (or enforcement) 
extraterritorial jurisdiction, where the State sends its organs, such as its military, overseas.  For 
more detail, see Addendum 2 to the SRSG&#8217;s 2007 report UN Doc. A./HRC/4/035/Add. 2 and 
<i>Extraterritorial Jurisdiction as a tool for improving the Human Rights Accountability of 
Transnational Corporations</i> - background paper for 3-4 November 2006 seminar prepared by 
Prof. Olivier de Schutter, Catholic Univ. of Louvain &amp; College of Europe, December 2006 
available at http://www.business-humanrights.org/Documents/de-Schutter-report-for-SRSG-re-
extraterritorial-jurisdiction-Dec-2006.doc. 
<b>115
</b></p>
<p>  See for example HRC general comment 31 at para. 10 and the following HRC concluding 
observations<i>:  </i>United States, UN Doc. CCPR/C/USA/CO/3/Rev.1, 18 December 2006, at 
para. 10; Poland, UN Doc. CCPR/CO/82/POL, 2 December 2004, at para. 3; Belgium, UN Doc. 
CCPR/CO/81/BEL, 12 August 2004, at para. 6 and 10; Germany, UN Doc. CCPR/CO/80/DEU, 
4 May 2004, at para. 11.  The individual treaty reports for the ICCPR and ICESCR will discuss 
how such extraterritorial responsibility may affect States being held liable for abuses committed 
by State-owned enterprises abroad and other enterprises carrying out government functions or 
subject to government control, i.e. where such enterprises can be considered the State&#8217;s agents 
and therefore the State may be held responsible for their actions in situations where there is 
sufficient control over foreign rights-holders.  The reports will also examine whether similar 
arguments are feasible in relation to private enterprises acting independently abroad over which 
the State exercises some form of jurisdiction. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.1

</p>
<p>non-intervention under international law.  What is difficult to derive from the treaties or the 
treaty bodies is any general obligation on States to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction over 
violations by business enterprises abroad. 
</p>
<p>85. For example, the HRC has suggested that States should assist &#8220;each other to bring to 
justice persons suspected of having committed acts in violation of the Covenant that are 
punishable under domestic or international law&#8221;.<b>116</b>  However, it is unclear whether this duty 
requires only information exchanges and respect for extradition treaties or whether it suggests a 
broader duty to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction and even then whether it could apply to legal 
as well as natural persons. 
</p>
<p>86. CESCR says slightly more on the topic.  In particular, paragraph 33 of general 
comment 15 on the right to water provides that &#8220;steps should be taken by States parties to 
prevent their own citizens and companies from violating the right to water of individuals and 
communities in other countries.  Where States parties can take steps to influence other third 
parties to respect the right, through legal or political means, such steps should be taken in 
accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and applicable international law.&#8221;  It appears 
that the term &#8220;their companies&#8221; relates both to State-owned enterprises and privately owned 
companies under the State&#8217;s jurisdiction while &#8220;other third parties&#8221; concerns unrelated actors 
acting overseas. 
</p>
<p>87. However, even with CESCR&#8217;s direct reference to companies, the most one can say with 
certainty is that there is an obligation to take &#8220;steps&#8221; to &#8220;prevent&#8221; violations.  It is not clear what 
types of steps should be taken, including whether an exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction is 
considered necessary under the Covenant.<b>117</b>  Nevertheless, the Committee&#8217;s statements at least 
suggest that the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction is not prohibited, in so far as it accords 
with the Charter of the United Nations and applicable international law.  Indeed, the Committee 
seems to be encouraging the State to regulate corporate acts both within and outside its borders. 
</p>
<p>88. Relevant concluding observations from the CRC urge the State to establish bilateral and 
multilateral agreements with countries of origin/transit to &#8220;prevent the sale of and trafficking of 
children&#8221;.<b>118</b>  However, there is no indication that States are required to exercise extraterritorial 
jurisdiction over perpetrators of trafficking.  Similarly, concluding observations for CEDAW 
urge States to prosecute and punish those engaging in trafficking but it also remains unclear 
whether States are required to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction over perpetrators or whether 
they are simply expected to cooperate with extradition processes.  There is no suggestion that the 
exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction is prohibited.

<p>89. The OPSC to the CRC provides more guidance regarding extraterritorial responsibility in 
relation to the crimes States must prohibit under the Protocol.  Article 3 (1) requires that such 
offences be criminalized, whether they are committed &#8220;domestically or transnationally or on an 
individual or organized basis&#8221;.  Article 3 (2) also requires that subject to the State&#8217;s law, attempt, 
complicity or participation in any of the offences should also be prohibited by legislation. 
Article 4 (2) requires the State to take measures as necessary to establish jurisdiction over the 
offences where the victim or alleged offender is a national.  Article 4 (3) also requires the State 
to exercise jurisdiction where the alleged offender is present in the State&#8217;s territory and it does 
not extradite &#8220;him or her&#8221; to another State party because the offence was committed by one of its 
nationals.<b>119</b> 
</p>
<p>90. However, considering article 3 (4)&#8217;s broad wording in relation to legal persons as 
described in Part II.D above, it is unclear whether the extraterritorial jurisdiction requirements 
above could require action in relation to legal persons.  The concluding observations do not 
illuminate this issue.  There are numerous references to States parties&#8217; duties to exercise 
extraterritorial jurisdiction under the OPSC but these relate to general principles affecting the 
effectiveness of such jurisdiction rather than discussing whether jurisdiction should be exercised 
over legal persons.  And while the concluding observations which recommend that States extend 
their laws to legal persons are encouraging, it is unclear if they were intended to relate to abuses 
committed by legal persons beyond the State&#8217;s borders. 
</p>
<p>91. CAT also requires States parties to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction in certain 
situations.<b>120</b>  However, the requirement does not appear to extend to exercising jurisdiction over 
legal persons. 
</p>
<p>92. Accordingly, the strongest pattern one can ascertain is a trend towards the treaty bodies 
recommending that States influence the actions of business enterprises abroad though States 
appear to have wide latitude in deciding the type of influence in most circumstances. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>93. This addendum has mapped the State obligations to regulate and adjudicate private 
corporate acts as these obligations are recognized in the United Nations core human rights 
treaties and further clarified by their respective treaty bodies.  At this point, the research has been 
able to identify some trends and gaps in relation to the protection and promotion of human rights 
in the business context.  The research has notably shown the treaty bodies&#8217; increasing focus on 
State protection against corporate abuse.  The forthcoming finalization of individual reports on 
all treaties will allow making more specific recommendations in this respect.  Nevertheless, on 
the basis of the available materials, it is possible to make a few preliminary observations. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>119
</b>  Note that while the OPAC does not require an exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction in the 
</p>
<p>same way as the OPSC, the CRC has recommended establishing extraterritorial jurisdiction over 
offences where either the victim or the perpetrator is a national. 
<b>120
</b></p>
<p>  See in particular art. 5 and 7 of CAT. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.1

</p>
<p>94. The treaty bodies are the main international accountability and monitoring mechanism for 
the implementation of the treaties.  The increasing attention they have shown to States&#8217; 
regulation and adjudication of corporate acts is an important and welcomed development.  
Indeed, it is vital that they continue to provide guidance to States on how they can fulfil their role 
in effectively regulating and adjudicating the acts of business enterprises in relation to human 
rights.  Such guidance as well as deliberations among treaty bodies about this particular issue 
would not only assist States but also provide more clarity to rights-holders and business 
enterprises as to States&#8217; obligations in this respect.  To this end, the treaty bodies could also 
consider issuing specific general comments or recommendations on this issue. 
</p>
<p>95. It would also seem desirable if the treaty bodies were to systematically request States 
parties to include information about steps taken to regulate and adjudicate corporate abuse in 
their periodic reports.  States could also make greater efforts to include such information in their 
periodic reports to the treaty bodies, and to consult business representatives and civil society in 
this respect.  Representatives from the State who are in charge of relations with business or have 
knowledge of State actions regarding corporate activities in the human rights context could also 
be part of the State delegation to treaty body sessions discussing the State&#8217;s periodic report.
