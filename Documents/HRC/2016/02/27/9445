<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Afghanistan Compact and the Afghanistan National Development Strategy provide a 
positive framework for development and improvements in the enjoyment of human rights.  There 
are serious efforts towards reform in key sectors and a number of achievements, including in the 
security and justice sectors.  However, Afghanistan&#8217;s transition is overshadowed by the armed 
conflict which intensified in 2006 and which poses challenges to political, social and economic 
achievements.  Violence has taken hundreds of civilian lives, hindered much-needed delivery of 
development aid, created new groups of displaced and, coupled with grinding poverty and the 
illegitimate narcotics industry, remains the greatest challenge for Afghans.  Despite some 
significant gains, justice reform continues to face daunting obstacles; improvements achieved by 
women over the last four years are overshadowed by ongoing discriminatory practices; and 
factional fighting between commanders continues to pose threats in some areas.  Arbitrary 
detention is commonplace and torture continues to be reported.  Impunity continues largely 
unabated both for past and present crimes.  Many commanders against whom there are credible 
allegations of abuse and who control armed militia continue to hold official positions.  The 
present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/113, contains 
recommendations to address the situation described.

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/113 and has been 
prepared in cooperation with the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA).  
The report is not an exhaustive account of the human rights situation in Afghanistan, but reflects 
the key challenges that must be addressed most urgently by the Government of Afghanistan with 
the support of the international community. 
</p>
<p>2. The Afghanistan Compact, which includes specific human rights benchmarks, is an 
important achievement following the successful completion of the Bonn Process.  However, 
political, institutional and economic gains are under threat as growing insecurity and violence 
increasingly permeate the lives of many Afghans.  Lack of security remains the greatest obstacle 
to the enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms.  More civilian lives were lost in 2006 than 
during the ousting of the Taliban regime in 2001, among them government figures and 
humanitarian workers.  The death in September 2006 of Safia Ama Jan, Head of the Kandahar 
Department of Women&#8217;s Affairs (DoWA), was the first-ever known targeted assassination of a 
female government official and sets back further the cause of women in Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>3. As affirmed in the Afghanistan Compact, insecurity cannot be overcome by military 
means alone.  It is essential that tangible progress in social and economic development reach the 
people, especially vulnerable populations.  Poverty is both a cause and a consequence of 
insecurity; it feeds recruitment for the insurgency from among many Afghans who experience 
few peace dividends and are disillusioned by the Government&#8217;s performance.  The delivery of 
basic humanitarian aid has been prevented in parts of the country and new emergencies have 
been created, including the displacement of some 15,000 families in southern Afghanistan 
following fighting in the second half of 2006. 
</p>
<p>4. In a welcome move, President Karzai launched the Action Plan on Peace, Reconciliation 
and Justice, which is a step towards effectively addressing the legacy of past armed conflict.  
Continuing political support by the President and the Government is required if the Action Plan 
is to be implemented. 
</p>
<p>5. I commend the Government for its efforts to tackle justice and security sector reform, 
but more progress is needed to ensure that international human rights standards are upheld.  
Long-term international commitment to Afghanistan must continue if respect for human rights is 
to become institutionalized. 
</p>
<p><b>II. POVERTY AND OTHER ECONOMIC, SOCIAL 
AND CULTURAL RIGHTS ISSUES 
</b></p>
<p>6. Afghanistan is currently at a crossroads, with frustration at the lack of real 
improvements in human security manifesting itself among the population.  Grinding poverty is 
one of the greatest challenges currently facing Afghans.  It is more widespread in some 
provinces than others, and the groups most affected are women, children, the disabled, the 
elderly and the landless.  Disparities are considerable between men and women as well as 
between urban and remote rural areas.  Social indicators are very weak with life expectancy 
under 47 years, a 72 per cent illiteracy rate and infant mortality at 140 per 1,000 live births.  
One in five Afghan children dies before their fifth birthday. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/98* 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p>7. Millions of Afghans are chronically or seasonally food insecure.  Afghanistan&#8217;s first 
Millennium Development Goal report states that 40 per cent of the rural population is unable 
to count on sufficient food to satisfy their most basic needs.  United Nations agencies 
reported a harvest shortfall of up to 1.2 million tonnes in 2006 and a drought affecting up to 
2.5 million people, half of whom are children.  As few as 23 per cent of Afghans have access to 
clean drinking water and in rural Afghanistan only 1 in 10 Afghans have access to sanitation<i>.</i> 
</p>
<p>8. The basic needs of women and girls are still unmet.  Afghanistan has the lowest female 
literacy rate in the world (estimated to be 10-18 per cent) and an estimated 57 per cent of females 
are married before their sixteenth birthday.  Progress in education means that 37 per cent of girls 
between the ages of 7 and 12 now attend school.  However, of an estimated 2 million children 
currently not attending school, 1.3 million are girls.  This is due to an insufficient number of 
formal schools and qualified teachers, physical inaccessibility of schools due to security 
concerns and negative parental attitudes regarding girl&#8217;s education.  The Afghanistan 
Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) also cites early marriage as a significant 
factor in the high dropout rate of girls. 
</p>
<p>9. Violence in the majority of districts in the south has had an impact on the delivery of aid 
and services due to restrictions placed on the movement of personnel of the United Nations, 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the Government.  Failure to deliver basic services 
contributes to a feeling of disillusionment with the Government.  A report published by AIHRC 
in May 2006 concluded that the Government is failing to meet its minimum core obligations 
under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to which Afghanistan 
is a party. 
</p>
<p>10. Despite the above, there has been important progress in a number of areas.  The 
Government has established a development framework; it has set monitoring mechanisms in 
place; and it has established a crisis management group, which is addressing security concerns in 
the four southern provinces.  Policies on irrigation, rural and urban water supply and sanitation 
have been drafted and<b> </b>there has been an expansion of the Government&#8217;s Basic Package of Health 
Services.  However, the AIHRC report shows that almost 55 per cent of the population are not 
using available health facilities due to difficulties of access or perceptions of poor quality care.  
The Ministry of Public Health concluded in 2006 that there had been a modest improvement in 
maternal health as a result of investment in reproductive health services, but the disparity 
between rural and urban areas is still enormous. 
</p>
<p>11. In terms of protection of vulnerable groups, the Government is addressing its admitted 
failure to mainstream social disability and social protection issues into development 
programmes, through an analysis of the situation of the chronically poor and a gender assessment 
of the design and implementation of the National Solidarity Programmes.  To address one of the 
obstacles to girls&#8217; school attendance, the Ministry of Education is training a pool of female 
teachers and offering land and housing incentives to them. 
</p>
<p>12. Illegal seizure of land and insecurity of land ownership is an ongoing and widely reported 
problem.  Multiple land claims and resulting feuds continue to generate fresh conflicts.  The 
judicial system is accused of delays and frequent corruption when arbitrating disputes and 
validating documents and ownership deeds.  In the majority of cases, traditional community 
dispute resolution mechanisms are preferred; disputes are settled swiftly, but not always fairly.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/98* 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>A policy has been drafted as one of the benchmarks of the Afghanistan National Development 
Strategy (ANDS) to inform the revision of the legal framework for land, taking into account 
aspects such as title deeds, legal definitions of property and customary modes of settling 
disputes.  The document has been approved by the Ministries of Justice, Agriculture and Urban 
Development and will be presented to Parliament for adoption in the near future. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  DISCRIMINATION 
</b></p>
<p>13. As reported previously, women in Afghanistan have made remarkable progress under the 
current Government.  This includes female participation in Parliament and the public sector and 
the growth of women&#8217;s organizations.  Many development projects include a requirement of 
gender inclusiveness; however, progress in the realization of gender equality continues to be held 
back owing to discrimination, insecurity and the persistence of customary practices.  Basic 
services such as access to education, health care and sources of income are still inaccessible 
while insecurity continues to dominate the lives of most women.  The targeted assassination of 
the Head of DoWA in Kandahar on 25 September 2006 has created a sense of fear among many 
female government employees, particularly in southern and eastern Afghanistan.  The treatment 
of women by the male-dominated justice sector, ongoing obstacles to the realization of civil, 
political, social and economic rights, and pervasive violence from segments of society are further 
daunting challenges.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Gender and criminal justice 
</b>14. Across the country, the judicial system is failing to protect and provide justice to women, 
who continue to face discrimination from a predominantly male judicial sector.  Women and 
girls are incarcerated for committing moral and uncodified crimes:  cases have been documented 
of females being imprisoned for &#8220;running away from home&#8221;, arbitrarily detained and/or 
convicted of adultery when reporting crimes of a sexual nature; denied a fair trial and 
accompanying judicial guarantees; and returned to male offenders when reporting violence.  
Sentencing by judges of females convicted of sexual offences such as adultery is often harsh and 
disproportionate while male co-accused are often released or given a much lighter sentence. 
</p>
<p>15. Preliminary findings from the ongoing UNAMA and AIHRC campaign against arbitrary 
detention indicate a high proportion of women in prison for transgressing social and moral codes, 
with some facing double victimization following sexual violence.  In Afghanistan&#8217;s largest 
prison, in Kabul, almost half of the female inmates were registered as detained for &#8220;running 
away from home&#8221;, while a significant proportion were imprisoned for &#8220;adultery&#8221;.  In almost all 
cases due process principles had been violated, including the rights to equal treatment before the 
law and to be prosecuted only for acts that are defined as a crime by law.  Often, the women had 
not been sentenced or even appeared in court. 
</p>
<p>16. Customary law prevails in Afghanistan, where traditional dispute resolution mechanisms 
are frequently used in place of formal court systems in criminal and non-criminal cases, 
including disputes over marriage and land.  While enjoying community support and delivering 
swift decisions, these mechanisms often fail to respect even the most basic human rights 
standards, especially as regards women and girls.  A particular issue of concern is the practice of 
<i>baad</i>, by which girls as young as 7 years of age are given away to settle feuds and murder cases. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/98* 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>17. Initiatives undertaken to address the needs of women in the justice sector have moved 
forward slowly.  A law on family violence has been drafted and submitted to the Ministry of 
Justice for review, and is expected to be presented to Parliament for approval in 2007.  
Internationally supported legal aid programmes have been extended to different parts of the 
country, and a small number of NGOs are providing a legal defence for female defendants.  
While these programmes are having a positive impact and are welcome, legal representation for 
the majority of women outside Kabul and a select number of provinces remains out of reach. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>18. Awareness campaigns and the registration of cases of violence against women are being 
undertaken by a variety of United Nations agencies, international and local NGOs, and 
government bodies.  A number of commissions have also been set up to eliminate tolerance of 
violence against women, but the crime remains pervasive.  Underreporting is common as most 
women do not report violence, particularly domestic violence, for a variety of reasons:  fear of 
reprisals, lack of support and services for victims of violence; failure to prosecute perpetrators; 
and intolerance on the part of the community.  Moreover, reporting family violence can further 
jeopardize the safety of females as police officers often return the victim to the offender.  As 
more women are becoming aware of their rights and with the presence of human rights and 
women&#8217;s NGOs, more cases are being reported.  However, poverty, tradition and insecurity are 
compounding the difficulties. 
</p>
<p>19. AIHRC registered 1,545 cases of violence against women from January to 
November 2006, including self-immolation, exchange of girls in the context of dispute 
settlement, forced marriages and sexual violence.  Forced marriage, with 200 complaints, was 
the largest category.  The Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs (MoWA) recorded more than 500 cases 
of violence against women, including 197 cases of self-immolation in Herat Province alone.  In 
almost all cases, the perpetrators of violence were male family members.  Shelters and services 
to support victims are located mainly in Kabul, but most provincial authorities have been 
reluctant to support the removal of victims to safe locations outside the province, resulting in a 
continuing lack of protection. 
</p>
<p>20. Afghan laws put the legal age of marriage at 16 years of age.  This is routinely violated, 
as girls as young as 10 are married.  Two cases documented by UNAMA are emblematic of the 
situation:  the case of a 10-year-old girl in Kunar Province whom the local authorities claimed is 
legally married to a 65-year-old man (following pressure from UNAMA, the Kunar provincial 
court detained the husband but refused to prosecute him); and in Kunduz Province, a 10-year-old 
girl was kidnapped, forcibly married to an adult male and taken to Pakistan (the district and 
provincial authorities have taken little action to locate the girl or investigate persons suspected of 
abducting her). 
</p>
<p>21. A number of women and girls continue to be murdered by family members through the 
practice of &#8220;honour killings&#8221;.  Reasons for the killings include the victim having been raped, or 
marrying a man of her own choice rather than someone chosen by her family.  The State still 
rarely prosecutes perpetrators of such crimes.  The belief is prevalent among communities that </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/98* 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>honour killings are acceptable and that perpetrators should not be punished.  In late 2006, 
a pregnant woman and a young man suspected of adultery were publicly executed during Eid 
following the issuance of a death fatwa by a local <i>jirga</i> (council) in Faryab Province.  To date, 
the authorities have taken two individuals into custody but the perpetrators have not yet been 
brought to justice. 
22. A Family Response Unit was established in Kabul in 2005 to allow women complaining 
of domestic violence and other criminal issues easy access to the police.  A similar unit also 
exists in Herat and three were opened in Mazar-I-Sharif in 2006.  The Kabul unit is staffed by 
female police officers who serve as the first contact for women facing violence and other crimes.  
Mediation between couples and families is offered and, in some instances, cases are referred for 
criminal investigation.  The south, south-east and east remain in dire need of similar 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>23. The United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) established a database of 
cases and information relating to violence against women gathered from provincial offices of 
MoWA, AIHRC, NGOs and United Nations agencies.  The database will be transferred to 
MoWA in due course.  UNIFEM issued a report in 2006 based on 1,327 collected and analysed 
cases of violence against women countrywide from 2003 to 2005 which had previously been 
collected by 17 organizations.  AIHRC published a report in September 2006 on the situation of 
women and has conducted a number of seminars on violence against women for local 
communities, provincial and district authorities, women&#8217;s organizations and clerics.  MoWA has 
launched a long-term campaign on combating violence against women; the Inter-Ministerial 
Commission on the Elimination of Violence against Women is working on a protocol on the 
eradication of forced and child marriages; and a parliamentary commission was established on 
women, gender, civil society and human rights.  A &#8220;National Action Plan for the Women of 
Afghanistan&#8221; is expected to be passed and released by Parliament in 2007.  A number of 
United Nations organizations have been active in providing training and awareness-raising 
activities on violence against women, including UNAMA Human Rights Officers, UNIFEM and 
the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>IV.  ARMED CONFLICT AND VIOLENCE 
</b></p>
<p>24. Violence linked with armed conflict was the deadliest in 2006 since the fall of the 
Taliban regime in late 2001.  Although centred in the four southern provinces, it occurs over 
large areas from Kunar in the east to Farah in the west.  Parts of the southern central highlands, 
notably Dai Kundi and Ghor, are also becoming destabilized and prone to violence. 
</p>
<p>25. Insurgent-related attacks increased from fewer than 300 a month at the end of 
March 2006 to over 600 by end September 2006.  (In 2005, the average number of such 
attacks was an estimated 130 per month.)  Suicide attacks have risen dramatically - in 2005, 
there were 17 such attacks; in 2006, 123 incidents were recorded by the United Nations, 
killing 237 civilians and injuring 624.  In addition, 16 international military personnel and 
52 Afghan soldiers and police were killed by suicide bombing attacks.  During 2006, an 
estimated 4,000 people were killed, of whom at least one third were civilians. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/98* 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>26. More than 15,000 families have been displaced from Uruzgan, Helmand and Kandahar 
provinces; numbers are likely to increase with the spread of fighting to other areas.  Their return 
to their places of origin and residence is seriously hindered by ongoing fighting in the areas, 
intimidation and fear of being killed by Taliban insurgents, and destruction of homes and 
livelihoods.  In addition, the void in the rule of law that accompanies conflict means that those 
responsible for human rights violations and abuses are not held accountable. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Attacks by anti-Government elements affecting civilians 
</b></p>
<p>27. Kandahar, Helmand and Uruzgan provinces are the epicentre of much of the violence.  
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the great majority of suicide attacks in Kandahar.  They 
conducted deliberate and indiscriminate attacks against civilians, targeted high-profile 
government officials, humanitarian workers and private contractors, and assumed control of 
some districts in Helmand for a short period.  Major offensives by North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) forces were launched in districts of Kandahar, Kunar and Helmand and 
parts of the south-east.  Development activities have been severely hindered in these areas, with 
agencies partially or completely withdrawing. 
</p>
<p>28. Fear and insecurity have been further entrenched with the distribution of letters purported 
to be written by the Taliban warning Afghans of deadly reprisals if they are found working for 
the international aid community or military forces.  Seven civilians working for the United States 
Coalition Forces (US CF) were killed by an improvised explosive device on a minibus in June in 
Kandahar; 21 civilians were killed in two separate attacks in Helmand; 4 labourers working for 
US CF were abducted and found dead in Kunar Province; 5 family members, including 2 female 
teachers, were killed in their home in December in Narang District, Kunar.  Unverified reports 
were also received of Taliban-enforced justice in a few districts in Uruzgan and Helmand.  In 
December 2006, four Afghans were reported to have been beheaded in Panjwai District after 
being accused of working for international military forces. 
</p>
<p>29. I deplore all attacks targeting the civilian population or resulting in civilian deaths, 
injuries or disruption of civilian life, including the rights to education, to freedom of movement 
and residence, and to an adequate standard of living. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Attacks on Afghan government officials 
</b></p>
<p>30. Targeted assassinations of provincial and district government officials were a worrying 
trend in 2006.  Judges, law enforcement officials, high-profile local officials and a female public 
figure were killed.  In September, a provincial director of MoWA was assassinated in Kandahar; 
in October, a male member of the Provincial Council in Kandahar was killed and two attempts 
were made against the outgoing Governor of Helmand.  In October, a suicide bomber killed the 
Governor of Paktia and in August, two female members of the Provincial Council in Laghman 
Province moved to the capital of the province following death threats from unknown sources.  
District administrators bore the brunt of Taliban attacks in the south-east and east and some were 
killed, including the district governors of Khogyiani and Gulran districts.<b> </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/98* 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Attacks on schools 
</b></p>
<p>31. Schools were attacked regularly in the first half of 2006 and although the number of 
attacks decreased in the second half of the year, schools continued to be subjected to violence.  
In 2006, over 200 schools were burned, attacked or partially destroyed, at least 15 teachers were 
killed and some 200,000 students were affected by school closures.  Local community 
consultations suggest that the number of closed schools is underreported.  Schools all over the 
country have been affected.  Although insurgent activity has intensified, not all violence can be 
attributed solely to anti-Government elements:  intercommunal feuds and competition over local 
resource allocation are also sources of violent conflict. 
</p>
<p>32. There is no notable distinction between the targeting of girls&#8217; and boys&#8217; schools, but the 
impact of such attacks has nonetheless been felt more by females because there are fewer girls&#8217; 
schools and the greater tendency of parents to withdraw girls from education due to perceived 
security threats.  Communities and local authorities condemned attacks and peaceful 
demonstrations were held in Maimana, Herat and Farah.  President Karzai and the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to education issued condemnatory public statements after six children 
were killed in a school in Kunar.  Communities have also established night patrols and guards. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Counter-insurgency operations 
</b></p>
<p>33. In October 2006, international forces mandated by the Security Council to support the 
Government came under the single command of the 38-nation International Security Assistance 
Force (ISAF).  ISAF currently has approximately 36,000 soldiers under its command and, in 
addition, some 10,500 United States troops remain engaged in &#8220;Operation Enduring Freedom&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>34. International military operations intensified in 2006 and a number of incidents 
were reported in which civilians were either mistaken for terrorists or caught in the crossfire 
during NATO/ISAF operations.  The majority of fatalities were reported in the southern region.  
In May, 9 civilians were killed allegedly during a NATO/ISAF air strike in Kajaki District, 
Helmand; a government fact-finding mission found that 10 civilians had been killed and 
27 injured in a NATO/ISAF raid on an alleged insurgent compound in Dehjawz village, near 
Tirin Kot, Uruzgan.  Of particular concern was the protracted offensive in Zherai/Panjwai 
districts in which NATO/ISAF is alleged to have killed 23 civilians as part of &#8220;Operation 
Medusa&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>35. President Karzai and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Afghanistan 
condemned civilian deaths caused by insurgents and NATO/ISAF in 2006.  In December 2006, 
following incidents in Kandahar, UNAMA issued a public report urging NATO/ISAF and the 
Taliban to uphold international humanitarian and human rights law and to ensure that civilian 
life is protected at all times. 
</p>
<p>36. Community support for NATO/ISAF appears to have waned following forced searches of 
private homes, destruction of property and civilian deaths attributed to United States forces and 
NATO/ISAF.  In December 2006 in Mandozai District, Khost Province, five members of a 
prominent family were killed, leading to community demonstrations against international forces.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/98* 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>Warning shots by NATO/ISAF forces have killed and injured civilians when their vehicles 
strayed too close to military convoys.  In two separate incidents in December, a 7-year-old boy 
and a 70-year-old man were killed after the vehicles they were travelling in failed to heed 
NATO/ISAF warnings to stop. 
</p>
<p>37. A number of measures to limit civilian deaths have been implemented by the 
Government and NATO/ISAF.  A radio announcement has been aired in Kandahar requesting 
civilians to stay away from NATO/ISAF patrols, the Government has produced and aired radio 
clips on the same subject, and warning signals have been prominently posted on the back of 
international military convoys.  At the end of 2006, NATO issued a statement that civilian 
casualties were its single biggest failure in 2006 and that additional measures to reduce them 
would be taken.  I welcome this commitment. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  IMPUNITY 
</b></p>
<p><b>Transitional justice 
</b>38. The deterioration in the security situation during 2006 has limited the space for 
transitional justice activities.  The failure to prevent known human rights abusers standing for 
and winning parliamentary seats, together with the continued practice of appointing individuals 
suspected of human rights violations to senior positions in Government, has reinforced the 
de facto state of impunity.  
</p>
<p>39. These problems, and delays in promulgating it make the full implementation of the 
Government&#8217;s Action Plan on Reconciliation, Peace and Justice within the three-year time frame 
unlikely.  Nevertheless, important steps have been taken.  On 10 December, Human Rights Day, 
President Karzai publicly launched the Action Plan and declared that 10 December would be a 
National Day of Remembrance for victims and that a memorial to them would be built at 
Pul-I-Charkhi prison near Kabul.  
</p>
<p>40. As an illustration of the sensitive environment, a press release by Human Rights Watch in 
the wake of the President&#8217;s launch of the Action Plan provoked a strong reaction from powerful 
figures, some of them members of the Government or the legislature, who were named as past 
human rights violators.  The issue continued to simmer through January 2007, with Parliament 
discussing the issue and claiming that there was a conspiracy against jihadi leaders.  
</p><p>41. A &#8220;Core Group&#8221; on transitional justice, comprised of representatives of the President&#8217;s 
Office, AIHRC, NGOs, various embassies and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR)/UNAMA, is coordinating and monitoring the efforts of stakeholders in the 
implementation of the Action Plan.  The Core Group is establishing implementation working 
groups for the five key action areas under the Action Plan and engaging seven responsible 
government ministries as leads or partners for implementation.  The United Nations, in 
coordination with AIHRC, will provide technical advice and training to focal points within these 
ministries.   
</p>
<p>42. The quality of appointments in the Government and administration remains of serious 
concern, but there have been some positive developments.  In November 2006, President Karzai 
issued Presidential Order No. 2421 establishing a Special Advisory Board on Senior </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/98* 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>Appointments as part of a transparent mechanism for all senior-level appointments.  
OHCHR/UNAMA is assisting the President&#8217;s Office with technical, financial and operational 
support and has provided Board members with a United Nations report on past human rights 
violations in Afghanistan previously shared with the President and AIHRC. 
</p>
<p>43. The active and meaningful role of civil society in shaping transitional justice is essential.  
In support of these activities, UNAMA and AIHRC conducted outreach activities in 2006 with 
civil society actors across the country.  In August 2006, the United Nations supported the 
International Centre on Transitional Justice and the local Civil Society and Human Rights 
Network with a six-day training of trainers&#8217; workshop on the role of civil society and transitional 
justice.  
</p><p>44. Individuals allegedly responsible for committing grave violations of human rights, 
including war crimes, during the conflict have not been held to account, and some hold positions 
of authority.  Trials of individuals accused of human rights violations are rare, and flawed when 
they take place.  Asadullah Sarwary, a former intelligence chief, was tried and sentenced to death 
in February 2006.  UNAMA monitored the trial, which was highly politicized, as well as 
procedurally and legally flawed.  Despite efforts by UNAMA and the European Union, Sarwary 
was unable to find a lawyer willing to defend him.  
</p>
<p>45. Several identified mass grave sites are unprotected and no proper investigations have 
been carried out.  Currently, there is seemingly little willingness on the part of the Government 
or the international forces to provide security for the forensic investigation, and the capacity is 
low and the equipment limited for such investigations.  The concept of evidentiary requirements 
is not well developed among police and justice officials. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  DEFICITS IN DEMOCRACY 
</b></p>
<p><b>Freedom of expression and religion 
</b></p>
<p>46. There has been an increase in violence and threats to the media.  Three journalists were 
killed in 2006.  A certain amount of self-censorship is practised owing to threats, pressure from 
the authorities and increasing violence.  The main unions of Afghan journalists have raised 
serious concerns about how the proposed new Media Law could restrict freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>47. Two media laws have been in force in Afghanistan since 2002.  The first was 
promulgated in 2002 and the second, promulgated in 2003, remains in force today.  Work began 
on drafting a third, new media law in 2005, and it was a significant advance on the previous two.  
Improvements include a High Media Council to develop policy and three commissions tasked 
with regulating specific media sectors, including a Commission on Media Complaints and 
Violations.  Adopted by presidential decree in December 2005, it has yet to be endorsed by 
Parliament.  However, amendments proposed by the parliamentary Religious and Cultural 
Affairs Commission represent a significant potential setback for media development and 
freedom of expression by opening the way for direct political interference and placing 
restrictions on private media.  These include the removal of all but one of the initially proposed 
commissions, a new stipulation that freedom of expression must be in accordance with Islamic 
principles, and a series of new provisions which include banning published material that is 
deemed immoral. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/98* 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>48. A number of violent incidents involving the media have taken place.  In May 2006, 
Ariana TV was attacked by violent demonstrators during riots in Kabul.  On 14 February 2006, 
Abdul Qudoos, a reporter for Sulha Radio, was detained on charges of attempted murder of a 
well known Member of Parliament.  The legal process was marred by political interference and 
undue pressure on the prosecutors, but appointment of a defence lawyer and United Nations 
monitoring of the trial process eventually led to the release of the detainee on 
24 December 2006.  In October 2006, Karen Fischer and Christian Struwe, two German 
journalists, were shot dead in Baghlan Province.  
49. Although private media have been more adventurous in addressing current issues, there 
are also criticisms of lack of balance and professionalism.  Programmes dealing with criminal 
cases sometimes lack understanding of legal processes and people arrested on suspicion of 
crimes are often portrayed as criminals before they are proven guilty in a court of law.  AIHRC 
has taken up this matter with media organizations.  UNAMA has also received many complaints 
from detainees regarding misuse of media by the police and prosecutors. <b>  
</b></p>
<p>50. In June 2006, Afghanistan&#8217;s intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security 
(NDS), distributed a directive restricting the publication of material on morality grounds and 
banning material which may be construed as being against national security interests and/or the 
presence of international military forces.  Following protests, this directive was withdrawn.  
</p>
<p>51. Also in June 2006, serious consideration was given by the Cabinet, under pressure from 
the Ulema Council, to reactivate the Department for (the Prevention of) Vice and (the Promotion 
of) Virtue, infamous under the Taliban, as part of the Ministry of Religious Affairs.  The 
Department, among other duties, would have been mandated a clampdown on expression 
deemed non-Islamic.  Progressive individuals in the Government and civil society have been 
instrumental in blocking its establishment thus far.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>52. Afghanistan&#8217;s obligation under international human rights law to respect freedom of 
religion was severely tested when Abdul Rahman was imprisoned in March 2006 for converting 
from Islam to Christianity and threatened with a death sentence.  Article 7 of the Constitution 
commits Afghanistan to observe the international treaties that Afghanistan has ratified and which 
clearly uphold freedom of religion.  There is no law on apostasy in Afghanistan.  Although 
released following procedural irregularities and flown out of the country at the end of 
March 2006, Abdul Rahman&#8217;s case attracted considerable attention.  The case raised 
long-standing concerns about the capacity of the judiciary, the interference of clerics, application 
of the death penalty and the struggle between sharia law and statutory law.  Several similar cases 
have come to the attention of UNAMA following the publicity surrounding the Rahman case.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>VII.  INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY 
</b></p>
<p>53. AIHRC continued to do tremendous work to protect human rights in Afghanistan despite 
setbacks in terms of accessibility to those in need due to the security situation, as well as having 
been forced to distance itself from certain issues to avoid becoming a target itself.  The recent 
and long-overdue confirmation of its membership by the President is a welcome development 
and should serve to strengthen its standing.  OHCHR remains committed to providing technical 
advice and support to AIHRC, including contributing funds towards its project activities.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/98* 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>In addition to daily coordination between UNAMA Human Rights Officers and AIHRC regional 
staff, OHCHR/UNAMA is also part of the AIHRC Project Committee which meets regularly to 
discuss activities as well as make strategic recommendations for the fulfilment of the mandate of 
AIHRC to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Administration of justice 
</b>54. Despite progress, Afghanistan&#8217;s formal justice system continues to face systemic 
problems.  With the support of the international community and donor nations, training of 
judicial professionals is ongoing, physical infrastructure is being built and the capacity of the 
permanent justice institutions has increased, including through the enactment of key new 
legislation.  However, in some provinces and districts effective State institutions are still largely 
absent or are subject to corruption, pressure from armed groups and, in some areas, insecurity 
and violence.  
</p>
<p>55. Institutionalized corruption, lengthy pretrial detention and due process violations are still 
prevalent in the justice sector.  The absence of a State-funded legal aid system acts as a 
significant impediment to safeguarding the rights of accused persons and to providing the 
necessary legal representation for vulnerable groups.  Although there are 223 lawyers registered 
and licensed with the Ministry of Justice, the number actually practising is considerably lower.  
UNAMA has found that in provinces where legal aid providers are active there has been an 
improvement in the application of constitutional and legal principles and a reduction in the 
incidence of arbitrary detention.  NGOs have significantly expanded the provision of legal aid.  
There is some limited capacity (19 lawyers) within the Legal Aid Department of the Supreme 
Court.  However, the constitutional right to legal representation of defendants is far from being 
met.  The Legislative Department of the Ministry of Justice finalized its draft Advocates&#8217; Law in 
July 2006 following extensive consultations with national and international actors.  The 
Advocates&#8217; Law, establishing the Independent Bar Association for Afghanistan, is now with 
Parliament. 
</p>
<p>56. According to the Ministry of Justice, the number of detainees and prisoners in 
Afghanistan has more than doubled in the past two years to 9,357 persons, including 
266 women.  The ratio of detainees to convicted prisoners is also rising as the number of arrests 
increase while the capacity of the courts remains limited.  The Attorney-General&#8217;s Office 
estimated in November 2006 that there were 6,653 detainees awaiting trial across the country, 
approximately 71 per cent of all those currently incarcerated.  UNAMA and AIHRC continue to 
receive and verify complaints of illegal and arbitrary detention.  In response, a joint campaign by 
UNAMA and AIHRC began in October 2006 to analyse adherence to due process standards in 
detention facilities throughout Afghanistan with the cooperation of the Ministries of Justice and 
the Interior and the Attorney-General&#8217;s Office, and to recommend reforms.  Initial findings 
indicate a significant proportion of cases in which pretrial detention time limits are breached, 
suspects are not provided with defence counsel, and ill-treatment and torture are used to force 
confessions. 
</p>
<p>57. As noted above, judicial officials have been increasingly targeted by insurgents and some 
have been killed.  In May 2006, the deputy civil court judge of Farah Province was shot dead.  
In June, suspected militants linked to the Taliban abducted and killed a local judge in Ghazni 
Province.  In addition, the capacity of the legal system is undermined, especially in the districts, </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/98* 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>by weak State institutions, low salaries for judges and prosecutors, widespread corruption, the 
presence of armed individuals and the failure to ensure a secure environment for courts, judicial 
personnel, victims and witnesses.  Moreover, the justice system still lacks sufficiently qualified 
officials, adequate legal education, and the necessary administrative tools and physical 
infrastructure to administer justice fairly and effectively.  The findings of the Supreme Court&#8217;s 
report on judicial education issued in May 2006 highlighted the fact that only about a third of 
the 1,415 judges currently working in Afghanistan has a tertiary education. 
</p><p>58. There are prisons in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan, administered by the Ministry of 
Justice.  Prison conditions in most facilities remain below minimum international standards, 
treatment of detainees and prisoners raise serious human rights concerns and judicial guarantees 
are largely absent.  In late 2006, the Central Prison Department announced that it did not have 
accommodation for nearly 1,000 male prisoners in 11 provincial prisons and that prisoners had 
been sleeping in the prison yards.  There has been some progress, as a number of major prison 
projects are currently being carried out including two new prison facilities in Gardez and 
Mazar-I-Sharif, a women and juvenile&#8217;s wing in Kabul and a juvenile correctional centre in 
Herat.   
</p>
<p>59. Positive reforms are being implemented in the justice sector and in August 2006, a new 
Chief Justice was sworn in together with seven new Supreme Court judges.  The new 
composition of the Supreme Court reflects a fairly even ethnic balance and is more reform 
minded and professional than the previous Court.  Nevertheless, there are no women judges and 
the United Nations continues to encourage the Government to appoint a qualified woman to the 
single vacancy on the Supreme Court.  In the latter part of 2006, Chief Justice Azimi dismissed 
several judges throughout the country on the grounds of lack of qualifications or alleged 
corruption.  While such attempts to professionalize the judiciary are welcome, the dismissals 
raise concerns regarding due process and transparency.  In October 2006, Chief Justice Azimi 
presented the Supreme Court&#8217;s five-year reform strategy to achieve the rule of law benchmark of 
the Afghanistan Compact and the Afghanistan National Development Strategy.  The strategy 
includes a plan to systematically review judicial remuneration, appointment, promotion and 
discipline.  
</p>
<p>60. The new Attorney-General, Abdul Sabit, was appointed in August 2006 and has 
undertaken a campaign to tackle corruption.  He has removed several prosecutors and a number 
of provincial and district officials have been arrested and placed under investigation.  He also 
appointed the first women chief prosecutor in the Province of Herat.  However, there remains a 
pressing need to undertake more far-reaching institutional reforms of the Attorney-General&#8217;s 
Office to ensure increased efficiency and effectiveness and to address corruption.  
</p>
<p>61. In the summer of 2006 the Juvenile Code was submitted to Parliament for its 
endorsement.  The Wolesi Jirga (Lower House) rejected the age of 18 years as the age for 
criminal prosecution for both girls and boys and lowered the age for girls to 17.  Persistent 
lobbying efforts by civil society and some parliamentarians - with technical expertise provided 
by UNIFEM and UNAMA - have been undertaken to challenge this differentiation in age.  (The 
Meshrano Jirga (Upper House) had approved the legal age of 18 for both boys and girls.) A joint 
commission of representatives of the two houses will be convened to resolve this conflict. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/98* 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>62. Systematic monitoring of the legal system to track the progress of justice sector reforms 
and to monitor compliance with international fair trial standards remains a critical need.  In 
February 2007 UNAMA begins a pilot Legal System Monitoring Programme in five provinces, 
with an initial emphasis on criminal justice. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Security sector reform 
</b></p>
<p>63. Drug-related criminal gangs, entrenched warlords, anti-Government elements and the 
narcotics trade continue to threaten stability, good governance and the enjoyment of human 
rights.  A disbandment of illegal armed groups programme was launched in May/June 2006 but 
has been held back by a disappointing response from concerned government ministries. 
Conversely, mounting insurgency led to the accreditation of pro-Government militia such as the 
Afghan National Auxiliary Police in the south and the &#8220;<i>Arbaki</i>&#8221; in the south-east and east.   
</p>
<p>64. The reform of the Afghan National Police (ANP) began with the selection of senior 
officers and provincial chiefs of police.  While the overall exercise was successful, 
14 individuals, some with links to criminal and illegal armed groups and records of human rights 
violations, were appointed despite having failed the selection process.  Following concerns 
expressed by members of the international community, they were put on probation.  In 
January 2007, all but three were recommended for removal.  With assistance from UNAMA and 
the international community, police reform has progressed and UNAMA is now confident that at 
the time of writing there are no known human rights violators down to the rank of colonel in 
ANP.  Challenges to creating a more professional police force remain as low pay, political 
interference, lack of discipline among officers and rampant corruption, among other concerns, 
continue to play a large role in the public&#8217;s negative image of ANP.    
</p>
<p>65. The Afghan National Army currently has a total of 34,700 personnel and is intended to 
reach its full strength of 70,000 by 2010.  Efforts to ensure a more ethnically balanced and 
effective force have been successful and the Army has been playing an increasingly responsible 
role in security operations.  The key challenge is to build on current efforts in the areas of 
recruitment and retention of staff, provision of better quality equipment and weapons, and timely 
and secure payment of salaries.  
</p>
<p>66. Reports of the use of torture and other forms of ill-treatment by the NDS are frequent.  
Arbitrary arrests are regularly reported and NDS prosecutors regularly fail to conduct 
investigations within legal time frames, thus violating judicial guarantees concerning detainees.  
Individuals are documented as having &#8220;disappeared&#8221; when they are arrested by NDS officials 
and access to the facilities where they are held has been problematic for AIHRC and the 
United Nations.  In the current climate of instability and conflict, the lack of oversight 
mechanisms, the absence of scrutiny of the intelligence service mandate and the lack of access to 
their facilities are of serious concern.  A promising step was taken in January 2007 with the first 
human rights training programme for NDS officers organized by the United Nations, AIHRC 
and partners. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/98* 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  TECHNICAL COOPERATION 
</b></p>
<p>67. In addition to monitoring the human rights situation, often jointly with AIHRC as in the 
campaign to reduce arbitrary detention, UNAMA Human Rights Officers, representing OHCHR, 
provide technical assistance to the Government and organizations such as AIHRC and NGOs.  
They also undertake awareness-raising about human rights with the population as a whole by 
means of meetings and seminars throughout accessible parts of the country, as well as in the 
media.  On 10 December 2006, OHCHR and UNAMA published an illustrated version of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Dari and Pashto in both poster and booklet form.  
These are being distributed nationwide, including to all schoolteachers.  During the reporting 
period, UNAMA Human Rights Officers have undertaken training programmes with AIHRC, 
NGOs and ANP, as well as with the intelligence service.  Support has been provided to training 
other key officials, including the judiciary and prison guards.  AIHRC has been given technical 
assistance to develop a database and case management system. 
</p>
<p>68. In line with the Afghanistan Compact, a project to assist Afghanistan resume its human 
rights treaty reporting obligations is supported by UNDP, OHCHR and UNAMA.  Coordinated 
by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the project involves 16 ministries and has twin aims:  to build 
sustainable reporting capacity and to assist Afghanistan prepare up to six overdue reports.  The 
first of these, on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, is due to 
be completed by April 2007, in order to bring a human rights perspective to the ANDS process.  
Assistance is also provided to AIHRC and civil society so that they may play useful roles in the 
treaty reporting and implementation process.  
</p>
<p>69. Support to transitional justice activities is described above.  In addition, OHCHR and 
UNAMA supported Physicians for Human Rights to undertake a mission in June 2006 to assess 
priorities for forensic investigation, including of mass grave sites, and build national capacity to 
undertake forensic analysis.  A three-day training course was held with AIHRC staff.  The 
mission will be followed up in 2007 with further training and support for a project coordinated 
by AIHRC to map mass graves.  Forensic investigation of selected sites will be conducted 
in 2007, security permitting. 
</p>
<p>70. OHCHR is implementing two projects jointly with other members of the United Nations 
Country Team.  A project with UNIFEM will provide a referral service for women victims of 
violence in Parwan and Jalalabad, so that they may obtain protection and support.  It is hoped 
this service may be expanded to other areas in the future.  Together with UNDP, OHCHR is 
supporting a series of regular radio broadcasts on disability, aimed at informing the population 
with disabilities, as well as the general population, about the rights of persons with disabilities 
and the issues they face.  It is planned that this service may be expanded to television 
broadcasting in the near future.  Another initiative in 2007 under the United Nations Action 2 
programme will see several United Nations agencies combining to raise awareness of economic 
and social rights among the rural population in two regions. 
</p>
<p>71. Following agreement with the Ministry of the Interior, an adviser from OHCHR has been 
selected to help strengthen the Ministry&#8217;s Human Rights Unit, which oversees the conduct of the 
police.  </p>

</p>
<p><b>IX.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> In view of the situation described in this report, I make the following 
recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The Government and international security forces should ensure that 
international humanitarian and human rights principles are upheld in relation to the 
protection of civilians in armed conflict.  This should include taking all necessary measures 
to mitigate and limit the risk to civilians during military operations, to ensure prompt 
investigations into civilian casualties and to pay compensation to the families of civilians 
killed and injured in the conflict.  NATO is urged to establish a discretionary fund and 
place it at the disposal of national contingents to provide immediate reparations to civilian 
casualties of NATO/ISAF military action and their families. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Non-State entities involved in the armed conflict in Afghanistan are also 
called upon to abide by common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) In view of the intensification of armed conflict in parts of Afghanistan, the 
adequacy of the mandate of UNAMA to protect civilians should be closely examined with a 
view to strengthening it where necessary. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) The Government should increase efforts to apply a rights-based approach to 
the Afghanistan Compact.  This should include appropriate disaggregated indicators to 
measure progress in poverty reduction for vulnerable groups and ensure participation of 
all sectors of Afghan society in the monitoring of the Afghanistan Compact and ANDS, 
particularly of groups suffering discrimination such as women, people with disabilities, 
nomadic groups and the chronically poor.  Policies should include a strategy on 
employment creation for the most vulnerable in rural areas. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) The Government is urged to address the failure of health-care services in 
rural areas to be accessible to many women:  efforts to achieve a reduction of child and 
maternal mortality in accordance with the Millennium Development Goals should continue 
while urgent action should be taken to reduce customary and security obstacles preventing 
girls from enrolling in and completing primary education. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) The Government should incorporate a rights-based approach to ANDS by 
harmonizing international reporting requirements under treaties such as the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights with the monitoring of the Afghanistan 
Compact/ANDS.  This involves integrating international legal obligations with the 
equivalent ANDS targets in order to further delineate a clear framework of accountability 
for the Government and incorporate internationally recognized standards for 
measurement of progress in human rights and development. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) The international community should continue to provide financial and 
technical support to the Government to conduct a full poverty and gender analysis of the 
impact of local-level development programmes; and, the Government needs to ensure that 
any conclusions are fully integrated into ANDS in order to achieve progressive realization 
of economic and social rights. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/98* 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p><b> (h) The Government, with the support of the international community, is called 
upon to intensify its efforts to increase the participation and role of women in public 
decision-making in line with Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and 
security; it should provide security for female Members of Parliament, Provincial Council 
members and heads of DoWA who are currently facing intimidation and threats in 
southern and eastern Afghanistan. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) The Government is urged to take all necessary measures to investigate 
allegations of family and other forms of violence, including honour killings, and to 
prosecute perpetrators, including those committing or arranging underage and forced 
marriages; domestic violence and rape should be included as crimes in the Criminal Code; 
instructions should be provided to prosecutors and judicial officials on the application of 
Afghanistan&#8217;s Criminal Law provisions in order to clarify breaches of custom or civil codes 
which are not criminal offences; and traditional dispute resolution mechanisms should be 
reviewed in order to better protect the rights of all individuals, particularly women and 
children, and enhance accountability to the State. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) The Government should ensure that a wide-ranging awareness campaign to 
eradicate violence against women and girls is undertaken in conjunction with community 
leaders, mullahs and civil society; that efforts to support MoWA in the establishment of 
safe houses across the country for victims of domestic violence are stepped up and include 
psychosocial support for victims and vocational training for released female prisoners. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) The Government is encouraged to ratify the Optional Protocols to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, enabling women and men who 
have been subjected to discriminatory or unfair judicial rulings to have recourse to an 
international mechanism. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) The Government is further encouraged to issue, in 2007, a standing 
invitation to the United Nations human rights special procedures mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) The Government should enact legislation implementing the provisions of the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in domestic law, including the crimes set 
out under articles 6, 7 and 8, to ensure that Afghan courts have jurisdiction to prosecute. 
 (n) The implementation of and respect for constitutional and other legal 
safeguards for freedom of expression is strongly recommended, and the Government 
should ensure that the new proposed Media Law provides safeguards particularly against 
political interference and censorship, especially for private media. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (o) The Government, with the support of the international community, is urged 
to focus efforts on meeting the Afghanistan Compact rule of law benchmark, particularly 
the drafting, revision and implementation of further key legislation. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (p) The Government should continue its cooperation with UNAMA and AIHRC 
on the arbitrary detention campaign and related issues and grant these organizations 
access to all detention facilities and to relevant documentation. </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/98* 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p><b> (q) The Government, with the support of the international community, should 
expand legal aid services and develop a sustainable and efficient State-funded legal aid 
scheme. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (r) In line with the Afghanistan Compact benchmark to end the illegal 
expropriation of property, the Government should adopt housing and land restitution 
policies and programmes and enforce legislation in line with the Principles on Housing and 
Property Restitution for Refugees and Displaced Persons (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2005/17, annex).  
The role of the judiciary in arbitrating and mediating in cases is essential to resolving 
disputes in a fair manner. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (s) The Government should increase efforts towards the implementation of the 
five-year Supreme Court strategy and prioritize the development of an open and 
transparent accountability and disciplinary mechanism designed to enforce ethical 
standards.  The Government should also provide members of the judiciary with the 
necessary protection for them to perform their tasks without undue interference. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (t) The Government is encouraged to appoint a female judge to fill the current 
vacancy on the Supreme Court. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (u) The Government with the support of NATO/ISAF and the international 
community should establish effective measures to protect mass grave sites; provide security 
for investigations and support training on forensic investigation and collection of evidence. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (v) The Government is urged to immediately establish the task force called for in 
key action 5 (a) of the National Action Plan on Peace, Reconciliation and Justice.
