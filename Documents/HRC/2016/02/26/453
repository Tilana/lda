<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human

</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
</p>
<p> In the present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 25/35 
</p>
<p>of 14 June 2014, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights describes the 
</p>
<p>human rights situation in Guinea in 2014 and makes recommendations to address diverse 
</p>
<p>human rights problems. The High Commissioner also provides information on the activities 
</p>
<p>of the country office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Guinea. 
</p>
<p> During 2014, action by the Government was dominated by efforts to control the 
</p>
<p>Ebola virus. The case fatality rate, the measures adopted by the authorities to tackle the 
</p>
<p>virus and the decisions by some neighbouring countries to close their borders affected the 
</p>
<p>exercise of fundamental rights such as freedom of movement, the right to education, the 
</p>
<p>right to health and the right to work. 
</p>
<p> The Government continued its efforts to consolidate national institutions. Reform of 
</p>
<p>the judicial system continued, and was marked by the establishment of the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Council of Justice and the implementation of the special status for magistrates to ensure 
</p>
<p>their independence and significantly improve their salary. 
</p>
<p> However, progress in combating impunity among members of the defence and 
</p>
<p>security forces has been very limited. Moreover, prison overcrowding is still a major 
</p>
<p>problem, in particular because of the almost systematic use of pretrial detention. Nor has 
</p>
<p>there been any progress in efforts to combat violence against women and girls, and female 
</p>
<p>genital mutilation is still practiced.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 25/35 
</p>
<p>of 28 March 2014 the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights assesses the 
</p>
<p>human rights situation in Guinea in 2014. He also provides information on the activities of 
</p>
<p>the country office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Guinea and makes a 
</p>
<p>number of recommendations to the Government and the international community. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Main political, security, social and economic developments 
</b></p>
<p>2. In January 2014, the new National Assembly was formed following the 
</p>
<p>parliamentary elections of September 2013. Guinea is currently preparing for its 2015 
</p>
<p>presidential elections at a time of severe difficulties in the economic, health and social 
</p>
<p>spheres. The pace of the dialogue between the Government and the opposition is slow. The 
</p>
<p>opposition parties have presented a list of demands, which includes the restructuring of the 
</p>
<p>Independent National Electoral Commission and annulment of the legislation it had put in 
</p>
<p>place, the recruitment of a new technical operator and the resumption of the 2014 general 
</p>
<p>population and housing census. 
</p>
<p>3. In view of this tense situation, it is essential to both encourage and ensure political 
</p>
<p>dialogue as the controversy over the electoral system could fuel inter-ethnic violence. It is 
</p>
<p>vital that the presidential elections be held in a peaceful and transparent manner. 
</p>
<p>4. In early 2014, an epidemic of Ebola virus broke out in Guinea and quickly spread to 
</p>
<p>other West African countries. To deal with the spread of the virus, the Government 
</p>
<p>established an institutional and operational framework for disease control and adopted a 
</p>
<p>national response programme. It also set up an interministerial committee, a national 
</p>
<p>coordination committee and district-level technical coordination committees in the areas 
</p>
<p>affected by the outbreak. These measures were accompanied by awareness-raising 
</p>
<p>campaigns in the areas concerned, including in rural districts. 
</p>
<p>5. Nevertheless, the Ebola virus continued to spread rapidly, ultimately affecting all 
</p>
<p>areas of the country. Both the outbreak and the restrictive measures taken to prevent it from 
</p>
<p>spreading &#8212; including border closures by neighbouring countries &#8212; have caused a 
</p>
<p>substantial reduction in State revenue as well as the loss of jobs and income for many 
</p>
<p>people. Growth forecasts for 2014 have been revised downwards from 4.6 per cent to 2.<footnote name="3">0 prisons in all eight administrative regions of the country, where a total of 3,110 persons </footnote> 
</p>
<p>per cent and, as a result, the Government has been forced to make substantial cuts to basic 
</p>
<p>social services budgets.  
</p>
<p>6. During 2014, Guinea also experienced social unrest and violence, including 
</p>
<p>lynchings. With regard to social protests, the main demands related to better living 
</p>
<p>conditions and improvements to basic social services. There were occasional 
</p>
<p>demonstrations by women and young people in the suburbs of Conakry between February 
</p>
<p>and August 2014, with protesters demanding water, power supplies and improved sanitation 
</p>
<p>in their neighbourhoods. The demonstrations were marred by the deaths of two people &#8211; a 
</p>
<p>civilian and a trainee gendarme.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Situation of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Government took steps in 2014 to ensure greater promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights. The Ministry of Justice continued its reform of the judicial system with the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the Supreme Council of Justice and a commission on criminal law reform; </p>


<p>GE.15-03278 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>in addition, the decree giving effect to the special status of judges came into force (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/25/44 and Corr.1, para. 57). Nevertheless, the recurrence of violence is of concern, 
</p>
<p>especially where it relates to localized demands or combating the Ebola virus. Cases of 
</p>
<p>arbitrary arrest, illegal detention and ill-treatment persist. Furthermore, the mob lynchings 
</p>
<p>reported in Haute Guin&#233;e and Guin&#233;e Foresti&#232;re, as well as continued impunity for 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of certain types of human rights violations, expose the inherent weaknesses in 
</p>
<p>the judicial system. 
</p>
<p><b> A. The impact of the Ebola virus on social and economic rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>8. The right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
</p>
<p>health is recognized under article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights. It is further guaranteed under article 15 of the Guinean Constitution. With 
</p>
<p>support from technical and financial partners, treatment and transit centres offering free 
</p>
<p>health care have been set up in Guin&#233;e Foresti&#232;re and in the capital city. The international 
</p>
<p>community &#8212; including the United Nations, the European Union, the African Union, the 
</p>
<p>Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and a number of individual 
</p>
<p>States &#8212; has made every effort to provide Guinea with substantial support in order to help 
</p>
<p>combat the virus. 
</p>
<p>9. Despite these efforts, the virus was able to spread quickly due to a lack of awareness 
</p>
<p>about Ebola, the delay in establishing a communication strategy, weaknesses in the health-
</p>
<p>care system and hostility towards officials raising awareness about the virus in local 
</p>
<p>communities. By mid-December 2014, more than 2,000 people in Guinea had been infected 
</p>
<p>with Ebola and more than 1,000 people had died. 
</p>
<p>10. In October 2014, during its consideration of the report of Guinea 
</p>
<p>(CEDAW/C/GIN/7-8), the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women encouraged the Government to seek support from the international community to 
</p>
<p>address the imbalances in the health-care system caused by the outbreak, overcome 
</p>
<p>budgetary issues and establish adequate health-care infrastructures. The Committee 
</p>
<p>expressed concern about the impact of the outbreak on the lives and health of women, who 
</p>
<p>are often the first victims of the virus. Furthermore, the Committee recommended that 
</p>
<p>Guinea make provision for gender issues in its Ebola prevention and control programme, in 
</p>
<p>consideration of women&#8217;s unequal access to health care (CEDAW/C/GIN/CO/7-8). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>11. Fearing an escalation of the rate of infection in schools and universities, and with the 
</p>
<p>school year due to start at the beginning of October, on 4 September 2014 the Government 
</p>
<p>postponed the start of the school year indefinitely. On 19 January 2015, the Government 
</p>
<p>determined that classes could resume, albeit on a temporary basis. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Right to food 
</b></p>
<p>12. The right to food is guaranteed under article 11 of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The Government has made continual efforts to 
</p>
<p>improve the diet of the population, and a policy to boost agricultural and rice production 
</p>
<p>was launched in 2011. Farming has been heavily subsidized, with the Government 
</p>
<p>importing agricultural inputs and machinery in order to promote greater food self-
</p>
<p>sufficiency for the country as a whole. Agriculture is the main source of income for close to 
</p>
<p>80 per cent of the population. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.15-03278 
</p>
<p>13. To contain the spread of the Ebola virus, the Government has taken steps to restrict 
</p>
<p>population movement and closed a number of local markets. Following the state of 
</p>
<p>emergency declared by the Government, in September 2014 the local authorities in 
</p>
<p>Gu&#233;ck&#233;dou, Guin&#233;e Foresti&#232;re, decided to close the weekly markets held in six sub-
</p>
<p>prefectures bordering Sierra Leone and Liberia.1 Although justified in the context of the 
</p>
<p>epidemic, these measures have had a considerable impact on the right to food, with 
</p>
<p>quarantined persons particularly badly affected as they do not receive adequate food aid 
</p>
<p>from the authorities. The weekly market closures had been lifted at the time of finalizing 
</p>
<p>this report. 
</p>
<p>14. According to a statement issued on 11 November 2014 by the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the right to food, more than a million people in the countries hit 
</p>
<p>hardest by the Ebola crisis were facing the prospect of starvation because of the toll the 
</p>
<p>epidemic had taken on food production.2  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Right to work 
</b></p>
<p>15. The right to work is guaranteed under article 23 of the Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights, article 6 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights and article 20 of the Guinean Constitution. 
</p>
<p>16. At the same time as the new civilian authorities came into power, major mining 
</p>
<p>group investments were being withdrawn or put on hold as a result of the Ebola crisis. 
</p>
<p>Thousands of workers lost their jobs, particularly in the town of Fria where the closure of 
</p>
<p>the aluminium smelter has pushed hundreds of employees into poverty and insecurity. 
</p>
<p>17. Following the Ebola outbreak, numerous multinational organizations evacuated their 
</p>
<p>employees and wound down their business activities in the country. For example, 400 of 
</p>
<p>the 500 Rio Tinto personnel based in Beyla have been transferred to other areas of the 
</p>
<p>country or abroad; the Societ&#233; des mines de fer de Guin&#233;e (SMFG) evacuated all of its 
</p>
<p>international employees and placed at least 133 of its Guinea nationals on leave. At the time 
</p>
<p>of drafting this report, business activities on the whole remained greatly reduced. 
</p>
<p>18. The Ebola outbreak has had a significant effect on women&#8217;s right to work, with 
</p>
<p>those in the agricultural sector particularly badly affected as a result of the disruption to 
</p>
<p>production structures as well as the market and border closures. In this regard, the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women recommended that Guinea 
</p>
<p>adopt specific measures to promote alternative income-generating opportunities for women 
</p>
<p>active in the agricultural sector and to ensure food security (CEDAW/C/GIN/CO/7-8, para. 
</p>
<p>45). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Right to life 
</b></p>
<p>19. In the previous report (A/HRC/25/44 and Corr.1, para. 57), The United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights recommended that the Government should continue 
</p>
<p>to reform the security sector and strengthen the resources of the security forces in order to 
</p>
<p>ensure greater respect for the international principles applicable to the maintenance and 
</p>
<p>restoration of law and order. The High Commissioner also recommended that the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 This Declaration was made by the President of the Republic of Guinea on 13 August 2014.

<p>GE.15-03278 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>authorities ensure that the security forces were trained in human rights and international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law so as to prevent violations of the right to life, especially during operations 
</p>
<p>relating to demonstrations. 
</p>
<p>20. The right to life is one of the fundamental and inalienable rights of all individuals. It 
</p>
<p>is protected under article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 6 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 6 of the Guinean 
</p>
<p>Constitution. 
</p>
<p>21. Violations of the right to life involving security forces were documented by the 
</p>
<p>OHCHR country office in Guinea during 2014. In February 2014, a student suspected of 
</p>
<p>trafficking and using of cannabis was arrested in Fria, a town 160 kilometres north of 
</p>
<p>Conakry, by officers of the communal police force on the orders of two gendarmes. When 
</p>
<p>he resisted arrest, he was beaten and dragged along the ground for several metres. As a 
</p>
<p>result of this ill-treatment, he died shortly after arriving at the gendarmerie. 
</p>
<p>22. In February 2014, in response to the young man&#8217;s death, young people from Fria 
</p>
<p>vandalized and set fire to the local gendarmerie and town hall and broke down the prison 
</p>
<p>gates, allowing the prisoners to escape. 
</p>
<p>23. The regional and prefectural authorities deployed security forces at the scene. A 
</p>
<p>commission of inquiry comprising a justice of the peace, the gendarmerie commander and 
</p>
<p>the central police commissioner of Fria was established on 1 March 2014 to determine 
</p>
<p>responsibility for the young man&#8217;s death. The commission questioned 19 people, 8 of 
</p>
<p>whom were municipal police officers and 11 young people suspected of organizing and 
</p>
<p>carrying out the burning and looting of public property. However, the gendarmerie captain, 
</p>
<p>who was identified by the victim&#8217;s family and by witnesses as the main person behind the 
</p>
<p>young student&#8217;s arrest, never responded to the many court summonses issued to him. His 
</p>
<p>superiors opposed his appearance in court and assigned him to a different town. 
</p>
<p>24. On 16 September 2014, a delegation comprising the governor of the Nzer&#233;kor&#233; 
</p>
<p>administrative region, the prefect, the director of the regional hospital, the Nzer&#233;kor&#233; 
</p>
<p>regional director of health, the Womey sub-prefect, religious leaders and journalists set out 
</p>
<p>for Womey, a village 50 km from Nzer&#233;kor&#233;, to raise awareness among the local population 
</p>
<p>about the Ebola virus. The group was attacked by some local people, and eight of its 
</p>
<p>members were killed. According to reports, the victims&#8217; bodies were thrown into the septic 
</p>
<p>tank at the local primary school. After this incident, defence and security forces were 
</p>
<p>deployed to secure the scene and to arrest suspects. Fourteen people were arrested and 
</p>
<p>placed in pretrial detention at the Nzer&#233;kor&#233; central prison. Non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations reported looting by the security forces responsible for securing the village. 
</p>
<p>The OHCHR office in Guinea met with the Minister of Justice to request an investigation to 
</p>
<p>shed light on the murder of the delegation members and the allegations of looting. 
</p>
<p>25. In relation to the murders, 53 persons were arrested and the case was referred to the 
</p>
<p>Court of Appeal. The village was occupied by the defence and security forces for two 
</p>
<p>months, during which the inhabitants of Womey reportedly fled to the bush for fear of 
</p>
<p>reprisals. Despite appeals from civil society and the intervention of the Minister of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and Public Liberties, the soldiers continued to occupy Womey, preventing the 
</p>
<p>villagers from returning to their homes. The army withdrew at the end of November 2014 
</p>
<p>after a hunger strike organized by opposition leaders and members of civil society. The 
</p>
<p>OHCHR office in Guinea later received reports that six women had been raped by the 
</p>
<p>defence and security forces. The office staff met with these women and with the Nzer&#233;kor&#233; 
</p>
<p>judicial authorities to request an investigation to determine who was responsible. </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.15-03278 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Right to liberty and security 
</b></p>
<p>26. The right to liberty and security is enshrined in article 3 of the Universal Declaration 
</p>
<p>of Human Rights and guaranteed under article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights and article 9 of the Guinean Constitution. It affords individuals an essential 
</p>
<p>guarantee of freedom from arbitrary detention by ensuring that they will not be deprived of 
</p>
<p>their liberty except on grounds specified by law and in accordance with the relevant 
</p>
<p>established procedures. 
</p>
<p>27. In 2014, the OHCHR office in Guinea visited 107 places of detention and observed 
</p>
<p>numerous cases of illegal arrest and arbitrary detention, both in gendarmeries and police 
</p>
<p>stations and in prisons run by regional authorities. 
</p>
<p>28. According to the findings of OHCHR, numerous illegal arrests are made during 
</p>
<p>demonstrations and are followed by arbitrary detention. In February 2014, during the 
</p>
<p>above-mentioned events in Fria, the police arrested young men at random, either on the 
</p>
<p>street or at their homes, and sometimes late at night. 
</p>
<p>29. In addition, OHCHR noted cases in which persons were arrested for acts committed 
</p>
<p>by their family members. In May 2014, a woman was prosecuted for the offence of 
</p>
<p>concealment, which had been committed by her son, who was wanted by the courts. She 
</p>
<p>was remanded in custody in Nzer&#233;kor&#233; central prison, in violation of article 55, paragraph 
</p>
<p>2, of the Guinean Criminal Code, which provides that an offender&#8217;s spouse, parents or 
</p>
<p>relatives up to the fourth degree of affinity may not be prosecuted for harbouring a 
</p>
<p>criminal. OHCHR also found that persons who could not honour their civil commitments, 
</p>
<p>such as the payment of debts, were arrested and detained at the T&#233;lim&#233;l&#233; central police 
</p>
<p>station and by the No. 3 mobile gendarmerie squad in Matam, Conakry. In all these cases, 
</p>
<p>intervention by OHCHR resulted in the detainees&#8217; release. 
</p>
<p>30. Violations of the right to liberty and security particularly affect persons in pretrial 
</p>
<p>detention on felony charges. Under Guinean law, the Assize Court should convene 
</p>
<p>regularly every four months. In addition, the Code of Criminal Procedure establishes a 
</p>
<p>maximum duration for pretrial detention of 24 months for the most serious crimes. 
</p>
<p>However, a person awaiting trial on charges of rape has been held in Kindia central prison 
</p>
<p>for the past nine years. More than 20 other persons detained on felony charges have been in 
</p>
<p>pretrial detention for periods of more than 2 to 6 years. Since August 2011, five officers of 
</p>
<p>the Guinean military, who were arrested in connection with the attack on the President&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>residence on 19 July 2011, have been held in Conakry central prison without trial or 
</p>
<p>renewal of the detention order against them. They were charged with crimes against State 
</p>
<p>security, murder and attempted murder by the indictment division of the Conakry court, and 
</p>
<p>their case was transferred to a military court that has yet to be established, before which 
</p>
<p>they are to stand trial for desertion and failure to obey orders, which carry maximum 
</p>
<p>penalties of 2 and 6 months&#8217; imprisonment respectively under the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>31. In addition, persons in pretrial detention for misdemeanours, for which the 
</p>
<p>maximum duration is 4 months under the Criminal Code, are being held in various prisons, 
</p>
<p>particularly in Conakry, for longer periods, usually without the renewal of the detention 
</p>
<p>order by a judge. 
</p>
<p>32. Faster processing of the case files of suspects held in police custody and persons in 
</p>
<p>pretrial detention, as well as the use of alternative measures to detention, would help 
</p>
<p>resolve the problem of prison overcrowding and to improve prison conditions. 
</p>
<p>33. Between January 2012 and June 2014, staff of the OHCHR office in Guinea visited 
</p>

<p>GE.15-03278 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>are being held. These regular visits have made it possible to conduct a thorough review3 of 
</p>
<p>the operation of the criminal justice system, including the criminal police, the public 
</p>
<p>prosecution service, judges and the prison system. Members of the police force and the 
</p>
<p>judiciary work under extremely poor conditions, due to a lack or complete absence of 
</p>
<p>infrastructure, trained personnel and adequate logistical resources. Public documents and 
</p>
<p>infrastructure were either completely destroyed or severely damaged by angry citizens 
</p>
<p>during the labour strikes that took place in 2007 in 30 out of 33 prefectures in the country. 
</p>
<p>34. The OHCHR office in Guinea found that prisons were dilapidated and unsanitary 
</p>
<p>and that there was a lack of privacy due to overcrowding. International standards on 
</p>
<p>detention, particularly the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners,4 are 
</p>
<p>very poorly respected. In some prisons, such as those in Boffa and Bok&#233;, the latrines are 
</p>
<p>located inside small and overcrowded cells. As for the right to health, under an agreement 
</p>
<p>signed in 2004 between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Justice, each prison 
</p>
<p>should have a health-care worker assigned to it. The implementation of this agreement, has 
</p>
<p>however, had very little impact and does not permit professional consultations or the 
</p>
<p>dispensing of medicines to detainees, who must pay for their own medication. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Respect for physical integrity 
</b></p>
<p>35. Respect for a person&#8217;s physical and moral integrity is an inalienable right and must 
</p>
<p>not be restricted under any circumstances. Torture is formally prohibited under article 5 of 
</p>
<p>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights and article 6 of the Guinean Constitution. 
</p>
<p>36. Torture and ill-treatment have long been commonplace in Guinea, particularly in 
</p>
<p>places of detention, where torture was the usual means of obtaining confessions and 
</p>
<p>information. The Criminal Code neither criminalizes nor defines torture. The Government 
</p>
<p>should intensify its efforts, in particular by speeding up the current legislative reform to 
</p>
<p>incorporate the Convention against Torture into Guinean positive law and by ratifying the 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the Convention, so as to enable the Subcommittee on Prevention of 
</p>
<p>Torture to conduct unannounced visits. The Committee against Torture, in its concluding 
</p>
<p>observations on the initial report of Guinea, adopted on 20 May 2014 (CAT/C/GIN/CO/1), 
</p>
<p>expressed concern about the absence of legislation on torture, and stressed that this could 
</p>
<p>lead to impunity for perpetrators of torture. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>37. The freedom to move about freely, to leave any country, including one&#8217;s own, and to 
</p>
<p>return to one&#8217;s own country, is a fundamental freedom guaranteed under article 13 of the 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 12 of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights. Article 10, paragraph 4, of the Guinean Constitution provides 
</p>
<p>that: &#8220;All citizens have the right to establish residence and travel throughout the territory of 
</p>
<p>the Republic, and to enter and leave it freely.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>38. On 13 August 2014, the President declared a state of health emergency and 
</p>
<p>announced restrictions on gatherings and on the freedom of movement, including in the 
</p>
<p>areas most affected in Guin&#233;e Foresti&#232;re along the borders with Liberia and Sierra Leone. 
</p>
<p>The decree established a cordon sanitaire to be manned by health workers and security and

<p> 3 Report on conditions of detention in Guinea, issued in October 2014 by the OHCHR office in Guinea, 
</p>
<p>available at www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/GN/ReportofGuinea_October2014.pdf. 
</p>
<p> 4 Adopted by the first United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of 
</p>
<p>Offenders, held in Geneva in 1955 and approved by the Economic and Social Council in its 
</p>
<p>resolutions 663 C (XXIV) of 31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 1977. </p>

</p>
<p>defence forces at all points of entry into Guinea. The movement of persons is restricted and 
</p>
<p>is subject to health monitoring measures at the various points of entry at land borders, 
</p>
<p>seaports and airports. All health workers and security and defence forces have been 
</p>
<p>mobilized to combat the disease. A temperature-monitoring system has been set up at 
</p>
<p>Conakry airport, and anyone with an abnormally high body temperature is prohibited from 
</p>
<p>travelling. 
</p>
<p>39. These restrictions on freedom of movement, while justified, limit the exercise of 
</p>
<p>certain rights, as described above. They may well limit people&#8217;s participation in the 2015 
</p>
<p>presidential elections. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Government has made commitments to improve the administration of justice 
</p>
<p>and to improve conditions of detention. With support from national and international 
</p>
<p>partners, including OHCHR, reform of the main pieces of criminal legislation and of 
</p>
<p>legislation on the organization of the judicial system has been initiated. The Criminal Code, 
</p>
<p>the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Military Justice Code are all being reviewed with 
</p>
<p>the aim of bringing them into line with the State&#8217;s commitments under the international and 
</p>
<p>regional human rights instruments to which it is a party. 
</p>
<p>41. The Supreme Council of Justice, which is responsible for, inter alia, safeguarding 
</p>
<p>judges&#8217; careers, was established in March 2014, and the President of the Republic enacted 
</p>
<p>the Act on the Special Status of Judges in June of that year. In July 2014, the Head of State 
</p>
<p>also approved a document on judicial reform prepared by the National Steering Committee 
</p>
<p>for Judicial Reform. 
</p>
<p>42. Two training workshops were organized by OHCHR in Kindia and Lab&#233; from 22 to 
</p>
<p>29 October 2014, at which 107 judges and judicial officials (criminal police officers, 
</p>
<p>response unit officers, lawyers, prison staff and bailiffs) in Basse Guin&#233;e and Moyenne 
</p>
<p>Guin&#233;e were informed about their roles and responsibilities for promoting and protecting 
</p>
<p>human rights. These sessions provided an opportunity for participants to reflect on the 
</p>
<p>failures and shortcomings of the judicial system and to consider appropriate solutions for 
</p>
<p>strengthening the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>43. However, the absence or lack of adequate infrastructure, the lack of trained and 
</p>
<p>specialized staff and the insufficient budget allocated to the Ministry of Justice continue to 
</p>
<p>have a major effect on the administration of justice. In addition to these factors, which are 
</p>
<p>attributable to the State, defendants regularly report corruption among some judges. Many 
</p>
<p>detainees interviewed by the staff of the OHCHR office in Guinea claimed that they were in 
</p>
<p>prison because they were unable to pay the sums of money demanded by criminal police 
</p>
<p>officers or judges for their release. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Combating impunity 
</b></p>
<p>44. In the previous report, the High Commissioner for Human Rights recommended that 
</p>
<p>the Government should strengthen the fight against impunity, in particular by prosecuting 
</p>
<p>the alleged perpetrators of the human rights violations committed on 28 September 2009 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/44 and Corr.1, para. 57 (a)). Likewise, on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the 
</p>
<p>28 September massacres in Conakry, the High Commissioner urged the Guinean authorities 
</p>
<p>to take immediate and concrete steps to move forward the investigation and to prosecute 
</p>
<p>those responsible for the human rights violations, including the acts of murder, rape and </p>


<p>GE.15-03278 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>enforced disappearance committed by security forces against peaceful demonstrators.5 In 
</p>
<p>reality, very little is being done to combat impunity. 
</p>
<p>45. In particular, many human rights violations involving gendarmerie and army officers 
</p>
<p>go unpunished. For example, proceedings against the gendarmes involved in cases of 
</p>
<p>torture and ill-treatment documented by OHCHR since 2012 are still being blocked, 
</p>
<p>because the gendarmerie commanders concerned have failed to respond to all court 
</p>
<p>summonses, claiming that they have not received authorization from their superiors. 
</p>
<p>46. Marginal progress has been made regarding the events of 28 September 2009, with 
</p>
<p>new charges brought and hearings held. Over the course of 2014, about 400 victims were 
</p>
<p>heard by the investigating judges handling the case. In July 2014, Captain Moussa Dadis 
</p>
<p>Camara, head of the military junta at the time of the events, was heard as a witness by a 
</p>
<p>judge from Burkina Faso whose judicial assistance had been requested by the Guinean 
</p>
<p>judiciary. In September 2014, the Minister of Sports at the time of the events was also 
</p>
<p>heard as a witness. 
</p>
<p>47. However, more than five years after the events, victims and their dependents are still 
</p>
<p>waiting for the authorities to take decisive action, for example by placing the defence and 
</p>
<p>security forces officials accused in the case on inactive duty. Impunity also prevails with 
</p>
<p>regard to the events in Zogota in August 2012, the communal violence that broke out from 
</p>
<p>15 to 18 July 2013 and the attacks in Womey on 16 September 2014. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Violence against women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>48. In the previous report, the High Commissioner for Human Rights recommended that 
</p>
<p>the Government should strengthen the fight against all forms of discrimination, especially 
</p>
<p>sexual violence against women and girls, with particular emphasis on combating sexual 
</p>
<p>violence and female genital mutilation (A/HRC/25/44 and Corr.1, para. 57 (d)). 
</p>
<p>49. During the reporting period, the Government has made considerable efforts to 
</p>
<p>combat discrimination and violence against women. In October 2014, the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Discrimination against Women noted that significant progress had been 
</p>
<p>made, in particular by the adoption of laws, policies and action plans to combat 
</p>
<p>discrimination and violence against women. The Committee expressed concern, however, 
</p>
<p>over the persistence of stereotypes and harmful practices affecting women, such as forced 
</p>
<p>marriage, domestic violence and female genital mutilation, including female circumcision. 
</p>
<p>50. Guinea should intensify its efforts to combat such practices, especially female 
</p>
<p>circumcision, to which 97 per cent of women and girls in the country are subjected. A 
</p>
<p>positive first step, which has set a precedent, is the conviction by the Conakry Third Court 
</p>
<p>of First Instance of a female circumciser, who was a repeat offender, to a suspended 
</p>
<p>sentence of 2 years&#8217; imprisonment and the payment of 1 million Guinean francs.6 
</p>
<p>51. In addition, impunity still persists in cases of gender-based violence. Indeed, the 
</p>
<p>OHCHR office in Guinea has noted that judicial personnel show a generally tolerant 
</p>
<p>attitude towards sexual offences and sexual violence once proceedings reach the 
</p>
<p>investigation phase. For example, two cases of gang rape were settled amicably in 
</p>
<p>Nzer&#233;kor&#233; prefecture under pressure from the local community; the judiciary made no 
</p>
<p>attempt to pursue legal proceedings against the suspects. In another case of rape committed 
</p>
<p>in the village of Nianpara, the suspect was placed on remand, then under judicial 
</p>
<p>supervision, before being returned to the supervision of the investigating judge, then 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 OHCHR, press release issued on 26 September 2014, available on the OHCHR website at 
</p>

</p>
<p>transferred to Nzer&#233;kor&#233; central prison before being released in confused circumstances. In 
</p>
<p>Dubr&#233;ka, 55 kilometres from Conakry, a member of the defence forces charged with raping 
</p>
<p>a minor was released and placed under judicial supervision by the investigating judge. 
</p>
<p>52. There have, however, been some signs of improvement. In August 2014, a soldier of 
</p>
<p>the Presidential Guard was detained by the gendarmerie and brought to court after a 
</p>
<p>medical certificate had been issued confirming the rape of two girls under 10 years of age. 
</p>
<p>He was placed in detention at the Conakry central prison pending trial. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Cooperation to promote and protect human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Strengthening of cooperation with the international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Creation of an inter-ministerial human rights committee 
</b></p>
<p>53. The delays in the submission by Guinea of its initial and periodic reports to the 
</p>
<p>United Nations treaty bodies were attributable to the indifference of the authorities, for 
</p>
<p>whom human rights issues were not a priority. Thanks to the political will of the current 
</p>
<p>authorities and the support provided by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, an inter-ministerial human rights committee (responsible for drafting reports for 
</p>
<p>submission to the treaty bodies) was created by a decision of the Prime Minister on 21 July 
</p>
<p>2014. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Cooperation with the treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>54. The OHCHR office in Guinea helped the Government to submit its initial report to 
</p>
<p>the Committee against Torture, by providing technical support for analysing the data 
</p>
<p>collected on the basis of the relevant international standards (see CAT/C/GIN/1). 
</p>
<p>55. The OHCHR office in Guinea also provided support to the National Directorate for 
</p>
<p>Children of the Ministry of Social Action, in connection with efforts to finalize the two 
</p>
<p>initial reports on the implementation of the first two Optional Protocols to the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of the Child: the initial report under the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict and the initial 
</p>
<p>report under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale 
</p>
<p>of children, child prostitution and child pornography.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>56. In January 2015, the human rights situation in Guinea was considered by the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council as a part of the universal periodic review. In 2010, during the first review of 
</p>
<p>Guinea, the Government accepted 105 of the 114 recommendations formulated. 
</p>
<p>57. From 15 to 19 September 2014, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, in conjunction with the Ministry of Human Rights and Civil Liberties, held a 
</p>
<p>capacity-building workshop for the members of the Inter-Ministerial Committee and 
</p>
<p>representatives of civil society. The workshop addressed the preparation and submission of 
</p>
<p>initial and periodic reports to the various treaty bodies and for the universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review, and the implementation of the recommendations and observations within the 
</p>
<p>participatory process. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> B. Integration of human rights into security sector reform 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Implementation of new Government policies 
</b></p>
<p>58. In September 2014, the Government adopted a national priority action strategy as a 
</p>
<p>part of judicial reforms. The overall aim of the national priority action strategy is to 
</p>
<p>strengthen the rule of law and improve governance in the field of justice. Moreover, the 
</p>
<p>strategy, which relies on the consolidation of the rule of law and the reform of the prison 
</p>
<p>system, should eventually ensure the independence of the judiciary and facilitate access to 
</p>
<p>justice. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, together with other 
</p>
<p>agencies of the United Nations system operating in Guinea, provided technical support for 
</p>
<p>the preparation of that strategy. 
</p>
<p>59. On 30 June 2014, the President of the Republic of Guinea set up the Provisional 
</p>
<p>National Reconciliation Commission, co-chaired by the Head Imam of Conakry, El-hadj 
</p>
<p>Mamadou Saliou Camara, and the Archbishop of Conakry, Monsignor Vincent Coulibaly. 
</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s task is to discuss and draw up a national consultation programme to 
</p>
<p>gauge public opinion on a national reconciliation process. The Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights provided technical support to recruit 25 members of the 
</p>
<p>staff of the Provisional Commission, including 8 project coordinators, 8 assistants and 8 
</p>
<p>community outreach workers. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Legislative reforms 
</b></p>
<p>60. Other priorities of the Government include the ongoing preparation of a bill on the 
</p>
<p>organization of the judicial system and a new policy on the organization of the prison 
</p>
<p>system. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights helped to raise awareness 
</p>
<p>among the members of the National Steering Committee for Judicial Reform about the 
</p>
<p>integration of human rights into that important process. 
</p>
<p>61. The process of reforming the security sector, which was initiated in 2010 with the 
</p>
<p>support of the international community, intensified during 2014, with special emphasis on 
</p>
<p>the monitoring, by democratic, civilian actors, of the defence and security forces. A code of 
</p>
<p>conduct for the army, drawn up on the basis of respect for human rights, was prepared and 
</p>
<p>disseminated across the country, with the support of the Office of the High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights. Thanks to the support of the Office of the High Commissioner and of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Development Programme, information on the Military Justice Code was 
</p>
<p>also disseminated among the various units of the armed forces based in the country&#8217;s four 
</p>
<p>military regions. This outreach activity enabled the members of the defence and security 
</p>
<p>forces better to understand the contents and scope of the various provisions of the Code and 
</p>
<p>the process whereby military personnel guilty of human rights violations are punished. 
</p>
<p>62. As a part of the implementation of a project to strengthen community policing, 
</p>
<p>supported by the Peacebuilding Fund, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights is involved in the integration of human rights modules into the basic training 
</p>
<p>curricula of the defence and security forces, including in police and gendarmerie training 
</p>
<p>facilities and military academies and training centres. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Support for civil society bodies 
</b></p>
<p>63. In 2014, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights organized seven 
</p>
<p>coordination and cooperation meetings with civil society bodies on the human rights 
</p>
<p>situation in Guinea. The meetings made it possible to strengthen the capacity of NGOs to 
</p>
<p>perform their roles and responsibilities for the promotion and protection of human rights, 
</p>
<p>advocacy to ensure that human rights issues are taken into account when working to </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.15-03278 
</p>
<p>prevent and combat Ebola virus and the submission of periodic reports to the treaty bodies 
</p>
<p>and for the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>64. The OHCHR office in Guinea has provided support to and helped build the technical 
</p>
<p>capacities of associations of victims of Camp Boiro (under the First Republic of Guinea), 
</p>
<p>the large-scale strikes of 2007, and the massacres of 28 September 2009. In 2014, the 
</p>
<p>OHCHR office in Guinea held five practical workshops on the inclusion of a gender 
</p>
<p>perspective in the transitional justice process. 
</p>
<p>65. On 26 June 2014, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in 
</p>
<p>conjunction with the Ministries of Human Rights and Justice and civil society bodies, 
</p>
<p>organized activities in Conakry to mark the United Nations International Day in Support of 
</p>
<p>Victims of Torture. More than 150 persons took part in discussions on the role of the State 
</p>
<p>and civil society in the implementation of the recommendations of the Committee against 
</p>
<p>Torture, the incorporation into domestic legislation of the Convention against Torture and 
</p>
<p>Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, efforts to make the justice 
</p>
<p>system more accessible and efforts to combat impunity and gender-based violence.
