(15- 26 November 2012), A/HRC/23/41/Add.3. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>The Government of Japan offered its utmost cooperation to Anand Grover, the Special 
Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health, on his mission to Japan last November with the involvement of 
a number of ministries, based on his request and in light of the recommendations of the 
second UPR (Universal Periodic Review) cycle. 
</p>
<p>The Government recognizes that the health management of the residents affected by the 
situation involving Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station is of considerable 
importance. Therefore, it has been working on health management taking into account the 
latest findings of medical experts beyond examining the possibility of influence on heath in 
a limited way. 
</p>
<p>We, the Government of Japan, have been taking various measures to improve situations 
which were mentioned in Mr. Grover&#8217;s report. The main points of improvement are 
described in the following document. 
</p>
<p>While Mr. Grover&#8217;s report reflects his personal and independent perspective, we have made 
some comments on his draft report in advance concerning a misunderstanding of the facts 
from scientific and juridical viewpoint in response to his request. It seems that his report 
which was finally submitted to the Human Rights Council does not reflect our comments 
sufficiently; therefore, we attach those comments to this document.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reply to the recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to implement the following 
recommendations in the formulation and implementation of its nuclear emergency 
response system: 
</p>
<p>(a) Establish regularly updated emergency response plans that clearly demarcate the 
command structures and specify evacuation zones, evacuation centres, and provide 
guidelines for assisting vulnerable groups; 
</p>
<p>This has been already carried out.  
</p>
<p>The Nuclear Regulation Authority has established new Guidelines on Nuclear Emergency 
Preparedness. The Guidelines specify operational and technical matters including a 
conceptual basis for evacuation and off-site emergency zones. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, on the basis of the law, the central government, local governments and 
operators of nuclear facilities have developed their emergency action plans respectively. 
</p>
<p>(b) Communicate disaster management plans, including response and evacuation 
measures, to residents of areas likely to be affected by a nuclear accident; 
</p>
<p>This has been already carried out. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/41/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p>In the regional disaster prevention plans crafted by local governments, evacuation plans 
have been developed, and they have been made open to the public by the local 
governments. 
</p>
<p>(c) Release disaster-related information to the public as soon as a nuclear accident 
occurs; 
</p>
<p>This has been already carried out. 
</p>
<p>The central government is prepared to implement necessary measures to protect residents 
from radiation caused by a nuclear accident in a flexible way and disseminate information 
to the public and news media in a prompt manner. 
</p>
<p>(d) Distribute promptly iodine prophylaxis before or as soon as the accident occurs; 
</p>
<p>This has been already carried out. 
</p>
<p>Distribution and consumption of stable iodine agent have been described by the Nuclear 
Regulation Authority in the new Guidelines on Nuclear Emergency Preparedness. 
</p>
<p>e) Provide for prompt and effective usage of such technology as SPEEDI in gathering 
and disseminating information on affected areas; 
</p>
<p>The central government has already provided the results of SPEEDI (System for 
Predictions of Environmental Emergency Dose Information). 
</p>
<p>Results of SPEEDI, a system to predict a diffusion of radioactive materials in the air, are 
made use of when establishing evacuation plans. And the results are uploaded on the central 
government&#8217;s web-site so they are open to the public. The results of SPEEDI on prediction 
of a diffusion of radioactive materials caused by the accident at Fukushima Dai-ichi 
Nuclear Power Station have continued to be open to the public. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, information other than the SPEEDI results is able to be shared quickly among 
relevant contact points through a video conference system and other means, which connect 
contact points of the central government, local governments and operators of nuclear 
facilities. 
</p>
<p>The central government is prepared to implement necessary measures to protect residents 
from radiation caused by a nuclear accident in a flexible way and disseminate information 
to the public and news media in a prompt manner. 
</p>
<p>77. With respect to health monitoring of the affected population, the Special 
Rapporteur urges the Government to implement the following recommendations: 
</p>
<p>The Government recognizes that the health management of the affected residents is of 
considerable importance. It also regards that respecting the perspectives of medical experts 
sufficiently when considering the place and process of health management is important, and 
understands that expert committees constituted of local doctors and experts, which have 
been set up in Fukushima Prefecture and other neighboring prefectures, have discussed on 
policies of health management. On the basis of the governor of Fukushima Prefecture&#8217;s 
opinion, which states that Fukushima Prefecture should take the initiative on conducting 
middle- to long-term health management, the Government has been financially and 
technically supporting the health management survey of Fukushima Prefecture. 
Furthermore, it understands that health management includes all types of management 
which are regarded as necessary by the committee on the basis of the accumulated </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/41/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 
</b></p>
<p>knowledge of medical experts such as in the 2008 report of the United Nations Scientific 
Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR).  
</p>
<p>The Government will continue to work on health management taking account the latest 
findings of medical experts beyond examining the influence on health in a limited way. 
</p>
<p>(a) Continue monitoring the impact of radiation on the health of affected persons 
through holistic and comprehensive screening for a considerable length of time and 
provide appropriate treatment available to those in need; 
</p>
<p>Already completed. The Government of Japan made a financial contribution (JPY 78.2 
billion) for the Fukushima Health Management Survey in order to ensure mid- to long-
range health-care for the residents of Fukushima Prefecture, especially for children and the 
residents who lived in the evacuation zone.  
</p>
<p>The Fukushima Health Management Survey consists of a basic survey (estimation of 
external radiation dose) covering the population of Fukushima (2 million people) and four 
detailed surveys: a thyroid ultrasound examination (residents between 0 and 18 years), a 
comprehensive health check (residents of all ages living in the evacuation zones), a mental 
health and lifestyle survey (residents of all ages living in the evacuation zones) and a 
pregnancy and birth survey (of around 16 000 women who received maternal and child 
health care in Fukushima prefecture)1. 
</p>
<p>The Government will continue to manage the health of the residents appropriately. </p>
<p>(b) The health management survey should be provided to persons residing in all 
affected areas with radiation exposure higher than 1 mSv/year; 
</p>
<p>Already completed. There is not a sufficient scientific basis for the claim that health 
management is necessary for residents who live in areas where the additional radiation dose 
is 1 mSv/year. Thus, the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur, which does not have a 
scientific basis, is not acceptable without changing the content of the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>The annual background radiation dose in Japan was estimated at 2.1 mSv. When adding an 
extra 1 mSv/year due to the nuclear accident, the annual radiation dose increases to 3.1 
mSv/year. This value is similar to the background radiation dose of the USA (3.1 mSv) and 
that of many countries in Europe (2 &#8211; 7 mSv/year). When using effective dose, the effect of 
the additional radiation due to the nuclear accident is equal to that of the background 
radiation. If residents exposed to a radiation dose of ~3 mSy/year must be included as 
subjects of health management survey, many countries, where residents are exposed with 
radiation doses of ~3 mSy/year, should conduct health management surveys for radiation. 
Medical and scientific bases are necessary when we discuss whether the residents who live 
in areas with additional 1 mSv/year should be included as subjects of health management 
surveys. 
</p>
<p>Health management has been in place for residents in Japan regardless of the nuclear 
accident (e.g. once a year for students at school). Moreover, a person who presents a certain 
symptom can consult a doctor at a medical institution without restriction. 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/41/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>The contents of the health monitoring of residents concerning the nuclear accident has been 
decided on a scientific basis and an estimation of radiation exposure. In areas where the 
radiation dose is relatively high or where long-term evacuation is expected, individual 
radiation doses are estimated and blood tests are carried out. In areas where the radiation 
dose is relatively low and which needs to investigate health conditions other than health 
effects of the radiation dose, health conditions of residents can be monitored with the data 
of existing health check-ups and medical institutions, whether residents are exposed to an 
additional 1 mSv of radiation dose in a year or not. The WHO assessed that the health risk 
from the Fukushima nuclear accident, and suggested that the increases in the incidence of 
human disease attributable to the additional radiation exposure from the nuclear accident 
are likely to remain below detectable levels2. UNSCEAR is now assessing the influence of 
the nuclear accident on the health of residents, as well as the WHO. The Government will 
continue to work on measures so that suitable support will be provided to the people who 
truly need the support. 
</p>
<p>(c) Ensure greater participation and higher response rates in all health surveys; 
</p>
<p>Already completed. Investigators have supported writing questionnaires by visiting 
temporary housing and hearing from evacuees to increase the response rate of 
questionnaires for the estimation of individual radiation doses (basic survey). Moreover, 
various supports are provided to assist the creation of questionnaires in municipalities, such 
as face-to-face instruction and seminars. 
</p>
<p>The thyroid examination has been conducted since November 1, 2012 in all prefectures so 
that evacuees can undergo the examination in the place they currently live. There are 77 
institutions where the examination can be consulted, covering all prefectures outside 
Fukushima Prefecture. The thyroid screening is performed on about 150,000 subjects and 
the consultation rate of the subjects to date is about 85% (summarized data until January, 
2013)3. 
</p>
<p>(d) Ensure that the basic health management survey includes information on the 
specific health condition of individuals and other factors that may exacerbate the 
effect of radiation exposure on their health;  
</p>
<p>Already completed. A considerably wide range of health effects shall be investigated when 
combining the data of the health management survey due to the nuclear accident with the 
existing health check-ups and also from the medical institutions as mentioned in 77(a). 
</p>
<p>(e) Avoid limiting the health check-up for children to thyroid checks and extend 
check-ups for all possible health effects, including urine and blood tests; 
</p>
<p>Although some misunderstandings are in fact included in this opinion, the recommendation 
has already been carried out. There is little scientific basis for urine and blood tests, and 
thus we cannot accept this recommendation.  The children&#8217;s health survey is not limited to 
an ultrasound examination of thyroid. Urinalysis and an electrocardiogram are carried out 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/41/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 
</b></p>
<p>in the existing health check-ups described in 77 (b), and also blood tests are carried out in 
the areas where radioactivity doses are relatively high. Such examinations are chosen 
because the examination is scientifically required or its necessity is indicated.  
</p>
<p>The necessity of the examination recommended by the Special Rapporteur has not been 
demonstrated scientifically. A health survey conducted on normal healthy people is rare 
and, therefore, many researchers are interested in conducting research. However, we do not 
agree with compelling unnecessary examination. 
</p>
<p>(f) Make follow-up and secondary examination for children&#8217;s thyroid check up 
available to all requesting children and parents; 
</p>
<p>Already completed through the Fukushima Health Management Survey. As mentioned 
previously in 77(b), a person who is aware of a certain symptom can seek consultation 
through a medical examination at a medical institution without limitation. Children can also 
seek consultations through medical examination as well. 
</p>
<p>(g) Simplify children&#8217;s and their parents&#8217; access to information regarding their test 
results, while ensuring the protection of private information; 
</p>
<p>This was already carried out through the Fukushima health management survey. The results 
of ultrasound thyroid examination have been presented to all subjects. In addition, the 
detailed explanation that the Special Rapporteur pointed out was requested by 
approximately 200 persons of 170,000 persons who were examined in relation to thyroid, 
and we have explained the results to all of them (summarized data until January 2013). 
</p>
<p>(h) Refrain from restricting examination for internal exposure to whole-body 
counters and provide it to all affected population, including residents, evacuees, and to 
persons outside Fukushima prefecture; 
</p>
<p>Because the Rapporteur&#8217;s indication have little scientific basis, we cannot accept it. 
</p>
<p>Though the Rapporteur recommends to conduct wide internal exposure investigation by 
urinalysis, whole body counting (WBC), which can be conducted more easily and 
accurately, was chosen to examine residents, preferentially children and pregnant women in 
Fukushima Prefecture. To provide a more detailed explanation, urine testing requires the 
labor of collecting several urine samples over a whole day because the concentration varies 
throughout the day. It is not realistic to force residents (especially children and pregnant 
women) to collect several urine samples over the course of a whole day.  
</p>
<p>In the beginning of the health management survey, we compared the estimates of internal 
exposure between WBC and urine tests in a sampling test. However, the results were not 
consistent . Basically, the estimation of internal dose by urinalysis is not much more 
reliable relative to the estimation by WBC because there is variability in biological half-
life. Thus, urinalysis was not chosen as an alternative method for WBC to estimate internal 
dose of residents in Fukushima Prefecture. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur recommends estimating the internal dose of radioactive strontium 
(Sr-90), which emits beta-radiation, by urinalysis because it is difficult to measure beta-
radiation by WBC. Because contamination of Sr-90 is much less than that of radioactive 
cesium from the Fukushima nuclear accident, it is reasonable to focus on the internal dose </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/41/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>of cesium. The concentration of Sr-90 was between 1/19,000 and 1/600 of that of 
radioactive cesium in the monthly fallout measured by the Ministry of Education, Culture, 
Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT).4 Thus, there is no strong incentive to measure 
concentration of Sr-90 in urine for the health management of the residents. Based on this 
scientific basis, we are conducting examination of internal doses by WBC as part of the 
health management of the residents in the Fukushima prefecture. 
</p>
<p>There is no reasonable explanation to compel the residents to undergo examination of low 
medical priority, and recommendations which do not have a medical and scientific basis are 
not acceptable. 
</p>
<p>In Fukushima Prefecture, 123,050 persons were examined for internal exposure resulting 
from this accident by the end of March 2013. The data from Fukushima Prefecture indicate 
that more than 99.9% of the residents&#8217; internal exposure was less than 1 mSv and that the 
</p>
<p>highest internal exposure among them was approximately 3 mSv5. This result is within the 
range of the natural radiation dose. 
</p>
<p>The WHO assessed the health risk from the Fukushima nuclear accident, and their results 
suggest that the increases in the incidence of human disease attributable to the additional 
radiation exposure from the nuclear accident are likely to remain below detectable levels. 
UNSCEAR is now assessing influence of the nuclear accident on the health of residents, as 
well as the WHO. The Government will continue to work on measures so that suitable 
support will be provided to the people who truly need it. 
</p>
<p>(i) Ensure mental health facilities, goods and services are available to all evacuees 
and residents, especially vulnerable groups such as older persons, children and 
pregnant women; 
</p>
<p>Due to problems of structure and management of shelters, some people requiring assistance 
during the disaster could not stay in shelters. Moreover, some of them were obliged to stay 
in their own homes because the establishment of welfare evacuation centers was not well 
publicized, and this prevented them from receiving enough information and assistance. 
</p>
<p>Based on these issues, a committee of experts was established in FY 2012. The committee 
discussed the contents that should be included in the guidelines for ensuring a sound living 
environment, and compiled a report. 
</p>
<p>Hereafter, the government will establish the &#8220;Guidelines for Ensuring Sound Living 
Environment in Shelters&#8221; based on the report. 
</p>
<p>And, in regard to older persons living in temporary housing, we support activities including 
comprehensive counseling, observation, etc, with periodic visits by the  Council of Social 
Welfare. In addition, we have located Long-Term Care Support Bases in temporary housing 
to consult about general matters, provide long-term care services and livelihood support 
services and places for conversation with local residents, etc. 
</p>
<p>The mental healthcare professionals visit homes or temporary housing to perform medical 
assistance or support consultations with the affected people.

</b></p>
<p>In addition, as part of our efforts to provide mental/psychological care to children, the 
Government of Japan (MEXT: the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and 
Technology is implementing the following efforts: 
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent dispatch of school counselors and other specialists  
</b></p>
<p>The Government of Japan is dispatching school counselors and other specialists to schools 
in disaster-stricken areas, and providing necessary assistance for continuous mental 
healthcare to children suffering from the after-effects of the disaster.  
</p>
<p><b>  Mental healthcare countermeasures 
</b></p>
<p>The Government is holding training sessions targeting school teachers regarding mental 
healthcare as well as various symposia and other opportunities.  
</p>
<p>MEXT is aiming to diffuse information and raise awareness nationwide on proper mental 
healthcare. 
</p>
<p>(k) Monitor the health effects of radiation on nuclear plant workers and provide 
necessary treatment. 
</p>
<p>Regarding workers regularly engaged in work that exposes them to radiation such as 
nuclear plant workers, relevant regulations obligate employers to conduct necessary 
medical examinations every 6 months. Necessary treatment will be provided based on the 
results of medical examinations.  
</p>
<p>Furthermore, based on governmental guidelines, additional examinations are provided for 
workers engaged in emergency work in Fukushima Daiichi NPP during the period that 
emergency exposure dose limits had been increased to 250mSv (March 14 to December 16, 
2011) in accordance with the exposure dose of the said workers. MHLW (the Ministry of 
Health, Labour and Welfare) has collected and recorded the results of medical examinations 
of the said workers in MHLW&#8217;s database. Necessary treatment will be provided based on 
</p>
<p>the results of additional medical examinations. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to implement the following 
recommendations regarding policies and information on radiation dose: 
</p>
<p>(a) Formulate a national plan on evacuation zones and safe limits of radiation by 
using current scientific evidence, based on human rights rather than on a risk-benefit 
analysis, and reduce the radiation dose to less than 1mSv/year; 
</p>
<p>The Government of Japan set the evacuation areas based on the globally accepted 
recommendation of ICRP and discussion between domestic and foreign experts for 
radiation. 
</p>
<p>ICRP also recommends that the transition from an emergency exposure situation to an 
existing exposure situation should be managed by keeping exposures as low as reasonably 
achievable, taking into account economic and societal factors as well as the distribution of 
doses and benefits resulting from the implementation of the protection strategies. 
</p>
<p>(b) Provide, in schoolbooks and materials, accurate information about the risk 
radiation exposure and about the increased vulnerability of children to radiation 
exposure; </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/41/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>In October 2011, MEXT issued a supplementary reader about radiation. Regarding the 
relationship between radiation levels and their effect on health, it states that no clear 
evidence has been presented to show that exposure to low levels of radiation at less than 
100 mSv for short periods of time leads to cancer and other illnesses. At the same time, 
however, the reader also includes the International Commission on Radiological Protection 
(ICRP)&#8217;s belief that even in cases of exposure to radiation up to 100 mSv, a proportional 
relationship exists between radiation exposure and cancer death rates, as well as the ICRP&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>warning that exposure to radiation should be kept to levels as low as possible. The reader 
also states that radiation is one cause of cancer, along with smoking, food and dietary 
habits, viruses, air pollution, and so on, and that it is important to reduce exposure to 
radiation as much as possible.  
</p>
<p>(c) Incorporate validated independent data, including that from the communities, to 
monitor radiation levels. 
</p>
<p>Concerning radiation monitoring, the central government has implemented precise 
monitoring activities in cooperation with relevant organizations in line with the Overall 
Coordinated Radiation Monitoring Plan developed by the central government.  Under the 
plan, it is required that the quality and validation of monitoring data taken and provided by 
relevant organizations should be ensured by making them open to the public.  In this regard, 
the organizations of radiation monitoring have been required to adhere to the plan described 
above.  The central government has continued to implement radiation monitoring activities 
with the ensured quality and validation of monitoring data. 
</p>
<p>79. Regarding decontamination, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to 
adopt the following recommendations:  
</p>
<p>(a) Formulate urgently a clear, time-bound plan to reduce radiation levels to less 
than 1mSv/year; 
</p>
<p>It is a long-term goal in the areas with less than 20 mSv/year that additional exposure dose 
would become less than 1 mSv/year.  
</p>
<p>When the national government conducts decontamination work in the Special 
Decontamination Area, the work is implemented in FY2012 and 2013 according to &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>Policy for the Decontamination in the Special Decontamination Area (Decontamination 
Road Map).&#8221; The policy after FY2013 will be formulated based on the results of the 
</p>
<p>decontamination work in the first two years. 
</p>
<p>(b) Clearly mark sites where radioactive debris is stored; 
</p>
<p>Regarding temporary storage sites, such measures as below are taken to mark them clearly 
based on the Act on Special Measures Concerning the Handling of Radioactive Pollution. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; To install an enclosure to prevent any person from indiscriminately entering the 
sites.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; To set up boards which clearly state, with an emergency contact number, that the 
space is a temporary storage site. 
</p>
<p>(c) Provide, with the participation of the community, safe and appropriate 
temporary and final storage facilities for radioactive debris; 
</p>
<p>Temporary storage sites are indispensable to conducting decontamination work. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/41/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>10 
</b></p>
<p>As such, the Ministry of the Environment as well as related municipalities have been 
endeavouring to secure storage sites, paying due attention to the safety of storage while 
obtaining local stakeholders&#8217; consent.  
</p>
<p>As for final disposal facility, the government will give this very important issue 
considerable thought while hearing a wide range of opinions.  
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to implement the following 
recommendations regarding transparency and accountability within the regulatory 
framework: 
</p>
<p>(a) Require compliance of the regulatory authority and the nuclear power plant 
operators with internationally agreed safety standards and guidelines;  
</p>
<p>The Nuclear Regulation Authority newly developed regulatory requirements for nuclear 
power reactors, which will go into effect in July 2013, taking into account the lessons learnt 
from the accident at Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station and IAEA nuclear safety 
standards, etc. to an even greater extent.  The regulatory requirements are open to the public 
through the following web-site: http://www.nsr.go.jp/english/ 
</p>
<p>(b) Ensure disclosure by members of the Nuclear Regulatory Authority of their 
association with the nuclear power industry; 
</p>
<p>The website of Prime Minister&#8217;s Cabinet Secretariat 
</p>
<p>[http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/genpatsujiko/info/proposals.html] provides information (in 
Japanese) on the past and present association of the NRA Chairperson and Commissioners 
with the nuclear industry which was uploaded on the Cabinet Secretariat&#8217;s website on 26 
July 2012 prior to their appointment, taking into account the resolution made in the 
Environment Committee of Japan&#8217;s House of Representatives. In this regard, this draft 
sentence should be corrected to &#8220;Public disclosure of past or present association with the 
nuclear industry was required and made prior to the appointment of its Chairperson and 
Commissioners.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, in this regard, paragraph 80 (b) should be corrected in due course. 
</p>
<p>(c) Make information collected by the Nuclear Regulation Authority, including 
regulations and compliance of nuclear power plant operators with domestic and 
international safety standards and guidelines, publicly available for independent 
monitoring; 
</p>
<p>As &#8220;independent monitoring&#8221; is regarded as monitoring activities by some organizations 
that have nothing to do with the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA), the NRA is not in 
the position to be involved in it. 
</p>
<p>(d) Ensure that TEPCO and other third parties are held accountable for the nuclear 
accident and that their liability to pay compensation or reconstruction efforts is not 
shifted to taxpayers.  
</p>
<p>Based on the Act on Compensation for Nuclear Damage (Act No. 147 of 1961), TEPCO is 
liable for compensation for the damage caused by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power 
plant accident. 
</p>
<p>Payment of compensation has been made by TEPCO funded by the Nuclear Damage 
Compensation Facilitation Corporation (NDCFC), the mutual aid fund consisting of all the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/41/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>nuclear operators, established in accordance with the Nuclear Damage Compensation 
Facilitation Corporation Act (Act No. 94 of 2011). The nuclear operators including TEPCO 
are obliged to pay general contributions to NDCFC every year.  In addition to that, TEPCO, 
which caused the accident, is required to pay an additional contribution to NDCFC. 
</p>
<p>According to the Supplementary Provision of the Nuclear Damage Compensation 
Facilitation Corporation Act, at an early date after the enforcement of the Act, on the basis 
of verification of the causes of the accident, the progress on compensation for nuclear 
damage pertaining to the accident, and economic and financial situations, etc., the 
government shall review the status of enforcement of the Act including the burden upon the 
nuclear operator which caused the accident (TEPCO), the government and other nuclear 
operators, and the burden on shareholders and any other relevant persons of said nuclear 
operator (TEPCO), etc., from the viewpoint of minimizing the burden on citizens, and shall 
take necessary measures based on the result of this review. 
</p>
<p>Under the Basic Act on Reconstruction, the Japanese government addresses various 
measures to achieve reconstruction and revitalization from the Great East Japan Earthquake 
as soon as possible, which is the top priority of the Japanese government. Japan continues 
to accelerate our reconstruction measures together with the private sector. 
</p>
<p>(Notes) Japan believes that it is the responsibility of the government to address 
reconstruction measures.  The government&#8217;s reconstruction efforts should be discussed 
separately from TEPCO&#8217;s responsibility and compensation. Therefore, to mention 
&#8220;reconstruction efforts&#8221; in this paragraph is inappropriate.  
</p>
<p>81. In relation to compensation and relief, the Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to implement the following recommendations: 
</p>
<p>(a) Formulate, with the participation of the affected communities, the implementing 
framework under the Victims Support Law; 
</p>
<p>The Government of Japan is currently studying it. In the process, we are listening to the 
views of victims. 
</p>
<p>(b) Include cost of reconstruction and restoration of lives within the relief package; 
</p>
<p>The Government of Japan has taken and will continue to take necessary measures for 
alleviating the burden on the victims. 
</p>
<p>(c) Provide free health check-ups and treatment that may be required for health 
effects from the nuclear accident and radiation exposure; 
</p>
<p>Already completed. The Government of Japan made a financial contribution (JPY 78.2 
billion) for the Fukushima Health Management Survey in order to ensure mid- to long-
range health-care for the residents of Fukushima Prefecture, especially for the residents 
who lived in the evacuation zone.  
</p>
<p>The Fukushima Health Management Survey consists of a basic survey (estimation of 
external radiation dose) covering the population of Fukushima (2 million people) and four 
detailed surveys: a thyroid ultrasound examination (residents between 0 and 18 years), a 
comprehensive health check (residents of all ages living in the evacuation zones), a mental 
health and lifestyle survey (residents of all ages living in the evacuation zones) and a 
pregnancy and birth survey (of around 16 000 women who received maternal and child 
health care in Fukushima Prefecture). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/41/Add.5 
</b></p>
<p><b>12 
</b></p>
<p>The Government will continue to manage the health of the residents appropriately, and thus 
the health survey will provide free health examinations to the subjects. 
</p>
<p>(d)  Ensure that compensation claims by affected persons against TEPCO are settled 
without further delay; 
</p>
<p>MEXT established the Dispute Reconciliation Committee for Nuclear Damage 
Compensation on April 11, 2011, in accordance with the Atomic Energy Damage 
Compensation Law. The Reconciliation Committee formulated guidelines specifying types 
and the scope of damage for which compensation should be provided immediately and 
uniformly when the categorization of such damages is possible. It also mediates settlements 
of disputes regarding compensation. 
</p>
<p>In developing the principles of compensation for properties, METI (Ministry of Economic, 
Trade and Industry) which holds jurisdiction over TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power 
Company) reflected the opinion of local communities in it and took measures necessary to 
accomplish compensation without delay. 
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to ensure effective community 
participation, especially participation of vulnerable groups, in all aspects of the 
decision-making processes related to nuclear energy policy and the nuclear regulatory 
framework, including decisions regarding nuclear power plant operations, evacuation 
zones, radiation limits, health monitoring and compensation amounts.  
</p>
<p>The members of the Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy, which is 
organized by METI, are now discussing energy and nuclear policy aiming at deciding the 
new Basic Energy Policy Plan. One of the governors from an area with nuclear power 
plants is included among the members of the committee. Moreover, the new plan will be 
decided through a public comment system. In addition, anyone can submit their opinions to 
the committee for the discussion through the website at any time. 
</p>
<p>With regard to restarting reactor, having assured the safety of so doing, our government 
will try to obtain the understanding of local governments with nuclear power plants and 
their cooperation. 
</p>
<p>From the standpoint of transparency in nuclear regulation, the Nuclear Regulation 
Authority has been making available opportunities to listen to stakeholders by soliciting 
public comments and other means in development of new regulatory requirements and their 
regulations.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/41/Add.5

<p><b>  Other additional comments 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Regarding paragraph 39:  
</i></p>
<p>MEXT has entrusted the Fukushima Prefectural Board of Education to provide lectures and 
practical advice by physicians and sports trainers in order to remedy problems affecting 
children from both a lack of exercise and psychological stress as their going outside and 
activities outdoors are being constrained due to concerns about radioactivity. 
</p>
<p><i>  Regarding paragraph 53: 
</i></p>
<p>&#8220;The long-term goal is to reduce radiation levels below 1mSv/year.&#8221; should be amended to 
&#8220;The long-term goal is to reduce the additional exposure dose below 1mSv/year.&#8221; for 
clarification of the meaning of 1 mSv/year. 
</p>
<p><i>  Regarding paragraph 54: 
</i></p>
<p>As for the sentence &#8220;It is regrettable that there are neither specific measures nor a timeline 
for decontamination beyond 2013 and to levels less than 1mSv/year.&#8221;, the policy after 
FY2013 will be formulated based on the results of the decontamination work in the first 
two years. 
</p>
<p><i>  Regarding paragraph 55: 
</i></p>
<p>Children-related facilities such as schools are decontaminated on a priority basis, and, if 
needed, surrounding areas are to be decontaminated later according to the plan. Thus, the 
expression of &#8220;isolated&#8221; is not the case, and the sentence &#8220;decontamination of school &#8230;hot 
spots&#8221; is not necessary. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is confirmed that preceding decontamination of schools and playgrounds 
has sufficiently achieved a certain level. 
</p>
<p><i>  Regarding paragraph 56: 
</i></p>
<p>Decontamination work is undertaken by the contractors of the national government or 
municipalities. However, if volunteers exceptionally conduct some decontamination work, 
the venue is limited to an area with a relatively low dose, and relevant measures are to be 
taken such as the provision of information regarding radiation protection.  
</p>
<p><i>  Regarding paragraph 57: 
</i></p>
<p>When removal soil, etc. is stored, measures to prevent from human health impact are taken 
such as radiation shielding. 
</p>
<p><i>  Regarding paragraph 58: 
</i></p>
<p>Basic principles (roadmap) on interim storage sites, etc. were already published in October 
</p><p>2011. 
</p>
<p>In addition, when removal soil, etc. is stored, measures to prevent the human health impact 
are taken such as radiation shielding. Therefore, a description such as &#8220;posing a health 
</p>
<p>hazard to residents&#8221; is not the case.

<p>1. General remarks   &lt;Comment&gt; 
</p>
<p>- Overall, we consider that the Rapporteur&#8217;s understanding of 1 mSv/year 
contains some inaccuracy. Therefore, we would like to clarify them in 
this document. For instance, this report sometimes uses the description &#8220;1 
mSv/y&#8221;, which is not correct. Please revise these descriptions to 
</p>
<p>&#8220;additional 1 mSv/y in effective dose&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>- We request UNHRC to hear the opinions of other UN agencies such as 
UNSCEAR, IAEA, and WHO, etc.  
</p>
<p>- WHO has already released reports on dose estimation and evaluated 
health risks for residents and workers. UNSCEAR is now working on 
evaluating nuclear contamination and exposure among people. WHO 
estimated doses and health risks conservatively to prevent 
underestimation, and they concluded that &#8220;[t]he present results suggest that 
the increases in the incidence of human disease attributable to the 
additional radiation exposure from the Fukushima Daiichi NPP accident 
are likely to remain below detectable levels.&#8221; (1) WHO also concluded that 
</p>
<p>outside of Fukushima prefecture &#8220;no increase in cancer risk above 
variation in background rates is anticipated in the less affected areas of 
Fukushima Prefecture, neighboring prefectures and the rest of Japan, or 
countries other than Japan.&#8221; (2) A summary of the UNSCEAR reports will 
be issued to the General Assembly in October 2013.  
</p>
<p>- In addition, we accept the concept of health management as shown in the 
WHO&#8217;s report (3) and we shall carry out examination that is necessary in a 
</p>
<p>scientific manner. Conducting a survey that is not based on scientific 
evidence is unacceptable because unnecessary examination will lead to an 
unnecessary burden on residents. 
</p>
<p>- We cannot avoid pointing out that the report lacks sufficient scientific 
examination. This report makes almost no reference about the actual 
situation of the exposure of the Fukushima incident, which has already 
been shown by public organizations and authorities such as the WHO </p>

radiation dose for children. The state of health of the children was 
examined at the same time. 
</p>
<p>- The purpose of the basic survey was to collect data required for the 
estimation of external exposure dose. Since medical information is highly 
protected as personal information, diagnostic data and medical treatment 
records cannot be collected. Moreover, the collection of information for 
unspecified purposes is found to be ethically problematic. Furthermore, 
any greater complexity of questionnaires could have resulted in a serious 
drop in the collection ratio. Therefore, we used a limited number of 
questions to collect the information we needed for specific purposes.

We request that the report conform with the view of other UN 
organizations such as UNSCEAR, WHO, and IAEA.

they do not need to be followed up within a short interval medically. The 
Ministry of the Environment examined the ratio of the categories A, B, 
and C in the thyroid examination, which is the same quality as that of the 
Fukushima Health Monitoring Survey (FHMS). The preliminary 
examination showed that the ratio of each category is similar with that of 
the FHMS. </p>

</p>
<p>- A document, asked to explain the medical evaluation of small nodules 
and cysts categorized as A2 in the health management survey to the 
subjects, was shared among the members of the Japan Thyroid 
Association. But some people misunderstood that the document asked the 
members not to provide a second opinion.  
</p>
<p>- A second opinion is not prohibited for the thyroid examination as well as 
other medical services. There is no regulation for examination in a clinic 
or being examined for a thyroid condition, either, when it is medically 
required.

</p>
<p>- After the nuclear accident, concentrations of radioactive isotopes in food 
were measured and internal exposures were estimated by whole body 
counting (WBC). Results of these observations showed that internal 
exposure is very limited. Internal exposure was estimated in 81, 000 
residents by WBC between June 2011 and September 2012; the reported 
committed effective doses were below 1 mSv in 99.9% of the persons 
surveyed, and the maximum dose was 3 mSv (4).

</p>
<p>29.  33 P11 The comprehensive (...) 
exposure. 
</p>
<p>&lt;Point of fact&gt; 
</p>
<p>- Recently, internal exposure of the residents in Fukushima prefecture is 
less than the detection limit of (...)200 Bq/body for cesium estimated by 
WBC for most of the people because foods are measured and controlled 
well (this level is much smaller relative to the natural background of 
(...)7000 Bq/body for adults). This result indicated that internal exposure 
in Fukushima prefecture is less than that of residents living in such 
countries as France and Germany. 
</p>
<p>30.  33 P11 the survey does not include urine 
tests for people under the age of 
16 years. 
</p>
<p>&lt;Comment&gt; 
</p>
<p>- It is important to evaluate the level of the concentration of radioactive 
isotopes rather than the fact that radioactive isotopes are detected in the 
urine of people. The level of the concentrations of radioactive isotopes in 
urine is under the level where the influence of radiation exposure on health 
can be detected.  
</p>
<p>- Internal dose is estimated for residents, preferentially children and 
pregnant women in Fukushima prefecture by WBC. It is obvious that 
estimating internal dose by WBC has more benefits and is more reliable 
than that of urine measurement. Urine testing requires the task of 
collecting urine samples for a whole day because the concentration varies 
over a day. It is not realistic to force residents (especially children and 
pregnant women) to collect urine samples for a whole day. We compared 
the results of internal exposure between WBC and urine tests at the 
beginning of the Fukushima Health Management Survey as a sampling 
test. We concluded that WBC is better than a urine test for measuring 
many residents.

</p>
<p>- Concentration of strontium-90 is also monitored in food and water. The 
level of Sr-90 concentration is controlled in food and water. Thus it is not 
necessary to measure concentration of Sr-90 by urine tests. In the 
Fukushima incident, contamination of Sr-90 was much smaller relative to 
radioactive cesium. The concentration of Sr-90 was between 1/19,000 and </p>

</p>
<p>- In the Fukushima incident, contamination of Sr-90 was much smaller 
relative to radioactive cesium. The concentration of Sr-90 was between 
1/19,000 and 1/600 of that of radioactive cesium in the monthly fallout 
measurement conducted by MEXT. It is not realistic to measure beta 
radiation emitted by Sr-90 by WBC. 
</p>
<p>35.  39 P12-13 He calls on the Government to 
make quality mental health 
facilities, goods and services 
available and accessible to 
residents of Fukushima, evacuees 
and their families, with a focus 
on vulnerable groups such as first 
responders and children. 
</p>
<p>&lt;Point of fact&gt; 
</p>
<p>- Mental health survey includes a program to provide medical service by a 
doctor in a mental health facility when doctors decide that the responder 
requires mental care. 
</p>
<p>36.  39 P13 The Government should also 
provide and support programmes 
to reduce the stress and anxiety 
for affected communities. 
</p>
<p>&lt;Point of fact&gt; 
</p>
<p>- The health management survey supports programmes of mental care for 
residents in the evacuated zone. (There are phone services through which 
people can make inquires related to health and radiation concerns.) 
</p>
<p>- The government has already provided and supported programmes to 
reduce the stress and anxiety for affected communities.

evaluation zone&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>38.  40 P13 Further, the response rate was 
less than 50 per cent. Additional 
efforts are required to ensure that 
all people participate in the 
survey. 
</p>
<p>&lt;Point of fact&gt; 
</p>
<p>- The mental health survey should focus on the support and care for 
persons who are listed as candidates for medical support. Now we provide 
face-to-face communication by visiting people who require support. It is 
not reasonable to make further efforts to increase the response rate of the 
health management survey. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>39.  40 P13 Moreover, the survey asks 
respondents about their 
experience during the earthquake 
but not during the nuclear 
accident. This should be 
changed, since respondents&#8217; 
</p>
<p>concerns regarding radiation 
exposure and evacuation may not 
get captured otherwise. 
</p>
<p>&lt;Point of fact&gt; 
</p>
<p>- The surveys of 2011 and 2012 ask questions about the earthquake, 
tsunami, and nuclear accidents. 
</p>
<p>40.  40 P13 It is also important to record past 
experiences with radiation 
accidents because this may 
heighten the impact of the 
accident on mental health. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&lt;Point of fact&gt; 
</p>
<p>- The health survey examines the level of health conditions such as stress 
and anxiety; therefore it can identify persons who have high stress and 
anxiety. It is not clear to which radiation accidents you are referring.

</p>
<p>&lt;Point of fact&gt;

<p>- It is necessary to evaluate the level of dose for residents in Fukushima 
prefecture when planning appropriate health management. Diseases such 
as mental disability and in &#8211;utero leukaemia are reported as a response to 
much higher doses than those to which the residents were exposed as a 
result of the Fukushima incident. </p>

</p>
<p>&lt;Point of fact&gt; 
</p>
<p>- Under the ICRP recommendation for cases of taking radiation 
protection, in the existing exposure situation, protection strategies carried 
out to reduce individual exposure should achieve sufficient individual or 
societal benefit to offset the detriment that is caused. However, 
justification of protection strategies goes far beyond the scope of 
radiological protection as they may also have various economic, political 
value of reducing exposure and limiting inequity in the exposure received 
by those living in the contaminated areas needs to be included when 
justification of protection strategies is being carried out. Therefore, 
optimisation involves keeping exposures as low as reasonably achievable, 
taking into account economic and societal factors as well as the 
distribution of dose and benefits resulting from the implementation of the 
protection strategies.

<p> 
</p>
<p>&lt;Point of fact&gt; 
</p>
<p>- From our strategy based on data from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it is 
believed the effects on health from radiation exposure are less significant 
than the effects from other causes or non-existent as long as the exposure 
is at the level of 100 mSv or less. Regarding the decision making about 
radiation protection, it is to keep exposures as low as reasonably 
achievable and use the LNT-model for estimating the effect on health. It is 
in the point of view to compensate for the scientificy uncertainty about the 
effect on health from radiation exposure.

<p>- The content of reference 94 is not consistent with the content of the

</p>
<p>- It is common among scientists that the increase of excess relative risk 
(ERR) of cancers can be observed at the radiation exposure of 100 mSv in 
epidemiological studies. Under the level of exposure, it is likely to be 
difficult to detect the increase of ERR in epidemiological studies because 
the degree of the increase is very small relative to the variation of the 
background risk. Recently, analysis of the  ERR of cancers under low 
radiation exposure is a hot topic of research on radiation health effects, 
among which the research of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors in the 
Life Span Study (LSS) is one of the cases of instant exposure. On the other 
hand, health effects are not detected among residents in high background 
areas such as Kerala in India even if the residents are exposed to over 
(...)500 mSv as an accumulated dose for decades (1). It is believed that the 
factor of dose-rate is also important as well as the amount of dose. The 
French Academy of Sciences (<i>French</i>: Acad&#233;mie des sciences) released a 
comment that it is questioning that there exists a linear no-threshold 
relationship (LNT) under a few dozen mSv (2).

<p>&lt;Point of fact&gt; 
</p>
<p>- Residents in Japan receive radiation of (...)2.1 mSv/year from the natural 
environment. An additional 1 mSy/year is a long-term target, under which 
efforts for reducing radiation exposure are not necessary, but not a border, 
above which radiation health effects may be expected. Please refer to the 
idea in ICRP 103 and 111. The Japanese government accepts 1 mSv as a 
target, which is the minimum of the standard of radiation protection in the 
recovery phase after radioactive contamination (ICRP recommends 1-20 
mSv/year).

understanding, it is strongly suggested to add the following sentences after 
the current last sentence: 
</p>
<p>- For the purpose of monitoring the air dose, more than 3,200 units of

using airplanes and vehicles have been implemented, and the information 
on the air dose rate has been provided to the residents in Fukushima

<p>51.  51 P15-16 &#8220;text book&#8221; &lt;Comment&gt; 
</p>
<p>In regard to Paragraph 51, we believe that the textbook indicated in the 
report refers to a supplementary reader and that this supplementary reader 
does not provide erroneous information about radiation. 
</p>
<p>Since, based on internationally accepted understanding, the effect of 
radiation exposure of 100mSV or less is small enough so that it may be 
hidden by the carcinogenic effects of other factors, the supplementary 
reader explains the fact that it is difficult to scientifically verify whether 
there is a clear increase in the risk of contracting cancer from radiation. 
However, at the same time, it is believed that radiation is one cause of 
cancer, and accordingly, the supplementary reader explains that reducing 
the amount of exposure to radiation as much as possible is important.

</p>
<p>The website of Prime Minister&#8217;s Cabinet Secretariat <b> 
</b></p>
<p>[http://www.cas.go.jp/jp/genpatsujiko/info/proposals.html ]leads to 
information (in Japanese) on the past and present association of the NRA 
Chairperson and Commissioners with the nuclear industry which was 
uploaded on the Cabinet Secretariat&#8217;s website on 26 July 2012 prior to 
their appointment, taking into account the resolution made at the 
Environment Committee of Representatives House. In this regard, this 
draft sentence should be corrected to &#8220;Public disclosure of past or present 
association with the nuclear industry was required and made prior to the 
appointment of its Chairperson and Commissioners.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>And furthermore in this regard, paragraph 80 (b) on page 22 should be 
corrected in due course. &#8220;Nuclear Regulatory Authority&#8221; should be </p>

<p>However, the Government&#8217;s <b>The Nuclear Damage Compensation

<p><b>Facilitation Corporation (NDCFC)</b> acqui<b>red</b>sition of TEPCO&#8217;s majority 
stakes in Ju<b>ly</b>ne 2012 has arguably helped TEPCO to effectively avoid 
accountability and liability for damages. Payment of compensation is 
made from government funds <b>by TEPCO</b> funded by taxpayers. The 
Special Rapporteur was informed that TEPCO would have to repay the 
Government eventually. Nevertheless, under the current arrangement, the 
taxpayers may have to continue bearing the liability of the nuclear damage, 
for which TEPCO should solely be liable. <b>NDCFC, the mutual aid fund 
consisting of all the nuclear operators. The nuclear operators

<p>After the nuclear accident, TEPCO provided USD 137 million <b>120 billion

estimated by <b>the</b> TEPCO <b>Management and Finance Investigation 
Committee</b> were around USD 38 billion <b>4500 billion yen at that time</b>.

<p>&lt;Comment&gt; 
</p>
<p>- This recommendation is based on a misunderstanding of facts. We have 
already examined the scientific validity of other methods. Even though the 
equipment servicing would be time-consuming, based on this examination 
process, we have chosen WBC as the most accurate method for the 
determination of internal exposure dose. Anyone who insists on the need 
for another type of examination method should justify such need with 
medically reasonable arguments. Moreover, we have conducted a 
sampling survey on the internal exposure of citizens outside the prefecture 
and verified that the internal exposure incurred to them was not of a level 
that would have effects on health. It should also be noted that the WHO 
has expressed a negative viewpoint concerning the possibility of effects on 
health. Anyone who insists on the need of repeating a survey on internal 
exposure should justify the need with scientific arguments.

counters and provide it to all affected population, including residents,
