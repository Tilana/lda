<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, at the invitation of the Government, visited 
Ukraine on an official mission from 22 October to 5 November 2008. In Kyiv, Donetsk, 
Simferopol, Sevastopol, Lviv, Uzhhorod, Mukachevo and Chop, the delegation met with 
Government authorities, representatives of civil society, relatives of detainees, members of 
domestic monitoring mechanisms and representatives of international and regional organizations. 
It conducted individual interviews in confidence with 138 detainees and approximately 
100 collective interviews in the 21 facilities visited, where people are deprived of their liberty. 
</p>
<p> The present report provides a brief overview of the institutional and legal framework 
relating to the deprivation of liberty and describes the situation in Ukraine with regard to 
criminal detention, including detention under State security and military powers and pending 
extradition, as well as deprivation of liberty for administrative offences, detention of vagrants, 
immigration detention, the juvenile justice system and deprivation of liberty on the grounds of 
mental health. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group highlights the cooperation given by the Government and the various 
reforms implemented since the country&#8217;s independence in 1991 with respect to the 
administration of justice system. It also commends the existence of several monitoring 
mechanisms, such as the Ombudsperson, mobile monitoring clinics and public councils, as a 
means of combating arbitrary detention, although further strengthening of these mechanisms is 
required. The Working Group deems the confinement of military jurisdiction, which largely 
follows civilian criminal and criminal procedure rules, exclusively to conscripts, a good practice. 
It encourages the Government to adopt swiftly a separate juvenile justice system. The Working 
Group also found the regime applied to persons deprived of their liberty on grounds of their 
mental health to be professionally implemented by caring personnel. 
</p>
<p> One main issue of concern relates to the numerous, consistent and often credible 
allegations received from various sources, including victims, some of whom minors, of 
confessions obtained under torture from detainees of the <i>Militsia</i>, the Ukrainian police force. 
Powers of taking persons into custody vested with the <i>Militsia</i> under the laws on administrative 
offences and on vagrants are at times abused to extract confessions under duress. 
</p>
<p> An assessment of statistical data and other information received further revealed that 
allegations of torture are neither properly addressed by the Office of the Prosecutor General 
during the investigation and prosecution proceedings nor generally excluded as evidence in 
trials. The fact that, in 2008, until the visit of the Working Group, the Prosecutor General&#8217;s 
Office considered 30 procedural violations during criminal procedures to be well-founded from a 
total number of 100,000 complaints, including allegations of torture, speaks volumes, as does the 
rate of acquittals, which remains stable at less than 1 per cent. The Working Group considers that 
impunity for perpetrators of ill-treatment largely prevails. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group identifies as one root cause of arbitrary detention in Ukraine the 
accumulation of powers within the Office of the Prosecutor General, who has both criminal 
prosecution and oversight powers, answers extradition requests and can at the same time 
challenge in court the refugee status of the person for whom extradition is sought. Another root </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p>cause is the perceived lack of an independent judiciary and an ineffective system of criminal 
defence and legal aid. The overall situation is aggravated by rampant corruption throughout the 
law enforcement system. 
</p>
<p> With regard to deprivation of liberty in general, the Working Group is concerned about the 
high number of arrests carried out in the country, many of them not registered, which some 
sources estimate at approximately 1 million each year. It also perceives that the recourse to 
pre-trial detention and restrictions applied during detention on remand is too frequent with courts 
not exercising genuine control when authorizing pre-trial detention. 
</p>
<p> On the basis of its findings, the Working Group addresses 24 recommendations to the 
Government of Ukraine concerning, inter alia, allegations of torture to extract confessions; the 
various law enforcement institutions governing deprivation of liberty; pre-trial detention and 
legal aid; imprisonment, administrative offences and immigration detention; detention pending 
extradition; and juvenile justice and monitoring mechanisms. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, established pursuant to Commission on 
Human Rights resolution 1991/42, whose mandate was clarified and extended by Commission 
resolution 1997/50, and extended for a further three-year period by Human Rights Council 
resolution 6/4 of 28 September 2007, at the invitation of the Government conducted a country 
mission to Ukraine from 22 October to 5 November 2008. The delegation was comprised of 
Mr. El Hadji Malick Sow, Vice-Chair of the Working Group, and Ms. Shaheen Sardar Ali, 
member of the Working Group, the Head of the Civil and Political Rights Unit of OHCHR&#8217;s 
Special Procedures Division and another officer of the same Unit, and was supported by 
interpreters. 
</p>
<p>2. In June 2006, the Government of Ukraine extended a standing invitation to all 
United Nations special procedures mandates and promptly agreed to receive the Working Group 
on official mission when it requested an invitation. It would like to thank the Government to 
having swiftly agreed on new dates for the visit, after it had been postponed at the Government&#8217;s 
request due to difficulties of an organisational character. 
</p>
<p>3. During the entire visit and in all respects, the Working Group enjoyed the fullest 
cooperation of the Government and of all authorities it dealt with, and expresses its gratitude for 
their transparency and collaboration. The representatives of the authorities met were willing to 
discuss openly all matters raised by the Working Group, were interested in its preliminary 
observations and strived to provide the delegation with all information, and to arrange meetings 
with all Government authorities, requested. The delegation was able to visit all detention 
facilities and interview in confidence all detainees requested. 
</p>
<p>4. It would also like to thank the representatives of civil society it met, as well as 
representatives of international organisations, including the United Nations Development 
Programme in Kyiv for its support of the mission. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  PROGRAMME OF THE VISIT 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Working Group travelled to Kyiv, Donetsk, Simferopol, Sevastopol, Lviv, Uzhhorod, 
Mukachevo and Chop. 
</p>
<p>6. It visited 21 detention facilities, including prisons with remand detainees and convicts 
(CIZOs), temporary holding facilities of the Ministry of the Interior (ITTs), police stations, 
immigration detention centres, a State Security Service (SBU) holding facility, a centre for the 
reception and distribution of minors, two military detention facilities, and a psychiatric hospital 
(see appendix I). Three unannounced visits to two police stations and to an ITT also formed part 
of the programme. Due to flight cancellations and time constraints, the Working Group was 
unable to visit the CIZO in Donetsk and a detention centre for the reception and distribution of 
vagrants, on which it was, however, able to gather information from State officials and civil 
society. The Working Group was also seized of a number of cases within the Donetsk CIZO 
which were raised with the relevant authorities. A complete list of the establishments visited is 
annexed to this report. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>7. The Working Group interviewed in private 138 detainees in the respective detention 
facilities. It also conducted approximately 100 collective interviews at the different immigration 
detention facilities under the authority of the State Border Guard Service (SBGS). 
</p>
<p>8. At CIZO #13 in Kyiv, the first detention facility to visit, the focal point of the State 
Department for the Execution of Sentences who accompanied the Working Group during its 
mission to provide technical support, facilitated a common understanding of the Working 
Group&#8217;s right to speak to all detainees, pre-trial and convicted. The Working Group appreciates 
this support but would like to reiterate the importance that it have unfettered and unsupervised 
access to all detainees immediately. The Working Group notes that such access through the 
mission was a good practice and calls on other countries to which it would visit in the future to 
follow such a practice. Concerning the actual interviews the Working Group would like to 
request the Government to reconsider caging detainees during the interviews. The Working 
Group&#8217;s members were informed that security regulations require such precautions. 
</p>
<p>9. At CIZO #13 the Working Group interviewed a woman who appeared to have mental 
health difficulties. The Working Group was presented with a co-inmate who was proposed by the 
authorities to provide information concerning this particular individual. The Working Group 
would like to reiterate that it is important for it to have the sole right of selection of those persons 
detained with whom it would like to speak. 
</p>
<p>10. At the CIZO in Uzhhorod, which also housed an ITT facility, despite queries about the 
facilities which existed in the compound, the Working Group was surprised to learn from a 
credible source that this CIZO allegedly contains a secret detention wing run by the SBU. The 
Working Group stresses that the use of secret detention sites without any legal control is in total 
disregard of human rights. Such sites increase the risk of torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment for the detainee, especially when under interrogation. The Working Group 
would like to be fully informed about this possible facility by the Government and if it does exist 
why the authorities in Uzhhorod withheld this important information from the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>11. The Working Group noted the positive and constructive environment for detainees in the 
ITT in Podil whereby the management ensured that detainees were made aware of their rights 
and that the internal rules of conduct were also well known through their posting in the cells. 
</p>
<p>12. During its mission the Working Group held meetings with the following Government 
authorities: two Deputy-Ministers of Justice, representatives of the Ministry of Justice, including 
of its regional department in Donetsk and its Chief Department in Sevastopol; of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs; of the Ministry of the Interior, including of its regional department in Donetsk 
and of the Chief Department in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea; of the Ministry of Defence; 
of the Ministry for Health Protection; of the Ministry of Family, Youth and Sports; of the 
Ministry of Education and Science; of the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office, including civilian and 
military prosecutors; of the State Department for the Execution of Sentences; of the State 
Security Service, including its Deputy Head and Head of the Investigation Department in Kyiv; 
of the State Border Guard Service, including of its regional departments in Donetsk; Justices 
from Criminal Chambers of the Supreme Court; the Deputy Head of the Constitutional Court; all 
criminal judges from the Court of Appeal in Sevastopol and the Deputy Head of the Criminal 
Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Lviv; the Head of the Bilotserkva Municipal District Court; 
representatives of the State Court Administration of Ukraine; of the High Council of Justice; the </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>Parliament&#8217;s Commissioner for Human Rights (Ombudsperson); and the First Lady. It also met 
with Human Rights Advisers to the Ministry of the Interior. The Working Group was unable, due 
to internal challenges in Ukraine, to meet with members of the Parliamentary Committee on 
Human Rights, National Minorities and International Relations. 
</p>
<p>13. The Working Group further conducted meetings with representatives of civil society in 
Kyiv and the regions, including human rights and defence lawyers and members of mobile 
monitoring clinics; members of the Ukrainian Lawyers&#8217; Association; members of Public 
Councils; relatives of detainees; religious leaders of different faiths working in prisons in 
Ukraine; and representatives of international and regional organisations. 
</p>
<p>14. The mission concluded with a de-briefing with the Ukrainian Government on the initial 
findings of the Working Group and a press conference. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  OVERVIEW OF INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Political system 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Republic of Ukraine became independent on 25 December 1991. The Constitution, 
adopted in 1996 and significantly amended in 2004, provides for a semi-presidential system. The 
executive is comprised of the President, who is the Head of State and elected by popular vote; 
the Prime Minister, who is the Head of Government and appointed by the 450 seat unicameral 
Parliament (<i>Verkhovna Rada</i>); and the Council of Ministers (cabinet). 
</p>
<p>16. Ukraine is divided into 24 <i>oblasts</i> (regions) and further sub-divided into 494 <i>raions 
</i>(districts). Kyiv and Sevastopol have a special legal status and the Autonomous Republic of 
Crimea enjoys an autonomous status within Ukraine. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  International human rights obligations 
</b></p>
<p>17. Ukraine is a party to the majority of international human rights treaties and, in particular, 
to the two principal United Nations human rights covenants and four conventions and related 
Optional Protocols (see appendix II). 
</p>
<p>18. It is important that all those dealing with detention are aware of international and regional 
human rights standards which exist for the promotion of the rights persons in relation to 
detention and their supremacy over any ordinary national legislation. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Constitutional guarantees 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Constitution affords several basic rights. According to its article 29, every person has 
the right to liberty and personal inviolability. Articles 28, 40, 55, 56, 59, 61, 62 and 63 contain 
other basic rights pertaining to the mandate of the Working Group (see appendix III). 
</p>
<p>20. Awareness should be raised of the detainees&#8217; right as entrenched in the Constitution to 
resort to proper international and regional human rights mechanisms for submission of 
complaints. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  FINDINGS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Criminal and criminal procedure detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  The Militsia and Militsia investigators 
</b></p>
<p>21. According to the Law on Militsia, Ukraine&#8217;s single national police force is directly 
subordinate to the Minister of the Interior. The Militsia consist of several subdivisions. The Law 
of Ukraine on Combating Organised Crime created special divisions, such as regional agencies 
to combat organised crime. 
</p>
<p>22. Under the Law on Militsia, it is entitled, on its own authority, to arrest a person suspected 
of a criminal offence and to hold that person for up to three hours for the purpose of 
identification. Militsia investigators may keep that person in custody for up to 72 hours at a 
police station during which a pre-trial investigation may be carried out. Within these 72 hours of 
detention, the investigating bodies must, if they wish to remand in custody, bring the suspect 
before a judge. A judge may order such custody for up to 10 days, and thereafter grant 
extensions for a maximum total period of 18 months. 
</p>
<p>23. A person remanded in custody is in principle transferred to a CIZO for &#8220;investigation 
isolation&#8221;. The person may nevertheless be detained at an ITT for a maximum period of 10 days 
if the transfer to the CIZO cannot be affected owing to the distance or the absence of appropriate 
means of communication. 
</p>
<p>24. The Working Group was informed by the Ombudsperson that each year about 1 million 
arrests are carried out in Ukraine, which is an unacceptably high number in a country with a 
population of approximately 46 million. It also received information from reliable sources that 
often persons are arrested and held by the Militsia for a short period of time without the arrests 
being registered, and at times release secured only by bribes. 
</p>
<p>25. The Working Group also noted during its mission that Militsia officials often use the 
entire 72 hours prior to producing a criminal suspect before a judge. The Working Group wishes 
to recall that the 72 hours rule should be construed as providing for a maximum period on a 
needs basis. If the suspect is not brought promptly before a judge, the legal framework and 
practice is inconsistent with the requirements of article 9, paragraph 3, clause 1, of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Working Group is also concerned 
about information received from detainees about instances where the 72 hours rule was not 
observed. 
</p>
<p>26. The Working Group wishes to highlight the repetitive and often convincing reports of 
torture and other forms of ill-treatment by the Militsia throughout the country to extract 
confessions. The Working Group has received numerous reports about such practices from 
victims, whom they could interview in detention facilities and who sometimes showed signs of 
ill-treatment, from civil society representatives, and from other sources. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>27. These sources have also pointed at aggravating situations in which suspects are rejected by 
ITT personnel following a medical examination upon admission (which is not always carried 
out), that established signs of torture and ill-treatment, and sent back to the perpetrators. Victims 
do not report ill-treatments for fear of reprisals which consequently results in a high level of 
impunity. 
</p>
<p>28. The Working Group considers these reports credible as no Government authority from any 
tier or level met with denied the existence of this problem. Different Government authorities, 
however, varied regarding the extent of cases in which the Militsia resorts to torture and 
ill-treatment to extract confessions, the manner in which the problem is addressed at various 
levels and spheres of Government, and how it is redressed, notably during the continuation of the 
criminal investigation and the trial stage (see <i>infra</i>). According to two surveys conducted by a 
non-governmental organisation, in 2000, 78% of confessions were coerced ones according to 
those detainees asked, and in 2006 the rate was 81%. 
</p>
<p>29. The issue of the use of torture to extract confessions falls directly within the mandate of the 
Working Group as such practices make such confessions inadmissible and therefore the 
detention of such a person arbitrary. 
</p>
<p>30. There is no excuse to permit torture. Such practice is explicitly prohibited under 
international human rights and constitutional law and its prohibition is absolute and 
non-derogable. Any use of torture in extracting confessions should immediately lead to dismissal 
of any deposition and at any time should lead to criminal action against the perpetrator(s). With 
respect to law enforcement officials who denounce their supervisors, in relation to torture or 
other abuses of law by their superiors, they should not be penalised including through prolonged 
periods of detention. Any abuse in this regard should be properly investigated and those 
responsible should be held accountable. Similarly, training curricula of the Ministry of Interior 
officials, including the Militsia, should explicitly provide against such practices noting that there 
will be zero-tolerance. The manual on prevention of torture, compiled by the Ministry of the 
Interior, the Ombudsperson and human rights organisation with the support of the Danish 
Government, which was distributed to all Government educational institutions in 2003, is a 
welcomed initiative, but the Working Group considers that further progress needs to be made. 
</p>
<p>31. The investigator in any case under review also has important responsibilities and must first 
ensure that the person detained is fully aware of his/her rights and is able to realise them, which 
is often not the case according to consistent allegations from interviewed detainees and lawyers 
the Working Group met with. There should be a presumption of innocence until proven guilty 
and not the inverse. Where there are allegations or evidence of torture this should be noted and 
included in the case file of the alleged perpetrator. The investigator has a responsibility to bring 
this to the attention of the Prosecutor General, who should follow up with an immediate yet 
thorough investigation given the gravity of the allegation, and any presiding judge, especially 
since the Militsia investigators do not enjoy oversight powers over the Militsia. 
</p><p>32. The Working Group was informed that quotas in relation to the need to make a certain 
number of arrests in a given period may exist within the Militsia departments under the Ministry 
of Interior. If this is true this could lead to a use of force by officials to ensure confessions of a 
criminal nature. The Working Group requests confirmation from the Government that such a 
system of indicators does not exist. If it does it should be discontinued. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>33. The Working Group further received information by detainees that Militsia officers, as 
other competent law enforcement officials involved, do not always inform the next-of-kin of the 
detainees about their arrests and detention although required by law. This omission was 
confirmed by the Ombudsperson and must be ceased. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Office of the Prosecutor-Prosecutor General and prosecution 
</b></p>
<p>34. According to Chapter VII of the Constitution (articles 121-123), and legislation, the 
Prosecutor General prosecutes, and exercises oversight related to the observance of domestic 
legislation by law enforcement agencies in the conduct of criminal investigations. The 
prosecutors open and conduct criminal procedures after evaluation of criminal case files received 
from the Militsia, request detention on remand from courts, accuse and indict the defendant and 
represent the State in trial. The Prosecutor General has the power to release a person prior to the 
expiry of the period of pre-trial detention sanctioned by court, but not to overturn a court order 
for release. 
</p>
<p>35. According to officials met in the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office, in 2008 it opened 363,000 
criminal cases. In 100,000 of these cases suspects complained about procedural rights violations, 
but also those of a criminal nature including torture and ill-treatment to extract enforced 
confessions. The Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office noted it found violations in 30 of them. Further, 
in 2008 five law enforcement officials remained in custody on grounds of violations of 
constitutional rights of detainees, two of whom are already convicted. 
</p>
<p>36. The Working Group stresses the key role of the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office in the entire 
detention process. It very much regrets that its various requests to meet with the Prosecutor 
General himself were not entertained as a dialogue with him was therefore not possible. The 
Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office must be the institution which upholds the law in all circumstances. 
Respect for the decisions of the courts is absolute. The individuals representing the institution 
must be impartial, professional and rely on the law. They should not make subjective decisions 
nor be seen as an impediment to the execution of justice. Complaints received on treatment or 
other matters which may lead to arbitrary detention should be followed up by the Prosecutor 
General&#8217;s Office in all instances. 
</p>
<p>37. In matters requiring oversight and ensuring that due process is followed also having an 
enforcement capacity can lead to a potential conflict of interest and reduce confidence in the key 
institution of the Prosecutor General. The Working Group therefore suggests that the 
Government revisit this dual role, which was sustained by other Governmental authorities with 
special criminal investigation powers. Indeed, given the number of arrests highlighted by the 
Ombudsperson and the number of cases noted by the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office the Working 
Group questions the effectiveness of the Office&#8217;s oversight given the very few cases actually 
noted as being in violation. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  The judiciary 
</b>38. The court system in Ukraine, according to the Law on Judicial System of Ukraine, 
comprises courts of general jurisdiction and the Constitutional Court. According to Art. 147 
<i>et seq</i>. of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court is the sole organ of constitutional jurisdiction </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>in Ukraine. The Constitution of Ukraine does not know an individual constitutional complaint 
mechanism, so that the upholding of constitutional rights is vested with courts of general 
jurisdiction. 
39. The three levels of courts in criminal matters are <i>raion</i> courts, <i>oblast</i> Appeals Courts, and 
the Supreme Court as the highest judicial body. 
40. The Working Group noted the perceived lack of effective control by the judiciary over the 
detention process, which often leads to unnecessary and prolonged detention on remand in 
difficult conditions. Although the number of instances of resort to pre-trial detention, also for 
less grave crimes, are reportedly decreasing each year the Working Group noted that it still 
remains at an overall high level, whereby the rate of 21,5% detainees on remand in relation to 
the total prison population as of 1 January 2008<b>1</b> is acceptable. In 2002, courts in 60,708 cases 
authorised that the suspect be remanded in custody. In 2007, the courts sanctioned 38,607 
pre-trial detentions out of 44,000 requests by the prosecution. What struck the Working Group 
was that reportedly only 3,200 court decisions have been appealed against and that only 
532 appeals were granted. This reaffirms the findings of the Working Group regarding the lack 
of an efficient legal aid system, of access to lawyers as noted below, and the effectiveness of the 
oversight function of the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office and judiciary as to the legal necessity of 
pre-trial detention. A Government representative with competences in oversight over the 
judiciary reported of a case where a judge spent six minutes to process a nine page application 
for pre-trial detention and issue a decision granting remand in custody. 
</p>
<p>41. Another pre-occupation of the Working Group regarding prolonged pre-trial detention is 
the fact that the accused whose case is referred back to a court of lower instance for a re-trial 
must by law remain in pre-trial detention. Unlike for the first trial until a final court instance 
there is no maximum time limit established by law for the duration of the re-trial and accordingly 
for the admissible period of pre-trial detention. Such a regime is not conducive to the adherence 
to the realisation of the right to a trial within reasonable time or alternatively to release as 
stipulated by article 9, paragraph 3, clause 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. 
</p>
<p>42. Given the persistent allegations received by the Working Group throughout its mission on 
confessions obtained under torture and the overall failure to redress such violations during the 
criminal investigation and prosecution proceedings, an unnaturally low number of acquittals in 
trials further adds to the perception that the judiciary does not exercise effective control over law 
enforcement authorities. According to an Ukrainian non-governmental organisation, which 
conducts annual surveys in the field of criminal punishment and analyses Government data, the 
rate of acquittals remained stable between 0,26 and 0,78% since 1991. 
</p>
<p>43. Concerning the independence of the judiciary, the Working Group was reported several 
shortcomings: It was alleged that in some cases judges take a loan to be able to purchase a 
judge&#8217;s certificate, which then even needs to be amortised. Presidents of courts are not elected by 
their peers, but appointed, and have the competence to allocate cases to the bench. It was 
</p>
<p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>asserted that judges showing a strong commitment to the rule of law receive too many cases to 
settle and are then faced with disciplinary consequences. Judges are under pressure by law 
enforcement authorities and the general public not to reject applications for detention on remand 
or to order the release of detainees in general. The President of the Supreme Court addressed a 
letter to the President of Ukraine in 2008, raising concerns about the undue influence perceived 
to have been exercised by the executive upon the judiciary. An administrative court, of which a 
judge had nullified the President&#8217;s decision to dissolve Parliament and call for new elections, 
was re-structured and this judge was facing criminal prosecution. The Working Group noted that 
judicial decisions were often taken without the presence and even knowledge of the accused 
person, also due to convoy schedules. 
</p>
<p>44. It is clear that the judiciary itself does not receive the requisite support to ably execute 
justice. This would include that justices are recruited through a process which guarantees their 
independence, integrity and professional qualifications. In addition, training of justices is a 
continual process if one wishes to ensure that national, international and regional human rights 
norms form the foundation for judicial decisions. Consideration also needs to be given to 
empowering judges in certain instances to be able to exercise judicial review where there is 
doubt as to the manner in which, or veracity of, certain cases. For example, the Working Group 
was made aware of instances where continued requests for detention by the Prosecutor General&#8217;s 
Office were made, even though there was strong suspicion of torture having been undertaken to 
ensure a confession. 
</p>
<p>45. The Working Group met with Justices at the Supreme Court, Constitutional Court and 
Appeal Court levels. It also had the opportunity to follow a brief appeal hearing before the 
Appeal Court in Sevastopol, where it observed that the defendant was not present. It regrets that 
it was unable to meet with judges of the first instance - except for a brief thematic discussion 
focussing on juvenile justice with one judge - given their central role in the administration of 
justice and in particular in relation to authorising and extending periods of pre-trial. 
</p><p>46. The Working Group was informed that court hearings on eligibility of a prisoner for early 
release or for easening the detention regime are conducted on prison premises. The same goes, in 
some instances, for trials concerning new crimes committed during the serving of a prison term, 
which are conducted in the presence of the accused, their lawyers, and family members. The 
Working Group was informed that the ratio behind the former is that prisoners hope for a 
positive outcome of the hearing to gain immediate release following the ruling. While the 
Working Group has some sympathy for this underlying purpose in relation to a swift release it 
does not see how minor delays of release, if any, can outbalance the concerns it has regarding the 
lack of transparency in the hearings. Trials for crimes must be open to the general public; this 
important element of a fair trial cannot be guaranteed at all times if the trial is conducted on 
prison premises. 
</p>
<p>47. Apart from this, the law does not provide for judges to visit prisons. 
<b>4.  Legal defence and legal aid 
</b></p>
<p>48. The right to defence is not properly implemented in Ukraine and the legal aid system is 
ineffective. The Working Group gathered consistent information from numerous interviews with 
criminal suspects in detention, as well as convicts, from civil society representatives, and the </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>Ukrainian Lawyers&#8217; Association, that detainees are often not aware of their right to defence from 
the moment of arrest and to the appointment of a public defender from the moment of the 
commencement of the criminal investigation, but no later than 72 hours after the arrest, should 
they lack financial means. If they are aware of their right, they often refuse to assure themselves 
of the assistance of a lawyer out of mistrust or futility concerns, or worse, are sometimes 
deliberately withheld access to a lawyer by Militsia officers, investigators, prosecutors, or 
detention facility staff, during the crucial period of preliminary and pre-trial investigations. This 
situation is aggravated by the fact that the equivalent of approximately 3 USD per day for the 
service of a public defence lawyer does not provide the lawyers&#8217; profession with an incentive to 
criminally defend. It was further reported that until the Working Group&#8217;s visit only 20% of the 
legal aid budget for 2008 had been exhausted. 
</p>
<p>49. The Working Group wishes to point out that the right to a lawyer is an important right 
which individuals need to be made aware of at the time of initial arrest and throughout the 
judicial process including the opportunity to appeal decisions relating to detention. An 
individual&#8217;s exercise of this right must not be obstructed by those holding the detainee in 
custody. 
</p>
<p>50. It is often investigators who propose a lawyer to criminal suspects. Such lawyers must be 
independent and at arms length from the investigator and law enforcement officials. The 
Working Group heard from numerous detainees of their lack of confidence of those legal counsel 
proposed by investigators as they were seen as complicit in the investigator&#8217;s approach either 
through association or because they themselves were previous law enforcement officials. 
Following a decision from the Constitutional Court of Ukraine it is not a requirement to be a 
professional lawyer to perform the function of defence counsel. While the Working Group 
recognises the good intentions behind this decision in that it is aimed at reinforcing the right to 
freely choose counsel and at redressing the difficulties for defendants to find a good defender, it 
would like to express its concern as regards to the quality of defence and potential conflicts of 
interests that may exist. 
</p>
<p>51. The legal profession and remuneration when acting as public defenders must be 
strengthened. Without such reforms the highly prevalent practice of corruption throughout the 
judicial process will remain. The Working Group notes that there is no overall bar association in 
Ukraine. A strong and effective bar association can help ensuring effective legal support to all 
detainees. The professionalization of the legal profession is a necessity if confidence is to be 
built in the legal system. Legislative initiatives to establish such an association and ensure the 
legal protection of lawyers are hence welcomed by the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Imprisonment 
</b></p>
<p>52. Criminal sentences are executed by the State Department for the Execution of Sentences, 
the governing authority of the CIZOs and the Ukrainian prison colonies. The percentage of 
accused receiving prison sentences has welcomingly been gradually decreasing during the past 
years and has reached a level of around 25%. 
</p>
<p>53. The Working Group welcomes that the Government of Ukraine has transferred supervisory 
powers over the State Department for the Execution of Sentences from the Ministry of the 
Interior to the Council of Ministers through the Ministry of Justice. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>54. The Working Group was regrettably not able to ascertain how often disciplinary measures, 
including solitary confinement for up to 10 days, in the case of a minor for not more than 
five days, for the infringement of prison rules of a grave nature are resorted to at the CIZO in 
Uzhhorod. It welcomes the fact that such measures can be challenged in court, however, has 
reservations as to the fact that this can be done only after having served the disciplinary measure. 
The Working Group has further concerns regarding the conditions in the punishment cell at 
CIZO #13 in Kyiv, and about the failure of the prison authorities to have a record about the use 
of such a disciplinary measure. It was also made aware of a case of such detention where the 
individual was not aware of his right to seek legal counsel concerning such measures and was 
placed in such detention for an offence which could not be considered of a grave nature. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Detention under State security powers 
</b></p>
<p>55. The SBU of Ukraine is responsible for national security. All personnel of the SBU hold 
military ranks, but are not part of the Ministry of Defence. The SBU is, inter alia, competent to 
fight corruption; organised crime, such as trafficking in persons, drug trafficking, and money 
laundering; as well as terrorist activities and is entitled to conduct pre-trial investigations also 
when the suspect is a minor, although cases are rare. 
</p>
<p>56. During its criminal investigations the investigators of the SBU apply the same procedural 
rules as in other criminal proceedings. The Office of the Prosecutor General exercises oversight 
over SBU investigators in criminal cases without formal subordination. 
</p>
<p>57. In 2008, 453 persons were held under the authority of SBU investigators for less than 
three days and in 177 cases a court sanctioned pre-trial detention (2007: 268/185). 
</p>
<p>58. The Working Group is pleased to note that, following a decision of the Supreme Court of 
Ukraine, the former CIZO of the SBU in Kyiv has ceased to operate as an SBU detention 
facility, and was being refurbished to be re-opened as the national ITT of the SBU. The Working 
Group, however, remains concerned about allegations of a secret detention wing run by the SBU 
at Uzhhorod CIZO. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Detention under administrative offences powers 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Working Group positively notes that, since 1991, only courts shall be competent to 
sanction pre-trial detention no later than 72 hours after arrest. It has, however, received credible 
information that law enforcement authorities have a tendency to circumvent this requirement. 
For example, they are reported to resort to detention regarding administrative offences - 
involving a restricted right to defence and reduced court control since hearings are based solely 
on Militsia reports - providing time to extract coerced confessions related to criminal offences. 
</p>
<p>60. According to the Law on Administrative Offences the Militsia is competent to arrest a 
person and hold him or her in custody for up to 72 hours on suspicion of having committed an 
administrative offence such as &#8220;hooliganism&#8221;. A court is then entitled to sentence such a suspect 
to up to 15 days of administrative detention. As the Working Group could observe during 
interviews with detainees, whose allegations were supported by credible information received 
from civil society and defence lawyers, that situations occur in which Militsia officers stop a </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>person on the street and then falsely charge him or her with resistance to arrest, which amounts 
to an administrative offence. The person is then sent to an ITT by the court for up to 15 days 
during which criminal charges are fabricated under duress. 
</p>
<p>61. The use of administrative detention must clearly be regulated by law and not abused for 
purposes of criminal prosecution. Since it amounts to a form of punishment the concerned person 
must also have the right to appeal to a higher court, which is currently not the case. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Detention of vagrants 
</b></p>
<p>62. Ukraine has special detention facilities for vagrants. The term &#8220;vagrant&#8221; is not defined by 
law and may in practice apply to anyone who cannot produce an identity document when 
stopped on the street by Militsia officers, although the purpose of law is to combat socially 
inadequate behaviour. Such persons can then, at the request of a Militsia officer and sanctioned 
by a prosecutor, be held in administrative detention for up to 30 days (for the main purpose of 
establishing the identity of the detainee) without any involvement of a court of law. 
</p>
<p>63. Not only that such a practice violates article 9, paragraph 4 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights in that the detainee shall be entitled to challenge the legality of 
detention in court or released, this period of detention is also used by law enforcement officials 
to extract coerced confessions on criminal charges. This latter information was received by the 
Working Group from reliable sources. It was however unable to verify it for reasons of a lack of 
a visit to a detention centre for vagrants due to time constraints. 
</p>
<p>64. The Working Group was informed by Ministry of Justice officials that the Government has 
tabled a Bill in Parliament, inter alia, aiming at making it a legal requirement to have a court 
decision authorising detention no later than 72 hours after the arrest. The Prosecutor General has 
requested such legislative amendments be enacted after a study conducted by his Office revealed 
the shortcomings of the present system and also the inhumane conditions in vagrants&#8217; detention 
facilities. It welcomes such an initiative though has not yet seen the draft legislation to be able to 
comment on it substantively. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Detention under military jurisdiction 
</b>65. The Working Group promotes the gradual development from military jurisdiction to an 
entirely civilian one. In Ukraine the military jurisdiction only covers conscripts, which means 
that, for example, criminal offences committed by civilians against military personnel or 
installations, are exclusively tried by civilian courts. The Working Group sees this as a good 
practice. 
</p>
<p>66. Military law enforcement officers are entrusted with fighting crime within the military 
service. Military officers can be arrested under article 106 of the Criminal Procedure Code on 
suspicion of having committed a crime and held for no longer than two hours to establish 
identity. No later than 72 hours after the arrest the suspect has to be brought before a judge. 
Upon court order military servicemen may be detained for up to six months at a guardhouse. 
</p>
<p>67. After initial interrogations and investigations the case is handed over to the military 
prosecutor. Military prosecutors, although military servicemen, form organisationally part of the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>Office of the Prosecutor General. The same provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code are 
applied and defendants enjoy the same procedural rights during the proceedings as civilian 
accused. 
</p>
<p>68. Garrison tribunals form the military courts of first instance, and two regional military 
tribunals the appeals court. The court of review for criminal cases falling under military 
jurisdiction is the Supreme Court, which has military Chambers. All military judges, albeit 
military servicemen, are selected by the President of Ukraine to ensure their independence. Trials 
are, as a rule, conducted on the premises of the military courts, however, in exceptional 
circumstances they are arranged for on premises of the military unit of the accused to stress the 
educational effect of deterrence of the trial vis-&#224;-vis other military staff of the unit. Trials are 
generally open; only in cases involving national security or for the protection of the privacy of 
the accused or the victim are closed trials permitted under the Criminal Procedure Code. 
</p>
<p>69. The Working Group observed that many pre-trial detainees and convicts interviewed 
waived their right to access to a defence lawyer, pleaded guilty in court, and did not appeal their 
sentence, at times at the advice of the defence counsel as the courts of appeal can extend the 
sentence handed down by the court <i>a quo</i>. The Working Group commends the fact that the 
detention of persons under military detention is tied to the civilian structure, including the fact 
that the prosecutors dealing with military cases are also under the jurisdiction of the civilian 
Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p>70. All members of the armed forces of Ukraine sentenced to a prison term between 
six months and two years are being imprisoned at the barracks of the Disciplinary Battalion in 
Kyiv where they are locked up in their cells only in the evening. They can receive visitors 
without restrictions. Their criminal record does not appear in their personal service files. None of 
the prisoners interviewed raised any complaints as regards to their treatment throughout the 
entire proceedings. 
</p>
<p>71. Military Commanders of the Disciplinary Battalion can discipline military staff, including 
those in detention. Any decision to that effect can be contested in court by the concerned military 
officer. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Detention pursuant to immigration powers 
</b></p>
<p>72. The laws of Ukraine governing detention of irregular immigrants are scattered and 
complex. Pursuant to the various laws, a person suspected of having infringed the alien 
legislation may be detained for up to 72 hours by the State Border Guard Service (SBGS) or the 
Militia, provided that the public prosecutor has been notified within 24 hours after the arrest 
(article 263 of the Code of Administrative Offences). For persons who cannot produce an 
identity document the period of detention may be extended for up to 10 days with prior 
authorisation by the public prosecutor. Following an amendment, in 2003, of article 32 of the 
Law of Ukraine on the Legal Status of Foreigners and Stateless Persons, the maximum period 
allowed for the preparation of documentation for expulsion at a temporary holding facility is 
six months, whereas previously the period could have been indefinite. Upon expiry of the period 
of six months, the detainees must be released and are equipped with a temporary stay permit 
should their cases not have been processed by then. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>73. The Working Group appreciates that a maximum time limit has been established. 
However, article 32 of the Law is silent regarding the authority sanctioning the detention. The 
Working Group has received varying accounts from Government representatives as to whether 
such detention must be ordered by a court as a clear requirement of the law. 
</p>
<p>74. According to the Law of Ukraine on Refugees decisions about the granting (loss and 
deprivation) of refugee status are taken by the specially authorised central executive agency for 
migration (the State Committee on Nationalities and Religion). 
</p>
<p>75. The Working Group took note with appreciation that a separate holding facility for 
families, women and minors in Mukachevo has been in operation. However, the Working Group, 
as a matter of principle, questions the appropriateness of detention of minors, especially 
unaccompanied minors, and its compliance with the provisions of the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, notably article 37, lit. (b), clause 2, given the availability of alternatives to 
detention. It also met a few individuals at the Pavshino facility for men who claimed to be under 
age. 
</p>
<p>76. Moreover, there appears to be a lacuna in the laws which results in asylum seekers not 
being automatically released as soon as they have submitted their asylum application if a court 
sanctioned detention for a period of time exceeding this moment. Neither the asylum authority 
nor the administrative courts, in the event of a challenge to the granting of refugee status to an 
individual, have jurisdiction to order the release. Reports about difficulties to obtain access to 
lawyers and lack of awareness of detainees of their rights, also caused by insufficient 
interpretation, have been received. It was also reported that summary detention hearings are 
conducted or that a detainee is not presented before a court at all. At times the maximum periods 
of detention are exceeded, and the backlog of asylum cases before the administrative courts leads 
to unnecessary prolongation of detention. A legal aid system does not apply to irregular 
immigrants in detention. The Working Group would, however, expressly acknowledge the 
progress that has already been made by the Government of Ukraine with respect to the detention 
regime of irregular immigrants as was confirmed by several interlocutors, and encourages it to 
proceed on that path. 
</p>
<p>77. One major concern relates to information received independently from different sources 
from the civil society and from the international community about a so-called &#8220;Operation 
Migrants&#8221; that was supposed to have been carried out in Uzhhorod in summer 2008: At the 
instigation of higher authorities, foreigners were stopped randomly on the streets and detained 
invoking immigration powers to reduce the number foreigners visible in the street. At times their 
irregular status was fabricated by tearing apart their documents, which permitted their stay in 
Ukraine. The Working Group would like to receive information from the Government to clarify 
the situation, which would violate human rights on a number of levels. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Detention pending extradition 
</b></p>
<p>78. On 19 November 2008, the Working Group received a letter by a member of the Ukrainian 
Lawyers&#8217; Association, channelled through the Government and accompanied by its comments, 
concerning a man for whom authorities from a neighbouring country of his citizenship had 
requested extradition. He has been detained since 13 October 2007 at the CIZO #5 in Donetsk 
and his lawyer, with whom the Working Group met personally during its mission, had requested </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>that it meets with his client during its stay in Donetsk. The Working Group is concerned about 
the information it has received that this person remains in detention despite a decision by the 
Voroshylovskiy District court in Donetsk ordering his release on 29 August 2008. This followed 
a decision on acquittal by the same court concerning criminal charges brought against him on a 
separate account dated 21 August 2008. It is alleged that the Head of CIZO #5 refused to comply 
with the court order. 
</p>
<p>79. According to the Government the decision of this court of 29 August 2008 was overturned 
by the Appeals Court on 8 September 2008, authorising the continuation of detention, and that 
no further challenges of the detention order have been made. The appeal of the prosecution 
against the decision of 21 August 2008 is still pending. The Working Group would like to 
understand whether it was the Head of the Donetsk CIZO who refused to comply with the 
release order, which would amount to a criminal offence, or whether detention followed the 
appeal. It asks the Government to provide further information. 
</p>
<p>80. The Working Group has interviewed two individuals detained pursuant to extradition 
requests from a neighbouring country. One woman has been detained for one year and 
two months at CIZO #13. Criminal charges in her country of origin were brought against her 
when she applied for citizenship in Ukraine. She and her family had received threats from 
authorities of her country of citizenship and was granted refugee status in Ukraine. A legal 
challenge to her refugee status by the Prosecutor General was granted by an administrative court 
of appeal on 23 December 2008. The administrative court does not have jurisdiction over 
detention matters, which a different competent court had ordered until a decision on extradition 
is taken. 
</p>
<p>81. In another case a foreigner detained at CIZO #13 was interviewed, who had been charged 
for financially supporting the political opposition in a neighbouring country which has sought his 
extradition on these grounds. Despite him being granted refugee status in April 2008 and a court 
hearing in July 2008 where the administrative court supported his release, he remained in 
detention until 28 November 2008 when the Prosecutor General decided to reject the extradition 
request and released him. The Working Group has also received information that the Prosecutor 
General in a recent case had effected the extradition of a person to a neighbouring country giving 
rise to concern about a violation of the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i> despite a decision by a 
national court rejecting the Prosecutor General&#8217;s application to invalidate his refugee status. 
82. The Working Group is concerned about the potentially indefinite detention of detainees 
subject to an extradition request. It is also concerned yet again about the culmination of powers 
within the Office of the Prosecutor General which has to answer extradition requests and has at 
the same time the authority to challenge the granting of a refugee status, which could bar 
extradition on the grounds of <i>non-refoulement</i>. 
</p>
<p><b>H.  Juvenile justice 
</b>83. In Ukraine the general age of criminal liability is 16, for grave crimes, mainly committed 
against the life or physical integrity of a person, at the age of 14. 
</p>
<p>84. Once a minor suspected of having committed a crime is arrested and detained the same 
provisions are applied as for adults. In Ukraine no separate juvenile justice system tailored to </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>juveniles&#8217; specific needs exists. This impacts on rehabilitation where the Working Group notes 
that the relapse rate of minors to crimes is exceptionally high. The Working Group has been 
informed by the Government that draft legislation is under discussion to provide for a special 
regime for minors in conflict with the law and therefore supports this initiative. Several justices 
throughout Ukraine have already undergone training to empower them to take the juveniles&#8217; 
special needs into account during the judicial process. The Working Group was able to briefly 
meet with one such justice. 
</p><p>85. The Working Group observed several issues of concern regarding minors in conflict with 
the law. It interviewed a number of juveniles who were detained on remand in connection with 
relatively minor crimes such as theft of a mobile phone. This practice runs counter to article 37, 
lit. (b), clause 2, of the Convention on the Rights of the Child that &#8220;[t]he arrest, detention or 
imprisonment of a child shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a measure 
of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>86. The Working Group notes with grave concern that juveniles are allegedly being tortured 
and ill-treated while in the hands of Militsia officers to extract confessions. Although mandatory 
by law, minors interviewed reported a lack of information of their right to defence counsel and 
access to a lawyer. Minors face the same restrictions in pre-trial detention, including prohibited 
contact to their families until their trial commences in court, as for adults. Such measures are 
particularly severe where juveniles are detained in the same vicinity as adults including convicts. 
</p><p>87. The Working Group observed at the CIZO in Uzhhorod that five male adults were detained 
in a cell in a wing reportedly dedicated solely for the detention of women and minors and 
highlights the applicable international human rights law requirements which support the 
separation of men from women and juveniles in detention. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  Deprivation of liberty on grounds of mental health 
</b></p>
<p>88. The rights of individuals with mental impairments are an important component in any 
human rights regime. The Working Group draws the attention to the State of the International 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and calls for Ukraine to become a party to 
this Convention. The Working Group appreciated the head of State Municipal Psychiatric 
hospital&#8217;s supporting its visit despite the personal loss he experienced the day of the Members&#8217; 
visit. They commended the facilities&#8217; approach to those detained within its facility which was 
reaffirmed by speaking with a family member of a person (voluntarily) admitted there. There 
was no evidence of any arbitrariness of deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p>89. However, in relation to persons detained in either ITTs or CIZO the Working Group 
expresses concern that persons should not be detained to assess the psychiatric nature of an 
individual. Such detention without legal cause can be constituted as arbitrary and the persons 
affected should be treated in an appropriate mental health facility. At the CIZO in Uzhhorod the 
Working Group was concerned that persons may be detained while undergoing psychiatric 
assessment. It was also, regrettably, unable to find a record of these assessments in the detention 
facility despite the person undergoing weeks of assessment in another facility. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p><b>J.  Detention registries 
</b></p>
<p>90. To protect the rights of detained persons it is critical that their whereabouts, especially to 
their relatives, are known at all times in a clear and transparent manner. The registers maintained 
in institutions under the authority of the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Defence were 
generally of a good quality and permitted the Working Group the ability to determine in a speedy 
manner the process concerning a given detainee. Those however maintained in the institutions 
under the Department on the Execution of Sentences, namely the CIZO, were often opaque and 
required reference to a variety of sources. The Working Group would like to stress the 
importance of ensuring that all persons detained, for whatever period and in whatever detention 
facility, be properly registered. The Working Group was made aware of detention which had not 
been registered, and found one detainee at the Main Watch Guardhouse of the Crimean 
Territorial Law-Enforcement Administration who had not been registered after three days. 
</p>
<p><b>K.  Monitoring mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>91. A strong judicial process which can combat arbitrariness of detention requires independent 
monitoring and oversight over procedures and practices, which should include the participation 
of civil society. The initiatives of the Ministry of Interior in relation to the 53 mobile monitoring 
clinics throughout the country composed of representatives of civil society and staff of the 
Ministry of Interior and other Government bodies, with a mandate to visit Militsia detention 
facilities, monitor the situation of detainees, and prevent acts of torture, at each <i>oblast</i> level as 
well as the involvement of various stakeholders through the Public Councils, are positive steps. 
Drawing on information gathered during its mission, the Working Group however shares the 
concerns expressed by the Committee against Torture, noted in its recent Conclusions and 
Recommendations on Ukraine&#8217;s State report, regarding the mobile clinics&#8217; dependency on the 
goodwill of local authorities, their lack of formal status, and a lack of adequate resources.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>92. The Office of the Ombudsperson was established in 1998 with a constitutional mandate to 
deal with individual complaints of human rights violations; advise on relevant legislative 
developments; oversee governance in compliance with human rights standards; and undertake 
human rights promotional activities. The mandate includes unannounced visits to detention 
facilities. The Ombudsperson is elected by Parliament and financed directly from the national 
budget to ensure the Office&#8217;s independence. The number of staff employed (100 professional and 
general staff) is modest for a country the size of Ukraine and with the breadth of mandate 
bestowed on it. The Working Group noted varied perceptions concerning the effectiveness of the 
institution of the Ombudsperson. Civil society informed the Working Group on cases which had 
merely been referred by the Ombudsperson, for investigation, to the state institution complained 
against. The Ombudsperson, however, rejected these assertions. The Working Group welcomes 
the stated commitment of the Ombudsperson to take up the cases reported to it by the Working 
Group and to inform it accordingly of the results.

</p>
<p>93. The Working Group welcomes the fact that Ukraine has ratified the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. It also welcomes discussions and possible legislative initiatives which will provide 
for a structure in relation to national preventive mechanisms as an important tool also to combat 
arbitrary detention. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>94. The Working Group expresses its appreciation to the Government of Ukraine for the 
invitation and for its cooperation throughout the mission. 
</p>
<p>95. Institutionally, the Working Group noted a number of areas of cooperation between those 
Governmental bodies that deal with detention. However, the Working Group also found that 
there exists a number of overlapping departmental regimes which could be contributing factors 
to the existence of arbitrary detention. The Working Group noted that with respect to criminal 
cases the Ministry of Interior including the Militsia, as well as specialised authorities such as the 
State Security Services and the military, and the Department of the Execution of Sentences can 
deal with detainees during the various phases of the pre-trial period. 
</p>
<p>96. There were throughout the Working Group&#8217;s visit to Ukraine consistent references to a 
lack of confidence in key institutions relating to the protection of an individual&#8217;s rights. These 
would in particular include the judiciary; the Militsia; the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office, and 
lawyers. While some of this may also relate to very low and indeed unacceptable salaries for 
these professions as well as high levels of corruption, some also relates to a sense of collusion 
among individuals to make the principle of pre-trial detention as the norm rather than the 
exception. Confessions obtained under torture must be addressed by the Government as a matter 
of priority. 
</p>
<p>97. Recently, a number of legislative initiatives which have been launched are worthy of 
support: the revised Criminal Code and efforts to amend the Criminal Procedural Code. These 
would help reduce the burden on the penitentiary system. Overcrowding of detention facilities 
would be addressed by reducing sentences for less severe crimes, further exploring the 
possibility of early releases on probation, or finding alternatives to detention. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>On the basis of its findings, the Working Group makes the following 
recommendations to the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning access to detention facilities 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Continue to provide free and unfettered access to persons in detention to 
international, regional and national human rights mechanisms. </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p><b>Concerning allegations of torture to extract confessions 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Establish a National Preventive Mechanism as foreseen by the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, with the required capabilities, professional 
knowledge and appropriate resources to enable such a mechanism to function 
independently and effectively. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure a policy of zero-tolerance of torture and ensure that any related 
allegation is promptly and properly investigated and if founded redressed, including 
compensation. The proposal by the President of Ukraine, made at the opening of the 
meeting of the National Commission on Reinforcement of Democracy and the Rule of Law, 
to create an agency to coordinate the State&#8217;s policy preventing torture is an initiative 
supported by the Working Group. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Amend the Criminal Procedure Code to the effect that convictions exclusively 
based on confessions are inadmissible. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning the Militsia 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Support the Militsia and other enforcement officials in their policies of integrity 
which may comprise denouncing colleagues for illegal practices, including collusion and 
corruption, so that they are not arbitrarily detained and justice is served. 
Concerning pre-trial detention 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Amend the Code of Criminal Procedure to provide for a maximum time period 
of pre-trial detention also in the event of a re-trial. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning the Office of the Prosecutor General 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Revisit the dual role of prosecution and oversight of the Prosecutor General&#8217;s 
Office and entrust another state authority with either oversight or 
investigation/prosecution functions in criminal procedures to enhance protection of 
suspects&#8217; and accused&#8217; rights. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning the judiciary 
 (h) Provide the legal and operational framework for an independent and effective 
judiciary including through appropriate recruitment. 
 (i) Consider providing judges at all levels of the judiciary, who authorise pre-trial 
detention and other forms of detention and sentence the accused to imprisonment, with 
increased oversight competences, including the power to conduct unannounced visits to 
detention facilities. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p><b> (j) Cease the practice of appointing a president of a court entitled to distribute 
cases <i>ad libitum </i>to the judges of the court and guarantee that, in any given case, the 
competent judge who takes decisions related to deprivation of liberty is predetermined by 
law. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning access to a lawyer and legal aid 
</b></p>
<p><b> (k) Legally enact a nationwide Bar Association with an independent and effective 
mandate, with enhanced powers, also capable of efficiently holding those lawyers 
responsible who do not act in the defence of their clients. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (l) Empower the legal profession by taking measures such as raising the daily 
salary for public defence in criminal cases. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (m) To reserve access to the profession of defence lawyers to advocates following 
university education and legal clerkship. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (n) Ensure that, in practice, all detainees have recourse to lawyers from the 
moment of arrest. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning imprisonment 
</b></p>
<p><b> (o) Maintain records and statistical information concerning all stages of a person&#8217;s 
detention including temporary releases and disciplinary measures imposed upon prisoners. 
Provisions should be made that disciplinary measures such as solitary confinement may be 
challenged before a court not only <i>ex post facto.</i> 
 (p) Introduce, where necessary, i.e. especially in detention facilities under the 
authority of the State Department for the Execution of Sentences, a system of detention 
registries which contains all relevant information on the detention of the concerned person 
to avoid having to consult different files. The guidelines of the Working Group contained in 
its annual report 2007 (A/HRC/7/4, p. 24 et seq.) could be taken into account. 
 (q) Consider ceasing the practice of conducting court hearings for early release and 
trials regarding new crimes committed during the serving of a prison term on prison 
premises. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning administrative offences detention 
</b></p>
<p><b> (r) Provide for an effective appeal procedure against administrative sentences 
which are a form of punishment. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning immigration detention 
</b></p>
<p><b> (s) Ensure that delays in the processing of asylum requests do not have a bearing 
on the length of detention and to prevent unnecessary detention of asylum seekers. </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/21/Add.4 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p><b>Concerning detention pending extradition 
</b></p>
<p><b> (t) Legally provide, save for exceptional circumstances, and unless Ukraine has 
criminal jurisdiction itself, for the mandatory release of a person subjected to an 
extradition request, who has been granted refugee status because of the situation prevailing 
in the country of origin, to which an extradition, if carried out, would amount to a violation 
of the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i> and can therefore not be effected. 
Concerning juvenile justice 
 (u) Continue with and reinforce its efforts to enact a separate juvenile justice 
system in compliance with Ukraine&#8217;s obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and other applicable international human rights norms and standards. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning monitoring mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b> (v) Further strengthen the Office of the Ombudsperson, including by providing it 
with the necessary financial and human resources to carry out its human rights protection 
and oversight functions in relation to detention and prevention of, and protection against, 
torture. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Concerning deprivation of liberty in general 
</b></p>
<p><b> (w) Legally provide that all persons deprived of their liberty are released as soon as 
a court has made an order to that effect, even in the event of an appeal by the State of this 
court order, thereby removing the suspensive effect of such appeal. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (x) Provide for legal and institutional guarantees that next-of-kin of persons 
arrested or detained are always and promptly informed. </b></p>
