<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present document is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in 
</p>
<p>persons, especially women and children, Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, to the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>pursuant to its resolution 17/1.  
</p>
<p>2. In the present addendum, the Special Rapporteur provides observations, where 
</p>
<p>considered appropriate, on communications sent to States between 16 March 2011 and 15 
</p>
<p>March 2012, as well as on responses received from States in relation to these 
</p>
<p>communications until 15 May 2012. Communications sent and responses received during 
</p>
<p>the reporting period are accessible electronically through hyperlinks.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the receipt of responses from three States 
</p>
<p>during the period under review.  The Special Rapporteur is grateful to all States which have 
</p>
<p>transmitted responses to her communications.  She considers response to her 
</p>
<p>communications an important part of cooperation by States with her mandate. In this 
</p>
<p>context, the Special Rapporteur recalls paragraph (i)(4) of the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 17/1 which calls upon States &#8220;to provide him or her with all necessary 
</p>
<p>information relating to the mandate to enable him or her to fulfil the mandate effectively&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>She therefore urges States which have not yet provided responses to her communications to 
</p>
<p>do so without further delays.   
</p>
<p><b> II. Observations by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Albania  
</b></p>
<p>4. JAL 28/10/2011.  Case no. ALB 1/2011.  State reply: 22/12/2011.  Alleged 
</p>
<p>trafficking of Kosovo Albanians and Serbs for the purpose of removal of organs and sexual 
</p>
<p>exploitation.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Albania for its timely response to 
</p>
<p>this communication. She appreciates the information provided regarding previous 
</p>
<p>investigations carried out by non-State authorities on this matter. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>further welcomes the Government&#8217;s willingness to fully cooperate with the Special 
</p>
<p>Investigative Task Force of the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX), 
</p>
<p>which is mandated to investigate the allegations concerned in the communication.  The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur would be grateful to receive information on the outcomes of the 
</p>
<p>investigations, including any relevant information on the questions raised in the 
</p>
<p>communication.  In addition, the Special Rapporteur notes the Government&#8217;s efforts to 
</p>
<p>address trafficking in persons through the implementation of the &#8220;Intersectional National 
</p>
<p>Strategy in the fight against organized crime, trafficking and terrorism&#8221;, the &#8220;National 
</p>
<p>Strategy in the fight against human trafficking&#8221; and the &#8220;National Strategy in the fight 
</p>
<p>against children trafficking and the protection of children trafficking victims&#8221;.  The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur would appreciate it if the Government could share copies in English of these 
</p>
<p>strategies with her.    
</p>
<p><b>  Egypt

<p>6. AL 15/02/2012. Case no. EGY 4/2012.  State reply: 11/04/2012.  Alleged trafficking

</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the Government&#8217;s response to the 
</p>
<p>communication, which is being translated into English at the time of the finalization of the 
</p>
<p>report.  The response will be included in the next communications report of special 
</p>
<p>procedures.   
</p>
<p><b>  France  
</b></p>
<p>8. AL 25/3/2011. Case no. FRA 2/2011.  State reply: None to date.  Alleged trafficking 
</p>
<p>for the purpose of sexual exploitation and failure to provide the victim with remedy.  
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of France has not provided its 
</p>
<p>response to her communication of 25 March 2011, despite her reminder at the 17
th
</p>
<p> session 
</p>
<p>of the Human Rights Council.  She urges the authorities to provide as soon as possible 
</p>
<p>detailed responses to all the concerns raised in her communication. 
</p>
<p><b>  India  
</b></p>
<p>10. JAL 15/02/2012. Case no. IND 2/2012. State reply: None to date. Alleged 
</p>
<p>trafficking of girl children from the districts of 24 North Parganas and Murshidabad, West 
</p>
<p>Bengal State, for the purpose of sexual exploitation, and the alleged systematic failure of 
</p>
<p>the police to investigate such incidents. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government of India has not provided its 
</p>
<p>response to her communication of 15 February 2012.  She urges the authorities to provide 
</p>
<p>as soon as possible detailed responses to all the concerns raised in her communication. 
</p>
<p><b>  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
</b></p>
<p>12. JAL 21/12/2011. Case no. GBR 7/2011.  State reply: 23/02/2012.  Alleged negative 
</p>
<p>impact of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) government 
</p>
<p>proposal to abolish the Overseas Domestic Worker (ODW) visa system.   
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the United Kingdom for its 
</p>
<p>response.  However, she regrets that the results of the three-month consultation were not 
</p>
<p>received from the Government before it implemented the concerned changes to the ODW 
</p>
<p>visa system.  In particular, she wishes to receive information on the finding that there is no 
</p>
<p>convincing evidence that the changes to the ODW system would lead to an increase in 
</p>
<p>trafficking.  She would also appreciate more details about protections provided to overseas 
</p>
<p>domestic workers, having regard to the fact that they no longer enjoy the right to change 
</p>
<p>employer.  This additional information would be of interest to the other Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteurs who joined this communication.      </p>
