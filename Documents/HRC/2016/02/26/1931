the real and effective participation of the people in the decision-making processes, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the crucial importance of the active involvement of civil society, at all 
levels, in processes of governance and in promoting good governance, including through 
transparency and accountability, at all levels, which is indispensable for building peaceful, 
prosperous and democratic societies, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful</i> that domestic legal and administrative provisions and their application 
should facilitate, promote and protect an independent, diverse and pluralistic civil society 
and, in this regard, strongly rejecting any acts of intimidation or reprisals against civil 
society, 
</p>
<p><i>Underscoring</i> that the legal framework within which civil society operates is that of 
national legislation consistent with the Charter of the United Nations and international 
human rights law, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> that, in some instances, domestic legal and administrative 
provisions, such as national security and counter-terrorism legislation, and other measures, 
such as provisions on funding to civil society, have sought to or have been misused to 
hinder the work and endanger the safety of civil society in a manner contrary to 
international law, and recognizing the urgent need to prevent and stop the use of such 
provisions, and to review and, where necessary, amend any relevant provisions in order to 
ensure compliance with international human rights law and, as appropriate, international 
humanitarian law,

political, economic, social and cultural rights of all individuals, inter alia the rights to 
freedom of expression and opinion and to assemble peacefully and associate freely, online 
as well as offline, including for persons espousing minority or dissenting views or beliefs, 
and that respect for all such rights, in relation to civil society, contributes to addressing and 
resolving challenges and issues that are important to society, such as addressing financial 
and economic crises, responding to humanitarian crises, including armed conflict, 
promoting the rule of law and accountability, achieving transitional justice goals, protecting 
the environment, realizing the right to development, empowering persons belonging to 
minorities and vulnerable groups, combating racism and racial discrimination, supporting 
crime prevention, promoting corporate social responsibility and accountability, combating 
human trafficking, empowering women and youth, advancing social justice and consumer 
protection, and the realization of all human rights; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Urges</i> States to create and maintain, in law and in practice, a safe and 
enabling environment in which civil society can operate free from hindrance and insecurity;  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also urges</i> States to acknowledge publicly the important and legitimate role 
of civil society in the promotion of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, and to 
engage with civil society to enable it to participate in the public debate on decisions that 
would contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights and the rule of law, and 
of any other relevant decisions; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Urges</i> all non-State actors to respect all human rights and not to undermine 
the capacity of civil society to operate free from hindrance and insecurity; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Emphasizes</i> the essential role of civil society in subregional, regional and 
international organizations, including in support of the organizations&#8217; work, and in sharing 
experience and expertise through participation in meetings in accordance with relevant 
rules and modalities and, in this regard, reaffirms the right of everyone, individually and in 
association with others, to unhindered access to and communication with subregional, </p>


<p>regional and international bodies, in particular the United Nations, its representatives and 
mechanisms; 
</p>

appropriate, in the framework of their existing mandates, to continue to address relevant 
aspects of civil society space; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to promote and protect civil society space, and invites it to continue 
efforts in this regard; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Decides</i> to organize, at its twenty-fifth session, a panel discussion on the 
importance of the promotion and protection of civil society space, which will, inter alia, 
contribute to the identification of challenges facing States in their efforts to ensure space for 
civil society and lessons learned and good practices in this regard, and invites the Office of 
the High Commissioner to liaise with States, relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, 
relevant special procedures, civil society and other stakeholders with a view to ensuring 
their participation in the panel discussion; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a summary report 
on the panel discussion, to be presented to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh 
session.
