Funds  from  operations  is  a  non-GAAP  measure  that  does  not  have  a  standardized  meaning  as  prescribed  by
GAAP and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other oil and gas companies.
 We consider it an important measure as it demonstrates our ability to generate the cash flow necessary to fund
future growth through capital investment.

Summary
·
Strong financial statement results include the benefits of higher product pricing, higher volumes, and lower general
and administrative costs, partially offset by higher depletion rates.
·
Reserve additions of 0.3 bcf (after Kotaneelee revision) during the third quarter and a total of 4.2 bcf for the nine
months ended September 30, 2005, or a 56% increase year to date increase of proven reserves.
·
Upcoming winter drilling season expected to be active.
·
Presentations to financial community commencing in the 4th quarter.
Report to Shareholders
During and subsequent to the third quarter of 2005, we focused primarily on activity in northeast British Columbia
as part of our strategy to reduce our dependence on the Kotaneelee field.  Notwithstanding the high demand for
equipment, services, personnel, and the unpredictable weather conditions, we accomplished the following:
·
Completed, tested and added reserves on wells drilled last winter at:
o
both operated Mike/Hazel wells, and
o
one non-operated well in Buick Creek
·
Drilled  two 100% interest wells (one successful)
·
Prepared for the upcoming winter drilling season.
Mike/Hazel
In  the  Mike/Hazel  area,  we  are  pleased  to  report  that  both  of  the  wells  we  drilled  last  winter  were  new  pool
discoveries.
The 85% interest a-19-L/94-H-2 well discovered a Jean Marie gas pool at a depth of approximately 8,200 feet.  To
the  best  of  our  knowledge,  there  is  no  Jean  Marie  production  within  approximately  25  miles  of  this  discovery.
  Given  its  lack  of  proximity  to  comparable  pools  in  the  area,  we  will  tie  in  the  well  and  evaluate  its  long  term
productive capability.  The well’s performance will assist us in determining when, or if, follow up drilling to this
depth would be economic to pursue on additional identified anomalies by our proprietary 3-D seismic across 100%
interest Company lands.
The  100%  interest  a-81-H/94-H-2  discovered  a  new  pool  of  liquids-rich  Gething  gas.    We  plan  to  spend  the
necessary capital to tie-in this well and pursue further drilling opportunities in the area.  Surveys for our new well
locations and pipeline right of ways are expected to be submitted for regulatory approval within the coming weeks.
 Available equipment and services permitting, we expect to tie-in existing wells and drill new wells in the area this
upcoming winter season.
Buick Creek
Our  recently  drilled  100%  interest  Buick  Creek  d-60-C/94-A-14  well  is  currently  undergoing  flow  testing  in  the
primary zone of interest.  We are optimistic that we will include reserves additions for this well and will proceed
with its tie-in for production in 2006.
The non-operated Buick Creek b-88-C/94-A-14 well (22.5% Company interest) that was drilled last winter has now
been completed and tested; accordingly, we have recorded additional proven reserves in the third quarter.  This
well is currently being tied-in for production.
We are expecting the operator of the Buick Creek d-24-E/94-A-14 well (22.5% Company interest), also drilled last
winter, to complete and test this well in the near future.  Based on log analysis, we are optimistic that this well will
also contribute to reserve additions prior to year end and production cash flows in 2006.
Financial
We  are  pleased  that  net  income  is  higher  in  this  quarter  than  for  the  same  period  in  2004.  The  principal
contributing factors were the significant increase in commodity prices and higher production volumes.
Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 was $1.0 million, or $0.07 per share, compared to $445,000,
or $0.03 per share, for the same period in 2004.  Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was
$2.3 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to $2.2 million, or $0.15 per share, for the same period in 2004.
Funds from operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 was $4.0 million, or $0.28 per share, compared
to $1.6 million, or $0.11 per share, for the same period in 2004. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005
funds from operations were $8.6 million, or $0.60 per basic share, compared to $5.7 million, or $0.39 per share, for
the same period in 2004.
Other
The Kotaneelee L-38 well, which commenced production on May 4, 2005, continues to produce approximately 4.0
mmcf/d net sales to us.  In the third quarter of 2005, the Kotaneelee I-48 well, and to a lesser degree, the B-38 well
experienced further declines in production. The I-48 well averaged approximately 1.7 mmcf/d net sales to us for the
month of June 2005, however by late October this well was contributing only 0.1 mmcf/d of net sales to us.  The
operator is currently evaluating what, if any, remedial action can be taken.
We continue to increase the proportion of our production that we market ourselves.  Effective November 1, 2005,
we commenced marketing our production from Buick Creek.  We now control the marketing of the majority of our
gas, which is currently being sold on a daily basis on the spot market.
This upcoming winter drilling season will be our busiest in many years, as we expect to:
·
Install surface well equipment on two operated wells at Mike/Hazel and construct approximately 5 miles of pipeline
infrastructure to enable us to commence production in the first quarter of 2006
·
Install surface well equipment and pipelines on up to three (1.45 net) wells in the Buick Creek area
·
Drill up to three operated wells in the Mike/Hazel area
·
Commence presentations to the investment community.
Our goal remains to increase shareholder value and we believe that by selectively adding to our undeveloped land
base  and  carefully  and  thoroughly  evaluating  and  exploiting  our  development  opportunities,  we  will  build  this
value for our shareholders.

Management's Discussion and Analysis
Management’s Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements and selected notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 and
our  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  and  related  notes  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2004.    The
interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) applicable in Canada.  A reconciliation of Canadian GAAP to U.S. GAAP is included in note 9
to  our  interim  consolidated  financial  statements.    Unless  otherwise  noted,  all  amounts  are  stated  in  Canadian
dollars, and sales volumes, production volumes and reserves are before royalties. The calculation of barrels of oil
equivalent (“boe”) is based on a conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil (“6:1”)
to  estimate  relative  energy  content.    This  conversion  should  be  used  with  caution,  particularly  when  used  in
isolation, since the 6 mcf:1 bbl ratio is based on an energy equivalency at the burner tip and does not represent the
value equivalency at the well head.
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis includes references to financial measures commonly used in the oil
and  gas  industry,  such  as  funds  from  operations  (expressed  before  changes  in  non-cash  working  capital)  and
funds from operations per share (using the weighted average shares outstanding consistent with the calculation of
net income (loss) per share).  These financial measures are not defined by GAAP and therefore are referred to as
non-GAAP  measures.    The  non-GAAP  measures  used  by  us  may  not  be  comparable  to  similar  measures
presented by other companies.  We use these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of the Company.
 The non-GAAP measures should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than net earnings, as
determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our performance.
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis is dated as at November 7, 2005.

Funds from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2005 were $4.0 million, or $0.28 per share, up
158% over the same quarter in 2004.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, funds from operations were
$8.6 million or $0.60 per share, 52% higher than the same period last year.  The increases were mainly due to
higher commodity prices realized so far in 2005, including significantly higher gas prices during the third quarter
and the recovery of current income taxes realized as a result of a prior period re-filing of our income tax returns
from 1994 to 2002.  Increased sales volumes resulting from the successful drilling of the Kotaneelee L-38 well
contributed to the gains but were slightly offset by production declines in the I-48 well and, to a lesser degree, the
B-38 well at Kotaneelee.

Net income for the three month period ended September 30, 2005 was 125% higher than the previous year, due
mainly to the higher commodity prices realized during the quarter.  Higher revenues for the third quarter of 2005
were tempered somewhat by higher depletion costs.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, net income was $2.3 million, or $0.16 per share, slightly higher
than the net income for the first nine months of 2004.  Higher commodity prices, lower general and administrative
expenses and the recovery of current income taxes were offset by higher depletion charges.
Impact of Conversion of Kotaneelee to a Working Interest
Effective May 1, 2004, we converted our 30.67% carried interest in the Kotaneelee field to a corresponding 30.67%
working interest.  Although the conversion has no impact on the aggregate amounts of our share of field production
and related field operating cash flow, the conversion has financial statement disclosure implications as discussed
below.
Prior to the conversion, the majority of our carried interest revenue related to Kotaneelee.  Proceeds from carried
interests represent passive net investment income in a net cash flow stream, and appropriately were recorded after
the reduction of all royalties, lease operating expenses, transportation costs, and capital expenditures.
Subsequent to May 1, 2004, sales from the Kotaneelee field are being reported as working interest natural gas
sales while related royalties, lease operating expenses and transportation costs are being included under their
respective  captions.    As  a  result,  working  interest  natural  gas  sales,  royalties,  lease  operating  expenses,  and
transportation costs have increased significantly over comparable periods and proceeds of carried interests has
decreased accordingly.
Capital  expenditures  for  Kotaneelee  are  no  longer  a  deduction  from  carried  interest  revenue  but  are  instead
recorded as capital asset additions on our balance sheet.
Carried interest revenues in future periods are expected to be minimal.

Sales volumes for the third quarter averaged 1,285 boe/d, 16% higher than the comparable quarter in 2004.  This
increase is due to the added volumes from the Kotaneelee L-38 well, which came on production in May 2005.
 Production from the L-38 well, which continues to add approximately 4 mmcf/d to our sales volumes, has been
partially offset by declining production at the Kotaneelee I-48 and B-38 wells.
Year to date, our sales volumes averaged 1,131 boe/d, relatively unchanged from the 1,209 boe/d averaged year
to  date  in  2004.    The  production  addition  of  Kotaneelee  L-38  has  more  than  offset  the  production  declines;
however, this well has only been on production for 5 of the 9 months in 2005.  As a result, the 2005 versus 2004
year to date comparison is not representative of the full year impact.
Production from our Kotaneelee field continues to contribute the majority of our sales volumes.  Our average net
natural gas sales from Kotaneelee during the third quarter of 2005 were 5.5 mmcf/d, or approximately 73% of our
total natural gas sales.  This compares to 63% of total gas sales during the third quarter last year.  The increase is
attributable  to  the  addition  of  Kotaneelee  L-38  volumes  beginning  in  May  2005;  however,  with  the  expected
increase in production from new wells in combination with the decline in production from the Kotaneelee B-38 and
I-48 wells, this percentage is expected to decrease in the coming quarters.
Sales volumes in the third quarter of 2005 continued to be adversely affected by a scheduled turnaround at the
third-party Duke McMahon Gas Plant.  Production from the Buick Creek, Siphon, and Ekwan fields were shut-in
from June 21 to July 9, 2005.  These fields re-commenced production on completion of the turnaround.
Although our natural gas working interest volumes  increased  100%  over  the  nine  month  comparative  from  last
year, this is mainly the result of the conversion of our Kotaneelee carried interest to a working interest, as noted
above, which is also reflected in the decrease in natural gas carried interest volumes from last year.

“Carried interest” is net of related carried interest royalties, lease operating expenses, transportation costs, and
capital.
Commodity prices remained strong in the third quarter this year and were the major factor in the 72% increase in
petroleum and natural gas revenues versus the third quarter last year.   The 16% increase in sales volumes, as
shown above, was also a contributing factor.
For  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2005,  the  2004  conversion  of  the  Kotaneelee  carried  interest  to  a
working interest in May also contributed to the 29% increase in revenues in two ways.  First, revenue was recorded
under working interest revenues in all of the first nine months of 2005 as opposed to treatment as carried interest
revenues  during  a  portion  of  the  comparative  period  in  2004.    Also,  transportation  costs  after  conversion  are
recorded separately from revenue, as an expense, whereas before conversion, they were treated as a reduction
from carried interest revenue.  A corresponding decrease in the carried interest revenues also resulted from this
conversion.

The average sales price for “Carried interest” is calculated before deducting the related carried interest royalties,
lease operating expenses, transportation costs, and capital.  Carried interest revenue for the three and nine months
ending September 30, 2005 was not material.
Average  natural  gas  prices  continued  to  rise  during  the  third  quarter  of  2005,  averaging  47%  higher  than  the
second quarter this year and 48% higher than the third quarter last year.  Market factors contributing to the rise in
North American natural gas prices include continuing worldwide high oil prices and the extensive damage to oil
and gas production facilities by the recent hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
We continue to take more of our gas in kind from our properties as their long-term sales contracts expire.   Gas from
our  Siphon  and  Buick  Creek  properties  was  taken  in  kind  commencing  August  1,  and  November  1,  2005,
respectively.  We now control the marketing of the majority of our gas, which is currently being sold on a daily basis
on the spot market.

Total royalties increased by 38% in the third quarter of 2005, and by 59% for nine month period ended September
30, 2005.  The total increase in absolute amounts for royalties this year as compared with last year was a function
of higher revenues, the result of higher sales volumes in the third quarter and higher product prices, and treatment
of Kotaneelee as a carried interest in the first four months of the 2004 comparative period.
Royalties  as  a  percentage  of  working  interest  revenues  amounted  to  12%  during  the  third  quarter  of  2005,
compared to 15% during the same quarter last year.  This drop results mainly from an adjustment to the over-riding
royalties paid at Kotaneelee.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, royalties as a percentage of working interest revenues
decreased to 14% from 17%.  The increase in total royalties, offset by a decrease in the royalty rate, was mainly a
result of our conversion of the Kotaneelee carried interest to a working interest in May 2004.  The crown royalty
rate for the Kotaneelee property is approximately 10%, which is lower than the rate for the balance of our working
interest properties.  Due to the significance of the Kotaneelee revenues and, therefore the royalties, this resulted in
a lower overall corporate royalty rate.
During  the  third  quarter  this  year,  we  were  able  to  take  advantage  of  British  Columbia’s  Summer  Oil  and  Gas
Royalty Program by drilling the two 100% working interest wells at Siphon and Buick Creek.  As a result of this
program, which provides a royalty credit of up to $100,000 per new well drilled, we expect our royalties to decrease
in 2006 by approximately $150,000 to $175,000.

Lease  operating  costs  increased  32%  from  the  third  quarter  last  year  to  the  third  quarter  of  2005  as  increased
volumes in the third quarter of 2005 resulted in corresponding higher operating costs.  On a boe basis, however,
lease operating costs were only 12% higher.  Also contributing to the higher costs in the third quarter of 2005 was a
plant turnaround conducted at the third-party operated Siphon facility during the summer. Our lease operating costs
on a per boe basis compare favorably with our competition.
For the nine month periods ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, lease operating costs increased by 46% year-
over-year, due mainly to the conversion of Kotaneelee from a carried to a working interest in the 2004 comparative
period.  Prior to the conversion, operating costs from Kotaneelee were recorded as a reduction of carried interest
revenues as opposed to operating costs.  On a boe basis, lease operating costs dropped 8% from last year, also
largely due to the conversion of Kotaneelee to a working interest, where the operating costs averaged $3.17/boe
for the first nine months of 2005.

Transportation costs for the three months ended September 30, 2005 rose to $732,000, compared to $210,000 for
the comparable period in 2004 due mainly to the increased volumes subject to transportation with the addition of
the Kotaneelee L-38 well in May 2005.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, transportation costs were $1.6 million and $350,000
respectively.  These  costs  result  almost  entirely  from  the  transportation  of  our  gas  at  Kotaneelee  and  have
increased due to commencement of production of the L-38 well during the second quarter of 2005.  In addition to
that shown in the 2004 comparative above, transportation costs of $286,000 were also expended in the nine month
period; however they were included as a reduction of carried interest revenues for financial statement purposes.
 As we continue to take more of our gas production in kind, we expect to record the appropriate amounts of related
transportation expenses.
For gas, we consider transportation to include all downstream costs commencing from the point that it is transferred
to a transmission system for delivery to the ultimate sales point.  As a result, transportation costs may also include
certain processing costs at third party extraction and acid gas processing plants.

Interest  and  other  income  decreased  20%  in  the  third  quarter  of  2005  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2004,
resulting from a lower cash balance available for investment.
For  the  nine  month  period,  interest  and  other  income  decreased  40%  from  2004,  the  majority  of  the  decrease
relating to a $300,000 settlement that occurred in the second quarter of 2004.  During 2005, our average monthly
balance of funds available for investment was lower as compared to the previous year.  This was somewhat offset
by slightly higher yields this year versus last year.

General and administrative costs were 22% higher in the third quarter of this year when compared to the same
period  last  year  due  mainly  to  retaining  a  stronger  technical  team  and  the  related  higher  salary  expenses  and
geological support costs.  These were somewhat offset by lower directors fees and insurance costs.  Legal fees
were down substantially quarter-over-quarter as considerable legal expense was incurred in 2004 to prepare the
update of corporate governance voted on by our shareholders at the meetings held in November and December
2004.  On a boe basis, total general and administrative costs were 25% lower in the third quarter this year as
compared with the respective period in 2004.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, general and administrative costs were on par with those of last
year  and  legal  expenses  were  62%  lower  this  year  due  to  the  corporate  governance  update  mentioned  in  the
preceding paragraph.  Overall, on a boe basis, total general and administrative expenses were 8% lower this year
to date in comparison to last year.
In the coming quarters, we expect to incur significant administrative, auditing and legal expenses with respect to
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Act”), the requirements of which are to document, test and audit our internal
controls to comply with Section 404 of the Act, and rules adopted thereunder, that are anticipated to apply to us for
the first time with respect to our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2006.
No general and administrative expenses were capitalized during the nine months of 2005 and 2004.

Depletion and depreciation expense increased 190% in the third quarter of 2005 from the same period of 2004.
 For the nine month period ended September 30, 2005, depletion and depreciation more than doubled to $5.1
million  compared  to  the  first  nine  months  of  2004.    This  increase  is  mainly  a  result  of  the  increased  capital
expenditures  during  the  year  and  the  commencement  of  inclusion  of  Kotaneelee  L-38  capital  costs  in  the
depletable base.
All  costs  incurred  in  drilling,  completing  and  equipping  the  Kotaneelee  L-38  well  that  commenced  drilling  on
August 22, 2004 have been capitalized.  As the well represented a major development project and represented a
large portion the net book value of capital assets, prior inclusion of these amounts for depletion purposes would
not  have  represented  a  fair  matching  of  revenues  with  expenses.    The  L-38  well  was  tied  in  and  commenced
production on May 4, 2005.  An independent qualified reserve evaluator estimated the amount of reserve additions
attributable to this well during the second quarter of 2005.  The well’s cumulative costs of $12.7 million and reserve
additions were included for the first time in the computation of depletion during that quarter.
In the third quarter of 2005, reserve additions totaling 0.7 bcf for the two Mike/Hazel wells and one of two third-party
wells drilled at Buick Creek, all drilled in the winter of 2004/2005, have been included in the depletion calculation.
 These additions were partially offset by a downward revision to the Kotaneelee reserves of 0.4 bcf due to the
significant decline in production from the Kotaneelee I-48 well and, to a lesser degree, the B-38 well.  This brings
the total net reserve additions for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 to 4.2 bcf (702 mboe), or a 56%
increase over the proven reserves of 1,238 mboe (before current year production) as at December 31, 2004.
Asset Retirement Obligations Accretion
Asset retirement obligations accretion expense for the third quarter of 2005 increased to $72,000 from $60,000 in
the comparative 2004 period.  Asset retirement obligations accretion expense for the nine month periods ended
September 30 was $205,000 in 2005 versus $180,000 in 2004.  The increase in expense relates to the inclusion of
estimated retirement costs for the Kotaneelee L-38 well and the new wells at Mike/Hazel and Buick Creek.
Stock-based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense for the third quarter ended September 30, 2005 was $187,000, compared to
$230,000  for  the  same  period  in  2004.    For  the  nine  month  periods  ended  September  30,  stock  based
compensation  expense  decreased  from  $497,000  in  2004  to  $410,000  in  2005.    The  decrease  is  due  to  the
number, timing and vesting of stock options granted in the relative periods.
Foreign Exchange
A foreign exchange loss of $95,000 was recorded in the third quarter of 2005, compared to a loss of $105,000 in
the 2004 comparative, nullifying the gains recorded during the previous six months of 2005 and 2004.  Losses for
the nine month periods were $58,000 and $10,000 for 2005 and 2004, respectively.  With the relative volatility
between the U.S and Canadian dollar, we expect to record further foreign exchange gains or losses in the future,
but  cannot  predict  either  with  reasonable  certainty.    The  value  of  the  Canadian  dollar  was  U.S.  $.8303  at
December 31, 2004 compared to U.S. $.8538 at September 30, 2005.
Income Taxes
The income tax provision for the third quarter ended September 30 decreased from $503,000 in 2004 to $475,000
in 2005.  An income tax recovery of $474,000 was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 as
opposed  to  $1.7  million  of  expense  in  the  2004  comparative  period,  due  mainly  to  the  one-time  recognition  of
benefits realized from re-filing our tax returns.  The recovery of current income taxes stems mainly from the one-
time recognition of a Notice of Reassessment from Canada Revenue Agency received during the second quarter
of 2005.  The $1.1 million of current taxes recovered as a result of the Notice of Assessment is higher than the
$850,000 that we estimated in the subsequent event note disclosure in our financial statements for the year ended
December  31,  2004.      In  2003,  we  re-filed  tax  returns  for  the  taxation  years  of  1994  to  2002  inclusive,  which
resulted in a Canada Revenue Agency audit and ultimately the recovery of current income taxes.
In addition, we also recorded a one-time recovery of income tax of approximately $90,000 from successor tax pools
previously thought to be unusable.  A valuation allowance on these pools was previously recorded.  However,
these pools were fully utilized in the second quarter of 2005, and as a result, the Company no longer has any
valuation allowance on any of its tax pools.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We recognize the need for a strong balance sheet in order to withstand volatile natural gas prices and to be able to
capitalize  on  opportunities  when  they  become  available.    At  September  30,  2005,  we  had  no  bank  debt  and
approximately $24 million ($1.63 per share) of cash and cash equivalents.  These funds are expected to be used
for oil and gas exploration and development activities and for general corporate purposes.
Net cash flow provided from operating activities during the first nine months of 2005 was $6.8 million compared to
cash flow used in operating activities of $3.5 million during the comparable period in 2004.

Our  current  cash  flow  from  oil  and  gas  operations  is  mainly  derived  from  the  Kotaneelee  field.    Net  field  level
receipts from Kotaneelee represented approximately 69% of our total net field receipts for the nine months ended
September 30, 2005, compared to 66% in the same period of 2004.
The continuing production declines experienced at the older two wells in Kotaneelee remain a significant concern
to us.  Notwithstanding that the recently drilled L-38 well has continued to produce with little water at a steady
gross  production  rate  of  17  mmcf/d  during  its  first  six  months,  the  field  continues  to  experience  a  decrease  in
reservoir pressure, which decreases the ability of the older wells to lift water, and results in a decrease in gas
production.
In early October 2005, Kotaneelee I-48 was producing at a rate of approximately 10% of those rates averaged
during the second quarter of 2005.  It appears  that  both  the  I-48  and  B-38  wells  may  be  capable  of  continued
production for a very limited period of time unless they can be successfully remediated.  Although there are no
current  plans  for  remediation  at  B-38,  we  are  in  discussions  with  the  operator  to  determine  possible  economic
remediation alternatives for the I-48 well.  There are no assurances that the operator will be able to remediate the
decline in I-48 production.   There is a possibility that our cash flow from Kotaneelee could be significantly reduced
at any time in the future.
In  an  effort  to  address  the  risks  associated  with  our  dependence  on  Kotaneelee  production,  we  have  directed
considerable resources toward other areas with the objective of diversifying our cash flow, production, and proven
reserve base.  This includes evaluating and acquiring new mineral leases in areas of interest, acquisition of either
trade or proprietary 2-D and 3-D seismic and evaluating certain asset and corporate acquisitions.  Given the high
cost of acquisitions and their related reserves in current market conditions, we have concentrated our attention on
reserves growth through exploration and production.
The  oil  and  gas  business  is  inherently  risky  and  capital  intensive  and  can  require  significant  capital  and  cash
resources to expand and develop the business.
Our northeast British Columbia properties are not as risky as Kotaneelee, but cannot be considered low risk due to
depth of drilling, limited period of access to surface locations, and related costs.
We drilled two Company-operated wells in the Mike/Hazel area of northeast British Columbia during the winter
2004/2005 drilling/construction season.  The cost to drill, complete and test the A-19-L and A-81-H wells were
approximately  $5.9  million  and  $2.6  million  respectively.    We  are  currently  in  the  process  of  surveying  and
permitting the revised pipeline right of ways to tie in these gas wells during the winter of 2005/2006.  We expect
these wells to come on production and add cash flow to the Company during the first quarter of 2006.
Late in the third quarter of 2005, we commenced drilling two wells in northeast British Columbia.  We hope to drill
up to three more locations this upcoming winter season, pending availability of equipment.
During  the  three  and  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2005,  we  expended  $5.8  million  and  $20.7  million
respectively on capital additions, as summarized below:

The potential for significant cost overruns exists in the oil and gas industry, especially in areas where access to the
property is remote.  A recent summary of the risk of cost overruns is as follows:
In 2004, we agreed to participate in the drilling of the Kotaneelee L-38 well at an initial estimated cost of $16.7
million  (net  $5.1  million  our  share).    Due  in  part  to  the  technical  and  drilling  challenges  experienced  by  the
operator, actual gross costs were approximately $41 million ($12.6 million our share), all of which are reflected in
the financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2005.
Our initial 2005 capital expenditure budget of $16.5 million was increased to $23 million in the third quarter of 2005
to  evaluate  certain  additional  opportunities.    Capital  expenditures  incurred  through  September  30,  2005  were
$20.7 million, leaving $2.3 million of the budget remaining.  Additional expenditures expected to be incurred during
the winter 2005/2006 season, are estimated to be between $2.5 million to $5.6 million.  These expenditures will be
considered by the Board of Directors on a case by case basis.
We expect to rely on internally generated cash flows and current cash on hand to fund the remainder of our annual
capital expenditure program.

The term “BOE” may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 mcf/1 bbl is based

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Three and nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004
(in Canadian dollars)
(unaudited)
1.
Summary of significant accounting policies
Significant accounting policies and basis of presentation
The  accompanying  unaudited  interim  consolidated  financial  statements,  including  the  accounts  of  Canada
Southern Petroleum Ltd. (“Canada Southern” or “the Company”) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Canpet Inc.
and C.S. Petroleum Limited, have been prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting
principles (“Canadian GAAP”).  These financial statements have been prepared following the same accounting
policies and methods of computation as the annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December  31,  2004.    The  effect  of  differences  between  these  principles  and  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) is discussed in Note 9.  Certain information and disclosures normally
required  to  be  included  in  the  notes  to  the  annual  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  omitted  or
condensed.    These  interim  financial  statements  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  consolidated  financial
statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s annual report for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Comparative figures
Certain  figures  presented  for  comparative  purposes  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  the  current  period’s
financial statement presentation.
Transportation costs
Effective  January  1,  2005,  and  consistent  with  the  adoption  of  Canadian  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants
Handbook Section 1100, “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”, transportation costs are presented as an
expense in the Statement of Operations and Retained Earnings.  For the period January 1, 2004 to April 30, 2004,
when the Company was in a carried interest position at Kotaneelee, transportation costs of $263,841 are shown
net of carried interest revenues and have not been reclassified.
2.
Cash and cash equivalents
Canada Southern considers all highly liquid short-term investments with maturities of three months or less at date
of acquisition to be cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates market value due
to their short term nature.
Cash
Canadian marketable securities (yield: 2005 - 2.8%; 2004 -

interest rates ranging from 7% to 11%.  These payments are expected to be incurred between the years 2005 and
2024.

The shares outstanding throughout 2004 and up until March 2, 2005 were limited voting shares with $1.00 par
value per share.  Pursuant to special shareholders meetings held in late 2004, Canada Southern received final
approval  of  the  continuance  of  the  Company  from  Nova  Scotia  to  Alberta  on  March  2,  2005.    As  a  result,  the
outstanding limited voting shares became common shares on a 1 for 1 basis.  Also pursuant to the continuance,
Canada Southern is authorized to issue two series of preferred shares.
Stock options
Under the terms of Canada Southern’s 1985, 1992 and 1998 stock option plans, Canada Southern is authorized to
grant options to purchase common shares at prices based on the market price of the shares as determined on the
date of the grant.  The options are normally issued for a period of five years from the date of grant.

The  fair  value  for  stock  options  granted  is  estimated  at  the  date  of  grant  using  a  Black-Scholes  option  pricing
model.  Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock
price volatility. A summary of the weighted average assumptions used and the resulting values for options granted
in the first nine months of 2005 is as follows:

(a)
Stock-based compensation
For  U.S.  GAAP  reporting  purposes,  Canada  Southern  elected  to  adopt  the  fair  value  expense  recognition
provisions  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  (FAS)  123  “Accounting  for  Stock-based  Compensation”  and  has
reported using the modified prospective method.  This method provides prospective expense recognition for all
new  awards  and  the  unvested  portion  of  awards  granted  subsequent  to  January  1,  1995.    As  a  result,  the
cumulative effects of stock option grants from 1995 to January 1, 2004 were recorded as an opening adjustment to
retained earnings and shareholders equity as at January 1, 2004.  This is in contrast to Canadian GAAP where
prior periods were restated.
(b)
Other comprehensive income
Classifications  within  other  comprehensive  income  relate  to  unrealized  gains  on  certain  investments  in  equity
securities.  During 1998, the Company wrote down the value of its interest in the Tapia Canyon, California heavy
oil project to a nominal value.  During August 1999, the project was sold and the Company received shares of
stock in the purchaser. The purchaser has become a public company (Sefton Resources, Inc), which is listed on
the London Stock Exchange (trading symbol “SER”).  At September 30, 2005, the Company owned approximately
0.6%  (December  31,  2004  –  0.6%)  of  Sefton  Resources,  Inc.  (“Sefton”)  with  a  fair  market  value  of  $78,223
(December 31, 2004 - $87,936) and a carrying value of $1.00.
Under U.S. GAAP, the Sefton shares would be classified as available-for-sale securities and recorded at fair value
at September 30, 2005.  This would result in other comprehensive income for the three and nine month periods
ended September 30, 2005 and 2004.  In addition, the balance sheet would reflect Marketable Securities in the
amount of $78,223 (December 31, 2004 - $87,936) with a corresponding credit of $80,360 (December 31, 2004 -
$86,843) to Shareholders’ Equity – Accumulated other comprehensive income.  The difference is an adjustment to
Future income tax liability of $2,137 (December 31, 2004 – ($1,093)).
