<p>international humanitarian law, and acts of violence that foment sectarian tensions, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing its deepest concern</i> about the findings of the Independent International

</p>
<p>certain evidence with regard to torture and execution of persons incarcerated by the current 
</p>

<p><i>Welcoming</i> the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Syrian

</p>
<p>the formation of a transitional governing body with full executive powers, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the statements made by the Commission of Inquiry and the special 
</p>
<p>procedures of the Human Rights Council that crimes against humanity and war crimes are

<p>likely to have been committed in the Syrian Arab Republic, and noting the repeated 
</p>
<p>encouragement by the Commission to the Security Council to refer the situation to the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court,

</p>
<p>investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law since March 2011 in the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic, to establish the facts and circumstances that may amount to such 
</p>
<p>violations and of the crimes perpetrated and, where possible, to identify those responsible

</p>
<p>crimes against humanity, are held accountable; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Requests</i> the Commission of Inquiry to provide an oral update during an 
</p>

</p>
<p>2000 and 2122 (2013) of 18 October 2013, and encourages the Special Envoy of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General for the Syrian Arab Republic to conduct consultations with a broad range 
</p>
<p>of actors, including women-led organizations; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Strongly condemns</i> the continuing escalation of violence in the Syrian Arab 
</p>

</p>
<p>widespread and systematic gross violations and abuses of human rights and violations of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law, including those involving the continued use of heavy 
</p>
<p>weapons and aerial bombardments, such as the indiscriminate use of ballistic missiles, 
</p>
<p>cluster munitions, barrel and vacuum bombs and chlorine gas, and the starvation of 
</p>
<p>civilians as a method of combat by the Syrian authorities against the Syrian population; 
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their 
</p>
<p>Destruction, the decision of the Executive Council of the Organization for the Prohibition

</p>

</p>
<p>violation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling 
</p>
<p>and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, and expresses its strong 
</p>
<p>conviction that those individuals responsible for the use of chemical weapons must be held 
</p>
<p>accountable, as stressed by the Security Council in its resolution 2118 (2013) and expressed 
</p>
<p>by the Executive Council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 
</p>
<p>its decision of 4 February 2015; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Expresses grave concern</i> at the use of force by the Syrian authorities against 
</p>
<p>civilians, which has caused immense human suffering and displacement, has fomented the 
</p>
<p>spread of extremism and extremist groups and has demonstrated the failure of the Syrian 
</p>
<p>authorities to protect the Syrian population and to implement the relevant resolutions and 
</p>
<p>decisions of the United Nations bodies; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Condemns in the strongest terms</i> the terrorist acts and violence committed 
</p>

</p>
<p>rights and violations of international humanitarian law, and reaffirms that terrorism,

</p>
<p>and should not be associated with any religion, nationality or civilization; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Strongly condemns</i> the intervention in the Syrian Arab Republic of all foreign 
</p>
<p>terrorist fighters and those foreign organizations fighting on behalf of the Syrian regime, 
</p>
<p>particularly militia groups such as Hizbullah, Asa&#8217;ib Ahl al-Haq and Liwa&#8217; Abu al-Fadl al-
Abbas, and expresses deep concern that their involvement further exacerbates the 
</p>

</p>
<p>humanitarian situation, which has a serious negative impact on the region; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Condemns </i>all violations and abuses of international human rights law and all 
</p>
<p>violations of international humanitarian law committed against the civilian population, calls </p>

</p>
<p>take all necessary steps to protect civilians, including by demilitarizing medical facilities

</p>
<p>international humanitarian law and to respect human rights;

</p>
<p>that crimes against humanity and war crimes have been and continue to be committed in the 
</p>
<p>territory of the Syrian Arab Republic; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Recalls </i>that the International Criminal Court was established to help to end 
</p>
<p>impunity for such crimes where the State is unwilling or unable to genuinely carry out 
</p>
<p>investigations or prosecutions; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Emphasizes</i> the need to ensure that all those responsible for violations of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law or violations and abuses of human rights law are held to 
</p>
<p>account through appropriate, fair and independent domestic or international criminal justice 
</p>
<p>mechanisms, and stresses the need to pursue practical steps towards this goal, noting the 
</p>
<p>important role that the International Criminal Court can play in this regard; </p>


<p>19. <i>Takes note </i>of the ongoing efforts by those journalists and human rights 
</p>

</p>
<p>of large-scale refugee populations in those countries; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Demands </i>that the Syrian authorities and all other parties to the conflict 
</p>
<p>comply with their obligations under Security Council resolutions 2139 (2014) of 22

<p>Republic and urges the international community, including all donors, to provide urgent
