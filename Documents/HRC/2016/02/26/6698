</b></p>
<p><b>6/&#8230;   Human rights and international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p><i> The</i> <i>Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/55 of 20 April 2005, and taking 
note of the report presented to the Council by the independent expert on human rights and 
international solidarity (A/HRC/4/8), </p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> that the processes of promoting and protecting human rights should be 
conducted in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations 
and international law, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in June 1993, States 
pledged to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to 
development, and stressed that the international community should promote effective 
international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination of 
obstacles to development,  </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that article 4 of the Declaration on the Right to Development states that 
sustained action is required to promote more rapid development of developing countries and, as a 
complement to the efforts of developing countries, effective international cooperation is essential 
in providing these countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive 
development, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking into account</i> that article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights states that each State party to the Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually 
and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the 
maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of 
the rights recognized in the Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the 
adoption of legislative measures, 
</p>
<p><i> Persuaded</i> that sustainable development can be promoted by peaceful coexistence, friendly 
relations and cooperation among States with different social, economic or political systems,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that the widening gap between the economically developed and developing 
countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human rights in the international 
community, and makes it all the more imperative for every nation, according to its capacities, 
to make the maximum possible effort to close this gap,  
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing concern</i> at the fact that the immense benefits resulting from the process of 
globalization and economic interdependence have not reached all countries, communities and 
individuals, and at the increasing marginalization from their benefits of several countries, 
particularly the least developed and the African countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its deep concern</i> over the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and 
agricultural pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in a massive 
loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and environmental consequences for 
vulnerable societies throughout the world, in particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the crucial importance of increasing the resources allocated for 
official development assistance, and recalling the pledge of the industrialized countries to </p>

 <p></p>
<p>allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance, and 
recognizing the need for new and additional resources to finance the development programmes 
of developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Determined</i> to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international community 
with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights endeavours by an increased and 
sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i> Asserting</i> the necessity for establishing new, equitable and global links of partnership and 
intra-generational solidarity, and for promoting inter-generational solidarity for the perpetuation 
of humankind, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity as a vital 
component of the efforts of developing countries towards the realization of the right to 
development of their peoples and the promotion of the full enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights by everyone has been insufficient, 
</p>
<p><i> Resolved</i> to strive to ensure that the present generations are fully aware of their 
responsibilities towards future generations, and that a better world is possible for the present and 
future generations, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the recognition set forth in the declaration adopted by the Heads of State 
and Government at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations of the fundamental value of 
solidarity to international relations in the twenty-first century, in stating that global challenges 
must be managed in a way that distributes costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with basic 
principles of equity and social justice, and that those who suffer, or who benefit least, deserve 
help from those who benefit most; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses its determination</i> to contribute towards the solution of current world 
problems through increased international cooperation, to create such conditions as will ensure 
that the needs and interests of future generations are not jeopardized by the burden of the past, 
and to hand on a better world to future generations; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> the international community to consider urgently concrete measures to 
promote and consolidate international assistance to developing countries in their endeavours for 
development and for the promotion of conditions that make possible the full realization of all 
human rights; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Recognizes</i> that the so-called &#8220;third-generation rights&#8221; closely interrelated to the 
fundamental value of solidarity need further progressive development within the United Nations 
human rights machinery in order to be able to respond to the increasing challenges of 
international cooperation in this field;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests </i>all States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations to mainstream the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity in their activities;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Decides</i>, taking into account the urgent need to further develop guidelines, standards, 
norms and principles with a view to promoting and protecting the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity, to request the independent expert on human rights and 
international solidarity to continue discharging his mandate, subject to the review of this 
mandate that will be accomplished by the Council in the near future; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests</i> the independent expert to continue his work in the preparation of a draft 
declaration on the right of peoples and individuals to international solidarity and to submit a 
report on the implementation of the present resolution at its ninth session (to be held in 
September 2008), unless otherwise be decided by the Council; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Also requests</i> the independent expert to take into account the outcomes of all major 
United Nations and other global summits and ministerial meetings in the economic and social 
fields and to seek views and contributions from Governments, United Nations agencies, other 
relevant international organizations and non-governmental organizations in the discharge of 
his/her mandate; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Decides</i> to continue its examination of this issue at its ninth session under the same 
agenda item.
