<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. From 30 January to 12 February 2012, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing 
as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-
discrimination in this context, Raquel Rolnik, undertook an official country visit to Israel 
and the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT). The purpose of the mission was to assess the 
situation of the right to housing within Israel and in the OPT.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur expresses her gratitude to the Government of Israel and the 
Palestinian National Authority for the invitation and the support provided for her mission. 
She also thanks the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory for its logistical support for her work.  
</p>
<p>3. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with officials and representatives of the 
Government of Israel and the Palestinian National Authority, international agencies and 
non-governmental organizations in Israel and in the OPT. In Israel, she visited Jerusalem, 
Tel Aviv, Jaffa, Haifa, Akko, Sderot, Be&#8216;er Sheva and different villages in the Negev and 
Galilee. In the OPT, she visited East Jerusalem, Ramallah, Bethlehem, Hebron, 
communities in the Jordan Valley and the Gaza Strip. In her visits to Israeli and Palestinian 
communities, she met with local residents and saw their housing conditions. The Special 
Rapporteur thanks all those who met with her and shared information for the preparation of 
the present report. She is particularly grateful to all those who received her in their homes 
and communities.  
</p>
<p>4. The report is divided into three sections. The first describes the main findings of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8216;s visit to Israel. The second section describes the findings relating to the 
OPT. The final section contains conclusions and recommendations.   
</p>
<p><b> II. Israel 
</b></p>
<p>5. Since the establishment of the State of Israel, adequate housing has been at the 
center of the Government strategy to absorb immigrants and refugees in order to establish a 
home for the Jewish community. Israel received successive immigration waves from 
different regions of the world and was relatively successful in quickly accommodating them 
in newly developed and expanded urban and rural areas. During the initial decades, the 
State acted as a major provider of public housing. However, since the 1980s&#8212;with a small 
interruption in the mid-1990s when approximately 500,000 families from the former Soviet 
Union immigrated to Israel&#8212;this approach has changed. Mortgage subsidies have reduced 
the direct public involvement in the housing sector. 
</p>
<p>6. The combination of subsidized mortgages policies with few rental options under an 
unregulated market has led to an exponential increase in housing prices. In 2011, large 
public demonstrations in Israeli cities underlined the public frustration with the rise in the 
cost of living, including the lack of alternatives for affordable housing, triggering a review 
of relevant laws and policies.   
</p>
<p>7. In addition to contributing to the affordability crisis that affects middle- and low-
income quintiles of the overall Israeli population, housing laws and policies appear to have 
continuously failed to protect and assist Palestinian citizens of Israel (minorities 
representing 20 per cent of the population, also referred to as &#8213;Arab Israelis&#8214;, which include 
Muslims, Christians, Druze and Bedouins). For example, tenure insecurity, overcrowding, 
evictions and demolitions are often reported among these groups.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. Israel is party to six core international human rights treaties, including, inter alia, the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p>9. Israel has no formal constitution, but has adopted a series of Basic Laws that 
guarantee a number of fundamental rights.1 The Basic Laws do not explicitly protect 
economic and social rights, such as the rights to adequate housing or access to water, which 
is an issue that has been the subject of ongoing public debate.2 Specifically, the right to 
adequate housing is not explicitly recognized in any Israeli law. Internal procedures of the 
Ministry of Construction and Housing are used to regulate the provision of public housing 
and housing assistance. Additionally, the Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty does not 
explicitly guarantee equality and the prohibition of discrimination.  
</p>
<p>10. The Basic Law: Israel Lands establishes the principle of national ownership of the 
land (sect. 1). Currently, 93 per cent of Israel lands are publicly owned and can only be 
leased, not sold. They are managed by the Israel Land Administration. The Israel Land 
Council, a body comprised of representatives of Government ministries and of the Jewish 
National Fund, determines the policy of the Israel Land Administration.3  
</p>
<p>11. Following the creation of the State of Israel a series of laws were adopted regarding 
ownership of land, regulating the acquisition and management of private land and 
amending previous laws, notably from the Ottoman and British mandate periods. A number 
of these laws, as described below, disproportionally affected the Palestinian population.4 
</p>
<p><b> B. Housing affordability and adequacy 
</b></p>
<p>12. The mass construction of public housing under the framework of a planned 
development strategy was fundamental to the relative success of Israel in absorbing the 
successive waves of Jewish immigration. In the late 1960s, 206,000 units of public housing 
were in place.5 Various housing schemes were associated with the creation and expansion 
of development towns and immigrant neighbourhoods, such as different packages of 
subsidies and infrastructure projects.  
</p>
<p>13. Over the initial decades, the State continued to play a central role in providing 
indirect support for home ownership, particularly through facilitating infrastructure for new 
residential developments and subsidized credit for home buyers. However, in the mid-

</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>1990s, a sharp policy shift took place, with a clear reduction of State involvement in 
providing housing support; the sale of public housing property; and an increasing emphasis 
on stimulus to enable private housing markets.  
</p>
<p>14. The strong emphasis on the promotion of home ownership through subsidized 
mortgages appears to have provoked a distortion in the housing market and contributed to a 
rise in inequality, as housing price increases have been disproportionally high for the 
poorest. For example, between 1993 and 1998, it was estimated that 44 per cent of 
households in Israel purchased a housing unit and the housing price index rose by 90 per 
cent. The price increase was faster and higher in the lower submarket range (88 per cent) 
than in the higher submarket range (51 per cent). For the lower wealth quintiles, the rise in 
housing prices led to an increase in household expenses for housing, while for the upper 
wealth quintiles it led to a decrease. The rise in real estate prices also seriously affected the 
rental market.6 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur met with various representatives of civil society involved in 
the 2011 demonstrations, who emphasized that adequate housing had become practically 
unaffordable for too many Israelis, especially for young people and marginalized groups. 
Moreover, they stated that in the few cases housing support options were available, those 
were located in remote areas offering limited work opportunities. The Special Rapporteur 
also met with Government officials who described initiatives to assess public policies and 
devise new strategies to improve access to adequate housing in response to the protesters. 
Authorities indicated that there were prospects of increased budget support, but emphasized 
that the limited expansion of housing was partially related to stringent planning rules. 
</p>
<p>16. The number of households in low-rent publicly owned dwellings has fallen 
dramatically over the last 10 years.7 The construction of new public housing units, except 
for the elderly, has all but stopped and the stock has shrunk to approximately 66,000 units,8 
mostly concentrated in the periphery and deprived areas. Moreover, in 1998, the 
Government started selling public apartments to long-time residents at discounted rates. 
The income generated through the sales was not used in the replenishment of the public 
housing stock (contradicting the law regulating this process).9 This reduction seriously 
affected the capacity to assist the poorest groups of the population.  
</p>
<p>17. In this context, rental assistance programmes become the main alternative for the 
low-income groups. However, public rental assistance initiatives have also been reduced 
and rent assistance values have not kept up with the drastic rise in rent prices. Moreover, 
private rental contracts are governed only by general legislation and offer almost no 
protection as regards legal security of tenure.10 
</p>
<p>18. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur was informed that development projects 
implemented through new public tenders often do not make provision for affordable or 
public housing. Furthermore, only in 2009 were the laws amended to obligate the allocation

<p>of portions of publicly tendered land to affordable housing, but this was allegedly not fully 
implemented.11  
</p>
<p>19. In response to some of these claims, Government authorities announced an increase 
in the support for rental assistance and additional initiatives to accelerate the development 
of residential units accessible to low-income groups.  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur also received complaints regarding inadequate alternatives 
to public housing, the lack of transparency in the selection process, and deficiencies in 
criteria for eligibility for housing support. The Organization for Economic Co-operation 
and Development also underlined the inadequacy of the various complex point systems 
used in public housing assignments and rent and mortgage support.12 The use of criteria 
such as number of years of marriage, number of children and number of years of military 
service seems to be ineffective in targeting the poorest groups and particularly reduces the 
eligibility of minorities, youth and single persons to obtain support.  
</p>
<p>21. The precarious housing situation of vulnerable groups excluded from all assistance 
schemes is an issue of grave concern that was also brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8216;s 
attention. In particular, she received information concerning asylum seekers and refugees 
who are denied work permits and access to health and other basic services and find 
themselves in a very precarious situation. According to the information received, many 
such persons are homeless for long periods or live in extremely precarious conditions. In a 
number of cases their health can be at risk, as they often lack warm clothing to protect them 
from the cold and suffer from poor nutrition.  
</p>
<p>22. Another element that appears to contribute to the inadequacy of housing support 
policies is a disregard for specific social and cultural patterns of different groups by 
planners. The strict land and planning regime appears to have produced not only the clear 
exclusion of Palestinian groups, as detailed below, but has also affected some Jewish 
groups. The distribution of migrant waves in peripheral areas of Israel and the adoption of 
Northern/Western models of urbanization seem to have contributed to the marginalization 
of non-Western Jewish groups, creating political and economic gaps between Ashkenazi 
Jewish communities and all other groups. Historically, for example, research has indicated 
that members of the Ashkenazi communities benefited from better valued proprieties and 
received more land per capita than Sephardim (Mizrahi)-dominated localities.13 
</p>
<p><b> C. Palestinian minorities in Israel 
</b></p>
<p>23. Concerns about the prevalent social economic exclusion of Palestinian minorities 
living in Israel and the persistence of discriminatory laws and practices have already been 
expressed by international human rights mechanisms.14 The persistence of these 
disadvantages over decades is reflected in recurrent reports on violations of the right to 
adequate housing of Palestinian minorities living in Israel.

<p> 14 See, for example, the concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination (CERD/C/ISR/CO/14-16) and of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights (E/C.12/ISR/CO/3).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>24. Throughout her visit to Galilee, the Negev (the situation of Bedouins is addressed 
below) and Jaffa and in meetings in Tel Aviv, the Special Rapporteur was informed about 
expropriation of Palestinian lands; inadequate city planning and non-issuance of 
construction permits, often leading to irregular construction and, in some cases, to eviction 
and demolition orders due to an absence of construction permits; inadequate financial 
allocations to address the housing needs of minorities in Israel; and the failure to adopt 
targeted and culturally adequate solutions to assist minorities.    
</p>
<p>25. The control by the State of 93 per cent of the land in Israel (achieved in part through 
the expropriation and acquisition of lands originally owned by displaced Palestinians) 
deeply affected the capacity of Palestinian communities living inside Israel to develop or 
expand.15 The official role of Jewish organizations, such as the Jewish National Fund and 
the Jewish Agency, in the formal system of planning and development of Israel contributed 
further to the exclusion of all non-Jewish groups, who were often unable to directly benefit 
from development initiatives carried out by these agents.  
</p>
<p>26. The contrast between the effectiveness of planners in establishing new Jewish cities 
and villages and their failure in promoting the expansion or development of Palestinian 
areas is therefore stark: it is reported that since 1948, the State has established more than 
700 new Jewish communities and not a single minority community (excepting towns 
established for promoting the forced urbanization of Bedouins).16  
</p>
<p>27. As indicated by various studies, not only have no new localities been developed to 
accommodate non-Jewish citizens, but a significant number of villages hosting Palestinian 
minorities remain unplanned or have outdated master plans. As all construction, including 
for the expansion of existing homes, requires a permit to build that is granted only after 
planning is concluded, the absence of planning often implies the prohibition of further 
construction to accommodate the natural growth of populations.  
</p>
<p>28. In this sense, decades of limited or inadequate planning has resulted in the 
proliferation of irregular constructions in communities hosting Palestinian minorities inside 
Israel. This places many minority families under great pressure, as building without a 
permit constitutes a criminal offence and structures built irregularly are often designated for 
demolition.  
</p>
<p>29. In Galilee, for example, the Special Rapporteur visited the village of Majd el-Krum, 
where residents informed her that despite the population having almost tripled over the last 
three decades, no expansion of the city municipal boundary had been authorized. In this 
context, most families had built and expanded housing units without official authorization. 
Some have had their newly built units demolished, while others have received demolition 
orders. Residents were particularly frustrated as many owned land in areas outside the 
existing municipal boundary where zoning restrictions had prohibited residential use. 
Residents pointed out that newer neighbouring villages with Jewish majorities enjoyed 
better infrastructure and had expanded over the same period of time.  
</p>
<p>30. In the old city of Akko, Palestinian citizens of Israel who live as protected renters in 
areas under public custody informed the Special Rapporteur about the impact of the 
ongoing process of gentrification. Most property in the area is under the control of the 
Israel Land Administration, which was in the process of privatizing some areas and 
developing its touristic potential. Residents claimed they were not consulted in this 
planning process and informed the Special Rapporteur that they were unable to afford to

<p>buy the property they currently lived in or cover the costs required for the maintenance of 
the historic site; therefore they were placed under permanent threat of eviction. The Special 
Rapporteur observed the same phenomenon in Jaffa, where she visited another group of 
Palestinian residents under threat of eviction.   
</p>
<p>31. Uneven public budget allocations are also reported to further contribute to the 
deterioration of housing conditions of minorities. For example, an analysis of the Israeli 
State budget for 2012 showed that only 4 per cent of total allocations for city planning 
reached minority cities and that 99 per cent of the agriculture support was dedicated to 
Jewish farmers and associations.17 Half of all budget allocations to assist housing in 
minority localities are earmarked for the Negev, where the Government pursues a strategy 
of urbanization of rural Bedouins.18 
</p>
<p><b> D. Bedouin communities in the Negev 
</b></p>
<p>32. Among Palestinian minorities, Bedouin inhabiting the Negev face one of the most 
severe problems of inadequate housing conditions and insecurity of tenure within Israel.  
</p>
<p>33. Bedouins have had a presence in the region for hundreds of years.19 While their 
pastoral activities required travelling, their movements occurred around historic villages, 
privately owned plots and collective pasture lands. Estimates indicate that in 1948, prior to 
the creation of Israel, between 60,000 and 90,000 Bedouins inhabited the Negev.20 Since 
the 1948 war, the groups that remained have been progressively concentrated in the Siyag 
area in the eastern part of the Negev.21  
</p>
<p>34. Since 1948, Israel has refused to recognize the land ownership of most Bedouin 
groups or the existence of many Bedouin villages. Israel describes the areas occupied by 
Bedouins as &#8213;the Bedouin dispersal&#8214;, claiming that at least 40 per cent of the Bedouin 
communities live as squatters in &#8213;illegal homes&#8214; spread over State property.22 The 
Government also affirms that the rate of population growth of the Negev Bedouin is the 
highest in the world, which, together with their dispersion over an extensive area, prevents 
the State from offering public services.   
</p>
<p>35. Currently, about 180,000 Bedouins live in the Negev. For decades, the State has 
promoted the urbanization of this population in planned cities, resulting in approximately 
100,000 Bedouins inhabiting seven Government-planned cities. The remaining live either 
in one of the over 40 &#8213;unrecognized villages&#8214; or one of the 10 villages that were recently 
recognized by the State.23 Israel has indicated that it will continue to invest in the 
development of planned cities that could host Bedouin families that agree to abandon legal 
claims for territory and settle in those urban areas.

<p>36. During her mission, the Special Rapporteur was especially concerned to note the 
failure of the State to integrate the unrecognized villages, even those located in the outskirts 
of major urban areas. The unrecognized village of Assir, for example, has a population of 
about 2,300 living just outside the city of Be&#8216;er Sheva (the seventh largest city in Israel). 
While residents are counted in the city census, the village remains &#8213;illegal&#8214; for official 
purposes and has never been provided with basic public services or infrastructure, including 
water and sanitation connections. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur visited the unrecognized village of Al-Arakib and met with 
local residents who had received eviction orders and already had their homes and public 
buildings demolished on various occasions in previous years. The village leader presented 
evidence of the longstanding presence of his community in the area, including copies of 
documentation on land ownership dating from the Ottoman period. However, despite legal 
action taken by various civil society actors, demolitions are reportedly continuing.   
</p>
<p>38. On the other hand, the housing situation of Bedouin living in Government-planned 
towns is also a concern. The seven planned towns reportedly evolved into pockets of 
deprivation, unemployment, dependency, crime and social tension.24 Despite some State 
benefits, such as health care and child allowances, the precarious infrastructure and spatial 
isolation of these areas have greatly restricted opportunities for personal mobility or 
development, contributing to their impoverishment. The planned urban models, often 
inspired by Northern/Western cultural patterns, were also considered to be culturally 
inadequate vis-&#224;-vis the Bedouin family structure and their rural economic vocation, further 
contributing to the deterioration of the socioeconomic environment.  
</p>
<p>39. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur met also with Government authorities 
conducting consultations on a new State plan for the unrecognized villages in the Negev 
(known as the Prawer Plan). The plan was adopted in September 2012 and the Government 
is currently discussing a legislative proposal to implement it.  
</p>
<p>40. Serious reservations to the Prawer Plan and the proposed legislation for its 
implementation were expressed by representatives of the Bedouin community, who 
indicated, for example, that: (a) the plan still does not recognize the right of the Bedouin to 
ownership of their ancestral land; (b) it would legitimize the displacement, dispossession 
and eviction of residents in various unrecognized villages; (c) it proposes insufficient and 
inadequate compensation; and (d) it would strip courts of their power of judicial review and 
possibility to intervene or protect citizens from unfair State land and planning measures. 
Civil society also presented an alternative proposal, with indications on how to regularize 
all unrecognized villages and better integrate them into the existing local infrastructure.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur notes that Bedouin communities, who self-identify and have 
also been recognized as indigenous peoples by international human rights mechanisms, 
present both in Israel and the OPT enjoy land claims based on longstanding land use and 
occupancy linked to their traditional livelihoods and distinct cultural identity. These claims 
must be respected by the State, as affirmed by many international human rights bodies and 
mechanisms.25

<p><b> III. Occupied Palestinian Territory  
</b></p>
<p>42. Over the last four plus decades of military occupation of the OPT, successive 
international reports and studies have underscored the pervasive human rights impact of the 
multiple restrictions placed on the expansion and development of Palestinian society. At the 
same time, the expanding presence of Israeli settlers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank 
have greatly altered the territory&#8216;s landscape, draining natural resources and fragmenting 
the connections between pre-existing urban areas. Having undergone almost total physical 
and political isolation for the last five years, Gaza has suffered an extreme deterioration of 
its socioeconomic environment&#8212;more so than any other area in the territory. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>43. Regarding the issue of the applicability of certain norms of international 
humanitarian law and human rights instruments in the OPT, the Special Rapporteur would 
like to refer to the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 9 July 2004,26 as 
well as, among others, the concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination,27 the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights28 and the 
Human Rights Committee.29  
</p>
<p>44. The obligations of Israel as occupying Power are defined by the pertinent provisions 
of humanitarian and customary international law, notably the Geneva Convention relative 
to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (Fourth Geneva Convention) and the 
Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land (Hague Regulations), 
which are recognized as part of customary international law. The Special Rapporteur notes 
that the same international legal framework is also applicable to East Jerusalem, which 
under international law is considered occupied territory.30 
</p>
<p>45. In the present context, it is particularly relevant to recall that the occupying Power 
must generally respect the laws in force in the occupied territory and is prohibited from 
destroying property except to the extent needed to maintain orderly governance of the 
territory and for military necessity.31 Additionally, humanitarian law prohibits, without 
exception, the transfer of the occupying Power&#8216;s own civilian population into the territory it 
occupies.32 
</p>
<p><b>  Administrative division of the occupied territory 
</b></p>
<p>46. In 1995, pursuant to the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip (Oslo Accords), a temporary administrative division of the West Bank into 
three zones, referred to as Areas A, B and C, was agreed upon in view of a phased transfer 
of power from Israeli military and civil administration to the Palestinian National

<p>Authority.33 Area A comprises the major<b> </b>Palestinian cities, and both security and civil 
responsibilities are under the Palestinian National Authority. Area B corresponds to most 
Palestinian rural communities, and civil authority is under the Palestinian National 
Authority while security is shared with the Israeli authorities. In Area C Israel retains 
authority over law enforcement and control over the building and planning sphere.34 Areas 
A and B make up roughly 38 per cent of the West Bank; Area C corresponds to 
approximately 62 percent of the West Bank.  
</p>
<p>47. The Oslo Accords (annex III, appendix 1, art. 27) specified the responsibilities of 
planning and zoning, which were eventually to be under the purview of the Palestinian 
National Authority. Although the Interim Agreement foresaw a gradual transfer of power 
and responsibility in the sphere of planning and zoning in Area C from the Israeli civil 
administration to the Palestinian National Authority, this transfer was frozen in 2000.35   
</p>
<p>48. In Area C of the West Bank, Jordanian planning law, as modified by an Israeli 
military order, is applied.36 In East Jerusalem, Israeli planning laws have been applied since 
the unilateral annexation of the area and the expansion of its municipal boundaries in 1967.  
</p>
<p>49. In Gaza and in Areas A and B of the West Bank, with regards to planning, Jordanian 
laws as modified by the laws adopted by the Palestinian National Authority are generally 
applied. Additionally, it is noteworthy that the Palestinian National Authority has adopted 
the Amended Basic Law of 18 March 2003, which protects the right to property, specifying 
that property &#8213;may not be expropriated except in the public interest and for fair 
</p>
<p>compensation in accordance with the law or pursuant to a judicial ruling&#8214; (art. 21, para. 3). 
It also protects the right to housing and determines that &#8213;every citizen shall have the right to 
proper housing. The Palestinian National Authority shall secure housing for those who are 
without shelter&#8214; (art. 23). 
</p>
<p><b> B. East Jerusalem  
</b></p>
<p>50. In East Jerusalem, the Special Rapporteur received multiple complaints on issues 
concerning the Palestinian population, including discriminatory planning, limited access to 
public services, evictions and house demolitions. Municipal planning procedures appear to 
disproportionately restrict the expansion and consolidation of Palestinian neighborhoods in 
the city, while Israeli settlements have proliferated.  
</p>
<p>51. The Local Outline Plan&#8211;Jerusalem 2000, although not finalized or officially 
approved, is the master plan setting out the municipality&#8216;s strategies up to 2020. This plan 
is the first to include both East and West Jerusalem. While it includes questions of planning 
and development in the Palestinian neighborhoods of the city, the Local Outline Plan does 
not plan for enough housing units in the Palestinian areas to sufficiently address current 
shortfalls or accommodate the projected growth in population. Further, the master plan 
identifies &#8213;Maintaining a solid Jewish majority in the city&#8214; as one of its main aims and adds

<p>5 square kilometres for the expansion of Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem.37 This policy 
of &#8213;demographic balance&#8214;, a stated aim of official municipal planning documents, is 
</p>
<p>discriminatory and thus violates human rights law (see CERD/C/ISR/CO/14-16, para. 25). 
</p>
<p>52. In addition, it was reported that municipal planning processes lacked transparency 
and community consultation.38 In discussions with the Special Rapporteur, Israeli 
authorities claimed that participation of the Palestinian community was limited because 
they refused to engage in existing mechanisms as they consider participation would amount 
to the recognition of the illegal annexation of East Jerusalem by Israel.  
</p>
<p>53. The situation of the community of Al-Bustan illustrates the challenges posed by 
planning procedures, even when Palestinian communities attempt to engage with the 
authorities. There, 750 residents living in 88 homes, some of them predating 1967, are 
reportedly at risk of being displaced due to a plan by the Municipality of Jerusalem to turn 
the area into an archaeological park. The Special Rapporteur visited families in Al-Bustan 
that are being targeted by criminal and civil legal action. She was also shown an alternative 
urbanization plan prepared by the local leadership and told that that the alternative plan was 
dismissed by all competent authorities and that they had already exhausted all possible legal 
mechanisms to challenge the adoption and implementation of the plans of the municipality. 
</p>
<p>54. Currently, tens of thousands of Palestinians in East Jerusalem and throughout the 
OPT are estimated to be at risk of their homes being demolished due to unregulated 
building.39 As the overall number of permits issued is grossly inadequate to meet the 
housing needs of Palestinians, many Palestinians have built without obtaining a permit. As 
a result, numerous homes or extensions to homes are considered illegal and thus the 
inhabitants are in danger of being subjected to eviction orders and the demolition of their 
houses. Although persons faced with an eviction can institute court proceedings to protect 
their legal rights, such proceedings have very little chance of success and were perceived as 
serving mainly to delay the eviction and demolition process. 
</p>
<p>55. On the first day of her mission, the Special Rapporteur visited precarious housing 
units that had been demolished that same morning in East Jerusalem. Throughout the 
occupied territory, eviction and demolitions often appear to be undertaken without 
provision for relief and relocation. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur also received information regarding deficiencies in basic 
infrastructure in East Jerusalem. The situation on the ground is characterized by a visible 
neglect of services and infrastructure, including deficient sanitation services and dilapidated 
sewage and drainage infrastructure.40 Approximately 53 per cent of the Palestinian residents 
have no suitable legal connection to water networks.41 According to an internal Jerusalem

<p>government report, 2 billion new sheqalim (NIS) would be required to bring the quality of 
the sewage infrastructure of East Jerusalem to the level existing in the west of the city.42  
</p>
<p>57. When asked by the Special Rapporteur about the reason for these deficiencies, 
municipal authorities alleged that adequate allocations were made to service Palestinian 
neighborhoods, but service provision was hampered by the hostility of the local population 
towards municipal service providers. 
</p>
<p>58. Another issue of concern is the situation of members of Palestinian communities of 
East Jerusalem who, due to the construction of the barrier, found themselves on the &#8213;West 
Bank side&#8214; of the barrier, although they are located within the boundaries of the 
municipality of Jerusalem. These communities, such as the Shuafat refugee camp, Dahiyat 
al-Barid, Ras Khamis and Kfar Aqab&#8212;which the Special Rapporteur visited&#8212;have been 
cut off from the municipality. Although they continue to pay municipal taxes, they no 
longer have access to the basic services to which they are entitled as Jerusalem residents 
(health care, education, etc.) and face increasing difficulties gaining access to Jerusalem, 
leading to ever-declining living conditions. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur also visited areas affected by the barrier in the West Bank. 
In the village of Al-Walaja, for example, the construction of the barrier will completely 
encircle the city, which would be connected to the rest of the West Bank by a tunnel. 
Residents explained that the construction of the barrier combined with the expansion of 
neighbouring settlements would also completely isolate the community from its agriculture 
land.  
</p>
<p><b> C. West Bank 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Areas A and B 
</b></p>
<p>60. The administrative and physical fragmentation of the West Bank into three different 
areas severely hampers planning and the implementation of housing and urban policies at 
the local and regional levels.  
</p>
<p>61. In both Areas A and B of the West Bank, planning and building powers rest with the 
Palestinian National Authority.43 However, as outlined above, the partial implementation of 
the Oslo Accords left the major portion of the non-urban areas of the West Bank, known as 
Area C, under Israeli control. Thus, local authorities in areas A and B have limited 
possibilities with respect to expanding urban areas, promoting inter-municipal integration 
and improving the connection of urban areas under their control with all surrounding areas, 
which hampers their ability to better respond to growing housing demands. The Palestinian 
National Authority also reported facing particular difficulties in providing adequate water 
and sanitation due to irregular access to water sources controlled by Israel, depleted 
infrastructure and the lack of space for waste management and disposal.  
</p>
<p>62. The Palestinian National Development Plan (2011-13) prioritizes the goals of 
increasing home ownership and addressing the housing needs of a growing population. The 
Strategic Plan for the Housing Sector (2011-2013)44 was presented by authorities to the

<p>Special Rapporteur but she was informed it was still pending comprehensive 
implementation. The Plan highlights that the housing deficit in West Bank and Gaza (to 
2010) was estimated by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics to be about 132,759 
residential units. It identifies the Israeli occupation and the destruction of homes as 
challenges for the housing sector, but also lists multiple additional internal problems. These 
include: lack of monitoring capacity, weakness of the judicial authority in dealing with 
housing and real-estate disputes, the absence of a database on housing, lack of planning and 
zoning mechanisms and the absence of official budget lines for investment in the housing 
sector and the absence of a semi-public institution. The plan also indicates several 
initiatives to be further developed and pursued, including revising and reforming laws 
regulating the housing sector, investing in public and private partnerships, promoting public 
and private investment in housing and developing housing policies for people with low 
income.  
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of the strategy, but expresses her 
serious concern regarding the lack of implementation. Given the serious impact of poverty 
among Palestinian communities, the Special Rapporteur was particularly concerned by the 
absence of any further strategy to promote access to land and housing for low-income 
families, or to upgrade the living conditions, including in Palestinian refugee camps. 
</p>
<p>64. On other hand, the Special Rapporteur also visited the Rawabi town construction 
project45 near Ramallah and Bir Zeit, including a large residential housing construction 
project undertaken through a public-private partnership supported by international aid and a 
private investor.46 A master plan has been drawn up for the residential and commercial 
urban development, including 5,000 housing units for middle-income persons that will 
house 25,000 residents.47 Given the already described serious resource limitations of the 
Palestinian National Authority to fulfil its mandate, the Special Rapporteur was concerned 
to note that international donors and local authorities had decided to focus important public 
investments in a project targeted mostly at high and middle-income persons, without 
including any affordable housing for the numerous communities living in inadequate 
conditions. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Area C 
</b></p>
<p>65. It is estimated that some 150,000 Palestinians live in Area C, including 27,500 
Bedouin and other herders,48 two thirds of whom live in localities which are partly located 
in Areas A and B. According to the information received, since the occupation in 1967 the 
land made available to Palestinian communities living in Area C has been dramatically 
restricted through a variety of means.  
</p>
<p>66. Planning and all decisions on construction permit requests by Palestinians in Area C 
are made by the Civil Administration&#8216;s Higher Planning Council, comprised exclusively of

<p>Israeli officials.49 Modifications to Jordanian law introduced by Israel in 1971 eliminated 
Palestinian community participation in the zoning of Area C.50 Palestinian community 
members retained the possibility of presenting objections to a plan, although this is 
extremely limited in cases of plans for settlements, as will be seen below.51 
</p>
<p>67. Two types of plans can be applied to Palestinian villages in Area C: Special Partial 
Outline Plans prepared by the Israeli civil administration and the Regional Outline Plans 
from the British Mandate period.52 Special Partial Outline Plans cover less than 1 per cent 
of Area C land; that land, in practice, is the only part of Area C where Palestinian 
construction is allowed and much of the area is built up already. Israeli special plans have 
been approved only for Palestinian communities&#8212;no Israeli settlement has a special plan.53 
Mandatory Regional Outline Plans are applied to those villages without Israeli special 
plans. Approved by the British Mandate government of Palestine in the 1940s, such plans 
designate most of Area C as an agricultural zone, and are no longer adequate to deal with 
current Palestinian planning needs.54  
</p>
<p>68. About 70 per cent of Area C has been allocated for Israeli settlements, military 
zones, nature reserves, &#8213;State land&#8214; and the Seam Zone around the barrier, so possibilities 
for Palestinians to build are restricted.55 In practice, as Palestinian construction is only 
permitted in approximately 1 per cent of Area C56 many residents are forced to build 
without a permit to meet their housing needs, putting these persons at risk of home 
demolition and displacement. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur received information which indicated an increase in the 
number of demolitions of Palestinian constructions. It was reported that in 2011, a total of 
622 Palestinian structures were demolished by Israeli authorities, resulting in 1,094 people 
displaced, almost double the number for 2010. Between January and June of 2012, 351 
demolitions were carried out in Area C, further displacing 615 persons (330 of them 
children) and affecting over 1900 individuals.57 The first half of 2012 saw a 20 per cent 
increase in the monthly average number of demolitions in the West Bank when compared 
to the same period in 2011, and a 70 per cent increase compared to 2010.58 
</p>
<p>70. Another issue brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8216;s attention is the restriction on 
movement and access to water, land and basic services. The effect of such measures is 
particularly severe in the herding communities, such as the Bedouin, which are often 
located in remote areas, causing their displacement. Destruction of water infrastructure also 
causes displacement in Area C, where Israeli forces regularly take over or target for 
destruction cisterns, wells and springs used by Palestinians59 or confiscate water tanks.60

<p>71. The Special Rapporteur visited the al-Jahalin Bedouin community of Khan al-
Ahmar in Area C, which is under the direct control of the Israeli authorities. Having 
previously been subject to numerous demolitions, the community is now at risk of 
displacement as a whole, due to its location on what is considered public or State land.61 In 
the framework of an approved master plan ordering the expulsion of this community, an 
Israeli Civil Administration delegation visited the herding community in November 2011 to 
inform the people about their imminent transfer from the Ma&#8216;ale Adumim area.62 According 
to information received by the Special Rapporteur during her visit, this plan was prepared 
and approved without any consultation or participation of the affected community. The only 
school in the area, which was built by the community itself, is subject to a demolition order. 
Although during the time of the visit community leaders were told by authorities that this 
school would not be demolished in the near future, the demolition order had not yet been 
repealed.  
</p>
<p>72. In the Jordan valley, the Special Rapporteur also visited the Al-Hadidiya community 
and the village of Al-Aqaba. A re-zoning that transformed their living space and the 
surrounding areas into a dedicated military and settlement area resulted in these 
communities being deprived of indiscriminate access and full exercise of their in rem 
usufruct and use rights, for example, access to grazing lands and sources of water, with 
respect to related and nearby agricultural land&#8212;a situation that threatens their livelihoods. 
The settlers have closed off the land, leaving access only through a gate and allowing the 
community to enter only at certain hours and for short periods of time. The members of this 
community are living under extremely harsh conditions, with no access to the most basic 
services. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Settlement activity  
</b></p>
<p>73. Throughout her visit the Special Rapporteur heard numerous complaints of 
discriminatory treatment by Israel in the implementation of the right to adequate housing of 
the Palestinian community in the OPT, based, to a great extent, on the differential and 
privileged treatment that is allegedly accorded to settlers in the territory.

<p>74. The Special Rapporteur received information according to which: land with 
restrictions against use by Palestinians is made available for building and agricultural use 
by settlers; plans and planning processes involving settlers are, in practice, prepared with 
the participation of, and following meaningful consultation processes with, the settlers and 
approved within reasonable periods; the attribution, directly or indirectly, of substantial 
subsidies and incentives by the Government for settlers to build on and exploit the land in 
the OPT (and, particularly in the last few years, to expand existing settlements); the 
provision of ample infrastructure for the exclusive use of settlers, who are often living in 
areas close to Palestinians who have no access to the infrastructure and live in extremely 
difficult conditions.

<p>75. Additionally, it was alleged that, in stark contrast to the manner in which the 
authorities dealt with Palestinians found to be in contravention of building laws, illegal 
construction by settlers often leads to alternative solutions being sought and even, in some 
cases, the non-execution of eviction orders.  
</p>
<p>76. Settlement activities are ongoing, and the Government of Israel reportedly continues 
to plan for the expansion of settlements in the West Bank as well as East Jerusalem.63 While 
there have been individual decisions to dismantle some settlement &#8213;outposts&#8214;, others have 
been formalized and thus have become legalized under Israeli, if not international, law.  
</p>
<p>77. According to the information received, the nature of the support provided by the 
Government to the settlements has varied over the years, with a temporary freeze being 
imposed on some types in 2010. However, such changes do not seem to have had any 
impact in reducing the settler population in the OPT or halting expansion and construction. 
A recent report by the Secretary-General notes that plans for construction in settlements in 
East Jerusalem continue to be submitted and approved and that the settler population 
(excluding that of East Jerusalem) has over the past decade grown at an average yearly rate 
of 5.3 per cent, compared to 1.8 percent in the Israeli population as whole (A/67/375, 
para. 7). In a recent 12-month period alone the settler population increased by 15,579 
persons (ibid.).  
</p>
<p><b> 1. West Bank 
</b></p>
<p>78. As at 2008, there were 121 official settlements and 100 outposts in Area C. In 
contrast, no new Palestinian cities had been created since 1967.64  
</p>
<p>79. In Area C, while little zoning and planning has been carried out for Palestinian 
communities, the Israeli Civil Administration has developed and approved detailed plans 
for almost all Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and Israeli settlers are able to participate 
in the planning process. 
</p>
<p>80. The 1971 Israeli military order modifying the Jordanian planning law created a 
separate planning framework for settlements, implemented by a special category of 
planning committee (a &#8213;special local planning committee&#8214;) in practice reserved for 
</p>
<p>settlements.65 Unlike the Palestinian community, settlers effectively participate in the 
planning process, notably through the Settlement Subcommittee, which formulates plans 
for settlements. 
</p>
<p>81. Israeli Local or Regional Councils are the local authorities that run the settlements. 
Some 39 per cent of the West Bank is currently under the jurisdiction of such councils. 
Most of this territory is land that has been declared &#8213;State land&#8214;, and is not allocated for 
Palestinian use. Almost all of the area in the Jordan Valley and Dead Sea area falls under 
the jurisdiction of two Regional Councils.66 
</p>
<p>82. The settlements are provided with generous infrastructure, including water, 
electricity and roads that are, for the most part, unavailable to Palestinians. The Special 
Rapporteur also notes particularly that inequality in the amounts of water made available to 
the Israeli settlements and those made available to the Palestinian population was visible, 
since neighbouring settlements and villages had entirely different patterns of water supply.

</p>
<p>83. Settlement activity is also a regular source of violence and permanent tension. In 
Hebron, for example, the Special Rapporteur received testimonies from several persons of 
attacks by settlers on infrastructure, such as water tanks, and other violence against the 
Palestinian population. The heavy presence of soldiers in the heart of the city to protect the 
settlers contributes to a climate of fear and mistrust. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. East Jerusalem 
</b></p>
<p>84. Since 1967, Israel has confiscated approximately 35 per cent of the territory in East 
Jerusalem and its surrounding area and 12 settlements have been constructed on this land. 
These settlements are some of the largest, with some 200,000 inhabitants. Israel considers 
these settlements in East Jerusalem (including annexed areas of the West Bank) as part of 
Israel rather than as settlements. 
</p>
<p>85. During the mission, information was collected on how settlements, which have been 
built both within the municipality and in the surrounding areas of East Jerusalem, have led 
to a decrease in the amount of land and resources available to Palestinians. More than one 
third of the area of East Jerusalem has been expropriated for construction of Israeli 
settlements.67 The Special Rapporteur visited the neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where 
over 60 residents, including 24 children, were forcibly evicted from their homes, which are 
now occupied by settlers, and a further 25 families are at risk of eviction based on 
ownership claims dating back to the period prior to the 1948 founding of Israel.68 
Settlement activity is at times carried out by private settler groups or companies that enjoy 
the support of the Government of Israel, but who are not held accountable in the same 
manner as the Government. Palestinian residents are rarely engaged in the planning 
process.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Gaza  
</b></p>
<p>86. An almost complete physical and political isolation, combined with successive 
military operations, has deeply affected the housing situation in Gaza. While Israel 
withdrew its settlers and military from inside the Gaza Strip in 2005, it remains in control 
of the borders, including the entry and exit of people and goods, as well as the air space and 
access to the sea.  
</p>
<p>87. Since June 2007, the Gaza Strip has been subject to an intensified blockade, with 
severe restrictions on the movement of people, goods and services, resulting in severe 
shortages of electricity, fuel and consumer products. The Gaza Strip&#8216;s isolation and the 
continued hostilities also have a profound impact in the urban infrastructure. It is estimated 
that only 10 per cent of the water in the Gaza Strip is safe for human consumption. Severe 
fuel and electricity shortages result in regular power outages.69  
</p>
<p>88. Housing conditions have been significantly affected by military operations. During 
the Israeli offensive codenamed &#8213;Cast Lead&#8214; alone, more than 20,000 homes were

</b></p>
<p>destroyed or severely damaged.70 It is estimated that approximately 71,000 new housing 
units are required to cover current housing needs.71   
</p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur was gravely concerned by information received from 
representatives of international humanitarian assistance agencies that a large proportion of 
the projects aimed at improving housing and vital services in Gaza that have been 
submitted for approval by the international community have not been approved by the 
Israeli authorities or had suffered from disproportional delays. In the Ezbet Abed Rabbo 
community (Northern Gaza), for example, the Special Rapporteur visited an area which had 
been severely damaged during the offensive of 2008/09 and remains in dire need of 
reconstruction, as international organizations have yet to obtain the necessary authorization 
from Israeli authorities to import construction materials. 
</p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur raised her concerns with the Israeli authorities, who claimed 
not to be responsible for all delays and informed her of upcoming measures to ease the 
entry of goods and construction materials. The Special Rapporteur remains however 
concerned at the serious and disproportionate impact of the Israel blockade on Palestinians&#8216; 
</p>
<p>right to housing and basic services in the Gaza Strip.  
</p>
<p>91. At the same time, the Special Rapporteur was impressed by the degree of active 
engagement of Gaza inhabitants in undertaking the reconstructions and amelioration of 
their living conditions, mobilizing all the means and resources available to them. In this 
context, recent strategies of self-help reconstruction, making available direct funds to the 
households to rebuild demolished houses, have a very positive impact. However, the 
Special Rapporteur also noted her concern that these self-help schemes are available only to 
those with registered legal titles to the land, so that the most needy, those who are squatting 
on public land, are left with no alternative other than to wait for the completion of public 
housing projects, funded by international donors.  
</p>
<p>92. As noted in the report of the Special Rapporteur focused on the right to adequate 
housing in post-disaster and post-conflict situations, humanitarian agencies and donors have 
gained an acute awareness of the long-term impact of hastened early recovery efforts in the 
past decades (A/HRC/16/42, para. 57). Especially in the area of the right to adequate 
housing, this awareness must translate into interventions based on community 
consultations, if not designed by the affected communities themselves, and marked by 
accountability to the beneficiaries.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Concluding remarks and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The provision of housing has been central to efforts by Israel to integrate 
successive waves of Jewish immigrants. This policy was based on a highly centralized 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government planning and intervention model, which in a number of cases ignored 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural differences and confined marginalized groups to the peripheries of the State. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Since the 1990s, the Government of Israel has increasingly disengaged from the 
housing sector, relying mostly on market incentives. Privatization, deregulation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>commercialization of public assets seem to have further undermined the declared 
</b></p>
<p><b>foundational goal to provide a safe and adequate home for all <i>Yishuv</i>, regardless of 
</b></p>
<p><b>nationality or income level. The massive protests in 2011 highlighted the public 
</b></p>
<p><b>frustration with increasing costs of living and in particular with regard to housing.

<p><b>A/HRC/22/46/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>95. <b>Nonetheless, even after the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement 
on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, Israel has continuously dedicated important 
</b></p>
<p><b>public financial and technical resources to promote the expansion of settlements in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Occupied Palestinian Territory. The State engagement in the settlement enterprise not 
</b></p>
<p><b>only violates international law and seriously worsens the living conditions of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestinians under occupation, but also ends up depriving Israeli nationals of 
</b></p>
<p><b>important resources that could be used to promote access to adequate housing within 
</b></p>
<p><b>the internationally recognized boundaries of the country.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>Throughout her visit the Special Rapporteur witnessed a development model 
that systematically excludes, discriminates against and displaces minorities in Israel 
</b></p>
<p><b>and which has been replicated in the occupied territory since 1967. In very different 
</b></p>
<p><b>legal and geographical contexts, from Galilee and the Negev to the West Bank, she 
</b></p>
<p><b>received multiple similar complaints from Palestinians, notably concerning a lack of 
</b></p>
<p><b>or discriminatory planning, which seriously hampers the urban and rural 
</b></p>
<p><b>development of these communities. As a consequence, a disproportionate number of 
</b></p>
<p><b>members of such communities live and sometimes work in structures that are 
</b></p>
<p>&#8213;unauthorized&#8214; or &#8213;illegal&#8214; and liable to eviction and demolition. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>It is estimated that, since 1948, nearly 1,100 Jewish urban and rural 
communities have been built between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean Sea. At 
</b></p>
<p><b>the same time, over 400 Arab villages have reportedly been destroyed and Arabs have 
</b></p>
<p><b>been forbidden to build in new localities. The only exception has been the often forced 
</b></p>
<p><b>urbanization of Bedouins in the Negev and Galilee.</b>72
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>Thus, the recent plans for relocating Bedouins in the Negev</b>&#8212;<b>inside Israel</b>&#8212;<b>as 
well as decades of promotion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, including in 
</b></p>
<p><b>East Jerusalem, are the new expressions of dispossession of traditional inhabitants 
</b></p>
<p><b>and control of the territory.</b>73<b> In this same context, the barrier and the blockade of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Gaza are the most visible expressions of a process of de facto segregation that seems to 
</b></p>
<p><b>be silently pursued in longstanding planning and zoning strategies both within Israel 
</b></p>
<p><b>as well as in the occupied territory.  
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>It is also important to underline that the spatial strategy of Israel has also been 
heavily shaped by security concerns, given the belligerent, conflictive nature of Israel-
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestine relations, marked by waves of violence and terror. But certainly the non-
</b></p>
<p><b>democratic elements in Israeli spatial planning and urban development strategies 
</b></p>
<p><b>appear to contribute to the deepening of the conflict, rather than promote peace.   
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>It would appear therefore that the Israeli planning, development and land 
system violates the right to adequate housing not only of Palestinians under Israeli 
</b></p>
<p><b>control, but also of low-income persons of all identities, who find it increasingly 
</b></p>
<p><b>difficult to obtain adequate and affordable housing under current policies. Both 
</b></p>
<p><b>aspects of this discriminatory system should be changed to allow all those living under 
</b></p>
<p><b>the control of the Israeli authorities to enjoy the most basic human right to adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>housing, within the framework of dignity and equality. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Accordingly, the Special Rapporteur presents the following recommendations 
to the State of Israel:

</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Revise and reform the Israeli legal framework relevant to the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>adequate housing: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Revise and reform the laws of Israel in order to: (a) guarantee the 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of the right to adequate housing in all its elements; and (b) repeal all 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>provided in the international human rights instruments to which Israel is a 
</b></p>
<p><b>party; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Revise zoning and planning legislation and processes so as to ensure, at a 
</b></p>
<p><b>minimum, meaningful consultation with affected populations throughout the 
</b></p>
<p><b>planning process. This implies: dissemination by the authorities of relevant 
</b></p>
<p><b>information in advance; a reasonable time period for public review of, 
</b></p>
<p><b>comments on, and/or objection to the proposed plan; opportunities to propose 
</b></p>
<p><b>alternatives; and a decision-making process that is transparent;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) In accordance with general comment No. 4 (1991) of the Committee on 
</b></p>
<p><b>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, take immediate measures aimed at 
</b></p>
<p><b>conferring legal security of tenure upon those persons and households currently 
</b></p>
<p><b>lacking such protection, in active and meaningful consultation with affected 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons and groups (para. 8 (a)); 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Review legislation and procedures regarding evictions to bring them into 
</b></p>
<p><b>conformity with international human rights norms and standards, in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>to ensure opportunity for genuine consultation with those affected, that 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>resources, to ensure that adequate alternative housing, resettlement or access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>productive land, as the case may be, is available;</b>74<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Revise legislation regulating private rental in order to ensure adequate

</b></p>
<p><b>adequate housing, paying particular attention to the situation of groups living 
</b></p>
<p><b>in poverty and historically marginalized groups, such as minorities; 
</b></p>

<p><b>Palestinian minorities, both in rural and urban areas, ensuring that these are 
</b></p>
<p><b>designed, implemented and evaluated through meaningfully participatory 
</b></p>
