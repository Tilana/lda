prices, the market continues to recognise the quality value in use premium for high quality, low impurity iron ore
products sold by Grange.
Grange will continue to deliver into secured term offtake agreements for all products for 2016 and the majority
production of 2017.

INTERIM FINANCIAL REPORT
Grange operations achieved over 448 days lost time injury free as mining continued in South Deposit and
North Pit.
Mining operations focused on mining ore from South Deposit and pre-stripping material in the next cutback of
North Pit. South Deposit is delivering high quality feed for processing and the cutback in North Pit continues to
develop access to the main ore zone for ore supply later in the year. Some remediation work was also required
in the cutback to support the wall, causing some delays in bulk mining. Studies are being conducted on short
term designs to improve access and working areas to increase movement rates. Severe weather conditions in
the second quarter caused flooding in the region and impacted movement in the pits.
Annual planned maintenance was also completed safely in the first half of 2016 with the completion of the
common equipment shutdown. This impacted production in the concentrator and pellet plant. A set of plant
trials were completed for the fluxed pellet project to improve pellet quality. The analysis of the trials is in
progress.
Development continues on construction of the filter face for the South Deposit Tails Storage Facility (SDTSF).
This is a significant project for operations at Savage River as the SDTSF will provide sufficient tailings storage
capacity for the remaining life of the mine and facilitate the treatment of legacy environmental issues from
previous operations at Savage River.
Statement of Financial Position
principally as a result of the following:
increased during the half-year period to $278.4 million (31 December 2015 $245.5 million)
Increase in cash and cash equivalents of $12.4 million arising from increase in sales revenue;
Increased assets under construction of $16.6 million due to the construction of the South Deposit Tailings
Storage Facility (SDTSF);
Capitalisation of deferred stripping costs from North Pit has increased capitalised mine development by
$21.2 million; and
Offset by decreased inventory stockpiles of $30.0 million arising from lower stockpiles and decrease in
production costs.
Statement of Cash Flows
Net cash flows from operating activities
Net cash inflows from operating activities for the period were $56.1 million (June 2015 inflow $46.2 million)
which reflects higher iron ore product sales and income tax payments of $8.4 million (June 2015 $9.2 million).
Net cash flows from investing activities
Net cash outflows from investing activities for the period were $40.3 million (June 2015 outflow $66.9 million)
and principally related to significant expenditure of $19.7 million (June 2015 $30.9 million) on property, plant
and equipment mainly for the SDTSF, whilst mine development of $21.2 million (June 2015 $26.0 million)
reduced as the business finalises ore production from South Pit.
Net cash flows from financing activities
Net cash outflows from financing activities for the period were $2.5 million (June 2015 inflow $2.3 million) and
principally related to repayments of the secured loan facility for the rebuild of the 789 Trucks.

NOTE 1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(a) Basis of preparation for the interim financial report
This condensed consolidated interim financial report for the half-year reporting period ended 30 June 2016 has
been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standard AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations
Act 2001.
The condensed consolidated interim financial report does not include all the notes of the type normally included in
an annual financial report. Accordingly, this report is to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year
ended 31 December 2015 and any public announcements made by Grange Resources Limited during the interim
reporting period in accordance with the continuous disclosure requirements of the Corporations Act 2001.
(b) Accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year and corresponding interim
reporting period, except for the adoption of new and amended standards as set out below:
(i)
New accounting standards and interpretations
A number of new or amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period. However, the Group
did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these
standards.
(ii)
Impact of accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet applied by the entity
Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 30 June
2016
out below.
(i) AASB 9 Financial Instruments, AASB 2009-11 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards
arising from AASB 9 and AASB 2010-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from
AASB 9 (December 2010) and AASB 2012-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards
Mandatory Effective Date of AASB 9 and Transition Disclosures (effective from 1 January 2018)
AASB 9 Financial Instruments addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financial
assets and financial liabilities. The standard is not applicable until 1 January 2018 but is available for early
adoption. The Company intends to apply the standard from 1 January 2018. Application of this standard is
not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
(ii) AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Mandatory Effective Date of AASB 15 (effective
from 1 January 2018)
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers will replace AASB 118 which covers contracts for goods
and services and AASB 111 which covers construction contracts. The standard is not applicable until 1
January 2018. The Company is assessing the impact of the new rules on t
and intends to apply the standard from 1 January 2018.
(iii)
IFRS 16 Leases (effective from 1 January 2019)
IFRS 16 Leases will replace the current guidance in IAS 17 and require all operating leases to be recognised
on the balance sheet. The Group intends to apply the standard from 1 January 2019. Application of this
standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
(c) Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of this interim financial report requires the use of estimates and judgements. The estimates and
judgements that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities within this interim financial report are consistent with those of the previous financial year as disclosed in
the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2015.

The Group has one reportable segment, being the exploration, evaluation, development and exploitation of mineral
resources and iron ore mining operations. The Chief Executive Officer allocates resources and assesses
performance, in terms of revenues earned, expenses incurred and assets employed, on a consolidated basis in a
manner consistent with that of the measurement and presentation in the financial statements.
Exploration, evaluation and development projects (including the Southdown project) are not deemed reportable
operating segments at this time as the financial performance of these operations is not separately included in the
reports provided to the Chief Executive Officer. These projects may become segments in the future.

NOTE 21.
IMPAIRMENT OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. The
Group considers both internal and external factors when reviewing for indicators of impairment. The Group
continues to improve its production, reduce its cash operating costs and exceeded its revenue target. Although the
changes to external or internal factors since its last assessment that may indicate further impairment to its book
value of net assets. An impairment of $123.1 million was recognised at 31 December 2015.
The fair value of the Savage River Cash Generating Unit (CGU) is based on a number of significant assumptions
as disclosed in the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2015. A key assumption is the capital project
t to attract a higher
premium. Although the Group has deferred the commencement of fluxed pellet production to 2018 compared to
the anticipated 2017 start in its last impairment assessment, the impact on the fair value has been more than offset
by the improvement in the iron ore price forecast assumption. Should the Group be unable to realise the anticipated
higher premium in the future, or should any of the other reasonably possible unfavourable changes described in
Note 26 (iv) of the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2015 occur, a further impairment would be likely.
NOTE 22. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
Financial instruments are recognised and measured at fair value in the financial statements.
Derivatives
Derivatives are only used for economic hedging purposes and not as speculative investments. The Group has the
following derivative financial instruments:

(i)
Classification of derivatives
4,496

4,840
3,035
(980)
2,055
Derivatives are classified as held for trading. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative
contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognised immediately in profit or loss and are included in
other income or other expenses. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or
liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months; it is classified as a current asset
or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
In accordance with AASB 13, Fair Value Measurement, the Group did not measure any liabilities at fair value on a
non-recurring basis as at 30 June 2016 and did not transfer any fair value amounts between the fair value hierarchy
during the period ended 30 June 2016.
Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts of current receivables and current payables are assumed to
approximate their fair value.
NOTE 23. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
There were no significant changes to the contingent liabilities previously disclosed in the Annual Report for the year
ended 31 December 2015.
NOTE 24. EVENTS OCCURRING AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD
Refer to note 20 for dividends recommended since the end of the reporting period. No other matter or circumstance
has arisen since 30 June 2016 that has significantly affected, or may significantly affect:
the results of those operations in future financial years; or
ture financial years.

Independent auditor's review report to the members of Grange 
Resources Limited
Report on the Half-Year Financial Report 
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year financial report of Grange Resources Limited (the 
company), which comprises the condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 
2016, the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income, condensed consolidated 
statement of changes in equity and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the half-year 
ended on that date, selected explanatory notes and the directors' declaration for Grange Resources 
Limited (the consolidated entity). The consolidated entity comprises the company and the entities it 
controlled during that half-year.
Directors' responsibility for the half-year financial report 
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the half-year financial report that 
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 
2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
the half-year financial report that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor's responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our review. We 
conducted our review in accordance with Australian Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 
2410 Review of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to 
state whether, on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes 
us believe that the half-year financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 
including giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entityâ€™s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and 
its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 
Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of Grange 
Resources Limited, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the 
audit of the annual financial report.
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for 
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards 
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant 
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Independence 
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations 
Act 2001.

Conclusion 
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us 
believe that the half-year financial report of Grange Resources Limited is not in accordance with the 
Corporations Act 2001 including:
a)
b)
giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entityâ€™s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and of 
its performance for the half-year ended on that date;
