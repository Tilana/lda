</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i>, in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations, its 
full and active support for the United Nations and for the enhancement of its role and

solution of international problems, as well as the development of friendly relations and 
cooperation among States, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the obligation of all States to settle their international disputes by peaceful 
means in such a manner that international peace, security and justice are not endangered,

to setting up conditions in which their people can live in true and lasting peace, free from any 
threat to or attempt against their security, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the obligation of all States to refrain, in their international relations, from the 
threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in 
any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations,
