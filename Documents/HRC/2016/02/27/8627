<p><b> I.  Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. In resolution 13/9 on follow-up to the report of the United Nations Independent 
International Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, the Human Rights Council 
requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to present a report on 
the implementation of the resolution at its fifteenth session. The present report is submitted 
pursuant to this request. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Implementation of Human Rights Council resolution 13/9 
</b></p>
<p>2. In operative paragraph 4 of resolution 13/9, the Human Rights Council reiterated its 
call upon all concerned parties, including United Nations bodies, to ensure the 
implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the United Nations 
Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (A/HRC/12/48), in 
accordance with their respective mandates.  
</p>
<p>3. In response to operative paragraph 14 of resolution 13/9, the status of 
implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Fact-Finding 
Mission is comprehensively addressed in the report of the Secretary-General to the fifteenth 
session of the Council on the progress made in the implementation of the recommendations 
of the Fact-Finding Mission by all concerned parties, including United Nations bodies, in 
accordance with paragraph 3 of section B  of Human Rights Council resolution S-12/1 
(A/HRC/15/51). 
</p>
<p>4. In operative paragraph 5 of resolution 13/9, the Human Rights Council reiterated the 
call by the General Assembly upon the Government of Israel to conduct investigations that 
are independent, credible, and in conformity with international standards into the serious 
violations of international humanitarian and international human rights law reported by the 
Fact-Finding Mission, with a view to ensuring accountability and justice. In operative 
paragraph 6 of resolution 13/9, the Council reiterated the urging by the General Assembly 
for the conduct by the Palestinian side of investigations that are independent, credible, and 
in conformity with international standards into the serious violations of international 
humanitarian and international human rights law reported by the Fact-Finding Mission, 
with a view to ensuring accountability and justice. 
</p>
<p>5. The status of implementation of operative paragraphs 5 and 6 of resolution 13/9 is 
addressed in the report of the committee of independent experts in international 
humanitarian and human rights law that was established by the Council in operative 
paragraph 9 of the same resolution (A/HRC/15/50). The committee was mandated to 
monitor and assess any domestic, legal or other proceedings undertaken by both the 
Government of Israel and the Palestinian side, in light of General Assembly resolution 
64/254, including the independence, effectiveness, genuineness of these investigations and 
their conformity with international standards.   
</p>
<p>6. In operative paragraph 7 of resolution 13/9, the Human Rights Council welcomed 
the recommendation made by the General Assembly to the Government of Switzerland, in 
its capacity as depositary of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian 
Persons in Time of War, to reconvene, as soon as possible, a conference of High-
Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention on measures to enforce the 
Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to ensure 
its respect in accordance with common article 1, bearing in mind the statement adopted on 
15 July 1999 as well as the reconvening of the conference and the declaration adopted on 5 </p>


<p>December 2001, and recommended that the Government of Switzerland reconvene the 
above-mentioned conference before the end of 2010.  
</p>

the Secretary-General requested that the Government of Switzerland provide written 
information regarding any steps it may have taken, or was in the process of taking, further 
to the recommendation of the General Assembly in operative paragraph 4 of resolution 
64/254.1 The Government of Switzerland responded to this request with a report entitled 
&#8220;Status of the talks on follow-up to paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 64/254,&#8221;

State of Israel during the military operations conducted from December 2008 to January 
</p><p>2009.  
</p>
<p>9. In response to operative paragraph 8, the High Commissioner requested guidance

of Legal Affairs. The High Commissioner will provide further information on this matter 
following the receipt of counsel from the Office of Legal Affairs. 
</p>

that the High Commissioner appoint the members of the committee of independent experts 
in international humanitarian and human rights law and provide them with all the 
administrative, technical, and logistic assistance requested to enable them to fulfil their 
mandate promptly and efficiently.

report of the Fact-Finding Mission (A/HRC/14/CRP.4), the High Commissioner fulfilled 
the request of the Council to appoint the members of the committee and established a 
secretariat to provide assistance to the committee. 
</p>
<p>12. In operative paragraph 11 of resolution 13/9, the Human Rights Council requested 
the Secretary-General to transmit all the information submitted by the Government of Israel 
and the Palestinian side, pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 of General Assembly resolution 
64/254, to the committee of independent experts. 
</p>

fifteenth session of the Council in pursuance of this request.
