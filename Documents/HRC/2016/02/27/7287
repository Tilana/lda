<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 20/15, the Human Rights Council decided to establish an open-
</p>
<p>ended intergovernmental working group with the mandate of progressively negotiating a 
</p>
<p>draft United Nations declaration on the right to peace. 
</p>
<p>2 In its resolution 27/17, the Human Rights Council decided that the open-ended 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental working group would hold its third session for five working days in 
</p>
<p>2015 with the objective of finalizing the declaration. The third session was held from 20 to 
</p>
<p>24 April 2015. 
</p>
<p>3. Also in its resolution 27/17, the Human Rights Council requested the Chairperson-
</p>
<p>Rapporteur of the working group to conduct informal consultations with Governments, 
</p>
<p>regional groups and relevant stakeholders before the third session of the group. The Council 
</p>
<p>also requested the Chairperson-Rapporteur to prepare a revised text on the basis of the 
</p>
<p>discussions held during the first and second sessions of the working group and on the basis 
</p>
<p>of the intersessional informal consultations to be held, and to present it prior to the third 
</p>
<p>session of the working group for consideration and further discussion thereat. The revised 
</p>
<p>text prepared by the Chairperson-Rapporteur was circulated to all States by note verbale on 
</p>
<p>31 March 2015. 
</p>
<p>4. On 20 April 2015, the session was opened by the Officer-in-Charge of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council Mechanisms Division of the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on behalf of the High Commissioner. The 
</p>
<p>Officer-in-Charge recalled that the realization of peace lay at the very heart of the 
</p>
<p>principles and purposes of the United Nations, as reflected in its Charter. He referred to the 
</p>
<p>2005 World Summit Outcome,1 and the Human Rights up Front initiative, launched by the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General in 2013, in which the complementarity between peace and human rights 
</p>
<p>was clearly reflected. The Officer-in-Charge commended the efforts of the Chairperson-
</p>
<p>Rapporteur to engage actively with States, civil society and academia in order to reconcile 
</p>
<p>the diverse views and positions with regard to the right to peace and to move the process 
</p>
<p>forward. He also confirmed the continued readiness of OHCHR to assist the working group 
</p>
<p>in all its endeavours. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Organization of the session 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Election of the Chairperson-Rapporteur

<p>Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/WG.13/3/1 Note by the Secretariat 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/27/63 Report of the open-ended intergovernmental working group on 
</p>
<p>a draft United Nations declaration on the right to peace 
</p>
<p><b> D. Adoption of the agenda and organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>15. In his opening statement, the Chairperson-Rapporteur referred to Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 27/17, in which the Council requested him to prepare a new text on the 
</p>
<p>basis of the discussions held during the first and second sessions of the working group and 
</p>
<p>on the basis of the intersessional informal consultations. 
</p>
<p>16. The Chairperson-Rapporteur introduced his new text, which he described as the 
</p>
<p>result of extensive consultations held with a wide range of stakeholders, including States, 
</p>
<p>intergovernmental organizations, United Nations entities, civil society organizations and 
</p>
<p>academia.2 In this light, the revised text did not include any paragraph or provision that had 
</p>
<p>not been previously discussed with or in the working group. The revised text was short and 
</p>
<p>concise, and did not aim to provide a stand-alone definition of the right to peace as such, 
</p>
<p>but rather focused on the elements composing the right to peace that had already been 
</p>
<p>identified by the Human Rights Council in previous years. 
</p>
<p>17. The Chairperson-Rapporteur stated that the first and second sessions of the working 
</p>
<p>group had created a basis that would allow for the working group to conduct the negotiation 
</p>
<p>process in good faith. As this was the final session of working group, it was now the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of States to reach consensus on a draft declaration. He reiterated that 
</p>
<p>transparency, inclusiveness, consensus and objectivity &#8211; and a little realism &#8211; continued to 
</p>
<p>be the guiding principles for the conduct of the process. 
</p>
<p>18. At its lst meeting, on 20 April 2015, the working group adopted, without comments, 
</p>
<p>its agenda (see A/HRC/WG.13/3/1), and the draft programme of work. 
</p>
<p>19. On the proposal of the Chairperson-Rapporteur, the working group agreed to hold a 
</p>
<p>general debate, to be followed by the first and second readings of the revised text prepared 
</p>
<p>by the Chairperson-Rapporteur, and to conclude with the adoption of the report on the 
</p>
<p>session. 
</p>
<p><b> III. General comments 
</b></p>
<p>20. At the 1st meeting, on 20 April 2015, following the adoption of the agenda, the floor 
</p>
<p>was opened for general comments, which included statements delivered on behalf of groups 
</p>
<p>of States, namely, by Algeria (on behalf of the Group of African States), the Islamic 
</p>
<p>Republic of Iran (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement), the European Union and the 
</p>
<p>Organization of Islamic Cooperation. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 The Chairperson-Rapporteur convened several informal consultations in preparation for the third 
</p>
<p>session of the working group. The first consultation was held with States and other stakeholders on 30 
</p>
<p>January 2015, the second consultation with representatives of various international organizations on 
</p>
<p>26 February 2015, and the third consultation with non-governmental organizations, also on 26 
</p>
<p>February 2015. Consultations and bilateral meetings were held also with the Association of Southeast 
</p>
<p>Asian Nations, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the European Union and regional groups 
</p>
<p>prior to the third session of the working group. </p>


<p>21. Although views concerning the concept of the right to peace still diverged, all 
</p>
<p>participating delegations demonstrated their will to engage constructively in the discussion. 
</p>
<p>The general debate was concluded during the first part of the 2nd meeting. 
</p>
<p>22. The delegations congratulated the Chairperson-Rapporteur on his re-election and 
</p>
<p>commended him for his able leadership on the issue and for his approach based on 
</p>
<p>transparency, inclusiveness, consensual decision-making and objectivity, which had 
</p>
<p>contributed to narrowing the gap between diverging opinions among delegations on the 
</p>
<p>initial draft declaration. Numerous delegations also expressed their appreciation for his 
</p>
<p>efforts to prepare a revised text that carefully reflected the different positions expressed at 
</p>
<p>the second session of the working group and during the constructive intersessional 
</p>
<p>consultations with delegations, regional groups and other stakeholders. The delegations 
</p>
<p>expressed the hope that the consensus approach would be maintained and also that the third 
</p>
<p>session would conclude with a positive outcome so that the working group would be in a 
</p>
<p>position to submit a draft declaration to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>23. A number of delegations reiterated their support for the mandate of the working 
</p>
<p>group, namely to progressively negotiate a draft United Nations declaration on the right to 
</p>
<p>peace. They considered that the working group needed to be mindful of fulfilling its 
</p>
<p>mandate as provided by the Human Rights Council, and encouraged all parties to engage 
</p>
<p>with that goal in mind. 
</p>
<p>24. Many delegations considered that the right to peace and the realization of peace 
</p>
<p>were fundamental for economic and social progress and for the enjoyment of all human 
</p>
<p>rights. A peaceful environment was necessary for the achievement of individual and 
</p>
<p>collective rights in every nation. In their view, the right to peace was not a new concept, but 
</p>
<p>one that already existed in the normative legal framework of international law. The 
</p>
<p>prohibition of acts of aggression as contained in the Charter of the United Nations was the 
</p>
<p>basis for the right to peace. Regional instruments that reflect the right to peace were 
</p>
<p>recalled, for example, the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Declaration of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The 
</p>
<p>imposition of unilateral coercive measures violated the principles of the Charter of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and therefore the right of peoples to live in peace. Several delegations stated 
</p>
<p>that the right to peace could be realized by respecting the self-determination of peoples and 
</p>
<p>the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of sovereign States. 
</p>
<p>25. Other delegations restated their conviction that there was no legal basis for the right 
</p>
<p>to peace as either an individual or collective right in international law. They were therefore 
</p>
<p>of the view that it was not appropriate for the draft declaration to imply the existence of 
</p>
<p>such a right in the title or the body of the text. They nevertheless welcomed the direction in 
</p>
<p>which the Chairperson-Rapporteur was guiding the work of the working group. The 
</p>
<p>delegations appreciated, however, the mutually reinforcing relationship between peace and 
</p>
<p>security, human rights and development. While acknowledging the difficult task ahead for 
</p>
<p>the working group, they expressed their will to engage constructively in forthcoming 
</p>
<p>negotiations. 
</p>
<p>26. The revised text prepared by the Chairperson-Rapporteur was largely regarded as a 
</p>
<p>solid basis for the negotiations to be held during the third session. According to the 
</p>
<p>delegations, the text had to be concise but balanced, meaningful, realistic and 
</p>
<p>implementable. It was suggested that controversial or undefined issues not enjoying 
</p>
<p>consensus at the international level not be included. The content should be guided by 
</p>
<p>international law and the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations. The inclusion of 
</p>
<p>such elements as the prevention of armed conflict, a culture of peace and the interlinkage 
</p>
<p>and mutual reinforcement between the three pillars of peace and security, development and 
</p>
<p>human rights was welcomed by some. A number of delegations supported references in the </p>


<p>preamble to the right to development, the Declaration on the Right of Peoples to Peace3 and 
</p>
<p>the issue of terrorism. 
</p>
<p>27. Some delegations regretted that no progress had been made in the revised text 
</p>
<p>towards norm-setting and codifying the right to peace pursuant to Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 20/15, reflecting previous related developments at the United Nations, including 
</p>
<p>the Declaration on the Right of Peoples to Peace. Furthermore, they believed that certain 
</p>
<p>areas of the text needed strengthening. In this connection, a suggestion was made to 
</p>
<p>highlight the interrelations between the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
</p>
<p>and peacemaking, peacekeeping and peacebuilding and the realization of the right to peace. 
</p>
<p>Attention was also drawn to the situation of people living under foreign occupation, which 
</p>
<p>violated all human rights. 
</p>
<p>28. Several delegations considered it essential to include the principles of non-
</p>
<p>aggression and the prohibition of the use of force in the draft declaration, while one 
</p>
<p>delegation stressed the need to recognize the exceptions of the latter enshrined in the 
</p>
<p>Charter. 
</p>
<p>29. The representatives of non-governmental organizations and of other stakeholders 
</p>
<p>that contributed to the general discussion appealed to States to show political will and to 
</p>
<p>work constructively towards producing a meaningful draft declaration, in spite of their 
</p>
<p>differences. Their appreciation was expressed to the Chairperson-Rapporteur for engaging 
</p>
<p>with numerous stakeholders when preparing his revised text and for having included 
</p>
<p>references to such issues as equality and discrimination, as well as the rule of law. The 
</p>
<p>reference to the three pillars of the United Nations in the preamble was also welcomed, as 
</p>
<p>was the notion that peace was more than just the absence of conflict. A view was expressed 
</p>
<p>that the draft declaration previously prepared by the Advisory Committee was more in line 
</p>
<p>with the aspirations of peoples. While appreciating the efforts of the Chairperson-
</p>
<p>Rapporteur, some felt that his revised draft did not meet their expectations to build 
</p>
<p>significantly on previous instruments, such as the Declaration on the Preparation of 
</p>
<p>Societies for Life in Peace4 and the Declaration on the Right of Peoples to Peace.5 They 
</p>
<p>regretted that the working group had not yet made progress in codifying the right to peace 
</p>
<p>pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 20/15, and that an explicit article defining the 
</p>
<p>right to peace was absent from the revised text. They called upon the working group to 
</p>
<p>initiate a genuine negotiation on the right to peace leading to normative development rather 
</p>
<p>than to a political declaration. 
</p>
<p>30. Suggestions were also made for the inclusion of such elements as the right to human 
</p>
<p>security; the right to disarmament; the right to peace education and training; the right to 
</p>
<p>conscientious objection to military service; and the right to resistance and opposition to 
</p>
<p>oppression. A call was also made for the establishment of a monitoring body to guarantee 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the declaration. Some representatives proposed including the notions 
</p>
<p>of the right to live in peace and of gender equality. One stakeholder drew attention to the 
</p>
<p>adverse human rights impact of military spending, and expressed hope that the future 
</p>
<p>declaration would be a step towards disarmament.

<p><b> IV. First and second readings of the revised text prepared by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Chairperson-Rapporteur of the working group  
</b></p>
<p>31. At its 2nd meeting, on 20 April 2015, its 3rd and 4th meetings, on 21 April 2015, 
</p>
<p>and its 5th and 6th meeting on 22 April 2015, the working group proceeded, paragraph by 
</p>
<p>paragraph, with the first and second readings of the revised text prepared by the 
</p>
<p>Chairperson-Rapporteur of the working group, on the understanding that nothing would be 
</p>
<p>agreed upon until everything had been agreed upon. The text was subject to two readings 
</p>
<p>during the session, with the exception of article 1, which was considered only during the 
</p>
<p>first reading. 
</p>
<p>32. At the outset, the Chairperson-Rapporteur stated that the revised text encompassed 
</p>
<p>the different views expressed at the second session of the working group and in the 
</p>
<p>informal and bilateral consultations held during the intersessional period. He explained that 
</p>
<p>the revised text incorporated those elements included in the compilation of proposals made 
</p>
<p>by States during the second session of the working group, around which it was hoped that 
</p>
<p>consensus could be reached. He stressed that, in the light of the foregoing, the revised text 
</p>
<p>was not the &#8220;Chairperson&#8217;s text&#8221;, and that his role was merely to facilitate the process. The 
</p>
<p>Chairperson-Rapporteur reiterated his determination to seek consensus on the draft 
</p>
<p>declaration, which he viewed as a first step towards building and codifying the right to 
</p>
<p>peace. 
</p>
<p>33. Before beginning the reading, the Chairperson-Rapporteur also outlined the structure 
</p>
<p>of the revised text. The first part of the preamble contained references to international 
</p>
<p>instruments relevant to the context of the right to peace, followed by a number of 
</p>
<p>paragraphs relating to each of the three pillars of the United Nations (namely, peace and 
</p>
<p>security, human rights, and development), a section on peace education and the culture of 
</p>
<p>peace, and concluded with the purposes of the declaration. Four articles formed the core of 
</p>
<p>the revised text, building on, inter alia, article 23 of the African Charter on Human and 
</p>
<p>Peoples&#8217; Rights and article 38 of the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration. Articles 3 and 4 
</p>
<p>dealt with the implementation and interpretation of the draft declaration. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Preamble 
</b></p>
<p>34. In the course of the reading, a number of proposals were made by delegations and 
</p>
<p>other stakeholders to modify the Chairperson&#8217;s revised text. The proposals were recorded in 
</p>
<p>successive compilations subsequently made available in the room. 
</p>
<p>35. Comments of a general nature were made in which some States again reaffirmed 
</p>
<p>their full support for the mandate of the working group and to reflect clearly the concept of 
</p>
<p>the right to peace in the draft declaration, while others restated their view that there was no 
</p>
<p>consensus on the right to peace as such, and that they wished to focus rather on the 
</p>
<p>interlinkage between the three pillars of the United Nations. Those making statements 
</p>
<p>pledged, in the spirit of reaching compromise, to work towards consensus, to show 
</p>
<p>flexibility and to refrain from introducing controversial or complex issues. 
</p>
<p>36. Some delegations made proposals to insert specific provisions from the Charter of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations throughout the preamble, while others raised a general concern over 
</p>
<p>selectively adding elements from agreed texts, and notably from the Charter. The latter 
</p>
<p>delegations were of the view that a general reference to the Charter at the beginning of the 
</p>
<p>preamble was sufficient and all-encompassing, and that there was no need to add further 
</p>
<p>extracts from it in subsequent sections of the preamble. </p>


<p>37. Discussions also centred on the inclusion of a reference to foreign occupation and 
</p>
<p>alien subjugation, domination and exploitation, and a specific mention of the Declaration 
</p>
<p>on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples.6 Some participants felt 
</p>
<p>that the absence of such references in a draft declaration on the right to peace was 
</p>
<p>inconceivable. 
</p>
<p>38. It was also proposed to include a reference to the 2005 World Summit Outcome7 and 
</p>
<p>the post-2015 development agenda. Some delegations were of the view that the declaration 
</p>
<p>should be kept short and concise, and generally did not favour additional inclusions, 
</p>
<p>although they agreed with the reference to the World Summit Outcome and the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda. Regarding the proposal to also add a general reference to &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>relevant instruments mentioning or in relation to peace or the right to peace&#8221;, a preference 
</p>
<p>was voiced for citing specific instruments rather than referring to instruments in a general 
</p>
<p>manner. 
</p>
<p>39. A suggestion to include a reference to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
</p>
<p>Court, as amended, was also debated, with several delegations raising concerns over the 
</p>
<p>fact that the amendments regarding the crime of aggression (2010) had not yet come into 
</p>
<p>force. Alternatively, a reference to aggression or acts of aggression was proposed. 
</p>
<p>40. The insertion in the revised text of a paragraph on the issue of terrorism as a threat to 
</p>
<p>peace was welcomed by a number of delegations. It was suggested that explicit mention be 
</p>
<p>made to the threat that it posed to the territorial integrity and security of States in line with 
</p>
<p>the wording of the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism.8 It was 
</p>
<p>also felt that the unequivocal condemnation of all acts of terrorism, including the provision 
</p>
<p>of support for terrorist groups, as criminal and unjustifiable needed to be emphasized. A 
</p>
<p>reservation was expressed at the proposal to condemn also the payment of ransom in this 
</p>
<p>connection. 
</p>
<p>41. Alternatively, it was proposed that more focus should be place on the measures used 
</p>
<p>in the fight against terrorism and that the need for them to be in compliance with the 
</p>
<p>obligations of States under international law be stressed. Some delegations felt that the 
</p>
<p>recognition of the importance of moderation and tolerance as a value within societies for 
</p>
<p>countering extremism in all its aspects should also be reflected in the text. 
</p>
<p>42. As a compromise and a means to avoid focusing disproportionately on the issue of 
</p>
<p>terrorism in the draft declaration, a suggestion was made to merge the original text with the 
</p>
<p>proposals made. In this connection, caution was expressed at merging the issues of 
</p>
<p>terrorism and extremism, given that extremism was a different and broader concept. 
</p>
<p>43. Several delegations felt that it was important to reaffirm the duty of States to 
</p>
<p>cooperate, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, in order to, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>maintain international peace and security. It was therefore suggested that wording from the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Co-
</p>
<p>operation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations9 be included. 
</p>
<p>There was broad support for the proposal, although a concern was expressed that such a 
</p>
<p>reference would be too broad. 
</p>
<p>44. Recognizing that peace was not only the absence of conflict, requirements for it 
</p>
<p>were discussed. In this regard, some delegations were of the view that the link between 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV). 
</p>
<p> 7 General Assembly resolution 60/1. 
</p>
<p> 8 General Assembly resolution 49/60, annex. 
</p>
<p> 9 General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV), annex. </p>


<p>peace and the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms should be more 
</p>
<p>explicit. Others wished to emphasize the importance of socioeconomic development. 
</p>
<p>45. Diverging views were expressed on the inclusion of references to the right to 
</p>
<p>development and the recalling of the Declaration on the Right to Development. While some 
</p>
<p>delegations proposed the inclusion of additional references throughout the preamble, others 
</p>
<p>supported the deletion of all mention. Some delegations pointed out that too many 
</p>
<p>additional inclusions on this topic would dilute the revised text, arguing that the text would 
</p>
<p>be better structured if these references were omitted in parts of the text that did not 
</p>
<p>specifically focus on the right to development and related topics. 
</p>
<p>46. With regard to the provision in the revised text reflecting article 5 of the Vienna 
</p>
<p>Declaration and Programme of Action, it was proposed that the language in the article 
</p>
<p>should be more accurately reflected, and also that a reference to the primary responsibility 
</p>
<p>of States to promote and protect human rights be added. 
</p>
<p>47. Comments were also made on a paragraph based on article 5 of General Assembly 
</p>
<p>resolution 60/251 on the contribution of the United Nations to the prevention of human 
</p>
<p>rights violations. Some preferred reverting to the original language by replacing the 
</p>
<p>reference to the United Nations with a reference to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>48. Several delegations expressed the desire to insert specific wording from the 
</p>
<p>Declaration on the Preparation of Societies for Life in Peace, emphasizing the duty of 
</p>
<p>States to discourage advocacy of hatred and prejudice. Some delegations felt that the 
</p>
<p>proposed text was not clearly relevant to the notion of the right to peace. Others were 
</p>
<p>unable to support the insertion also because the relationship between the two concepts was 
</p>
<p>a very complex one and touched upon the freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>49. Suggestions were made to insert wording that would emphasize the importance of 
</p>
<p>strengthening multilateralism, or the capacity of the United Nations, in order to prevent 
</p>
<p>armed conflict. Such an insertion was agreeable to most delegations, although reservations 
</p>
<p>were made on an additional proposal relating to the consequences of armed conflict and the 
</p>
<p>positive impact that multilateralism could have on alleviating the suffering of people 
</p>
<p>affected by armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>50. Several delegations subsequently proposed text that reflected the importance of 
</p>
<p>promoting actions to eliminate the root causes of conflict. During the ensuing discussion, 
</p>
<p>delegations expressed diverging positions on the exact phrasing of the text. Some 
</p>
<p>delegations found ambitious wording preferable, while others were of the view that a more 
</p>
<p>moderate approach was desirable. 
</p>
<p>51. It was also proposed to include language based on article 10 of the Programme of 
</p>
<p>Action on a Culture of Peace on development assistance and capacity-building in post-
</p>
<p>conflict situations. While some delegations found the proposed text overly specific, there 
</p>
<p>was in this regard broader support for further proposals that underlined the activities of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations in development assistance. Several ideas on merging the different proposals 
</p>
<p>were subsequently put forward. 
</p>
<p>52. Wording was further proposed to emphasize that a culture of peace is enhanced 
</p>
<p>when States respect their obligations to settle international disputes by peaceful means. The 
</p>
<p>idea advanced to list also some of the acts that would be inconsistent with this obligation, 
</p>
<p>such as the delivery of shipments of arms to any party of an armed conflict, was not 
</p>
<p>generally supported. Also discussed was the importance of resource allocation to 
</p>
<p>programmes to enhance a culture of peace. There was also a proposal for alternative 
</p>
<p>language on the issue of a culture of peace based on articles 3 and 4 of the Declaration on a 
</p>
<p>Culture of Peace, and an addition to stress the importance of promoting and implementing </p>


<p>the World Programme for Human Rights Education10 or the United Nations Declaration on 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Education and Training11 in order to develop a culture of peace. 
</p>
<p>53. Support was expressed for the proposal of several delegations to include wording 
</p>
<p>from the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious 
</p>
<p>and Linguistic Minorities12 and the Declaration of the World Conference against Racism, 
</p>
<p>Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance.13 Some were of the view that 
</p>
<p>the inclusion of language from the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action would 
</p>
<p>emphasize that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance may, inter 
</p>
<p>alia, endanger international peace and security. 
</p>
<p>54. A proposal was made to include wording on the elimination of nuclear weapons and 
</p>
<p>other weapons of mass destruction as a means to contribute positively to the pursuit of 
</p>
<p>durable and sustainable world peace. 
</p>
<p>55. Representatives of non-governmental organizations, speaking during the first 
</p>
<p>reading, endorsed the preamble to the draft declaration, stressed the importance of reaching 
</p>
<p>consensus and urged States to engage constructively in the debates with a view to finalizing 
</p>
<p>and adopting the text at the end of the session. They stated that peace was not just the 
</p>
<p>absence of violence, and generally welcomed proposals made by States that aimed to define 
</p>
<p>the notion of the right to peace broadly and positively. They added that a clear reference to 
</p>
<p>the right to peace should be included in the text. 
</p>
<p>56. In order to emphasize the importance of the draft declaration, it was also suggested 
</p>
<p>that a separate paragraph referencing exclusively the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights be included in the text. Another suggestion was made that more references to 
</p>
<p>international, regional and local human rights instruments be included throughout the 
</p>
<p>preamble. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Article 1 
</b></p>
<p>57. Before proceeding to consideration of article 1 of the revised text, the Chairperson-
</p>
<p>Rapporteur explained that the article was grounded in the three pillars of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations. It followed that everyone should be entitled to enjoy peace and security, human 
</p>
<p>rights and development. In this case, entitlement was used to refer to the guarantee of 
</p>
<p>access of every human being to the benefits derived from the three pillars, which ought to 
</p>
<p>be interpreted as an aspiration, an obligation or a privilege to which every human being 
</p>
<p>should have access for the full enjoyment of a life in dignity and without war, violence, 
</p>
<p>intolerance or conflict. 
</p>
<p>58. The Chairperson-Rapporteur clarified that the revised text drew on, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>elements that the Human Rights Council had regarded as fundamental for building the right 
</p>
<p>to peace. In particular, he had taken into consideration the elements that the Council had 
</p>
<p>included in the operative paragraphs of resolutions 14/3 (2010), 17/16 (2011) and 20/15 
</p>
<p>(2012) on the right of peoples to peace. He had also taken into account the diverse positions 
</p>
<p>expressed, and recalled that delegations today bore responsibility for finding agreements 
</p>
<p>and for adopting a declaration. 
</p>
<p>59. Several delegations stated that, given the mandate of working group, an explicit 
</p>
<p>reference to the right to peace was necessary, while others opposed such a reference, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 10 See General Assembly resolution 59/113. 
</p>
<p> 11 General Assembly resolution 66/137. 
</p>
<p> 12 General Assembly resolution 47/135, annex. 
</p>
<p> 13 See A/CONF.189/12  .</p>


<p>reiterating that they did not recognize that right as a stand-alone right under international 
</p>
<p>law, even though they agreed that peace was an important goal for humanity. In that sense, 
</p>
<p>they restated their support for the balanced approach taken by the Chairperson-Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>It was also suggested that the mutually reinforcing nature of peace, security, development 
</p>
<p>and human rights should have been underlined. 
</p>
<p>60. A number of alternative proposals for article 1 were made by delegations in an effort 
</p>
<p>to find consensus. It was suggested that attention be focused on the promotion, protection 
</p>
<p>and respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including peace, security and 
</p>
<p>development. Another suggestion was to refer to the right to peace, to enjoy security and 
</p>
<p>development, allowing the full realization of all human rights, as an entitlement for 
</p>
<p>everyone. An alternative proposal was to acknowledge that, in some States, the elements 
</p>
<p>contained in article 1 could be characterized as a right to peace. Another option put forward 
</p>
<p>was to recognize the right of everyone to enjoy peace in such a way that security is 
</p>
<p>maintained, all human rights are promoted and protected, and development is fully realized. 
</p>
<p>61. The language proposed by some delegations at the previous session of the working 
</p>
<p>group was also re-tabled, referring to the fact that individuals, groups and peoples have the 
</p>
<p>inalienable right to a just, sustainable and lasting peace, or mentioning the inalienable right 
</p>
<p>of everyone to live in peace and dignity. During the discussion, some delegations restated 
</p>
<p>their positions, but also expressed their readiness to accept the revised text as a 
</p>
<p>compromise. Clarification was sought with regard to the legal difference between an 
</p>
<p>entitlement and a right. The Chairperson-Rapporteur explained that the notion of 
</p>
<p>entitlement was used in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
</p>
<p>Rights to denote rights that were to be progressively realized. One delegation expressed a 
</p>
<p>preference for not referring to an entitlement, but rather to the ability to enjoy peace, 
</p>
<p>security, human rights and development. 
</p>
<p>62. Proposals to include additional articles in the revised text were made and supported 
</p>
<p>by several delegations. The first proposal referred to the respect and implementation of the 
</p>
<p>principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, while the second one focused 
</p>
<p>on the obligation of all States to refrain from the threat or use of force. It was also 
</p>
<p>suggested that the latter proposal include a mention of respect for the territorial integrity or 
</p>
<p>political independence of other States. 
</p>
<p>63. Participating non-governmental organizations, which were given an opportunity to 
</p>
<p>making statements during the first reading, favoured the inclusion of some notions relating 
</p>
<p>to everyone&#8217;s right to live in peace, recalling that the right to life is recognized by 
</p>
<p>international human rights law. Some suggested that the reference to &#8220;security&#8221; be removed 
</p>
<p>from the revised text, cautioning on the potential ambiguity of the term &#8211; which could refer 
</p>
<p>to either human security or national security, and therefore be a limitation to a recognized 
</p>
<p>right &#8211; and reiterating that the declaration was not about the three pillars of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Article 2 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Chairperson-Rapporteur pointed out that article 2 focused on the role that States 
</p>
<p>had to play to promote and protect justice and the rule of law, and to guarantee freedom 
</p>
<p>from fear and want, all elements that contributed to peacebuilding. He added that the article 
</p>
<p>was grounded in the key notion of human dignity. 
</p>
<p>65. Support was expressed for the draft article and for its action-oriented language. 
</p>
<p>Several delegations by contrast sought to reinforce the declarative nature of the text. </p>


<p>66. Several delegations proposed adding specific language that referred to such notions 
</p>
<p>as friendship and cooperation, the security of citizens, social justice and democracy, and 
</p>
<p>moderation and tolerance. An alternative text for article 1 was also proposed, reflecting the 
</p>
<p>fact that peace resulted from a systematic process, and drawing on language from the 
</p>
<p>Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. 
</p>
<p>67. Extensive discussions were held on new proposals to include elements relating to the 
</p>
<p>creation and promotion of peace zones as a means to ensure the enjoyment of the right to 
</p>
<p>peace; the development of peace education programmes; and the removal of obstacles to 
</p>
<p>peace, such as unilateral coercive measures. A number of delegations felt that the concept 
</p>
<p>of peace zones was insufficiently defined to be included in a United Nations declaration, 
</p>
<p>and they also objected to the reference to the right to peace in the proposed article. 
</p>
<p>Reference to peace education programmes received support from several delegations, while 
</p>
<p>others considered the wording to be too prescriptive. Suggestions were made to either move 
</p>
<p>the reference to the preamble or to list it as an example of possible actions by States in 
</p>
<p>implementing the declaration in article 3. The suggestion to add comprehensive history 
</p>
<p>education based on truth was also considered. 
</p>
<p>68. Participating non-governmental organizations, which were given an opportunity to 
</p>
<p>make statements during the first reading of the revised text, pointed out the relevance of the 
</p>
<p>afore-mentioned proposals, and one organization stated that States should be encouraged to 
</p>
<p>report on how they contributed to the process towards establishing peace. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Article 3 
</b></p>
<p>69. Before opening the discussion on article 3, the Chairperson-Rapporteur explained 
</p>
<p>that the article referred to the actors responsible for implementing the declaration and for 
</p>
<p>providing assistance. 
</p>
<p>70. Some felt that the article should principally be directed to the United Nations and its 
</p>
<p>specialized agencies, which should be encouraged to work together to achieve the goals of 
</p>
<p>the declaration, and not include a list of other actors. Some delegations also expressed a 
</p>
<p>preference for having a short and concise text, and provided concrete language to 
</p>
<p>streamline the wording. Others supported the explicit inclusion of civil society. It was also 
</p>
<p>suggested that States be included among the actors. 
</p>
<p>71. Participating non-governmental organizations, which were given an opportunity to 
</p>
<p>comment during the first reading of the revised text, stressed the importance of including all 
</p>
<p>actors in the promotion of peace. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Article 4 
</b></p>
<p>72. A number of delegations expressed concern at the list of instruments mentioned in 
</p>
<p>article 4 of the revised text as a reference to guarantee a human rights approach to the 
</p>
<p>declaration. Some felt that it brought legally binding texts and soft law to the same level, 
</p>
<p>while others pointed out that the ratification status of the various instruments under the 
</p>
<p>legal system of each State should not interfere with the interpretation of the text of the 
</p>
<p>declaration. Some delegations proposed the deletion of the reference to regional 
</p>
<p>instruments, while others preferred to maintain it. New language was suggested as a way to 
</p>
<p>reduce the complexity of the article and to clarify its legal implication for States. Some 
</p>
<p>delegations provided amendments to streamline the wording of the article. </p>


<p><b> V. General comments by non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>73. At the 7th meeting, on 23 April 2015, non-governmental organizations presented 
</p>
<p>joint statements in which they called for the right to peace to be reaffirmed as a 
</p>
<p>fundamental human right and reiterated that the right to peace was solidly based on 
</p>
<p>international human rights law. They called upon delegations to adhere to their task of 
</p>
<p>drafting a declaration on the right to peace on the basis of consensus. 
</p>
<p>74. Participating non-governmental organizations welcomed the efforts made by 
</p>
<p>delegations to include peace education, and further reiterated previous proposals made to 
</p>
<p>include elements in the draft declaration on disarmament and on the prohibition of the use 
</p>
<p>of force. It was hoped that a meaningful declaration could be adopted, which would 
</p>
<p>constitute a starting point to materialize the right to peace. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusion of the session 
</b></p>
<p>75. At its 8th meeting, on 24 April 2015, the working group reconvened in a formal 
</p>
<p>setting to conclude its work. 
</p>
<p>76. At the request of delegations, the Chairperson-Rapporteur presented a revised text of 
</p>
<p>a draft declaration (see annex), based on the discussions held at the third session of the 
</p>
<p>working group, which was discussed in an informal setting.  
</p>
<p>77. One delegation felt that the right to development was insufficiently reflected in the 
</p>
<p>Chairperson&#8217;s text. Some delegations also pointed that the following proposals, which they 
</p>
<p>had put forward, had not been discussed or integrated into the text: 
</p>
<p>&#61623; &#8220;Convinced that the elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of 
</p>
<p>mass destruction, including through the establishment of weapons of mass-destruction-free 
</p>
<p>zones, contribute positively to the pursuit of durable and sustainable world peace&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#61623; &#8220;States should respect and put into practice the principles and purposes of the 
</p>
<p>Charter of the United Nations in their relations with all other States irrespective of their 
</p>
<p>political, economic or social systems or their size, geographical location or level of 
</p>
<p>economic development&#8221; 
</p>
<p>&#61623; &#8220;Affirming that a world free from weapons of mass destruction would greatly 
</p>
<p>contribute to the realization of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations&#8221; 
</p>
<p>78. The Chairperson-Rapporteur explained that he intended to include his conclusions 
</p>
<p>and recommendations in the report on the status of negotiations on a draft declaration as of 
</p>
<p>the conclusion of the third session of the working group. He added that he was not in a 
</p>
<p>position to make any commitment to continuing the present mandate in the future. 
</p>
<p>79. In the general comments made at the conclusion of the session, a number of 
</p>
<p>delegations expressed their sincere gratitude for the leadership, flexibility and efforts 
</p>
<p>demonstrated by the Chairperson-Rapporteur in working with all parties towards consensus. 
</p>
<p>Appreciation was also expressed for the contributions made by non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations and the support provided to the Chairperson-Rapporteur and the working 
</p>
<p>group by the secretariat throughout the third session. While some disappointment was 
</p>
<p>expressed with the outcome of the working group, it was nevertheless felt that progress had 
</p>
<p>been made. Several delegations and non-governmental organizations taking the floor 
</p>
<p>expressed the hope that work would continue and an agreement would be reached in the 
</p>
<p>near future. </p>


<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations of the Chairperson-
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Chairperson-Rapporteur acknowledged the respectful atmosphere and 
</b></p>
<p><b>spirit of dialogue and cooperation seen during the third session of the working group 
</b></p>
<p><b>while moving towards a consensual outcome. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Chairperson-Rapporteur pointed out that, unfortunately, such an 
</b></p>
<p><b>agreement could not be reached and, for that reason, recommended that the Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights Council conduct an assessment of whether the international community was in 
</b></p>
<p><b>a position to develop further the right to peace in a consensual manner at this point in 
</b></p>
<p><b>time. 
</b></p>
<p><b> VIII. Adoption of the report 
</b></p>
<p>82. At its 8th meeting, on 24 April 2015, the working group adopted the draft report on 
</p>
<p>its third session ad referendum and decided to entrust the Chairperson-Rapporteur with its 
</p>
<p>finalization.
