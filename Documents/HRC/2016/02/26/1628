<p><b>25/&#8230;  Ending violence against children: a global call to make the 
invisible visible 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided </i>by the Charter of the United Nations, and reaffirming the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other 
relevant international human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that the Convention on the Rights of the Child constitutes the standard 
in the promotion and protection of the rights of the child, bearing in mind the optional 
protocols thereto on the involvement of children in armed conflict and on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography, and reaffirming its provisions, purposes 
and principles, in particular its article 19, and the obligations of State parties thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that the general principles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
including the best interests of the child, non-discrimination, survival, development and 
participation, provide the framework for all actions concerning children, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>all previous resolutions on the rights of the child of the Commission on 
Human Rights, the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly relevant to the issue 
of violence against children, the most recent being Council resolution 22/32 of 22 March 
2013 and Assembly resolution 68/147 of 18 December 2013, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Welcoming </i>the work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
Violence against Children to promote the prevention and elimination of all forms of 
violence against children in all regions and to advance the implementation of the 
recommendations of the United Nations study on violence against children,1 and taking 
note with appreciation of her 2013 Global Survey on violence against children, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking</i> <i>note with interest</i> of the work done by the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child in relation to the right of the child to freedom from all forms of violence, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with appreciation</i> the work carried out by all relevant organs, bodies, 
entities, organizations, agencies, funds, programmes and mechanisms of the United Nations 
system, within their respective mandates, by relevant regional organizations and by civil 
society, including non-governmental organizations, to promote and protect the rights of the 
child and to end violence against children,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> in this regard the launch in 2013 by the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
of the End Violence against Children global initiative &#8220;Make the Invisible Visible&#8221;, and 
recognizing the role the Human Rights Council can play to support such initiatives, with a 
view to building awareness of the importance of preventing and ending violence against 
children, including in the context of the ongoing discussion on the post-2015 development 
agenda, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the serious immediate and long-term consequences of violence on 
children, both physical and psychological, affecting their development and their ability to 
learn and socialize, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that States have the primary responsibility to promote and protect 
human rights and to take appropriate measures to protect the child from all forms of 
physical or mental violence, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that the family has the primary responsibility for the nurturing and 
protection of children, in the best interests of the child, and that children, for the full and 
harmonious development of their personality, should grow up in a society, in a family 
environment and in an atmosphere of happiness, love, understanding and non-violence, 
</p>
<p><i>Stressing</i> that, in order to prevent violence against children and to effectively 
respond to the need to combat all forms and manifestations of such violence in all settings, 
it is crucial to mobilize State institutions, national human rights institutions, civil society 
and other relevant stakeholders to make it visible, and to undertake actions and measures to 
ensure children&#8217;s protection from violence, including through appropriate legislative 
measures, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> all forms of violence against children, and reaffirms that 
these are unjustifiable and preventable; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Urges</i> States to protect children from all forms of violence or abuse in all 
settings, to give priority to prevention and to raise awareness of the negative effects of 
violence against children, as well as to strive to change attitudes that condone or normalize 
any form of violence against children; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Decides</i> to convene, at its twenty-seventh session, a panel discussion on ways 
and means of accelerating global efforts to end violence against children, with a particular 
focus on how to better prevent violence and protect children as a global priority and cross-
cutting concern, and to share best practices and lessons learned in this regard; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>4. <i>Requests </i>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
organize the panel discussion and to liaise with States, the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on Violence against Children, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund and 
relevant United Nations bodies, agencies, treaty bodies and special procedures and regional 
human rights mechanisms, as well as civil society, including non-governmental 
organizations and national human rights institutions, with a view to ensuring their 
participation in the panel discussion; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also requests</i> the High Commissioner to prepare a summary report on the 
discussions of the panel, and to submit it to the Human Rights Council before its twenty-
eighth session.
