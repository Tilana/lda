this report. As used in this document:
·ARO:  asset retirement obligation.
·Bbl or Bbls:  barrel or barrels of oil or natural gas liquids.
·BOE:  barrel of oil equivalent, determined by using the ratio of one Bbl of oil or NGLs to six Mcf of gas.  The
ratio of one barrel of oil or NGL to six Mcf of natural gas is commonly used in the industry and represents
the approximate energy equivalence of oil or NGLs to natural gas, and does not represent the economic
equivalency of oil and NGLs to natural gas. The sales price of a barrel of oil or NGLs is considerably higher
than the sales price of six Mcf of natural gas.
·BBtu: billion Btu.
·BOE/d:  BOE per day.
·Btu:  a British thermal unit, which is a measure of the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of
one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit.
·GAAP: Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States.
·Henry Hub: A natural gas pipeline delivery point that serves as the benchmark natural gas price underlying
NYMEX natural gas futures contracts.
·LIBOR:  London Interbank Offered Rate.
·LOE:  lease operating expense.
·MBbls:  thousand barrels of oil.
·MBOE:  thousand BOE.
·Mcf:  thousand cubic feet of natural gas.
·MMBtu:  million Btu.
·MMcf:  million cubic feet of natural gas.
·NGL or NGLs:  natural gas liquids, such as ethane, propane, butanes and natural gasoline that are
extracted from natural gas production streams.
·NYMEX:  New York Mercantile Exchange.
·Oil: includes crude oil and condensate.
·SEC:  United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
·WTI: West Texas Intermediate grade crude oil, used as a pricing benchmark for sales contracts and
NYMEX oil futures contracts.
With respect to information relating to our working interest in wells or acreage, “net” oil and gas wells or
acreage is determined by multiplying gross wells or acreage by our working interest therein. Unless
otherwise specified, all references to wells and acres are gross.

Note 1 - Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
Description of business
Callon Petroleum Company is an independent oil and natural gas company established in 1950. The
Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 1994 and succeeded to the business
of a publicly traded limited partnership, a joint venture with a consortium of European investors and an
independent energy company partially owned by a member of current management. As used herein, the
“Company,” “Callon,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Callon Petroleum Company and its predecessors and
subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise.
Callon is focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional onshore,
oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. The Company’s operations to date have
been predominantly focused on horizontal drilling of several prospective intervals, including multiple levels
of the Wolfcamp formation and, more recently, the Lower Spraberry shale in the Midland Basin. Callon has
assembled a multi-year inventory of potential horizontal well locations and intends to add to this inventory
through delineation drilling of emerging zones on our existing acreage and acquisition of additional
locations through working interest acquisitions, acreage purchases, joint ventures and asset swaps.
Basis of presentation
Unless otherwise indicated, all dollar amounts included within the Footnotes to the Financial Statements are
presented in thousands, except for per share and per unit data.
The interim consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with (1)
GAAP, (2) the SEC’s instructions to Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and (3) Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X,
and include the accounts of Callon Petroleum Company, and its subsidiary, Callon Petroleum Operating
Company (“CPOC”). CPOC also has subsidiaries, namely Callon Offshore Production, Inc. and Mississippi
Marketing, Inc.
These interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has
been derived from the audited financial statements at that date. Operating results for the periods presented
are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all
adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments and all intercompany account and transaction
eliminations, necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position, the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the periods indicated. Certain prior year amounts may have been reclassified to conform to
current year presentation.

Recently issued accounting policies
In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued accounting standards update No. 2016-
09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting (“ASU 2016-09”). The standard is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for
share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as
either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows, and will allow companies to
estimate the number of stock awards expected to vest. The guidance in ASU 2016-09 is effective for public
entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
therein. Early adoption is permitted and is to be applied on retrospective basis. The Company is currently
evaluating the method of adoption and impact this standard may have on its financial statements and related
disclosures.
Recently adopted accounting policies
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes
(“ASU 2015-17”), which eliminates the current requirement to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as
current and noncurrent amounts on the balance sheet. Instead, entities will be required to classify all
deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The guidance in ASU 2015-17 is
effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim
periods within those annual periods. Early application is permitted. As of June 30, 2016, the Company
adopted this ASU, which does not have a material impact on its financial statements.
Note 2 – Oil and Natural Gas Properties
The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its exploration and development activities. Under
this method of accounting, the cost of both successful and unsuccessful exploration and development
activities are capitalized as oil and gas properties. Such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping
productive wells, dry hole costs, lease acquisition costs, delay rentals, interest capitalized on unevaluated
leases, other costs related to exploration and development activities, and site restoration, dismantlement
and abandonment costs capitalized in accordance with asset retirement obligation accounting
guidance. Costs capitalized also include any internal costs that are directly related to exploration and
development activities, including salaries and benefits, but do not include any costs related to production,
general corporate overhead or similar activities.
Under full cost accounting rules, the Company reviews the carrying value of its proved oil and natural gas
properties each quarter. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of
accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the
present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves, discounted at
10%, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unevaluated properties, net of related tax effects (the full cost
ceiling). These rules require pricing based on the preceding 12-months’ average oil and natural gas prices
based on closing prices on the first day of each month and require a write-down if the net capitalized costs of
proved oil and natural gas properties exceeds the full cost ceiling. At June 30, 2016, the prices used in
determining the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves were $40.62 per barrel of oil and $2.46
per Mcf of natural gas. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized write-
downs of oil and natural gas properties of $61,012 and $95,788, respectively, as a result of the ceiling test
limitation.
Note 3 - Acquisitions
Acquisitions were accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, which involves determining the
fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed under the income approach.
2016 acquisitions
On May 26, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of 17,298 gross (14,089 net) acres primarily
located in Howard County, Texas from BSM Energy LP, Crux Energy LP and Zaniah Energy LP, for total
cash consideration of $220,000 and 9,333,333 shares of common stock for a total purchase price of
$329,573,  excluding customary purchase price adjustments (the “Big Star Transaction”). The Company
acquired an 81% average working interest (61% average net revenue interest) in the properties acquired in
the Big Star Transaction.

The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to change based on numerous factors, including the
final adjusted purchase price and the final estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. Any such adjustments to the preliminary estimates of fair value could be material. The following
table summarizes the estimated acquisition date fair values of the net assets to be acquired in the
acquisition (in thousands):

The following unaudited summary pro forma financial information for the three and six months ended June
30, 2016 has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the
Company’s results of operations would have been if the Big Star Transaction had occurred as presented, or
to project the Company’s results of operations for any future periods. The pro forma financial information
was prepared assuming the Big Star Transaction occurred as of January 1, 2015. The pro forma
adjustments are based on available information and certain assumptions that management believes are
reasonable, including those pertaining to revenue, lease operating expenses, production taxes,
depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, accretion expense, interest expense and capitalized
interest.

From the date of the acquisition through the period ended June 30, 2016, the properties associated with the
Big Star Transaction have been comingled with our existing properties and it is impractical to provide the
stand-alone operational results related to these properties.
On May 16, 2016, the Company completed the following transactions (collectively, the “AMI Transaction”) for
an aggregate cash purchase price of $33,012,  excluding customary purchase price adjustments. Key
elements of the AMI Transaction include:
·Formation of an area of mutual interest with TRP Energy, LLC (“TRP”) in western Reagan County, Texas,
through the joint acquisition from a private party of 4,745 net acres (with a 55% share to Callon) north of the
Garrison Draw field; and

Credit Facility with a maturity date of March 11, 2019.  JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is Administrative Agent,
and participants include several institutional lenders. The total notional amount available under the Credit
Facility is $500,000. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility may

not exceed the borrowing base, which is generally reviewed on a semi-annual basis. As of June 30, 2016,
 the Credit Facility’s borrowing base was $300,000. The Credit Facility is secured by first preferred
mortgages covering the Company’s major producing properties.
As of June 30, 2016, there was  a $40,000 balance outstanding on the Credit Facility. For the quarter ended
June 30, 2016, the Credit Facility had a weighted-average interest rate of 2.21%, calculated as the LIBOR
plus a tiered rate ranging from 1.75% to 2.75%, which is determined based on utilization of the facility. In
addition, the Credit Facility carries a commitment fee of 0.5% per annum, payable quarterly, on the unused
portion of the borrowing base.
Effective July 13, 2016, the Credit Facility’s borrowing base was increased to $385,000 and the Company’s
capacity to hedge oil and natural gas volumes was effectively increased with a change in the capacity
calculation to a percentage of total proved reserves from proved producing reserves. In addition, the interest
rate for borrowings under the Credit Facility was increased 0.25% across all tiers of the pricing grid, resulting
in a range of interest costs equal to LIBOR plus 2.00% to 3.00%. There were no modifications to other terms
or covenants of the Credit Facility.
Secured second lien term loan (the “Term Loan”)
On October 8, 2014, the Company entered into the Term Loan with an aggregate amount of up to $300,000
and a maturity date of October 8, 2021. The Royal Bank of Canada is Administrative Agent, and participants
include several institutional lenders. The Term Loan may be prepaid at the Company’s option, subject to a
prepayment premium. The prepayment amount (i) is 102% if the prepayment event occurs prior to October 8,
2016, (ii) 101% if the prepayment event occurs on or after October 8, 2016 but before October 8, 2017, and
(iii) is 100% for prepayments made on or after October 8, 2017. The Term Loan is secured by junior liens on
properties mortgaged under the Credit Facility, subject to an intercreditor agreement.
As of June 30, 2016, the balance outstanding on the Term Loan was $300,000 with an interest rate of 8.5%,
calculated at a rate of LIBOR (subject to a floor rate of 1.0%) plus 7.5% per annum. The Company can elect
a LIBOR rate based on various tenors, and is currently incurring interest based on an underlying three-
month LIBOR rate, which was last elected in July 2016.
Restrictive covenants
The Company’s Credit Facility and Term Loan contain various covenants including restrictions on additional
indebtedness, payment of cash dividends and maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in
compliance with these covenants at June 30, 2016.
Note 6 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices received for its production.
Consequently, the Company believes it is prudent to manage the variability in cash flows on a portion of its
oil and natural gas production. The Company utilizes a mix of collars, swaps, puts, calls and similar
derivative financial instruments to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in commodity
prices. The Company does not use these instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
Counterparty risk and offsetting
The use of derivative instruments exposes the Company to the risk that a counterparty will be unable to
meet its commitments. While the Company monitors counterparty creditworthiness on an ongoing basis, it
cannot predict sudden changes in counterparties’ creditworthiness. In addition, even if such changes are not
sudden, the Company may be limited in its ability to mitigate an increase in counterparty credit risk. Should
one of these counterparties not perform, the Company may not realize the benefit of some of its derivative
instruments under lower commodity prices while continuing to be obligated under higher commodity price
contracts subject to any right of offset under the agreements. Counterparty credit risk is considered when
determining the fair value of a derivative instrument; see Note 7 for additional information regarding fair
value.

The Company executes commodity derivative contracts under master agreements that have netting
provisions that provide for offsetting assets against liabilities. In general, if a party to a derivative transaction
incurs an event of default, as defined in the applicable agreement, the other party will have the right to
demand the posting of collateral, demand a cash payment transfer or terminate the arrangement.
Financial statement presentation and settlements
Settlements of the Company’s derivative instruments are based on the difference between the contract price
or prices specified in the derivative instrument and a benchmark price, such as the NYMEX price. To
determine the fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments, the Company utilizes present value
methods that include assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets.
See Note 7 for additional information regarding fair value.
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments
The Company records its derivative contracts at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and records
changes in fair value as a gain or loss on derivative contracts in the consolidated statements of operations.
Cash settlements are also recorded as gain or loss on derivative contracts in the consolidated statements of
operations.

Note 7 - Fair Value Measurements
The fair value hierarchy included in GAAP gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs, which consist of
unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 inputs consist of quoted prices
for similar instruments. Level 3 valuations are derived from inputs that are significant and unobservable, and
these valuations have the lowest priority.
Fair value of financial instruments
Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted investments. The carrying amounts for these instruments
approximate fair value due to the short-term nature or maturity of the instruments.
Debt. The carrying amount of the Company’s floating-rate debt approximated fair value because the interest
rates were variable and reflective of market rates.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance
sheet. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair value:
Commodity derivative instruments. The fair value of commodity derivative instruments is derived using an
income approach valuation model that utilizes market-corroborated inputs that are observable over the term
of the derivative contract. The Company’s fair value calculations also incorporate an estimate of the
counterparties’ default risk for derivative assets and an estimate of the Company’s default risk for derivative
liabilities. The Company believes that the majority of the inputs used to calculate the commodity derivative
instruments fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy based on the wide availability of quoted market
prices for similar commodity derivative contracts. See Note 6 for additional information regarding the
Company’s derivative instruments.
The following tables present the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis:

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
Acquisitions.  As discussed in Note 3, the Company completed three acquisitions during the six months
ended June 30, 2016. The Company determined the fair value of the assets acquired using the income
approach based on expected future cash flows from estimated reserve quantities, costs to produce and
develop reserves, and oil and gas forward prices. The fair value measurements were based on level 2 and
level 3 inputs.
Note 8 - Income Taxes
The Company typically provides for income taxes at a statutory rate of 35% adjusted for permanent
differences expected to be realized, which primarily relate to non-deductible executive compensation
expenses and state income taxes. As a result of the write-down of oil and natural gas properties in the latter
part of 2015 the Company incurred a cumulative three year loss. Because of the impact the cumulative loss
has on the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets through future earnings, the Company
assessed the ability to realize its deferred tax assets based on the future reversals of existing deferred tax
liabilities. Accordingly, the Company established a valuation allowance for a portion of the deferred tax
asset. The valuation allowance was $147,540 as of June 30, 2016.

Certain of the Company’s operating agreements require that assets be restricted for abandonment
obligations. Amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2016 as long-term restricted
investments were $3,323. These assets, which primarily include short-term U.S. Government securities, are
held in abandonment trusts dedicated to pay future abandonment costs.
Note 10 - Equity Transactions
10% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock (“Preferred Stock”)
Holders of the Company’s Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our Board of
Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at a rate of
10.0% per annum of the $50.00 liquidation preference per share (equivalent to $5.00 per annum per share).
Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December
when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. Preferred Stock dividends were $1,823 and  $1,973  for
the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $3,647 and $3,947 for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or other mandatory
redemption. On or after May 30, 2018, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Preferred Stock, in whole
or in part, by paying $50.00 per share in cash, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends to the redemption
date.
Following a change of control in which the Company or the acquirer no longer have a class of common
securities listed on a national exchange, the Company will have the option to redeem the Preferred Stock, in
whole but not in part for $50.00 per share in cash, plus accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not
declared), to the redemption date. If the Company does not exercise its option to redeem the Preferred Stock
upon such change of control, the holders of the Preferred Stock have the option to convert the Preferred
Stock into
15
Callon Petroleum
Company
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Table of
Contents
a number of shares of the Company’s common stock based on the value of the common stock on the date of
the change of control as determined under the certificate of designations for the Preferred Stock. If the
change of control occurred on June 30, 2016, and the Company did not exercise its right to redeem the
Preferred Stock, using the closing price of $11.23 as the value of a share of common stock, each share of
Preferred Stock would be convertible into approximately 4.5 shares of common stock. If the Company
exercises its redemption rights relating to shares of Preferred Stock, the holders of Preferred Stock will not
have the conversion right described above.
On February 4, 2016,  the Company exchanged a total of 120,000 shares of Preferred Stock for 719,000
shares of common stock. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had 1,458,948 shares of its Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding.
Common stock
On March 9, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 15,250,000 shares of its
common stock for total net proceeds (after the underwriting discounts and estimated offering costs)  of
approximately $94,973.
On April 25, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of 25,300,000 shares of its
common stock for total estimated net proceeds (after the underwriter’s discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses) of approximately $205,874. Proceeds from the offering were used to fund the
May 2016 acquisitions described in Note 3.
On May 26, 2016, the Company issued 9,333,333 shares of common stock to partially fund the Big Star
Transaction, described in Note 3, at an assumed offering price of $11.74 per share, which is the last
reported sale price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on that date.
Note 11 - Other
Operating leases
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had contracts for two horizontal drilling rigs (the “Cactus 1 Rig” and
“Cactus 2 Rig”). The contract terms of the Cactus 1 Rig and Cactus 2 Rig will end in July 2018 and August
2018, respectively. The rig lease agreements include early termination provisions that obligate the
Company to pay reduced minimum rentals for the remaining term of the agreement. These payments would
be reduced assuming the lessor is able to re-charter the rig and staffing personnel to another lessee. In
January 2016, the Company decided to place its Cactus 1 Rig on standby and is required to pay a “standby”
day rate of $15,000 per day, pursuant to the terms of the agreement,  allowing the Company to retain the
option to return the rig to service under the contract terms.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
General
The following management’s discussion and analysis describes the principal factors affecting the
Company’s results of operations, liquidity, capital resources and contractual cash obligations. This
discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial
statements and our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which include additional information about our
business practices, significant accounting policies, risk factors, and the transactions that underlie our
financial results. Our Web site address is www.callon.com. All of our filings with the SEC are available free
of charge through our Web site as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them with, or furnish them to,
the SEC. Information on our Web site does not form part of this report on Form 10-Q.
We are an independent oil and natural gas company established in 1950. We are focused on the
acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore, oil and natural gas
reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas, and more specifically, the Midland Basin. Our operating
culture is centered on responsible development of hydrocarbon resources, safety and the environment,
which we believe strengthens our operational performance. Our drilling activity is predominantly focused on
the horizontal development of several prospective intervals, including multiple levels of the Wolfcamp
formation and, more recently, the Lower Spraberry shale. We have assembled a multi-year inventory of
potential horizontal well locations and intend to add to this inventory through delineation drilling of emerging
zones on our existing acreage and acquisition of additional locations through working interest acquisitions,
acreage purchases, joint ventures and asset swaps. Our production was approximately 78% oil and 22%
natural gas for the six months ended June 30, 2016. On June 30, 2016, our net acreage position in the
Permian Basin was approximately  33,734 net acres.
Commodity Prices
The prices for oil and natural gas remain extremely volatile and sometimes experience large fluctuations as
a result of relatively small changes in supply, weather conditions, economic conditions and actions by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other countries and government actions. Prices of oil
and natural gas will affect the following aspects of our business:
·our revenues, cash flows and earnings;
·the amount of oil and natural gas that we are economically able to produce;
·our ability to attract capital to finance our operations and cost of the capital;
·the amount we are allowed to borrow under our senior secured revolving credit facility; and
·the value of our oil and natural gas properties.
Beginning in the second half of 2014, the NYMEX price for a barrel of oil declined from $105.37 on June 30,
2014 to $40.06  on  August 1, 2016. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the average NYMEX price
for a barrel of oil was $45.59 per Bbl compared to $57.95 per Bbl for the same period of 2015. The NYMEX
price for a barrel of oil ranged from a low of $35.70 per Bbl to a high of $51.23 per Bbl for the three months
ended June 30, 2016.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the average NYMEX price for natural gas was $1.95 per MMBtu
compared to $2.64 per MMBtu for the same period in 2015. The NYMEX price for natural gas ranged from a
low of $1.90 per MMBtu to a high of $2.92 per MMBtu for the three months ended June 30, 2016.
The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its exploration and development activities. Under
full cost accounting rules, the Company reviews the carrying value of its proved oil and natural gas
properties each quarter. Under these rules, capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, net of
accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and deferred income taxes, may not exceed the
present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves, discounted at
10%, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unevaluated properties, net of related tax effects (the full cost
ceiling). These rules generally require pricing based on the preceding 12-months’ average oil and natural
gas prices based on closing prices on the first day of each month and require a write-down if the net
capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties exceeds the full cost ceiling. At June 30, 2016, the
realized prices used in determining the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves were $40.62
per barrel of oil and $2.46 per Mcf of natural gas (including the value of NGLs in the natural gas stream). For
the three and six months ended June 30,
19

Contents
2016, the Company recognized a write-downs of oil and natural gas properties of $61  million and $95.8
million, respectively, as a result of the ceiling test limitation. Based on prevailing commodity prices in the
current environment, we expect to incur additional ceiling test write-downs in the future. However, we do not
expect such prevailing commodity prices to have significant adverse effects on our proved oil and gas
reserves. See Note 2  in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for more information.
The table below presents the cumulative results of the full cost ceiling test for 2016 as of June 30, 2016,
along with various pricing scenarios to demonstrate the sensitivity of our full cost ceiling to changes in 12-
month average oil and natural gas prices. This sensitivity analysis is as of June 30, 2016,  and accordingly,
does not consider drilling results, production, changes in oil and natural gas prices, and changes in future
development and operating costs subsequent to June 30, 2016 that may require revisions to our proved
reserve estimates and resulting estimated future net cash flows used in the full cost ceiling test.

Operational Highlights
Our production grew 41%  and 44% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,  respectively,
compared to the same periods of 2015,  increasing to 1,224 MBOE from 866 MBOE and 2,357 MBOE from
1,637 MBOE for the comparative three and six months periods, respectively.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we drilled 6 gross (3.7 net) horizontal wells and completed 5
gross (3.4 net) horizontal wells. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we drilled 11 gross (8.0 net)
horizontal wells and completed 14 gross (10.5 net) horizontal wells. As of June 30, 2016, we had 6 gross
(4.2 net) horizontal wells awaiting completion, including 2 gross drilled, uncompleted wells recently
acquired.
As of June 30, 2016, we had 413 gross (323.5 net) working interest oil wells, 3 gross (0.1 net) royalty interest
oil wells and no natural gas wells. A well is categorized as an oil well or a natural gas well based upon the
ratio of oil to natural gas reserves on a BOE basis. However, most of our wells produce both oil and natural
gas.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Historically, our primary sources of capital have been cash flows from operations, borrowings from financial
institutions, the sale of debt and equity securities and asset dispositions. Our primary uses of capital have
been for the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas properties, in
addition to refinancing of debt instruments.
During 2016, we completed two public common stock offerings to raise additional capital, and we continue
to evaluate other sources of capital to complement our cash flows from operations as we pursue our long-
term growth plan in the Permian Basin. As of June 30, 2016, there was  a $40 million balance outstanding
on the Credit Facility, and the borrowing base was increased  to $385 million on July 13, 2016.

Operating activities. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was
$37.5 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $30.0 million for the same period in
2015. The change was predominantly attributable to the following:
·A  15% increase in revenue offset by a loss on settlement of derivative contracts;  
·An increase in payments on cash-settled restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards;
·A decrease in payments related to nonrecurring early retirement expenses that were incurred in 2015; and
·A change related to the timing of working capital payments and receipts.
Production, realized prices, and operating expenses are discussed below in Results of Operations. See
Notes 6 and 7 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the components of the
Company’s derivative contracts and disclosures related to derivative instruments including their composition
and valuation.
Investing activities. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was
$335.7 million compared to $130.5 million for the same period in 2015. The $205.2 million increase in cash
used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the following:
·A  $54.9 million decrease in operational expenditures due to the transition from a two-rig to a one-rig
program in January 2016, offset in part by the release of a vertical rig in April 2015; and
·A $258.9 million increase driven by various acquisitions, net of proceeds from the sale of mineral interest
and equipment, during the six months ended months June 30, 2016. The acquisitions were funded with
cash and common stock.
See Note 3 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s
acquisitions.

(a)On an accrual (GAAP) basis, which is the methodology used for establishing our annual capital budget,
operational expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $56.2 million. Inclusive of
capitalized general and administrative and interest costs, total capital expenditures were $71.1 million.

General and administrative expenses and capitalized interest are discussed below in Results of Operations.
See Note 3 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information on acquisitions.
Financing activities. We finance a portion of our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and
acquisitions with borrowings under our Credit Facility, term debt and equity offerings. For the six months
ended June 30, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $297.2 million compared to cash
provided by financing activities of $101.6 million during the same period of 2015.  The change in net cash
provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the following:
·Payments, net of borrowings, on our Credit Facility netted to zero,  $40 million less than the same period of
2015; and
·A  $235.3 million increase in proceeds resulting from common stock offerings in March and April 2016 as
compared to proceeds resulting from a common stock offering in March 2015.
See Notes 5 and 10 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information on our debt and
equity offerings.
Operational Capital Budget and Second Quarter Summary
Subsequent to the acquisitions made during the second quarter 2016 (see Note 3 in the Footnotes to the
Financial Statements), our operational capital guidance was updated from $75 to $80 million to $95 to $105
million, which reflects an increase in expenditures related to incremental completions and infrastructure
investments for future development of the acquired properties. In early August 2016, we announced an
increase of our operational capital guidance to $140 million. The increased guidance reflects expenditures
related to the reactivation of our idled second drilling rig that will be primarily in the WildHorse operating
area, and increased infrastructure investments to accommodate development in this area.
Operational capital expenditures on an accrual basis were $21.3 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016. In addition to the operational capital expenditures, $14.9 million of capitalized general and
administrative and capitalized interest expenses were accrued in the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Based upon current commodity price expectations for 2016, we believe that our cash flow from operations
and available borrowings under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our remaining 2016 capital
program, including working capital requirements.

Oil revenue
For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, oil revenues of $40.6 million increased $4.5 million, or 12%, compared
to revenues of $36.1 million for the same period of 2015.  The increase in oil revenue was primarily
attributable to a 38% increase in production offset by a 19% decrease in the average realized sales price,
which fell to $42.78 per Bbl from $52.69 per Bbl. The increase in production was primarily attributable to an
increased number of producing wells from our horizontal drilling program and acquisitions, offset by normal
and expected declines from our existing wells.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, oil revenues of $68.0 million increased $4.0 million, or 6%,
compared to revenues of $64.0 million for the same period of 2015. The increase in oil revenue was
primarily attributable to a  39% increase in production, and was predominantly offset by a  24% decrease in
the average realized sales price, which fell to $36.96 per Bbl from $48.38 per Bbl. The increase in
production was primarily attributable to an increased number of producing wells from our horizontal drilling
program and acquisitions, offset by normal and expected declines from our existing wells.
Natural gas revenue (including NGLs)
Natural gas revenues of $4.6 million increased $1.4 million, or 46%, during the three months ended June 30,
2016,  compared to $3.1 million for the same period of 2015. The increase primarily relates to a  53%
increase in natural gas volumes and was predominantly offset by a  4% decrease in the average price
realized, which fell to $2.77 per Mcf from $2.90 per Mcf, reflecting decreases in both natural gas and natural
gas liquids prices. The increase in natural gas production was primarily attributable to an increased number
of producing wells as mentioned above, offset by normal and expected declines from our existing wells.
Natural gas revenues of $7.8 million increased $2.2 million, or 39%, during the six months ended,  June 30,
2016,  compared to $5.6 million for the same period of 2015. The increase primarily relates to a 65%
increase in natural gas volumes and was predominantly offset by an 15% decrease in the average price
realized, which fell to $2.53 per Mcf from $2.99 per Mcf, reflecting decreases in both natural gas and natural
gas liquids prices. The increase in natural gas production was primarily attributable to an increased number
of producing wells as mentioned above, offset by normal and expected declines from our existing wells.

Lease operating expenses. These are daily costs incurred to extract oil and natural gas out of the ground,
together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties. Such costs also include
maintenance, repairs and workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016,  LOE increased by 11% to $7.3 million compared to $6.6 million
for the same period of 2015.  For the three months ended June 30, 2016, LOE per BOE decreased
to $5.97 per BOE compared to $7.59 per BOE for the same period of 2015,  which was primarily attributable
to improving operational efficiency, reductions in workovers of vertical wells and working with our service
partners to achieve cost reductions. Higher production volumes also contributed to the 21% per BOE
decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in production was primarily attributable to
an increased number of producing wells as discussed above.
For the six months ended,  June 30, 2016, LOE increased by 5% to $14.3 million compared to $13.5 million
for the same period of 2015.  For the six months ended,  June 30, 2016, LOE per BOE decreased to $6.05
per BOE compared to $8.27 per BOE for the same period of 2015, which was primarily attributable to
improving operational efficiency and reduced vertical workovers, and other cost reductions as mentioned
above. Higher production volumes also contributed to the 27% per BOE decrease for the six months ended,
 June 30, 2016. The increase in production was primarily attributable to an increased number of producing
wells as discussed above.
Production taxes. Production taxes include severance and ad valorem taxes. In general, production taxes
are directly related to commodity price changes; however, severance taxes are based upon current year
commodity prices, whereas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices. Severance taxes
are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at fixed
rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. Where available, we benefit from tax credits
and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions. In the counties where our production is located, we are
also subject to ad valorem taxes, which are generally based on the taxing jurisdictions’ valuation of our oil
and gas properties.
Production taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by 17% to $2.5 million compared to
$3.0 million for the same period of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in ad valorem taxes
attributable to a lower valuation of our oil and gas properties by the taxing jurisdictions. The decrease was
offset by an increase in severance taxes, which was attributable to an increase

in revenue. On a per BOE basis, production taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by
41% compared to the same period of 2015.
Production taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by 10% to $4.7 million compared to
$5.2 million for the same period of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in ad valorem taxes
attributable to a lower valuation of our oil and gas properties by the taxing jurisdictions. The decrease was
offset by an increase in severance taxes, which was attributable to an increase in revenue. On a per BOE
basis, production taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by 38% compared to the same
period of 2015.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”). Under the full cost accounting method, we capitalize
costs within a cost center and then systematically expense those costs on a units-of-production basis based
on proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities. We calculate depletion on the following types of costs:
(i) all capitalized costs, other than the cost of investments in unevaluated properties, less accumulated
amortization; (ii) the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves; and (iii) the
estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of estimated salvage values. Depreciation of other
property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which
range from three to fifteen years.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016,  DD&A decreased 7% to $16.3 million compared to $17.6
million for the same period of 2015. For the three months ended June 30, 2016,  DD&A decreased 34% per
BOE to $13.31 per BOE compared to $20.31 per BOE for the same period of 2015.  The decrease is
attributable to our increased estimated proved reserves relative to our depreciable asset base and assumed
future development costs related to undeveloped proved reserves. The decrease in our depreciable base
was primarily related to the write-down of oil and natural gas properties during 2015 and the first quarter of
2016.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, DD&A decreased 10% to $32.0 million compared to $35.7 million
for the same period of 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, DD&A decreased 38% per BOE to
$13.58 per BOE compared to $21.80 per BOE for the same period of 2015. The decrease is attributable to
our increased estimated proved reserves relative to our depreciable asset base and assumed future
development costs related to undeveloped proved reserves. The decrease in our depreciable base was
primarily related to the write-down of oil and natural gas properties during 2015 and the first quarter of 2016.
General and administrative, net of amounts capitalized (“G&A”). These are costs incurred for overhead,
including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, severance and early retirement expenses, costs of
maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our production and development operations, franchise
taxes, depreciation of corporate level assets, public company costs, vesting of equity and liability awards
under share-based compensation plans and related mark-to-market valuation adjustments over time, fees
for audit and other professional services, and legal compliance.
G&A for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased to $6.3 million compared to $5.8 million for the
same period of 2015. G&A expenses for the periods indicated include the following (in millions):

Accretion expense. The Company is required to record the estimated fair value of liabilities for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated ARO costs. Interest is
accreted on the present value of the ARO and reported as accretion expense within operating expenses in
the consolidated statements of operations.
Accretion expense related to our ARO increased 195% and  68% for the three and six months ended June
30, 2016,  respectively, compared to the same periods of 2015. Accretion expense generally correlates with
the Company’s ARO, which was $6.1 million at June 30, 2016 as compared to $4.1 million at June 30, 2015.
See Note 9 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s
ARO.
Rig termination fee. During the first quarter of 2015, the Company recognized $3.1 million in expense
related to the early termination of the contract for its vertical rig. In March 2015, the Company decided to
terminate its one-year contract for a vertical rig (effective April 2015). The Company paid approximately $3.1
million in reduced rental payments over the remainder of the lease term, which ended November 2015.
Acquisition expense. Acquisition expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were related to
costs with respect to our acquisition efforts in the Permian Basin. See Note 3 in the Footnotes to the
Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s acquisitions.
Write-down of oil and natural gas properties. Under full cost accounting rules, the Company reviews the
carrying value of its proved oil and natural gas properties each quarter. Under these rules, capitalized costs
of oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and deferred
income taxes, may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and
natural gas reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair value of unevaluated properties, net of
related tax effects (the full cost ceiling amount). These rules require pricing based on the preceding 12-
months’ average oil and natural gas prices based on closing prices on the first day of each month and
require a write-down if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties exceeds the full cost
ceiling.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized write-downs of oil and natural
gas properties of $61 million and $95.8 million, respectively, as a result of the ceiling test limitation. No
write-down was recognized during the same periods of 2015. See Note 2 in the Footnotes to the Financial
Statements for additional information. Based on prevailing commodity prices in the current environment, we
could incur additional ceiling test write-downs in the future.

Interest expense, net of capitalized amounts.  We finance a portion of our working capital requirements,
capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings under our Credit Facility or with term debt. We incur
interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We reflect
interest paid to our lender in interest expense, net of capitalized amounts. In addition, we include the
amortization of deferred financing costs (including origination and amendment fees), commitment fees and
annual agency fees in interest expense.
Interest expense, net of capitalized amounts, incurred during the three months ended June 30,
2016 decreased $0.9 million compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to
a $0.8 million increase in capitalized interest compared to the 2015 period, resulting from a higher average
unevaluated property balance for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of
2015. The increase in unevaluated property was primarily due to acquisitions costs. Also contributing to the
decrease was a $0.1 million decrease in interest expense related to our debt.
Interest expense, net of capitalized amounts, incurred during the six months ended June 30,
2016 decreased $0.3 million compared to the same period of 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to
a $0.4 million increase in capitalized interest compared to the 2015 period, resulting from a higher average
unevaluated property balance for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of
2015. The increase in unevaluated property was primarily due to acquisitions costs. Offsetting the decrease
was a $0.1 million increase in interest expense related to our debt.
See Note 5 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information on our debt.
(Gain) loss on derivative contracts. We utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our
exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. This amount represents the (i) (gain) loss related to fair value
adjustments on our open derivative contracts and (ii) (gains) losses on settlements of derivative contracts for
positions that have settled within the period.

Income tax expense. The Company had no income tax expense for the three and six months ended June
30, 2016 compared to an income tax benefit of $2.1 million and $7.2 million for the same periods of 2015.
The change in income tax expense is primarily related to recording a valuation allowance of $147.5 million
at June 30, 2016 and the difference in the amount of income (loss) before income taxes between periods.
See Note 8 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information.
Preferred Stock dividends. Preferred Stock dividends for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 were $1.8 million and $3.6 million, respectively, as compared to $2.0 million and $3.9 million for the
same periods of 2015, respectively. The decrease was due to a decrease in the number of preferred shares
outstanding attributable to a partial share conversion in February 2016 in which the Company exchanged a
total of 120,000 shares of Preferred Stock for 719,000 shares of common stock. Dividends reflect a 10%
dividend rate. See Note 10 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for additional information.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
We are exposed to a variety of market risks including commodity price risk, interest rate risk and
counterparty and customer risk. We address these risks through a program of risk management including the
use of derivative instruments.
Commodity price risk
The Company’s revenues are derived from the sale of its oil and natural gas production. The prices for oil
and natural gas remain extremely volatile and sometimes experience large fluctuations as a result of
relatively small changes in supply, weather conditions, economic conditions and government actions. From
time to time, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage oil and natural gas price
risk, related both to NYMEX benchmark prices and regional basis differentials. The total volumes which we
hedge through use of our derivative instruments varies from period to period; however, generally our
objective is to hedge approximately 50%  to  75% of our anticipated internally forecast production for the
next 12 to 24 months, subject to the covenants under our Credit Facility. Our hedge policies and objectives
may change significantly with movements in commodities prices or futures prices, in addition to modification
of our capital spending plans related to operational activities and acquisitions.
The Company’s hedging portfolio, linked to NYMEX benchmark pricing, covers approximately 48% and
25% of our expected oil and natural gas production, respectively, for the remaining six months of 2016,
based on the midpoint of publicly disclosed guidance as of August 8, 2016, including the impact of pending
transactions. We  also have commodity hedging contracts linked to Midland WTI basis differentials relative
to Cushing covering approximately 32% of our expected oil production for the remaining six months of 2016,
based on the midpoint of publicly disclosed oil production guidance as of August 8, 2016, including the
impact of pending transactions. Our actual production may vary from the amounts estimated, perhaps
materially. See Note 6 in the Footnotes to the Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s
outstanding derivative contracts at June 30, 2016 and derivative contracts established subsequent to that
date.
The Company may utilize fixed price swaps, which reduce the Company’s exposure to decreases in
commodity prices and limit the benefit the Company might otherwise have received from any increases in
commodity prices. Swap contracts may also be enhanced by the simultaneous sale of call or put options to
effectively increase the effective swap price as a result of the receipt of premiums from the option sales.
The Company may utilize price collars to reduce the risk of changes in oil and natural gas prices. Under
these arrangements, no payments are due by either party as long as the applicable market price is above
the floor price (purchased put option) and below the ceiling price (sold call option) set in the collar. If the
price falls below the floor, the counter-party to the collar pays the difference to the Company, and if the price
rises above the ceiling, the counterparty receives the difference from the Company. Additionally, the
Company may sell put (or call) options at a price lower than the floor price (or higher than the ceiling price)
in conjunction with a collar (three-way collar) and use the proceeds to increase either or both the floor or
ceiling prices. In a three-way collar, to the extent that realized prices are below the floor price of the sold put
option (or above the ceiling price of the sold call option), the Company’s net realized benefit from the three-
way collar will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
The Company may purchase put options, which reduce the Company’s exposure to decreases in oil and
natural gas prices while allowing realization of the full benefit from any increases in oil and natural gas
prices. If the price falls below the floor, the counterparty pays the difference to the Company.
The Company enters into these various agreements from time to time to reduce the effects of volatile oil and
natural gas prices and does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Presently, none
of the Company’s derivative positions are designated as hedges for accounting purposes.
Interest rate risk
On June 30, 2016,  the Company’s debt consisted of $300 million of outstanding principal related to its Term
Loan and $40 million outstanding balance on our Credit Facility. The Company is subject to market risk
exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under the Term Loan and Credit Facility.
 As of June 30, 2016, the interest rate on our Term Loan borrowings was 8.50%. An increase or decrease of
1% in the interest rate would have a corresponding increase or decrease in our annual net income of
30
Callon Petroleum Company Table of Contents
approximately $3.4 million based on the $340 million outstanding in the aggregate under the Term Loan
on June 30, 2016.  The Company is also subject to market risk exposure related to changes in the
underlying LIBOR-based interest rate used for the Term Loan to the extent that available LIBOR election
options exceed the 1.0% floor rate. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more
information on the Company’s interest rates on debt.
Counterparty and customer credit risk
The Company’s principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables from the sale of our oil and natural
gas production, joint interest receivables and receivables resulting from derivative financial contracts.
The Company markets its oil and natural gas production to energy marketing companies. We are subject to
credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant
customers. We do not require any of our customers to post collateral, and the inability of our significant
customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial
results. At June 30, 2016 our total receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production were
approximately $30.6 million.
Joint interest receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate.
These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we have or
intend to drill. We have little ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells. At June 30,
2016 our joint interest receivables were approximately $12.4 million.
Our oil and natural gas derivative arrangements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties. Most of the counterparties on our derivative instruments currently in place are lenders under
our Credit Facility. We are likely to enter into additional derivative instruments with these or other lenders
under our Credit Facility, representing institutions with an investment grade ratings. We have existing
International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreements (“ISDA Agreements”) with our derivative
counterparties. The terms of the ISDA Agreements provide us and the counterparties with rights of offset
upon the occurrence of defined acts of default by either us or a counterparty to a derivative, whereby the
party not in default may offset all derivative liabilities owed to the defaulting party against all derivative asset
receivables from the defaulting party.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal
executive and financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer performed
an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have
concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting.   There were no changes to our internal control over
financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
