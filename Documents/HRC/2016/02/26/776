 At the invitation of the Government of Spain, the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances visited the country from 23 to 30 September 2013. 
</p>
<p> Since the return to democracy significant, if tentative, steps have been taken to 
secure truth, justice and reparation and to preserve memory in the context of the enforced 
disappearances committed during the Civil War and the dictatorship. 
</p>
<p> The adoption of the Historical Memory Act, the hundreds of exhumations, the map 
showing the location of mass graves, the grants to victims, the isolated action taken by 
some courts in ordering investigation, search and exhumation procedures, the criminal trial 
launched in Investigating Court No. 5 of the National High Court, the memorials that have 
been built, the laws and protocols adopted and the institutions created by some autonomous 
communities such as Catalonia, the Basque country and Andalusia, represent tangible and 
valuable progress. 
</p>
<p> This progress has been made thanks to initiatives set in motion or carried out by 
victims&#8217; families or civil society and some State sectors, both at the national level and in a 
number of autonomous communities. In accordance with its obligations under the 
Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and with

that is broadly and generally consistent with international law. Article 10, paragraph 2, 
requires rights to be interpreted in a manner consistent with the treaties ratified by Spain. 
Nevertheless, in many cases of enforced disappearance the Working Group has noted a lack 
of analysis, or inadequate analysis, of the compatibility of domestic norms and practice 
with the State&#8217;s international obligations.

<p><b>2</b> GE.<footnote name="1">0. The Working Group commends Spain for having ratified the vast majority of the 
international human rights treaties and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court. It also notes with satisfaction that the State party has issued a standing invitation to 
all the Human Rights Council special mandate holders. It particularly welcomes its 
ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance and its recognition of the competence of the Committee on Enforced 
Disappearances to receive and consider communications under articles 31 and 32 of the 
Convention. It also congratulates the State on the presentation of its initial report to the 
Committee. 
</footnote>4-07270 
</p>
<p>international law, the State should accept its responsibility and take a leadership role in 
ensuring that these initiatives form part of a comprehensive, consistent, continuous, 
cooperative and collaborative policy. All activities in relation to enforced disappearance 
should take account of the gender perspective. 
</p>
<p> The hundreds of family members the Working Group met expressed deep frustration 
at the administrative hurdles and their difficulty in accessing the information they need to 
clarify the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones. Given the lapse of time since most of 
the enforced disappearances began and the advanced age of many of the witnesses and 
family members, it is a matter of urgency that the State make the search for the truth, and in 
particular the establishment of the fate and whereabouts of the disappeared persons, an 
immediate priority. 
</p>
<p> Other important challenges remain, including the limited scope of the Historical 
Memory Act, the lack of any budget to implement the Act, the continued applicability of 
the Amnesty Act as interpreted by the courts, impunity in all the cases of enforced 
disappearance, the fact that there is no separate offence of enforced disappearance, the lack 
of any law on access to information, the difficulty in accessing the archives, and the lack of 
any national plan on the search for disappeared persons. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group again expresses its solidarity with the victims of enforced 
disappearance and their families. Their constant suffering is tangible proof that enforced 
disappearance is a continuing offence and a continuing violation of human rights until the 
fate or whereabouts of the victim have been ascertained. The Working Group further 
expresses its readiness to continue the constructive dialogue with the Spanish State and 
offers its assistance in ensuring the full implementation of the Declaration.

information from the families of victims whose bodies now lie in the Valle de los Ca&#237;dos. 
More than 33,000 bodies were moved there, thousands of them unidentified. Many remains 
were taken from frontline cemeteries or from &#8220;Republican graves&#8221; excavated without 
families&#8217; permission or knowledge. For countless families, it is only in recent years that 
they learned that their disappeared relatives had been moved to the Valle de los Ca&#237;dos. The 
chances of finding and identifying bodies in the Valle de los Ca&#237;dos are in many cases 
remote as the area where the bodies lie is apparently prone to serious water damage and has 
been neglected for years. For many families it is highly problematic that their loved ones </footnote> 6

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances 
visited Spain from 23 to 30 September 2013. The delegation comprised Ms. Jasminka 
Dzumhur and Mr. Ariel Dulitzky. The purpose of the visit was to examine the main 
initiatives and policies of the Spanish State in relation to enforced or involuntary 
disappearances and to address issues related to justice, truth, reparation and memory for 
victims of enforced disappearance, all in light of the Declaration on the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance. The Declaration reflects, codifies and consolidates 
customary international law, which is legally binding on all States, including the Spanish 
State.  
</p>
<p>2. The experts met with various authorities, including: in Madrid, the Secretary of State 
for Justice; the Secretary of State for Security; the Secretary of State for International 
Cooperation and Latin America; the Under-Secretary, Office of the Prime Minister; the 
Under-Secretary of Defence; the Director-General for Multilateral and Global Affairs, and 
the Director of Human Rights at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Under-Secretary of the 
Interior and the Executive Secretary of the Human Rights Programme of the Ministry of the 
Interior and Public Security; the National Director of the Civil Registry and Identity 
Service; the National Director of the Forensic Medical Service; the Under-Secretary for 
Justice; the Under-Secretary for Defence; the Director-General of Foreign Policy, 
Multilateral Global Affairs, and Security; the Director of the Human Rights Office of the 
Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation; judges from the National Council of the 
Judiciary and prosecutors from the Office of the Attorney-General. They also met the 
President of the Senate and the Congressional Committee on Internal Affairs. In Catalonia 
the experts met the Government Representative to Catalonia; the Ombudsman and members 
of the Memorial Democr&#224;tic and the Institut Catal&#224; Internacional per la Pau. In the Basque 
Country they met the Minister of Public Administration and Justice and spokesperson for 
the Basque Government; the Director for Victims and Human Rights of the Basque 
Government; the Human Rights Commission of the Basque Parliament and its Chairperson; 
the President of the High Court of Justice of the Basque Country and the Senior Prosecutor 
of the Basque Country; and the Ombudsman. In Andalusia the experts met the Vice-
President of the Government (Junta) of Andalusia; the Director-General of Memoria 
Democr&#225;tica; the Andalusian Parliament and the deputy Ombudsman. 
</p>
<p>3. The Working Group wishes to thank the Government of Spain for its invitation to 
visit the country, for its extensive and positive cooperation before and during the mission, 
for its candid approach and openness to dialogue and for the information provided during 
the visit and the additional information provided afterwards. It also wishes to thank the 
authorities of the three autonomous communities that it visited. 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group met hundreds of family members and associations of families 
of disappeared persons, and other civil society organizations, lawyers, historians, doctors, 
archaeologists, forensic anthropologists and academics. It also received direct information 
from witnesses to enforced disappearances. The Working Group is grateful for the copious 
information and cooperation it has received. 
</p>
<p>5. The delegation visited the Valle de los Ca&#237;dos, the Fossar de la Pedrera in Barcelona 
and, in Seville, the Murallas de la Macarena and the mass grave at the cemetery. The 
experts met the Secretary-General of the Spanish Conference of Bishops. 
</p>
<p>6. Gross violations of human rights were committed in Spain during the Civil War 
(1936&#8211;1939) and the dictatorship (1939&#8211;1975). As yet there is no official figure for the 
number of persons who disappeared, for Spain does not have a central database in this area. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/49/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-07270 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>According to the criminal investigation carried out by Criminal Investigation Court No. 5 
of the National High Court, the number of victims of enforced disappearance from 17 July 
1936 to December 1951 is 114,<footnote name="22">. The Working Group is aware that the passage of time, the mass nature of the 
enforced disappearances and the use of mass graves containing hundreds or thousands of 
people mean that, in many cases, this obligation to guarantee the truth may not result in the 
identification of every one of the victims individually. Indeed, experts and many of the 
families acknowledge that, in some places, exhumation is neither possible or desirable. As 
the Working Group states in its general comment on the right to the truth, &#8220;there is an 
absolute obligation to take all the necessary steps to find the person, but there is no absolute 
obligation of result. Indeed, in certain cases, clarification is difficult or impossible to attain, </footnote>6. Since this criminal investigation was to all intents and 
purposes blocked or undermined, that number could not be reliably confirmed by a court 
enquiry. 
</p>
<p>7. The order to open an investigation also refers to the systematic abduction of children 
of Republican detainees (a figure of 30,960 children is mentioned), who were allegedly 
given to families who supported the Franco regime once their identities had been changed 
in the Civil Register. In addition, during the Civil War, many Republican parents evacuated 
their children abroad. When the War was over, the Franco regime decided that all those 
children should return and, after repatriation, many were sent to Auxilio Social centres, 
whereupon parental rights were automatically transferred to the State, while their biological 
families were quite unaware of this situation. Many of these children were adopted without 
the knowledge or consent of their biological families. 
</p>
<p>8. The Working Group has received information concerning the alleged &#8220;theft&#8221; and 
&#8220;kidnapping&#8221; of babies and children after the Civil War and even after the restoration of 
democracy. According to the reports, hundreds of babies were stolen from hospital 
maternity wards and illegally offered for adoption in exchange for money. According to the 
information received, in some cases the theft or kidnapping could have taken place with the 
knowledge or involvement of certain authorities or officials. In order to perpetrate these 
thefts, the biological parents were given to believe that their children had died shortly after 
birth. On other occasions the babies were simply snatched under threat and the adoptive 
parents were told that they had been abandoned. There are apparently around 1,500 
complaints with prosecutors but it has not yet been possible to establish how many people 
were affected by these acts. 
</p>
<p>9. Information has also been received about isolated cases of disappearance during the 
1970s and 1980s, in the context of efforts to combat terrorism. The Working Group 
acknowledges and emphasizes that, unlike other countries, Spain responded to terrorist 
violence without systematically resorting to enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/27/49/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.14-07270 
</p>
<p>(art. 55). However, it should be pointed out that, according to information provided by the 
Government, no state of emergency or siege has ever been proclaimed since the 
promulgation of the Constitution in 1978. 
</p>
<p>13. The Working Group has analysed the provisions of the Spanish Criminal Code that 
were cited and described by various authorities &#8212; either during the visit or as 
supplementary information provided later &#8212; as regulating enforced disappearance (arts. 
163&#8211;168 and 530). An analysis of these articles, separately or in conjunction with some or 
all of them, shows that the Spanish Criminal Code does not contain a separate offence of 
enforced disappearance, for the offences mentioned contain none of the elements that 
constitute enforced disappearance. They do not require the involvement of an agent of the 
State or provide for State support, acquiescence or cooperation in an offence of enforced 
disappearance committed by a person or group of persons. They only cover the offence of 
unlawful detention or abduction, whereas the Declaration refers to other possibilities such 
as arrest, detention or abduction of individuals against their will or being &#8220;otherwise 
deprived of their liberty&#8221;. In addition, the wording used in the Criminal Code (&#8220;failing to 
reveal the location of the victim&#8221;) is not broad enough to include the third component of 
enforced disappearance of persons, namely a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of 
liberty or the concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the victim. Lastly, the Criminal 
Code fails to specify that the consequence of disappearance is to place the person outside 
the protection of the law. Thus Spanish law is deficient in the area of enforced 
disappearance. 
</p>
<p>14. The draft reform of the Criminal Code is a major step forward as it increases the 
penalties for the offences mentioned above to make them the same as for homicide. It does 
not, however, include a separate definition of enforced disappearance. The Working Group 
appreciates the communication received from the Government to the effect that the 
parliamentary groups might introduce a separate definition of the offence of enforced 
disappearance and that separate provision for the offence of enforced disappearance is now 
under consideration. 
</p>
<p>15. The authorities have informed the Working Group that article 607 bis of the 
Criminal Code, entitled &#8220;Crimes against humanity&#8221;, defines crimes against humanity as 
they are defined in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. This is a welcome 
addition to the Criminal Code, for it defines enforced disappearance as a crime when it is 
committed as a part of a widespread attack against a civilian population. 
</p>
<p>16. Under Spanish law, crimes against humanity, including enforced disappearance, are 
not subject to the statute of limitations. In addition, under article 132 of the Criminal Code, 
the term of limitation in respect of a continuing offence begins to run when &#8220;the unlawful 
situation ceases&#8221;. Despite this, in considering cases of enforced disappearance during the 
Civil War, the Supreme Court did not accept that enforced disappearance was a continuing 
offence and consequently found that the statute of limitations applied to those cases. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Truth and memory 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/27/49/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-07270 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>(A/HRC/16/48, para. 39). Several victims&#8217; associations have been formed and there is a 
dynamic civil society in Spain working for these ends. 
</p>
<p>18. The Working Group has observed a lack of proper liaison and communication 
between these victims&#8217; groups and the State authorities. Victims&#8217; groups, and in particular 
associations of family members, have not been duly consulted or kept fully informed as 
measures have been adopted, with the result that those measures have been inadequate and, 
in many cases, ineffective. In the autonomous communities the Working Group visited, 
however, communication flows more freely. 
</p>
<p>19. Spain does not have a State body that deals with all matters relating to enforced 
disappearance, including the creation and administration of a central database on 
disappearances. The information available on enforced disappearances during the Civil War 
and the dictatorship is fragmented and scattered, which makes for confusion over the 
number of enforced disappearances, among other things. A central database is vital in 
promoting transparency, accuracy and certainty in respect of disappeared persons. It is 
necessary to have individual information and statistical data, notably in order to make a 
clear distinction between the victims of execution and the victims of enforced 
disappearance. The data should be disaggregated by sex, age and geographical area and 
give the location of the place where the disappearance occurred. It should also include the 
date and place of burial and details of any exhumation and identification, and information 
concerning family members. 
</p>
<p>20. The Working Group acknowledges the importance of Act No. 52/2007 of 26 
December, which &#8220;recognizes and enhances rights and introduces measures on behalf of 
those who suffered persecution or violence during the civil war and the dictatorship&#8221;. 
Known as the Historical Memory Act, it attempts to lay the foundations for future policies 
on the recognition and enhancement of victims&#8217; rights, the promotion of reparation and the 
recovery of memory. It also makes provision for the moral recognition of victims, the 
award of grants, the banning of symbols commemorating the Franco regime and the 
creation of a documentation centre. The Working Group received information concerning 
other legislative measures in respect of victims, such as the Act on Recognition of and 
Comprehensive Protection for Victims of Terrorism (Act No. 29/2011, of 22 September). 
According to the information received, this Act grants more rights to victims than the 
Historical Memory Act, thereby creating different categories of victims. 
</p>
<p>21. Articles 11 to 14 of the Historical Memory Act, which refer to the finding and 
identification of disappeared persons, are an attempt to respond to the demands of 
thousands of family members who wish to know the fate or whereabouts of their loved 
ones. Yet the measures provided for in the Act require action by the families requesting 
them and do not create a State obligation to act ex officio, and this has created a number of 
difficulties in the exercise of the rights contained in the Act. Under article 11, the State 
authorities only have an obligation to cooperate with individuals and to facilitate 
investigation, search and identification in respect of disappeared persons, which effectively 
shifts the responsibility for the work from the State to the families. The search for 
disappeared persons cannot be dependent on the efforts or initiative of family members but 
should be undertaken as an obligation of the State. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/27/49/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.14-07270 
</p>
<p>for instance when the body, for various reasons, cannot be found. A person may have been 
summarily executed, but the remains cannot be found because the person who buried the 
body is no longer alive, and nobody else has information on the person&#8217;s fate. The State 
still has an obligation to investigate until it can determine by presumption the fate or 
whereabouts of the person.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>23. The Working Group sees it as positive that the Historical Memory Act establishes an 
obligation to draw up a protocol for a scientific, multidisciplinary approach to exhumations 
and to map the mass graves around the country. The Protocol for Exhumation of Victims of 
the Civil War and the Dictatorship was adopted in September 2011, that is nearly four years 
after the adoption of the Act, during which time numerous exhumations were carried out. 
The Protocol is important because it provides for minimum standards to be observed by all 
scientific teams conducting exhumations. 
</p>
<p>24. The process of establishing the whereabouts and identity of those who disappeared 
has had limited success, with the discovery and subsequent exhumation of several mass 
graves. Some of the factors that account for this limited success are the length of time that 
has passed since the disappearances began, the fact that there has been little or no 
involvement by the State, the lack of any clear, detailed and specific procedure for 
exhumation and identification, and the fact that there is no genetic database of the family 
members of disappeared persons. There are no national regulations specifically on dealing 
with the remains after exhumation. The Historical Memory Act fails to regulate the search, 
exhumation and identification procedure or institutional responsibility for it. This has meant 
that the families have been obliged to go through numerous judicial and administrative 
procedures in order to obtain exhumation of the remains of disappeared persons, and their 
identification, with no clear legal or administrative framework to work in. In particular, 
there is no national plan for searching for the disappeared, no coordination of the work of 
exhumation and identification and no updating of the maps of mass graves created under 
the Historical Memory Act. Establishing an institutional mechanism to take on these tasks 
ought to improve implementation of the Act and make for better understanding of the 
nature, causes and impact of enforced disappearances, and promote a culture of 
responsibility and accountability and respect for the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>25. The support offered by the various autonomous communities is highly contingent on 
the governing political party in each place. This results in victims being treated differently 
depending on where a mass grave is located and it does not make for equal application of 
the rights recognized in the Declaration or the Historical Memory Act. In some autonomous 
communities, the local authorities have assumed full responsibility for exhumation &#8212; the 
path chosen by Andalusia in 2003 and that led to the adoption of the Andalusian Protocol 
for Exhumation of Victims of the Civil War and the Post-war Period, of 2009 &#8212; whereas in 
others, the Government has stayed completely outside the process. 
</p>
<p>26. Since 2006 the Spanish Government has allocated more than &#8364;<footnote name="2">7. That said, in the last two budgets no financing was allocated to the Department of 
Rights of Pardon and Other Rights of the Ministry of Justice, which now has responsibility 
for applying the provisions of the Historical Memory Act at the national level. The 
Department was part of the Office for Victims of the Civil War and the Dictatorship in 
early 2012. The Government has informed the Working Group that the change has not 
diminished the attention being paid to victims or implementation of the measures </footnote>5 million to the 
various historical memory associations for their work in the recovery of historical memory, 
for example locating and exhuming graves, organizing acts of homage and carrying out 
investigations. The implementation of this aspect of the Historical Memory Act has yielded 
an abundance of valuable information. The Working Group warmly welcomes this financial 
investment by the Spanish State in recognizing victims&#8217; rights and meeting its international 
obligations. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/27/49/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-07270 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>established in the Historical Memory Act. Family members and associations have told the 
Working Group that, in their view, the cutting of the budget, together with the change of 
name &#8212; which makes no reference to victims &#8212; are not solely due to a purely technical 
restructuring or the economic crisis the country is going through. They note in particular 
that there is now no department within the Spanish State, even in name, with a sole 
mandate to attend specifically to victims and answer for their rights, or with a budget to 
implement the Historical Memory Act. 
</p>
<p>28. The Historical Memory Act also provides that State administrations should prepare 
and make available to all interested parties within their territory maps showing the areas 
where remains are to be found. The Map of Mass Graves is administered by the Ministry of 
Justice and, according to information received, the Map now shows 2,<footnote name="3">4. In the area of memory and truth, a small number of autonomous communities have 
played a major part in extending the scope of the Historical Memory Act. Catalonia adopted 
a law (Act No. 10/2009) on locating and identifying disappeared persons and the honouring 
of mass graves. Honouring the graves has taken priority over exhumation. It has also 
established the &#8220;Memorial Democr&#224;tic&#8221; as the body responsible for policy on civic action 
on recovery, commemoration and building democratic memory. The Working Group notes 
with concern the reduction in the budget allocated to the work of the Memorial Democr&#224;tic. 
The Government of the Basque Country has signed a cooperation agreement with the 
Aranzadi Society for Science, allowing it to carry out a census of the disappeared, exhume 
numerous graves and identify the victims of enforced disappearance. Whenever a body is 
identified, the Government of the Basque Country sends a personal letter to the family and 
a file containing all the information gathered. In Andalusia, the Directorate-General for 
Democratic Memory is active in many ways, awarding honours and distinctions, making 
grants to local authorities and other bodies for commemorative monuments, investigations, 
studies, conferences, exhibitions and publications. In addition, a database of the victims of 
reprisals by the Franco regime has been created as part of the Todos los nombres (Every 
name) project. 
35. The Working Group received information on the various important initiatives by the 
Spanish State with regard to the situation of stolen children. It commends the establishment, 
in the Ministry of Justice, of an information service for those affected by a possible baby 
theft, the action taken by the Attorney-General&#8217;s Office, the creation of a DNA bank, the 
cooperation agreement between the Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality and 
the Attorney-General&#8217;s Office, and the reports by national and independent human rights 
institutions, inter alia. The Working Group received information regarding the many 
obstacles that prevent documentation of cases of child theft and the ineffectuality of the 
investigative measures taken to date. Moreover the national DNA bank does not have 
enough genetic samples, despite the size of the universe of potential victims and reported 
cases. 
</footnote>82 graves 
throughout the country. However, the Working Group was told that not all the autonomous 
communities have prepared such maps. Moreover the national map is not updated regularly. 
At the same time, the Working Group received positive, detailed information on regular 
updates regarding exhumations and identification of mass graves in the Basque Country 
and Andalusia. In the Basque Country, for example, the Working Group was given a census 
that had been taken of exhumations and victims. 
</p>
<p>29. The obstacles encountered in accessing information and archives are a major 
problem for victims in their search for the truth. In some cases documents have been 
deliberately destroyed. The security archives are still difficult or well-nigh impossible to get 
at. In general there is resistance to declassifying or allowing access to documents. The lack 
of a comprehensive law regulating access to information and archives means that access to 
public archives can be regulated or operate differently depending on the geographical 
region or the institutions involved. This creates situations in which access to information 
may depend on the goodwill of the official dealing with the request, or their interpretation 
of the rules. 
</p>
<p>30. The Working Group notes that there are a number of disputes over death registers 
and as to the accuracy of the information they contain as regards victims of the Civil War. 
Some registers have been destroyed, or else access is denied on various grounds, such as 
protection of personal information. The Working Group was also told that it was difficult to 
gain access to records belonging to the Catholic Church. Given that many cemeteries are on 
Church property and information on baptisms and deaths is held in Church records, it is 
essential, in order to guarantee victims&#8217; right to the truth, to open them up and facilitate 
access for those who are looking for disappeared persons or children believed to have been 
stolen. 
</p>
<p>31. The law on protection of personal databases blocks victims&#8217; access to information. 
The authorities apparently use the law to deny access to information relating to 
disappearance if the information contains a personal detail. Information that is controlled by 
a State body is a public asset and public access to such information promotes greater 
transparency and accountability. If public information contains personal details then it 
should be considered on a case-by-case basis so as to strike a balance between access to 
information and protection of personal data. The claim of &#8220;reasons of State security&#8221; for 
denying requests for information should be used restrictively and only in exceptional 
circumstances, because this is a matter of investigating enforced disappearances committed 
in a context of international crimes. What is more, given the time that has passed, it is 
hardly reasonable to suppose that State security could be jeopardized by access to these 
records. 
</p>
<p>32. Moves are now under way to legislate on access to information. The aim is to 
increase transparency in government activities &#8212; with a particular emphasis on battling 
corruption &#8212; rather than to regulate the public&#8217;s access to information. A wide-ranging law 
on access to information would help overcome the obstacles described above. </p>

</p>
<p>33. The Historical Memory Act also provides that State administrations shall take the 
necessary steps to remove shields, insignia, plaques and other commemorative objects or 
references that represent a glorification, whether personal or collective, of the military 
uprising, the Civil War and the repression by the dictatorship. The Government has 
informed the Working Group that 86 per cent of the relics listed by the Expert Technical 
Commission on the removal of symbols of the Franco era have been removed. Family 
members and associations have informed the Working Group that this provision has not 
always been observed, for there are no clear and precise regulations establishing what is 
commemorative and the various bodies&#8217; discretion in the matter. These sources say that the 
political colour of the relevant authority is the decisive factor in removal of such symbols. 
According to the Government, however, the symbols that have yet to be removed are ones 
requiring a special administrative procedure or that would incur major financial expenditure 
because of some particular historic and cultural interest and value.

<p>are in a religious site that does not accord with their own beliefs, and not far from the 
bodies of Francisco Franco and Jos&#233; Antonio Primo de Rivera, the only ones on the site to 
be acknowledged by their full name. In 2011 a multidisciplinary expert commission was set 
up to consider the future of the site and it reported in November 2011. Regrettably, the 
report was not properly circulated and its recommendations have yet to be implemented. 
The State pointed out, and the Working Group agrees, that action on the Valle de los 
Ca&#237;dos requires a broad consensus of all political forces, for which the Government should 
provide the impetus in the near future. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Right to justice 
</b>37. The Declaration requires that the State guarantee to victims of enforced 
disappearance an effective remedy that includes a thorough and impartial ex officio 
investigation with a view to identifying those allegedly responsible for the disappearance 
and imposing the appropriate penalties. However, the combination of a defective legal 
framework, a judiciary that does not interpret the law in light of international human rights 
law, prosecutors who have not conducted investigations and the existence of the Amnesty 
Act and, in particular, the courts&#8217; interpretation of the Act, have established a pattern of 
impunity for enforced disappearances committed during the Civil War and the dictatorship. 
No effective judicial investigation into any named individual is under way and no one has 
been convicted for the disappearances during the Civil War and the dictatorship. 
</p>
<p>38. A number of complaints were brought in the 1990s but they were usually dismissed. 
In December 2006 a group of victims submitted a collective complaint to the National High 
Court demanding a judicial investigation into the thousands of enforced disappearances that 
had allegedly occurred during the Civil War and the dictatorship. Criminal Investigation 
Court No. 5 of the National High Court, to which the complaint was assigned, described the 
offences as having been committed in a context of crimes against humanity and referred to 
a systematic plan of attack to eliminate political opponents starting in 1936 and during the 
Civil War and the following years. The judge disqualified himself as not competent and 
referred the proceedings to the relevant territorial courts, which dispersed, undermined and 
prevented any systematic investigation. Charged with malfeasance in office (<i>prevaricaci&#243;n</i>) 
for having opened and pursued the investigation, the judge in Criminal Investigation Court 
No. 5 was suspended, tried and ultimately acquitted on 27 February 2012 by Supreme 
Court judgement. The Supreme Court found that the judge in Criminal Investigation Court 
No. 5 had committed an error in carrying out the investigations but had acted without the 
malicious intent required to establish an offence of malfeasance. A month later the Supreme 
Court ruled in a conflict of jurisdiction, finding that it was the territorial courts, not the 
National High Court, that were competent to try cases of enforced disappearance during the 
Civil War. 
</p>
<p>39. In its rulings on acquittal and competence, the Supreme Court explicitly found that 
criminal investigation of cases of enforced disappearance during the Civil War was 
inadmissible since the period of limitation had expired, the alleged perpetrators had died, 
the continuing nature of disappearance was a fiction that was legally unacceptable and, in 
any event, the cases were covered by the 1977 Amnesty Act. This set of considerations runs 
counter to the principles deriving from the international obligations of Spain, including the 
Declaration. 
</p>
<p>40. The Working Group is particularly concerned at the effect of the trial of the National 
High Court judge, the Supreme Court ruling and its decision regarding the competence of 
the courts. What all this has meant in practice is that any proceedings to clarify and try the 
thousands of cases of enforced disappearance committed during the Spanish Civil War and 
the dictatorship are closed, dismissed or blocked, or investigations are kept to a minimum. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/49/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.14-07270 
</p>
<p>Following the Supreme Court rulings, practically no judges launched or pursued, and no 
prosecutors conducted any investigation into enforced disappearances. It is true that that 
was already the situation, but the Supreme Court rulings gave the lower courts new 
arguments for not proceeding with such cases. 
</p>
<p>41. Enforced disappearance is a continuing offence and an ongoing violation of human 
rights as long as the fate and whereabouts of the victims remain unclarified (Declaration, 
art. 17). Enforced disappearance is a single consolidated act, not a combination of isolated, 
unconnected facts. Even if certain aspects of an enforced disappearance may have been 
completed years or decades ago, if other aspects of the disappearance persist, and especially 
if the fate or whereabouts of the victim have not been established, the case should be tried 
by the criminal courts and the act of enforced disappearance should not be broken down 
into smaller parts. Thus the period of limitations can only begin once the disappearance has 
ceased. And even if, for the sake of argument, the statute of limitations was applicable, it 
could only apply once the judicial investigation had been completed, not before. As the 
Attorney-General put it, &#8220;First the investigation has to be completed and only then can a 
position be taken on the statute of limitations, for reasons of pure logic&#8221; (Circular 2/2012). 
42. Moreover, the fact that they are crimes against humanity means that the 
disappearances committed during the Civil War and the dictatorship are offences that are 
not subject to the statute of limitations. 
43. In October 1977 an Amnesty Act was passed with broad support in the democratic 
parliament. According to information received by the Working Group, the Spanish 
authorities and a broad swathe of society see the Amnesty Act as a key component in the 
peaceful transition from dictatorship to the rule of law, its purpose being to &#8220;close wounds 
and forget the Civil War and political enmity&#8221;, as the Government said. The Working 
Group was told that the Spanish Amnesty Act is not an &#8220;end of story&#8221; law (<i>ley de punto 
final</i>). In this regard, article 18 of the Declaration categorically states that persons who have 
or are alleged to have committed offences of enforced disappearance shall not benefit from 
any special amnesty law or similar measures that might have the effect of exempting them 
from any criminal proceedings or sanction. An amnesty law and the interpretation of that 
law should not permit the State&#8217;s obligation to investigate, try and punish those responsible 
for disappearances to lapse completely. 
</p>
<p>44. In this debate on the judicial response to enforced disappearance, the Constitutional 
Court has endorsed, explicitly or implicitly, the decisions by other courts to close down 
investigations, not order exhumations or not recognize the rights of victims&#8217; families. The 
Working Group understands that it should be possible for the Constitutional Court to give 
an opinion that would bring Spanish judicial practice into line with the country&#8217;s 
international obligations. 
</p>
<p>45. In a few cases, the courts have apparently ordered investigations that made it 
possible to establish the date and cause of death, recover and exhume victims&#8217; remains and 
identify them and hand them over to their families. Even these cases, however, all ended 
the same way, with dismissal and closure of proceedings. These isolated positive cases 
show that it is important and possible for judicial action to guarantee victims&#8217; rights, in part 
at least. The Working Group very much welcomes information received to the effect that a 
number of investigations have recently been launched, resumed or reopened. 
</p>
<p>46. When a request is made for an excavation and exhumation of a mass grave or a site 
where disappeared persons could be buried, judges, prosecutors and police do not visit the 
site, on the grounds that this is not part of a criminal investigation. This decision amounts to 
a serious failure on the part of the judicial and prosecuting authorities to investigate ex 
officio any crime that might have been committed, and particularly enforced disappearance. 
Indeed, in the majority of cases the complaints are summarily dismissed without judicial </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/27/49/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-07270 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>action of any kind. As long as there has been no proper scientific identification of the 
remains or determination of the dates and causes of death, and no judicial ruling on the 
existence of a crime, the possible perpetrators and any grounds for extinction of the right of 
action or of the punishment, courts cannot prejudge those issues without risking a violation 
of fundamental principles of law. In other cases, courts refer to the Historical Memory Act, 
claiming that the criminal jurisdiction is not the proper avenue for establishing the truth 
concerning a disappeared person. 
</p>
<p>47. As to judicial proceedings in the cases known as &#8220;child thefts&#8221;, the Working Group 
draws attention to Attorney-General&#8217;s Office Circular 2/2012, setting out standard 
guidelines for proceedings for abduction of newborn children, which maintains that the 
offence is continuing in nature and not subject to a statute of limitations. This position is 
compatible with the provisions of the Declaration. The Attorney-General&#8217;s Office has 
rejected the notion of a systematic plan to steal children. It is important that, where there is 
sufficient evidence, judicial investigations consider the possibility of links between multiple 
cases of alleged illegal abduction of children. 
</p>
<p>48. Organic Act No. 6/1985 of 1 July, on the judiciary, takes a broad view of universal 
jurisdiction (art. 23). Thanks to this, the Spanish judiciary made very important 
contributions to the development of universal jurisdiction, by investigating and trying 
international offences, including enforced disappearance, one example of which was the 
well-known <i>Scilingo</i> case. This action by the Spanish judiciary also played a vital part in 
strengthening domestic judicial procedures in some of the countries where universal 
jurisdiction had been asserted, making it possible to reopen or launch proceedings for 
enforced disappearance. This shows that the Spanish judiciary is quite capable of 
conducting serious investigations and imposing proper penalties for serious human rights 
violations, including enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>49. Organic Act No. 1/2009, however, has considerably curtailed the competence of 
Spanish courts and the application of the principle of universal jurisdiction. This Act has 
been invoked to dismiss at least two complaints containing claims of enforced 
disappearance. A new legislative framework, adopted after the visit, restricts the scope of 
universal jurisdiction even more. 
50. In view of the impunity of perpetrators of enforced disappearances during the Civil 
War and the dictatorship, Spanish victims have asked the courts of Argentina to exercise 
universal jurisdiction. The Argentine judiciary is now proceeding with one complaint and 
has sought the cooperation of the Spanish judiciary and State. The State indicated that the 
Ministry of Justice has accepted all requests for international judicial assistance. Other 
sources, however, say that the authorities have not always cooperated fully with the 
Argentine judiciary. In this regard the Working Group emphasizes the importance of 
judicial cooperation and recalls that, according to article 277 of Organic Act No. 6/1985 of 
1 July on the judiciary, &#8220;Spanish courts shall provide to foreign judicial authorities such 
cooperation as they may request in the conduct of their functions, in accordance with 
international treaties and agreements to which Spain is a party.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>51. According to information received, military courts may have competence to 
investigate and try cases of enforced disappearance committed by the military, 
notwithstanding the clear stipulation in article 16, paragraph 2, of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Awareness-raising, human rights education and other 
preventive measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/27/49/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.14-07270 
</p>
<p>about the past and provide society in general and civil servants in particular with adequate 
training in human rights. In this regard, the Working Group was pleased to hear that 
training for the Armed Forces covers human rights and international humanitarian law. It 
was also informed that special subjects relating to the Convention were to be included in 
2014. The Working Group emphasizes the importance of including the necessary education 
and information regarding the relevant provisions of the Declaration in the training given to 
law enforcement personnel, civil or military, medical personnel, public officials and other 
persons who may be involved in the custody or treatment of any person deprived of liberty. 
Training for judges, prosecutors and lawyers is equally important. The Legal Studies Centre 
gives courses on human rights and the framework agreement between the General Council 
of the Judiciary and the Ministry of Justice also provides for human rights training. On the 
other hand, Act No. 34/2006 on qualification as a court lawyer (<i>abogado</i>) or legal 
representative (<i>procurador</i>) contains no provisions on human rights. 
53. As a preventive measure, articles 10 to 12 of the Declaration require that deprivation 
of liberty must be carried out in strict compliance with national and international human 
rights standards. Yet article 509 and related articles of the Criminal Procedure Act establish 
a regime of incommunicado detention. Under Spanish law the investigating judge may 
order a detainee to be held incommunicado for up to 5 days in any case and up to 13 days if 
they are suspected of belonging to armed gangs or having links with gangs or being 
involved in terrorist offences. During this time the detainee has no right to a lawyer of their 
choice or to talk to a lawyer in private, or to inform a member of their family or another 
person of their choice that they have been detained or where they are being held, or to be 
examined by a doctor of their choice. The Government informed the Working Group that 
the Ministry of Justice is currently working on an overhaul of the Criminal Procedure Act, 
which will apparently make changes to the regime of incommunicado detention. It also 
indicated that this measure is subject to court supervision and that there is a protocol, 
adopted by the National High Court, which provides additional safeguards. 
</p>
<p>54. Detailed information was also received from the State concerning measures relating 
to the detention and expulsion of undocumented migrants, and the legal safeguards that 
exist, including Organic Act No. 4/2000 and Act No. 12/2009, to prevent returning a person 
if they might be at risk of human rights violations. However, domestic law does not make 
specific reference to enforced disappearance. In addition, the Working Group was 
concerned at claims it received to the effect that in some cases migrants had been expelled 
without following the relevant legal mechanisms, which prevented a case-by-case 
consideration of whether they might be at risk of enforced disappearance, as required by 
article 8, paragraph 1, of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>55. The Constitution, like the statutes of the autonomous communities, provides for the 
establishment of an Ombudsman. Article 54 of the Constitution defines the Ombudsman as 
a parliamentary high commissioner, appointed by Parliament to defend the rights 
established in the Constitution. In carrying out this mandate, the Ombudsman is empowered 
to review the actions of Government and report to Parliament. In addition, the Ombudsman, 
as the defender of individual rights, may apply for <i>amparo</i> on an individual&#8217;s behalf and is 
entitled to bring constitutional challenges. Under Organic Act No. 1/2009, the Ombudsman 
also functions as the national preventive mechanism against torture. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/27/49/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-07270 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>autonomous community. Notwithstanding the legislation on this subject, in practice it is not 
clear how a potential conflict of jurisdiction might be resolved in respect of a human rights 
violation committed in the autonomous community, where both ombudsmen could 
intervene. 
</p>
<p>57. The Working Group notes that, aside from what is stipulated in Act No. 36/1985 and 
the yearly meetings of the various levels of ombudsmen, there is little coordination between 
the national Ombudsman and the autonomous community ombudsmen. All are elected by 
qualified majority in their respective parliaments, based on nominations by the political 
parties. The election procedure does not give due weight to transparency or provide for 
consulting with or involving civil society. That could affect the independence of the 
ombudsman who is elected. The Working Group recalls that the election of an ombudsman 
at the State or autonomous community level should be carried out in accordance with the 
Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>58. Ombudsman&#8217;s offices have intervened in cases of child theft. The national 
Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for the Basque Country have produced major reports on 
the subject. Some offices have also tried to resolve the communication problems between 
the administration and victims and their representatives. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. National Human Rights Plan of Action 
</b></p>
<p>59. Spain adopted a National Human Rights Plan of Action for 2008&#8211;2012. It had a 
chapter on support for victims, including victims of the Civil War and the dictatorship, 
essentially based on implementation of the Historical Memory Act. The next national plan 
of action is in the drafting and consulting stage. According to information received, the 
draft national plan of action measures contains no measures relating to the rights of victims 
of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Final comments 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Working Group appreciates the substantive information provided to it by the 
various authorities, civil society organizations, and associations of relatives and victims 
with a view to improving understanding of the issue of enforced disappearance in Spain. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/27/49/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.14-07270 
</p>
<p>63. At all the sites visited, the Working Group met hundreds of families. Nearly all of 
them expressed deep frustration at the administrative hurdles and their difficulty in 
accessing the information they need to clarify the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones. 
Given the lapse of time since most of the enforced disappearances began and the advanced 
age of many of the witnesses and family members, it is a matter of urgency that the State 
make the search for the truth, and in particular the establishment of the fate and 
whereabouts of the disappeared persons, an immediate priority. There is an absolute 
obligation to take all necessary, reasonable and effective steps to find the person, but there 
is no absolute obligation of result. Indeed, in certain cases, clarification is difficult or 
impossible. 
</p>
<p>64. Other important challenges remain. The Working Group draws attention to the 
limited scope of the Historical Memory Act and the lack of any budget for its 
implementation, the continued applicability of the Amnesty Act as interpreted by the 
courts, impunity in all the cases of enforced disappearance, the fact that there is no separate 
offence of enforced disappearance, the lack of any law on access to information, the 
difficulty in accessing the archives, and the lack of any national plan on the search for 
disappeared persons, inter alia. 
</p>
<p>65. The Working Group reiterates its solidarity with victims of enforced disappearance 
and their families. Their constant suffering is tangible evidence that enforced disappearance 
is a continuing crime and a permanent violation of human rights until the fate and 
whereabouts of the victim are clarified. 
</p>
<p>66. The Working Group would welcome the opportunity to continue its constructive 
dialogue with the Spanish State and offers its assistance in fully implementing the 
Declaration. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Recommendations
