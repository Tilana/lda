<p><b>  Biographical data 
</b></p>

<p>&#8226; Independence from national government;<b> </b>the Commission on Human Rights of the 
Philippines is an independent body. While I have demonstrated the ability to work 
constructively with government, this is not at the expense of independence. It is, 
rather than a modus to keep engaged, to offer recommendations and other input.
