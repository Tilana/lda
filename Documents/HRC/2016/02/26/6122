<p><b>8/&#8230; Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial,

</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which guarantees the right to life, 
liberty and security of person, and the relevant provisions of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Having regard</i> to the legal framework of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, including the provisions contained in 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1992/72 of 5 March 1992 and General Assembly 
resolution 47/136 of 18 December 1992, 
</p>
<p><b> </b><i>Welcoming </i>the universal ratification of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, which 
alongside human rights law provide an important framework of accountability in relation to 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Council resolutions 5/1 on institution-building of the Human Rights Council 
and 5/2 on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate-holders of the Council, 
of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge his or her duties in 
accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> of all relevant General Assembly and Commission on Human Rights resolutions 
on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, in particular Commission resolution 2004/37 
of 19 April 2004 and Assembly resolution 61/173 of 19 December 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging</i> that extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions are crimes under the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> of the need for effective action to combat and to eliminate the abhorrent 
practice of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, which represents a flagrant violation 
of the inherent right to life, 
</p>
<p><i> Dismayed</i> that, in a number of countries, impunity, the negation of justice, continues to 
prevail and often remains the main cause of the continued occurrence of extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Strongly condemns</i> <i>once again</i> all extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, in 
all their forms, that continue to take place throughout the world; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 2. <i>Acknowledges</i> the importance of relevant special procedures of the Council, in 
particular the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, in their key 
role as early warning mechanisms in preventing the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity 
and war crimes, and encourages the relevant special procedures, within their mandates, to 
cooperate towards this end; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Demands</i> that all States ensure that the practice of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions is brought to an end and that they take effective action to combat and eliminate the 
phenomenon in all its forms; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reiterates </i>the obligation of all States to conduct exhaustive and impartial 
investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, to 
identify and bring to justice those responsible, while ensuring the right of every person to a fair 
and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law, to 
grant adequate compensation within a reasonable time to the victims or their families and to 
adopt all necessary measures, including legal and judicial measures, in order to bring 
an end to impunity and to prevent the recurrence of such executions, as stated in the 
Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary 
Executions; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Takes note</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions (A/HRC/8/3), as well as of the recommendations made in previous years, 
and invites States to give them due consideration; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Commends</i> the important role that the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions plays towards eliminating extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
and encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue, within the framework of his or her mandate, 
to collect information from all concerned, to respond effectively to information that comes 
before him or her, to follow up on communications and country visits and to seek the views and 
comments of Governments and to reflect them, as appropriate, in the elaboration of his or her 
reports; </p>

 <p></p>
<p><b> </b>7. <i>Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur, in carrying out his or her mandate: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To continue to examine situations of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
in all circumstances and for whatever reason, and to submit his or her findings on an annual 
basis, together with conclusions and recommendations, to the Council and the 
General Assembly, and to draw the attention of the Council to serious situations of extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions that warrant immediate attention or where early action might 
prevent further deterioration; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To continue to draw the attention of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
serious situations of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions that warrant immediate 
attention or where early action might prevent further deterioration; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To respond effectively to information which comes before him or her, in particular 
when an extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary execution is imminent or threatened or when such 
an execution has occurred; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To enhance further his or her dialogue with Governments, as well as to follow up on 
recommendations made in reports after visits to particular countries; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To continue monitoring the implementation of existing international standards on 
safeguards and restrictions relating to the imposition of capital punishment, bearing in mind the 
comments made by the Human Rights Committee in its interpretation of article 6 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the Second Optional Protocol 
thereto; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To apply a gender perspective in his or her work; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Urges</i> States: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of his or her 
task, to supply all necessary information requested by him or her and to react appropriately and 
expeditiously to his or her urgent appeals, and those Governments that have not yet responded to 
communications transmitted to them by the Special Rapporteur to answer without further delay; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To give serious consideration to responding favourably to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
requests to visit their countries; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To ensure appropriate follow-up to the recommendations and conclusions of the 
Special Rapporteur, including by providing information to the Special Rapporteur on the actions 
taken on those recommendations; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Welcomes </i>the cooperation established between the Special Rapporteur and other 
United Nations mechanisms and procedures in the field of human rights, and encourages the 
Special Rapporteur to continue efforts in that regard; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with adequate 
human, financial and material resources in order to enable him or her to carry out the mandate 
effectively, including through country visits; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary 
or arbitrary executions<b> </b>for three years; 
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Also decides</i> to continue to consider this matter in conformity with its programme of 
work.
