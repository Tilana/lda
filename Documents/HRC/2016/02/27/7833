<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally 
sound management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, Calin Georgescu, 
conducted a visit to Hungary from 4 to 11 October 2012, at the invitation of the 
Government. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his gratitude to the Government for 
its invitation, as well as for the cooperation extended to him during the visit. He also thanks 
all those who met with him, gave their time and cooperated with him during the visit.  
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was to assess the efforts made by Hungary in implementing 
its obligations under human rights and environmental law to ensure the safe and 
environmentally sound management and disposal of hazardous products and wastes. The 
Special Rapporteur focused on the impact on human rights of the Ajka industrial incident, 
including the Government&#8217;s efforts to mitigate that impact.  
</p>
<p>3. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with a range of authorities, including 
representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Office of the Commissioner for 
Fundamental Rights, the Sustainable Development Committee of the Parliament, the 
Inspectorate for Environment, Nature and Water, the National Directorate General for 
Disaster Management, the National Directorate General for Industrial Safety, the National 
Public Health and Medical Officer Service and the Hungarian Atomic Energy Agency, as 
well as a judge from the Budapest Capital Court. He also met with representatives of the 
World Health Organization (WHO) and members of civil society, including survivors of the 
Ajka industrial incident during a site visit to Devecser and to Kolont&#225;r.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for coordinating his 
visit to Hungary, especially the Department of International Organizations and human 
rights. He particularly appreciated the support given by the National Directorate General for 
Disaster Management during the visit to the site.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal and institutional framework  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International obligations 
</b></p>
<p>5. Hungary is party to nine core international human rights treaties and eight optional 
protocols, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Optional Protocols 
thereto. Pursuant to these treaties, the State has obligations to protect individuals and 
communities within its jurisdiction by eliminating, or reducing to a minimum, the risks that 
hazardous products and wastes pose to the enjoyment of several substantive human rights, 
including the rights to life, health, safe and healthy working conditions, adequate food, safe 
drinking water and adequate housing. In addition, Hungary has the obligation to ensure 
access to information, effective public participation, access to justice and effective 
remedies, in the context of the management and disposal of hazardous products and wastes. 
Hungary has ratified a number of regional human rights treaties adopted under the auspices 
of the Council of Europe, including the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms, the European Social Charter, its Amendment Protocol and its 
Revised Charter.  
</p>
<p>6. Hungary is party to several multilateral environmental agreements regulating the 
sound management and disposal of toxic and dangerous products and wastes, including the 
Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and 
their Disposal, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4 
</b></p>
<p>Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade and the Stockholm 
Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, and is signatory to the Basel Protocol on 
Liability and Compensation for Damage Resulting from Transboundary Movements of 
Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. It is also party to several conventions negotiated 
under the auspices of the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), including the 
Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access 
to Justice in Environmental Matters and the Protocol thereto on Pollutant Release and 
Transfer Registers.  
</p>
<p>7. Hungary is also party to several conventions of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) related to the protection of workers from health and safety hazards 
associated with dangerous working activities, including the Occupational Cancer 
Convention, 1974 (No. 139), the Working Environment (Air Pollution, Noise and 
Vibration) Convention, 1977 (No. 148) and the Occupational Safety and Health 
Convention, 1981 (No. 155). It has not yet ratified the Chemicals Convention, 1990 (No. 
170) and the Prevention of Major Industrial Accidents Convention, 1993 (No. 174). 
</p>
<p>8. According to article 24(3) c of the new Constitution of Hungary (in force since 
January 2012), the Constitutional Court may annul any legislation that is contrary to an 
international agreement to which the State is a party, therefore giving international 
agreements a constitutional standing.1 Consequently, recognized international human rights 
norms and international agreements ratified by Hungary become part of the domestic legal 
order and may be directly applied in national courts; other sources of international law may 
be directly applicable under national law if enacted through national legislation. The 
Constitution in force at the time of the Ajka incident was Act XX of 1949; article 18 of the 
Constitution declared the right to a healthy environment. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Constitutional, legislative, policy and institutional framework  
</b></p>
<p>9. The new Constitution recognizes various rights relevant to the management and 
disposal of hazardous substances and waste. Article P, under the &#8220;Foundation&#8221; section, 
</p>
<p>declares that all natural resources form part of the nation&#8217;s common heritage and that the 
State and every person are required to protect, sustain and preserve them for future 
generations. The Constitution further recognizes, inter alia, the rights to life and human 
dignity (art. II), to have access to data of public interest (art. VI), to physical and mental 
health, including by managing industrial safety and health care and by ensuring 
environmental protection (art. XX), as well as the right of every person to a healthy 
environment (art. XXI). With regard to the right to a healthy environment, the Constitution 
states that any person who causes damage to the environment is required to restore it or to 
bear all costs of restoration incurred as defined by law, and that the importation of pollutant 
waste to Hungary for the purpose of disposal is prohibited (art. XXI, para. 3). Article XXIV 
further provides that every person has the right to have his or her affairs administered by 
the authorities in an impartial, fair and reasonably timely manner, while also guaranteeing 
every person the right to statutory compensation for any unlawful damage caused by the 
authorities in the performance of their duties. Individual do not, however, have the right to 
approach the court directly, and the Special Rapporteur is concerned that this may limit 
access to the court for many. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The Constitutional Court ruled <i>a contrario sensu</i>, in its Decision 4/1997, that obligations arising from 
</p>
<p>international law (and in particular, international treaties to which Hungary is a party) imposed direct 
obligations on the State. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/39/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>10. In Hungary, environmental protection is governed by the Environmental Protection 
Act of 1995, which sets out an inclusive regulatory framework on the protection of the 
environment. It embodies numerous principles of environmental law, such as &#8220;the polluter 
pays&#8221; and the precautionary principle. Policy-level support of the Act is in the form of 
medium- and long-term strategies on environmental protection and are defined under the 
National Environmental Programme (2009-2014), which has specific targets and objectives 
aimed to mitigate the adverse impact of activities under the jurisdiction of the Act on the 
environment. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to note the impending passage of a new Waste 
Management Act (No. 185/2012), which seeks to implement the European Waste 
Framework Directive (2008/98/EC on waste), and was expected to come into force on 1 
January 2013, even though its implementing regulations had not yet been promulgated.2 
The Act is expected to increase transparency in and the monitoring of the waste sector 
while providing incentives for enhanced reduction of waste generation and an increase in 
the rate of reutilization. Efforts to implement the European directives on waste management 
include the adoption of European Regulation on chemicals and their safe use (EC No. 
1907/2006) and the Regulation on the Classification, Labelling and Packaging of 
Substances and Mixtures (EC No. 1272/2008).3 In addition, the Seveso Directives III on the 
prevention of industrial accidents in relation to hazardous substances,4 which were enacted 
in domestic legislation by Act CXXVIII of 2011 and Regulation 219/2011, require Hungary 
to establish a policy on prevention of major accidents applicable to industrial 
establishments where dangerous substances above a certain threshold are used or stored in 
large quantities. The facilities are subject to strict monitoring and are expected to provide 
updates to the public likely to be affected by an accident, to provide safety reports, and to 
establish a safety management system and an internal emergency plan.  
</p>
<p>12. Section 2 of Mining Act XLVIII of 1993 states that activities circumscribed by the 
Act may be carried out only when the protection of human life, health, environment, arable 
land and property has been assured. Section 26 requires disclosure of the physical and 
chemical properties of by-products and wastes expected during exploration or exploitation, 
while section 43(4) provides for mining rules governing activities relating to hazardous 
substances. In addition, Hungary is required to enforce European Directive 2006/21/EC on 
the management of waste from extractive industries, including waste resulting from the 
extraction, treatment and storage of mineral resources.  
</p>
<p>13. In recent years, Hungary has issued numerous executive decrees addressing the 
management of hazardous waste, including the creation of a list of atmospheric pollutants, 
and has established several other strategies aimed at reducing waste generation, such as the 
National Sustainable Development Strategy, which comprises waste management measures 
aimed at fostering sustainable production and consumption patterns. The National Climate 
Change Strategy (2008-2025) seeks to promote material recycling and to reduce emissions 
that are harmful to the environment and cause climate change. The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the efforts made by the Government to link heavily polluting industries to its 
climate change policy and, in particular, its use of economic incentives to promote climate 
change-friendly waste management practices.  
</p>
<p>  
 2 On 21 June 2012, the European Commission initiated an infringement procedure against Hungary for 
</p>
<p>its failure to meet the 2010 deadline to transpose the European Directive on waste into national law.  
 3 Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that European regulations 
</p>
<p>are binding for all Member States.  
 4 See http://ec.europa.eu/environment/seveso/.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 
</b></p>
<p>14. Hungary has several institutions that play a role in managing hazardous waste. The 
portfolio of the Ministry of Rural Development includes oversight of the Office of the 
Under-Secretary for the Environment, responsible for environmental protection, which in 
turn has oversight of the Department of National Environment and Water Authority, as well 
as that of the National Waste Management Agency. The waste management priorities of the 
Ministry of Rural Development focus on reduction of pollution, recycling and waste 
treatment. The Under-Secretary for the Environment is also responsible for environmental 
inspectorates tasked with inspection and classification. The National Directorate General 
for Disaster Management under the Ministry of the Interior is responsible for disaster 
response and ensuring industrial safety, including through the monitoring of hazardous 
plants, and has harmonized and created legislation in accordance with the Seveso 
Directives.  
</p>
<p>15. The Office of the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights, which is responsible for 
the protection of the interests of future generations, reports annually to Parliament. 
According to the Constitution, any person may petition the Commissioner if they believe 
that State or its organs have or may infringe their fundamental rights. The Commissioner 
may, in exceptional cases, approach the Constitutional Court if, on the basis of a petition, it 
may be presumed that an activity or omission gravely infringes the fundamental rights of a 
large group of natural persons. The Commissioner may also draw to attention to a need for 
review of legislation to ensure conformity with the Constitution. The Office of the 
Commissioner, having received a number of submissions on allegations of violations of the 
right to a healthy environment, considered, in 2011, cases on the operation of sewage 
treatment plants or drainage pipes, and on the disposal by municipalities of liquid waste. 
Further legislative branch oversight of environmental matters is provided by the Sustainable 
Development Parliamentary Committee, which includes a representative of political parties 
in Parliament.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Waste and chemicals management: current practices 
</b></p>
<p>16. As already mentioned above, the Special Rapporteur will provide a brief overview 
on the issue of the general management of hazardous substances and wastes currently in 
Hungary. According to the European Environment Agency, despite the measures taken by 
the State, the deterioration in air quality caused by both legal and illegal incineration has 
been reported in Hungary. Furthermore, illegal waste dumping, the &#8220;waste heritage&#8221; and 
other wastes entering the system by flooding pose considerable environmental problems.5 
</p>
<p><b> A. Municipal waste 
</b></p>
<p>17. Municipal solid waste accounts for almost 24.3 per cent of all waste generated in 
Hungary. Despite efforts made in selective collection and recycling, household waste is the 
biggest challenge for Hungary; municipal solid waste accounts for nearly 73 per cent of all 
waste generated by the residential sector, and mainly consists of plastics and biowaste. 
Generally, municipal waste poses no threat to human health or the environment, although a 
small proportion may be hazardous, such as expired chemicals and pharmaceuticals, 
batteries, obsolete pesticides, and electrical and electronic waste. 6 According to Hungarian 
law, these types of waste should be segregated at the point of generation from common

<p><b>A/HRC/24/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>municipal waste and disposed of in a safe and environmentally sound manner, namely, by 
means of selective collection and recycling. Hungary has made good progress in selective 
waste collection points, which are today available in more than 1,200 localities countrywide 
(including some 8,000 selective collection islands, nearly 100 waste yards and 40 regional 
composting plants), catering for 55 per cent of the population.  
</p>
<p>18. Recovery operations in Hungary encompass recycling, incineration with energy 
recovery, and composting. Disposal operations include landfills, which account for 67.3 per 
cent of all solid municipal waste. While the Special Rapporteur is concerned at the 
extensive use of landfills, which have an adverse impact on people&#8217;s health, he welcomes 
</p>
<p>the steady decline in their use and that of incinerators since 2005. According to the 
provisions of the new Waste Act, as from 1 January 2013, only non-profit organizations 
that have signed an agreement with the municipal government may perform waste 
management public services; a unified determination of waste collection charges will be 
introduced accordingly. In addition, the new Act will require operators of waste storage 
sites and landfills to pay a waste storage contribution based on the type and quantity of 
waste.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Hazardous substances and wastes 
</b></p>
<p>19. According to information received from the Government, in 2012, the National 
Directorate General for Disaster Management began to increase the number of hazardous 
industrial plants from 169 to 791 under the new national law on disaster management (Act 
CXXVIII) of 2011. While being based on the Seveso Directives, the law broadens their 
scope by introducing a new class of hazardous establishments. The Act therefore covers, 
not only upper- and lower-tier establishments (&#8220;Seveso establishments&#8221;) dealing with 
hazardous substances, but also plants that use or store such materials above the 25 per cent 
limit of lower tier thresholds. European Directive 2008/1/EC on integrated pollution 
prevention and control requires industrial and agricultural activities with a high pollution 
potential to have a permit, which may only be issued if certain environmental conditions are 
met. The Directive is implemented by governmental decree 314/2005 and also covers 
mining activities. Hungary has some 1,250 integrated pollution prevention and control 
installations, of which 600 are on livestock farms and 28 on mining sites.  
</p>
<p>20. Hungary needed only to promulgate a few laws to comply with its legal obligations 
under Regulation (EC) No. 166/2006 of the European Pollutant Release and Transfer 
Register to create its own domestic pollutant release and transfer register system. The 
Special Rapporteur is however concerned by the findings of a survey conducted between 
2000 and 2004 and submitted to the Commissioner showing that, despite the alarming 
evidence that the mortality of men living in the West of Szentgotth&#225;rd due to respiratory 
diseases is four times higher than the national average and that, among women aged 
between 15 and 64, the number of deaths due to cancer is nearly 35 per cent higher than the 
national average, presumably as a result of air pollution. The Commissioner found a 
violation of the right to a healthy environment and to health and called for air tests and 
disclosure of the testing data. The Commissioner also found that the Ministry of Rural 
Development had not fully met its obligation to conduct air quality checks in Vas and Zala 
counties. The Special Rapporteur reminds the State that, without adequate monitoring, no 
means are available to identify and mitigate against environmental hazards. 
</p>
<p>21. Beyond its ratification of the Stockholm Convention, Hungary has made further 
efforts to eliminate persistent organic pollutants through its implementation of EU 
Regulation No. 850/2004 on those pollutants. These compounds, usually found in 
pesticides and resistant to natural decomposition and thus persistent, can be transported 
over long distances. The documented effects of their bio-accumulation in humans include </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8 
</b></p>
<p>cancer, birth defects, repressed immune and reproductive systems and diminished 
intelligence.7 Several compounds controlled by international agreements on persistent 
organic pollutants have never been produced or licensed for use in Hungary, and even those 
that are not controlled by international regulations are banned (such as Dicofol). Hazardous 
substances are thereby subjected to comprehensive regulation.  
</p>
<p>22. Hungary has also banned polychlorinated biphenyls and, in accordance with article 6 
of the Stockholm Convention, has identified the need to destroy abandoned stockpiles. The 
Government is, however, faced with the challenge of identifying toxic substances owing to 
the high costs of chemical analysis. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that existing 
polychlorinated biphenyls constitute a present and continuing danger to the population. He 
alsowishes to remind the State that the European Committee of Social Rights found that 
Hungary was not in conformity with article 11 (on the right to protection of health) because 
it had not taken measures to reduce the mortality rate nor had there been adequate screening 
of the main causes of death especially, because interventions were aimed at children and 
young people and not adults.8 The Special Rapporteur encourages Hungary to comply with 
the Committee&#8217;s recommendation that it assess the true state of the health of the population 
and, in particular, that it establish what role hazardous substances have in the high cancer 
rate or other diseases in general. In so doing, the State will make the necessary advances in 
the right to health it seeks to protect in its Constitution, in particular article XX thereof.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to information and public participation 
</b></p>
<p>23. Even though the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in 
Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Aarhus Convention) was 
promulgated by Act LXXXI of 2001, the Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that 
Hungary has applied its principles since the early 1990s, primarily through the Protection of 
Personal Data and Disclosure of Information of Public Interest Act of 1992, which provides 
for the disclosure of environmental data, and the Environment Act, which defines 
environmental information, outlines how it should be provided, including format and cost 
effectiveness, and recognizes the right of non-governmental environmental organizations to 
participate in various administrative procedures. Furthermore, the Freedom of Electronic 
Information Act of 2005 provides a general framework for access to free and continuous 
public information. Provisions of the Aarhus Convention may be invoked and applied in 
national courts. The Supreme Court adopted decision No. 4/2010 relating to provisions of 
the Convention with the aim of harmonizing and eliminating different interpretations 
related to participation rights. The Special Rapporteur also acknowledges the efforts made 
by Hungary to promote environmental education at all levels through a cross-sectoral 
approach, including by collaboration between the Ministry of the Environment and the 
Ministry of Education. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>24.  Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur not only observed limited public participation 
in, but also inadequate mass media presence on, environmental matters in the national 
media. He therefore calls on the Government to increase its efforts to promote the right to 
know with information that is user-friendly, accessible, adequate and appropriate while 
taking into consideration such limitations as language, Internet access and disabilities. 
Furthermore, the information provided by various ministries in Hungary in order to

<p>strengthen other awareness-raising efforts should be regularly updated and cater for the 
visually impaired. People who reside near hazardous establishments deserve to know the 
dangers and exercise the option of relocating or remaining to mitigate exposure. Hungary 
should therefore increase efforts in the public dissemination of this information. Several 
non-governmental environmental organizations in Hungary involved in advocacy, 
awareness-raising and education activities are credited with the emergence of forest 
schools. The Special Rapporteur received information that State funding of non-
governmental organizations has been reduced drastically, and is concerned at the resulting 
diminishing participation of the public in environment issues.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. The Ajka industrial incident 
</b></p>
<p>25.  During his visit, the Special Rapporteurs also focused on the issue of industrial 
accidents with a view to preventing future accidents and to elaborating measures to 
eliminate or mitigate the adverse impact that such incidents involving hazardous substances 
have on the enjoyment of human rights, including the rights to health, housing, water and 
sanitation, the right to food and a safe and healthy environment, and the right to adequate 
and effective remedy.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Background and response 
</b></p>
<p>26. On 4 October 2010, Hungary experienced the Ajka incident, the worst industrial 
incident and ecological catastrophe in its history. On that day, a reservoir belonging to 
MAL Magyar Aluminium, a company that took over the plant when it was privatized by the 
State, ruptured, releasing the red sludge (highly caustic industrial waste produced in the 
process of alumina extraction from bauxite) contained therein. The substance flooded 
towns, destroying homes and causing injury and fatalities to residents and rescuers in its 
wake. It also caused extensive environmental damage that cost approximately $87 million 
to remediate (and even then not completely).  
</p>
<p>27. According to information received from the Government, the incident occurred at 
12:30 and shortly thereafter, the National Directorate General for Disaster Management 
immediately dispatched a team that was on site within two hours, whereupon it conducted a 
health risk assessment. Simultaneously, medical personnel, fire officers and volunteers 
were also deployed to rescue the injured, search for the missing and generally to ensure the 
preservation of life and the protection of property. Environmental monitoring was set up 
and water samples were taken daily by the National Environment Health Unit for analysis, 
which continued for a month as part of the environmental health surveying system. The 
Special Rapporteur received information that the results showed no contamination of the 
water system; by the second day, it was established that no radiological hazards or toxicity 
were present, but that the substance was highly caustic and alkaline. Houses in the affected 
region are connected to a mains pipe for drinking and household water; however, since 
there were also private wells in the area used primarily for watering gardens, information 
was shared with the public on the importance of testing well water before use. 
</p>
<p>28. Two days after the incident, information on the morphological composition of the 
substance, rescue efforts and safety protocols was made public, although some non-
governmental organizations informed the Special Rapporteur of inconsistent messages of 
the dangers of the red sludge sent out by the company and the State; the organizations were 
particularly critical of the company for its initial message to the general public that the red 
sludge was chemically harmless, an act that aggravated peoples&#8217; exposure to its effects. At 
the same time, the State expressed concern at the company&#8217;s failure to raise the first alarm, 
thus delaying the response and aggravating damage and injury. In order to neutralize the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10 
</b></p>
<p>alkalinity of the sludge, it was decided that gypsum should be used in all affected areas. 
This posed logistical challenges, however, since the gypsum was located in the north of the 
country and required heavy machinery for transportation; consequently, actions to offset the 
chemical damage caused by the sludge were delayed.  
</p>
<p>29. Environmental monitoring during the event showed significant air pollution, with air 
dense with particulate matter and especially high levels of aluminium and iron, with above 
average limits being discovered in Devecser and Kolont&#225;r. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed that the levels had dropped to acceptable levels two weeks after the incident; 
when measurements were taken then, the readings for Kolont&#225;r and Devecser were lower 
than for downtown Budapest. A state of emergency was declared from 6 October to 31 
December 2010 in the area and a disaster recovery plan was put in place. On 11 October, 
the Government began to supervise company activities, while the workforce, including 
management, remained. A team comprising experts from the European Union and WHO 
arrived on 12 October 2012 to carry out an on-site assessment, with the former focusing on 
the impact on the environment, the latter on the impact on public health. They subsequently 
submitted their findings to the Government.9 
</p>
<p><b> B. Impact on human rights 
</b></p>
<p>30. Following the Ajka incident and subsequent exposure of individuals to hazardous 
substances, the impact on the human rights of the people in the affected region was 
significant. It is widely accepted that a clean and healthy environment is a precondition to 
the realization of substantive human rights, including the right to health and the right to 
adequate housing. The Ajka incident also had an impact on the right of people to a healthy 
environment, a right recognized by the Constitution. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur was 
informed of various issues affecting the right to adequate and effective remedy.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Right to health 
</b></p>
<p>31. When the reservoir containing the red sludge collapsed, the most serious immediate 
effects were caused by the high alkalinity (pH 13+) of the sludge. The people of Devecser 
and Kolont&#225;r experienced serious first- and second-degree chemical burns to the skin; 
respiratory problems were also documented. In addition, the health of some 4,000 
volunteers and rescue workers were similarly affected. The Special Rapporteur attaches 
great importance to the issue of occupational health during rescue operations, and reiterates 
the recommendation of WHO that personal protective equipment should be selected on the 
basis of the hazards identified, the protective qualities of the equipment and its suitability 
for the tasks performed&#8221;.10 The Special Rapporteur was concerned at information he 
received indicating that there are no special protocols for the rescue of children, the elderly, 
disabled or other persons in need of protection in the training programme developed for 
disaster management forces in Hungary.  
</p>
<p>32. The National Public Health and Medical Officer Service established a local health 
command centre in Kolont&#225;r where the 2,475 injured persons were given free treatment, 
including hospitalization (108); persons in a severe condition were medically evacuated by 
ambulance (408) or military helicopter to nearby hospitals and to Budapest (3). The public 
health authorities received daily reports on the condition of the patients, and concluded that, 
of all the injuries treated at the on-site clinics, 36 per cent were minor, 51 per cent were

<p>moderate and 14 per cent were serious. A specialized crisis intervention team provided 
stress counselling, post-traumatic assistance and grief support. The Special Rapporteur 
received information that the fatalities that resulted from the incident were due to drowning, 
not directly from the chemical content. Ten people, including three children, died. 
</p>
<p>33. As mentioned above, Hungary is party to the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, of which article 12 recognizes the right of everyone to the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. In its general comment No. 14,11 
the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights described the normative content of 
article 12 and the legal obligations undertaken by the States parties to the Covenant to 
respect, protect and fulfil the right to health. It stated article 12.2 acknowledged that the 
right to health embraced a wide range of socioeconomic factors that promoted the 
conditions in which people can lead a healthy life, and extended to the underlying 
determinants of health, such as food and nutrition, housing, access to safe and potable water 
and adequate sanitation, safe and healthy working conditions, and a healthy environment.12 
With regard to natural and workplace environments, the Committee commented that the 
improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene comprised, inter alia, 
preventive measures in respect of occupational accidents and diseases and &#8220;the prevention 
</p>
<p>and reduction of the population&#8217;s exposure to harmful substances, such as radiation and 
harmful chemicals, or other detrimental environmental conditions that had a direct or an 
indirect impact on human health.13 The Special Rapporteur commends the embodiment of 
this realization of the interdependence and mutual reinforcement of these rights in article 
XX of the Constitution of Hungary, which has been amended to reflect these provisions.  
</p>
<p>34. The governmental committee responsible for the overall coordination of the 
response established an expert group, which included the participation of the Hungarian 
Academy of Science, in order to develop a model to ascertain short- and long-term effects 
on the health of the affected population. Since the bodies of children are more vulnerable to 
stressors, they were specifically subjected to biomonitoring, which measured pollutants in 
the body. Urine samples were taken between November 2010 and April 2012 from the 
children of the affected population, mainly in Devecser and Kolont&#225;r, with children from 
Ajka as the control group. The Public Health Authority found no statistically significant 
difference in the urinary levels of cadmium, cobalt, chromium or nickel excreted by the 
children in the red sludge area or in the control area. Statistically significant differences 
were found between the urinary arsenic and vanadium levels among children in the two 
areas; these differences were, however, not biologically significant, and the values 
measured were similar to the published reference values. The measured concentrations 
from both the red sludge area and the control are were in the range of the published data 
measured in other countries. The Public Health Authority stated that there were no 
significant fluctuations of cadmium during the monitoring period save, for the first and fifth 
quarters, which could be attributed to the normal meteorological conditions of the area and 
winter heating, which significantly contributes to localized air pollution. Some fluctuation 
was also detected in levels of vanadium during the monitoring period, with elevated levels 
in the fifth and sixth quarters attributed to dust in the air, caused by the decision by the 
company to change its storage method from wet to dry technology.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur received information from the Public Health Authority that 
the Government Health Centre continued to monitor the physical and mental health of the 
residents of the affected areas for a year after the incident. Subsequently, however, he 
received information that the screening centre and counselling unit had closed. The Special

<p><b>12 
</b></p>
<p>Rapporteur is concerned about the current and long-term health impact, including 
psychological and particularly post-traumatic syndrome. Part 1 of the European Social 
Charter requires the State to ensure that &#8220;everyone has the right to benefit from any 
measures enabling him to enjoy the highest possible standard of health attainable&#8221;; 
</p>
<p>Hungary should therefore maintain programmes to counteract the damage caused by post-
traumatic stress, among other conditions. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur received 
testimony during the visit from a woman who claimed that her child was chronically 
asthmatic as a result of the incident and that no assistance had been provided for the child&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>care. Without intending to treat the complaint as indicative of the concerns of the broader 
populace affected, the Special Rapporteur nevertheless wishes to remind the State of the 
particular health vulnerabilities of children to pollutants,14 and calls upon the State to ensure 
that measures are taken to encourage the healthy development of infants and children, 
including by providing facilities for the treatment of illness, rehabilitation, and removal of 
expectant mothers15 from environments with hazardous substances,16 and that every child 
receives the protection and care necessary for their proper development as guaranteed by 
article XVI of the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>36. According to the observations made in an occupational health guideline for sodium 
hydroxide (a highly caustic substance similar to the red sludge of the Ajka incident),17 a 
greater number of cases of oesophageal cancer is reported in individuals who have scarring 
of the oesophagus from swallowing sodium hydroxide (although this may due to the 
destruction of tissue rather than the direct carcinogenic action of sodium hydroxide itself). 
The Special Rapporteur draws the attention of the Government of Hungary to the need for 
continued monitoring of the population affected by the Ajka incident to detect potential 
cases of cancer. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Right to adequate housing and right to property 
</b></p>
<p>37. According to the information received, the red sludge damaged 51 houses in 
Kolont&#225;r, 275 in Devecser and 39 in Soml&#243;v&#225;s&#225;rhely, with 284 of them rendered beyond 
repair. Since the houses had been inundated with toxic substances, the National Directorate 
General for Disaster Management decided to have them demolished, thereby acting in 
conformity with the requirement of habitability as described by the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its general comment No. 4.18 Approximately 1,000 
hectares of soil was contaminated by the sludge, rendering it unsuitable for future housing 
developments (unless fully remediated). Efforts by the Government of Hungary to ensure 
the right to housing enshrined in article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights and article 31 of the European Social Charter deserve 
commendation. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to note that, in accordance with the 
&#8220;build-back-better&#8221; approach to post-disaster reconstruction, the Directorate built a total of 
127 houses (87 in Devecser, 21 in Kolont&#225;r and 19 in Soml&#243;v&#225;s&#225;rhely). Another 117 
victims, mainly elderly persons, received compensation in cash. 
</p>
<p>38. During his visit to the site, the Special Rapporteur received testimony from 
survivors and rescuers of having to face a two metre-high wave of sludge that invaded 
homes and swept away cars, farming machinery and livestock. Survivors recounted the

</b></p>
<p>despair in their frantic attempts to salvage housing, land, property and belongings, 
including important documents and family heirlooms. The Special Rapporteur believes that 
the extent of loss in these situations should not only be assessed from an economic point of 
view; the emotional attachment that people have towards their homes and property speak to 
the issue of identity and should not be underestimated. 
</p>
<p>39. With regard to the post-disaster reconstruction efforts by the National Directorate 
General for Disaster Management, the Special Rapporteur received reports of discontent by 
some community members for the loss in equity from alleged lower value housing 
replacements and little monetary consideration for recent renovations; the drop in market 
value of existing houses owing to area contamination; and insufficient consultation and 
inflexibility in planning and construction during post-disaster reconstruction. According to 
the Directorate, however, victims could select their preferred house from several plans, and 
could choose any location in Hungary with equivalent value. The Special Rapporteur was 
pleased to learn that some banks had accorded their customers an amnesty on their 
mortgages for properties destroyed by the incident, and applauds their demonstration of 
corporate responsibility and solidarity. The Special Rapporteur also, however, received 
testimony from residents who had not received an amnesty from their banks and were faced 
with the possible foreclosure on their new home. The Government of Hungary explained 
that the amnesty was at the behest of individual banks, and had no role in negotiating for it 
on behalf of persons affected. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that banks and insurers 
play a critical role in the aftermath of disasters, and that their response can determine how 
people recover from them, without crippling debts. Testimony received also raised concerns 
over the lack of programmes for the new community halls, which prevented people from 
having effective use of these buildings. To this extent, the provision of physical structures 
in post-disaster reconstruction is only part of the solution; a robust plan comprising 
community building programmes should therefore be initiated.  
</p>
<p>40. Restoration of other types of property, besides land, livestock, trucks and furniture, 
was included through replacement or cash compensation provided by the State. Some 
residents complained about the manner in which the coupon system used to provide a range 
of supplies allegedly excluded cheaper companies with which people could redeem 
coupons for goods, while more expensive companies were approved on the basis of 
political affiliation. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that the Government should 
have established more transparent processes to address perceptions of fraud and bias, and 
believes that it is critical that, for post-disaster rehabilitation to be sustainable, people&#8217;s 
ability to participate in and benefit from reconstruction efforts should be strongly 
encouraged and supported.  
</p>
<p>41. The Constitution of Hungary recognizes the right to property (art. XIII), and to the 
protection of property (art. V), as well as the State&#8217;s obligation to &#8220;strive to ensure decent 
housing conditions for everyone&#8221; (art. XXII). Devecser, which is home to a Roma 
community, witnessed the most destruction of residences. The Government assured the 
Special Rapporteur that the community was not discriminated against and indeed received 
the same treatment as non-Roma communities. The Special Rapporteur received, however, 
information according to which, owing to their lack of title and subsequent status as 
unlawful occupiers in a previous damaged settlement, the Roma currently have no security 
of tenure in new houses. The Special Rapporteur was not able to determine the precise 
status of affected Roma people during his visit, but draws the attention of the State to 
general comment No. 4 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which 
stated that, regardless of the type of tenure, all persons should possess a degree of security 
of tenure that guarantees legal protection against forced eviction, harassment and other </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 
</b></p>
<p>threats. States parties should consequently take immediate measures aimed at conferring 
legal security of tenure upon those persons and households currently lacking such 
protection, in genuine consultation with affected persons and groups.19 
</p>
<p>42. The European Court of Human Rights deliberated authoritatively on the protection 
of tenure. In <i>Yordanova and others v. Bulgaria</i>, the Court stated that the eviction of a Roma 
community was unlawful even if they had an informal tenure; the State was therefore in 
violation of article 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Fundamental Freedoms and the obligation of non-interference of the State in this right. 
Article 1 of the Protocol to the Convention (as amended by Protocol No. 11) reinforces the 
notion of possession rather than ownership, thus accommodating the distinct position of 
persons with unsecure tenure and affording them a framework for the protection of 
property. The Special Rapporteur appeals to the Government of Hungary to assure the 
Roma community categorically that they enjoy security of tenure, and to protect them from 
any threat of forced evictions or harassment, present or future. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Right to a safe and healthy environment 
</b></p>
<p>43. As recalled above, the Constitution of Hungary recognizes the right to a healthy 
environment and sets forth several provisions related to environmental protection. The 
Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that, as a result of the Ajka incident and of the 
acknowledgement of the gaps in legislation and regulation, the Mining Act and the 
Construction Act have since been amended to bring such activities under the auspices of the 
Mining Act rather than the Construction Act. The Special Rapporteur understands, 
however, that the Mining Act requires further modification to harmonize it with current 
European Union legislation with regard to the definitions of &#8220;mining activity&#8221; and &#8220;mining 
waste&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>44. The Ajka incident had a tremendous environmental impact: 1,000hectares of land 
were polluted, and rivers were contaminated with toxic impurities, including the Torna 
Creek and the Marcal River ecosystems. The red sludge reached the Danube on 7 October 
2010; however, transboundary effects were prevented when gypsum was introduced into 
the affected portion of the river. According to information provided by the Ministry of 
Rural Development, the Government spent some $87 million on environmental remediation 
(even then, the state of the environment was not completely restored to its pre-incident 
conditions). The contamination of arable land resulted in a loss of harvests, thereby 
affecting the right of farmers to a livelihood. Farmers who opted to keep their land were 
informed by the Ministry of Rural Development that they would not be able to grow any 
produce for the next four years. Similarly, the right to food was affected, given that crops 
and vegetables had been rendered unsuitable for consumption.  
</p>
<p>45. As mentioned above, an environmental health surveillance system was in place for 
daily monitoring of environmental parameters, including water and air quality. 
Furthermore, gypsum was used to neutralize the alkalinity of the red sludge. Some non-
governmental organizations raised concerns at the use of gypsum, given that it left behind 
levels of calcium that were toxic for certain ecosystems. Besides the works necessary to 
clear access roads to facilitate search and rescue operations, 1.1 million m3 of red sludge 
was collected and transported to another reservoir. Even though Hungary has adopted the 
mainland option for disposal of its immense red sludge reserves, the Special Rapporteur 
stresses that concerted efforts are still needed to develop more environmentally sound ways 
</p>
<p>  
 19 <i>Official Records of the Economic and Social Council</i>, <i>Supplement No. 3</i> (E/1992/23), annex III,

<p><b>A/HRC/24/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>of disposal; otherwise, Hungary will remain faced with the inevitable challenge of proper 
storage. Only seven of the world&#8217;s 84 alumina plants use a sea disposal method.  
</p>
<p>46. It is widely held that recycling red sludge is neither economically viable nor 
sustainable. Dry technology, which poses a lesser environmental risk, is becoming more 
common. Wet technology entails storing the sludge in a water-based solution, with a layer 
of water above it; dry technology entails dehydrating the sludge. The Special Rapporteur 
understands that current industrial practices involve neutralizing or reducing the alkalinity 
by washing the sludge several times with water (or by a relatively new process using 
seawater). He is, however, concerned at the use of large volumes of water and at the 
possible pollution of the water supply that may arise from this practice. Hungary should 
consider more sustainable options in accordance with the spirit of the provisions it has set 
for itself in its Constitution. Some countries recycle red sludge to manufacture construction 
bricks, a practice that appears to be the most environmentally sound method currently 
available. As a signatory to the European Social Charter, Hungary is required by article 11 
thereof &#8220;to remove as far as possible the causes of ill-health&#8217;; and, to that end, greater effort 
is required to realize environmentally sound recycling opportunities.  
</p>
<p>47. The above-mentioned dry technology has, however, disadvantages. During dry 
weather, wind may lift dust particles from the surface of the Ajka reservoir and blow them 
down the Lorenputzel valley. The Special Rapporteur received information that other red 
sludge reservoirs in the country deserve close scrutiny, in particular, the Alm&#225;sf&#252;zit&#245; 
alumina plant near the Danube, owing to the potential for serious transboundary pollution. 
He therefore calls on the Government to ensure that the impact of these hazardous 
substances and wastes on people&#8217;s health and the environment is mitigated.  
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur received information that there was lack of clarity about 
which authority had competence for authorization and supervision of the reservoirs, and 
that no regulatory authority regularly inspected their structural integrity, even though some 
experts had raised concerns that the dams were gradually sinking. Furthermore, it appears 
that a number of different and overlapping entities authorized and regulated the reservoirs, 
resulting in a fragmented approach to management and, consequently, inaction. 
Furthermore, civil society actors informed the Special Rapporteur that the substandard 
structural integrity of the dam and the possibility of hazardous wastes therein seeping into 
the marine and terrestrial environment had been raised with the Government before the 
incident, but that these concerns had not been heeded. According to other information 
received, when the dam broke, it had exceeded its storage capacity by three times, which 
compounded the severity of damage caused. In addition, the sludge reservoir was classified 
as non-hazardous and was thus not subject to European Directive 2006/21/EC on the 
management of waste from extractive industries. The Special Rapporteur was disappointed 
to receive information that indicated that the environmental management system was 
getting weaker as a result of major dismissals, including of environmental inspectors, thus 
likely rendering more ineffective the monitoring of potentially dangerous toxic sites 
countrywide.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Right to adequate and effective remedy 
</b></p>
<p>49. Article 2.3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guarantees 
victims of human rights violations an effective remedy, which includes environmental 
wrongs that impinge on human rights. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the attempts made 
by the authorities to ensure accountability, facilitate reparation and prevent such incidents 
in future, namely by means of official inquiries into the incident, including the 
parliamentary commission of inquiry and the inquiry conducted by the Commissioner for 
Fundamental Rights. The Special Rapporteur concurs with the Commissioner&#8217;s views that, 
in cases of interpretive uncertainties, an approach with a stricter protection of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/39/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16 
</b></p>
<p>environment should be adopted. For that reason, it was the responsibility of the authorities 
in this instance to determine the goals of the regulations, the aim of the legislator and the 
social interests of preventing disasters.20  
</p>
<p>50. Under Article XXV of the Constitution, everyone has the right to submit a complaint 
to any organ exercising public power, and any person causing damage to the environment is 
obliged to restore it, or to bear all costs of restoration, as defined by law. Nonetheless, 
under the revised Constitution, <i>actio popularis</i> is no longer possible. The Special 
Rapporteur is concerned about the restricted access to the Constitutional Court, and calls 
for a robust and comprehensive legal aid scheme to be established as a minimum. 
Reassuringly, any potential human rights violations resulting from damage to the 
environment may still be submitted to the Commissioner of Fundamental Rights, who may, 
inter alia, submit it for review to the Constitutional Court. The Special Rapporteur is 
nevertheless of the view that the potential for the Commissioner to serve as an effective 
monitoring tool and alternative dispute resolution mechanism is not being fully exploited, 
nor is its potential to serve as a sounding board for businesses in matters relating to human 
rights in business.  
</p>
<p>51. Although Hungary has a civil liability framework, there clearly are regulatory and 
implementation gaps, as shown by the inability to enforce sanctions on MAL Magyar 
Aluminium, despite the existence of legislature. The Environmental Protection Act 
stipulates that users of the environment are bound to give the environment protection. The 
commissioner&#8217;s inquiry concluded, inter alia, that, despite the above, detailed implementing 
rules had not been elaborated. A separate inquiry by a parliamentary commission identified 
more or less the same issues. After the incident, the company was fined $1.5 billion by the 
Environment Inspectorate for several failures of compliance, including $2,000 for failing to 
minimize discharges into the environment. In accordance with government legislation, the 
company was insured, but the fines were 90 per cent higher than the amount for which the 
company was insured, and would result in its bankruptcy and closure. A policy decision 
was taken by the State to maintain operations. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at such 
situations, where economic factors, such as the need to safeguard jobs, are in conflict with 
environmental and human rights considerations, and where companies that infringe human 
rights are ultimately not penalized. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur was unable to comment more specifically on issues of 
liability, given that the case (residents had filed civil and criminal cases against MAL 
Magyar Aluminium and were seeking damages) was <i>sub judice</i> during the period under 
review. There were, however, concerns that the prosecution only included lower level 
personnel and excluded management and other decision makers. The Special Rapporteur 
recalls general comment No. 31 of the Human Rights Committee, in which the Committee 
noted that reparations should be provided to individuals whose rights had been violated.21  
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Hungary of its obligation to 
protect against human rights abuses by establishing a framework to hold businesses 
accountable for any business-related impact on human rights.22 Some government 
authorities expressed frustration at their lack of access to information on multinational 
companies, in order to screen their track record in human rights and environmental 
compliance in other places of operation, before they are awarded a license to operate in 
Hungary.

<p>54. In accordance with his mandate to assess the role of business in hazardous 
substances, the Special Rapporteur calls on that sector in Hungary to recognize the right of 
access to information and to avoid using the privilege of confidentiality to shield health and 
safety information on hazardous substances. The Special Rapporteur urges businesses in 
Hungary, especially those in the mining sector, to respect human rights by preventing any 
negative impact on them and by providing remediation or remedy for any adverse impact 
caused.  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur believes that the court case creates an opportunity for 
Hungary to set the regional tone for just reparations for environmental injustices. The 
people affected by the Ajka incident demand, and deserve, final and just restitution, 
alongside the expectation that all people must be held accountable for the contamination of 
their property, loss of livelihoods and of lives. The Special Rapporteur is confident that the 
course of justice will be steadfast, and that responsibility will be fairly directed, not to one 
person but to all those responsible, without distinction, fear or favour, and that indeed the 
polluter will pay.
