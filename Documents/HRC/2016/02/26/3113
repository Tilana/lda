<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>,

<p><i>Guided </i>by the purposes, principles and provisions of the Charter of the United 
Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided also </i>by article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according 
to which everyone has the right to a nationality and no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of 
his or her nationality, and article 2 of the same Declaration, according to which everyone is 
entitled to the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration without distinction of any 
kind, including on the basis of sex, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind </i>the challenges still faced by all countries throughout the world to 
overcome inequality between men and women, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging </i>that the right to a nationality is a universal human right and that no 
one may be arbitrarily denied or deprived of a nationality, including on discriminatory 
grounds such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or 
social origin, property, birth, disability or other status, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>the provisions of international and regional human rights instruments 
recognizing the right of every child to acquire a nationality, and not be arbitrarily deprived 
of his or her nationality, inter alia, article 24, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, articles 7 and 8 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and 
article 29 of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant

article 5 (d)(iii) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting also </i>the provisions of international and regional human rights and other 
instruments that specify the obligations of States parties to register every child immediately 
after birth, inter alia, article 24, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the role that 
birth registration plays in preventing statelessness, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind </i>the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and the 
Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>Human Rights Council resolutions 7/10 of 27 March 2008, 10/13 of 26 
March 2009 and 13/2 of 24 March 2010, as well as 12/6 and 12/17 of 1 October 2009 and

</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing </i>that the prevention and reduction of statelessness are primarily the 
responsibility of States, in appropriate cooperation with the international community, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 66/133<b> </b>of 19 December 2011, in which the 
Assembly urged the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to 
continue its work with regard to identifying stateless persons, preventing and reducing 
statelessness, and protecting stateless persons, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming </i>the increased efforts of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees to prevent and reduce statelessness among women and children 
and, where necessary, to provide protection for stateless women and children, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming </i>the intergovernmental event held at the ministerial level of States 
Members of the United Nations on the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the 
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the fiftieth anniversary of the Convention 
on the Reduction of Statelessness, in particular the pledges made by States, 
</p>

nationality or without birth registration are vulnerable to trafficking in persons and other 
abuses and violations of their human rights,

the absence of proof that the foundling is not a national of the State where found; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Calls upon </i>States to ensure free birth registration, including free or low-fee 
late birth registration, for every child, and underscores the importance of effective birth 
registration and provision of documentary proof of birth irrespective of his or her 
immigration status and that of his or her parents or family members, which can contribute 
to reducing statelessness, as well as reducing vulnerability to trafficking in persons and 
other abuses and violations of their human rights; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Urges </i>all States to ensure that their international obligations and procedural 
safeguards are observed in all decisions concerning the acquisition, deprivation, loss or 
change of nationality, including availability of effective and timely judicial review; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Calls upon </i>States to ensure that effective and appropriate remedies are 
available to all persons, in particular women and children, whose right to a nationality has 
been violated, including restoration of nationality and expedient provision of documentary 
proof of nationality by the State responsible for the violation; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Encourages </i>relevant special procedures of the Human Rights Council, 
including the Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in 
practice, as well as specialized agencies, including the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund and 
the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, and 
invites treaty bodies, in coordination with the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees, to address and highlight issues relating to the right to 
nationality and statelessness among women and children, within their mandates;

Status of Stateless Persons and the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness if they 
have not already done so; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Calls upon </i>States to implement their international legal obligations to combat

provision of appropriate assistance to stateless persons who may be victims of trafficking, 
paying particular attention to trafficking in women and children; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Calls upon </i>all States to ensure that all persons, in particular women and 
children, regardless of their nationality status, enjoy their human rights and fundamental 
freedoms; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Requests </i>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to prepare, in consultation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees, the Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and 
in practice, States and other relevant stakeholders, a report on discrimination against 
women in nationality-related matters, including the impact on children, under national and 
international law, including best practices by States and other measures that eliminate 
nationality discrimination against women and avoid or reduce statelessness before the 
twenty-third session of the Council.
