This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements in this quarterly report include, among others, 
statements regarding our capital needs, business plans and expectations. Such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties regarding the market price of copper, availability 
of funds, government regulations, permitting, common share prices, operating costs, capital costs, outcomes of ore reserve development, recoveries and other factors. Forward-looking 
statements are made, without limitation, in relation to operating plans, property exploration and development, availability of funds, environmental reclamation, operating costs and permit
acquisition. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking 
statements by terminology such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “expect”, “plan”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “predict”, “potential” or “continue”, the negative of such terms 
or other comparable terminology. Actual events or results may differ materially. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks outlined in our 
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2012, and, from time to time, in other reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). These 
factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-
looking statements.

Handeni Gold Inc.  
(An Exploration Stage Company)  
Notes to the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements as of November 30, 2012 
(Expressed in U.S. dollars) 
(Unaudited)
1.
2.
Nature of Operations and Continuance of Business 
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 5, 2004. On February 14, 2012, the Company changed its name from Douglas Lake Minerals Inc. to Handeni
Gold Inc. (the “Company”). The Company is an Exploration Stage Company, as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards 
Codification (“ASC”) 915, Development Stage Entities. The Company’s principal business is the acquisition and exploration of mineral resources located in Tanzania, Africa. 
The Company has not presently determined whether its properties contain mineral reserves that are economically recoverable. 
 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in
the normal course of business. The Company has never generated revenues since inception and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate earnings
in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability
of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and to determine the existence, discovery and successful exploitation of economically recoverable
reserves in its resource properties, confirmation of the Company’s interests in the underlying properties, and the attainment of profitable operations. As at November 30, 2012, 
the Company has not generated any revenues and has accumulated losses of $112,699,279 since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. The Company plans to raise equity and/or debt financing to fund its operations. These consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as
a going concern. 
 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
a)
Basis of Presentation 
 
These  consolidated  financial  statements  and  related  notes  are  presented  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States,  and  are 
expressed in U.S. dollars. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries described as follows. In June 2011, the 
Company incorporated in Tanzania a new wholly-owned subsidiary, HG Limited (formerly DLM Tanzania Limited), which undertakes mineral property exploration 
activities in Tanzania. The Company also has a wholly-owned non-operating Tanzanian subsidiary (Douglas Lake Tanzania Limited). 
 
All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company’s fiscal year-end is May 31. 
 
Interim Financial Statements 
 
The interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial 
information and with the instructions to Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Form 10- Q. They do not include all of the information and footnotes required 
by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s 
audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended May 31, 2012, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on August 
27, 2012 with the SEC. 
 
The interim financial statements included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the opinion of management, 
are necessary to present fairly the Company’s financial position at November 30, 2012, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the interim period ended 
November 30, 2012. The results of operations for the three and six months ended November 30, 2012 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for 
future quarters or the full year. 
 
Use of Estimates 
 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and 
expenses in the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability and useful life of long-lived assets, mineral 
prospecting  licenses,  stock-based  compensation,  deferred  income  tax  asset  valuation  allowances  and  contingent  liabilities.  The  Company  bases  its  estimates  and
assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis 
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual 
results  experienced  by  the  Company  may  differ  materially  and  adversely  from  the  Company’s  estimates.  To  the  extent  there  are  material  differences  between  the 
estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.

(Expressed in U.S. dollars) 
(Unaudited)
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
d)
Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share 
 
The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per 
share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted 
average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period 
using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used 
in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their 
effect is anti-dilutive. 
 
Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
 
ASC  220,  Comprehensive  Income  establishes  standards  for  the  reporting  and  display  of  comprehensive  loss  and  its  components  in  the  financial  statements.  As  at 
November 30, 2012, the Company’s components of other comprehensive income (loss) and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are an unrealized fair value
gain (loss) on available for sale marketable securities. 
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
Cash  and  cash  equivalents  are  carried  at  fair  value  and  they  comprise  cash  on  hand,  deposits  held  with  banks  and  other  highly  liquid  investments.  Highly  liquid 
investments  are  readily  convertible  to  cash  and  generally  have  maturities  of  three  months  or  less  from  the  time  acquired.  The  Company  places  its  cash  and  cash 
equivalents with high quality financial institutions which the Company believes limits credit risk.
 
Marketable Securities 
 
The Company reports investments in marketable equity securities at fair value based on quoted market prices. All investment securities are designated as available for 
sale with unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders’ equity. Unrealized losses that are other than temporary are recognized in earnings. Realized gains and 
losses are accounted for on the specific identification method.
 
The  Company  periodically  reviews  these  investments  for  other-than-temporary  declines  in  fair  value  based  on  the  specific  identification  method  and  writes  down 
investments  to  their  fair  value  when  an  other-than-temporary  decline  has  occurred.  When  determining  whether  a  decline  is  other-than-temporary,  the  Company 
examines (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value of an investment has been lower than its carrying value: (ii) the financial condition and near-term 
prospects of the investee, including any specific events that may influence the operations of the investee such as changes in technology that may impair the earnings 
potential of the investee: and (iii) the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment in the investee for a sufficient period of time to allow for any anticipated
recovery  in  market  value.  The  Company  generally  believes  that  an  other-than-temporary  decline  has  occurred  when  the  fair  value  of  the  investment  is  below  the
carrying value for one year, absent of evidence to the contrary.
 
Property and Equipment 
 
Property and equipment consists of office equipment, automobiles and computer software recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis as follows:
Automobiles 
Camp and equipment 
Computer software 
Office furniture and equipment

Mineral Property Costs 
 
The Company has been in the exploration stage since its inception on January 5, 2004 and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations. It is primarily 
engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mining properties. Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred. Mineral prospecting licenses and mineral 
property acquisition costs are initially capitalized. The Company assesses the carrying costs for impairment under ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment at each 
fiscal quarter end. When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the 
costs then incurred to develop such property, are capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using the units-of- production method over the estimated life of the probable 
reserve. If mineral properties are subsequently abandoned or impaired, any capitalized costs will be charged to operations.

Long-Lived Assets 
 
In  accordance  with  ASC  360,  Property  Plant  and  Equipment  the  Company  tests  long-lived  assets  or  asset  groups  for  recoverability  when  events  or  changes  in 
circumstances  indicate  that  their  carrying  amount  may  not  be  recoverable.  Circumstances  which  could  trigger  a  review  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  significant 
decreases  in  the  market  price  of  the  asset;  significant  adverse  changes  in  the  business  climate  or  legal  factors;  accumulation  of  costs  significantly  in  excess  of  the 
amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of 
continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of 
its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the 
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is 
recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.
 
Asset Retirement Obligations 
 
The Company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with the provisions of ASC 440 Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations which requires 
the Company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of 
tangible long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. The Company did not have any asset retirement 
obligations as of November 30, 2012 and May 31, 2012.
 
Financial Instruments 
 
ASC 825, Financial Instruments requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and the fair value of financial instruments, which include cash and cash 
equivalents, restricted cash equivalent, restricted marketable securities, and accounts payable were estimated to approximate their carrying values due to the immediate 
or short-term maturities of these financial instruments. 
 
The Company’s operations are in Canada and Africa, which results in exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency rates. The financial risk is the risk to
the  Company’s  operations  that  arise  from  fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates  and  the  degree  of  volatility  of  these  rates.  Currently,  the  Company  does  not  use 
derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk.
 
Income Taxes 
 
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. The asset and liability method provides that
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of 
assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws
that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is 
believed more likely than not to be realized. 
 
Foreign Currency Translation 
 
The functional and reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to 
United States dollars in accordance with ASC 740 Foreign Currency Translation Matters, using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Average rates are used to translate 
revenues and expenses. 
 
Gains  and  losses  arising  on  translation  or  settlement  of  foreign  currency  denominated  transactions  or  balances  are  included  in  the  determination  of  income.  The 
Company has not, to the date of these financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
 
To the extent that the Company incurs transactions that are not denominated in its functional currency, they are undertaken in Canadian dollars (“Cdn$”) and Tanzanian 
shillings. The Company has not, to the date of these financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.

Stock-based Compensation 
 
The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Based Compensation and ASC 505, Equity Based Payments to 
Non-Employees,  which  requires  the  measurement  and  recognition  of  compensation  expense  based  on  estimated  fair  values  for  all  share-based  awards  made  to 
employees and directors, including stock options. 
 
ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The Company uses the Black-Scholes 
option-pricing  model  as  its  method  of  determining  fair  value.  This  model  is  affected  by  the  Company’s  stock  price  as  well  as  assumptions  regarding  a  number  of 
subjective variables. These subjective variables include, but are not limited to the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and 
projected  employee  stock  option  exercise  behaviours.  The  value  of  the  portion  of  the  award  that  is  ultimately  expected  to  vest  is  recognized  as  an  expense  in  the 
statement of operations over the requisite service period.
 
All  transactions  in  which  goods  or  services  are  the  consideration  received  for  the  issuance  of  equity  instruments  are  accounted  for  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the 
consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.
 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and does not believe that 
there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
 
Reclassification 
 
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period’s financial statements to conform to the current period’s presentation.

Mineral Properties and Licenses 
 
a)
Handeni Properties, Tanzania, Africa 
 
On September 21, 2010, the Company completed a Mineral Property Acquisition Agreement with IPP Gold Limited (“IPP Gold”), and the Company acquired four 
prospecting licences totalling approximately 800 square kilometres, located in the Handeni District of Tanzania (the “Handeni Properties”). IPP Gold retained a 2.5% 
net smelter royalty (“NSR”) on the Handeni Properties and the Company has the option to reduce the NSR to 1.25% by paying $5,000,000. If the NSR is reduced to
1.25% the maximum NSR for any year is capped at $1,000,000. In any year the NSR payment is less than $1,000,000 the difference between the actual NSR payment 
and $1,000,000 will be carried forward to subsequent years. In addition if the London spot price for gold is equal to or greater than $1,500 then the NSR will increase 
from 2.5% to 3%. The Company issued 133,333,333 restricted shares of common stock to IPP Gold to acquire the Handeni Properties and no further payments to IPP 
Gold in shares or cash is required.
 
On September 1, 2010, the Company entered into a Transaction Fee Agreement with a consultant for services related to soliciting offers from and in assisting in the 
negotiation with potential Company financiers, purchasers, acquisition targets and/or joint venture development partners (each such party being a “Potential Investor”). 
The initial term of the agreement is a period of 60 days and automatically renews monthly unless otherwise specifically renewed in writing by each party or terminated 
by the Company. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company agreed to pay the consultant a transaction fee for each completed property acquisition transaction in Tanzania 
(a “Completed Transaction”). The transaction fee is 12.5% of the shares issuable under each Completed Transaction, payable in restricted common shares at the lowest
priced security issuable under each Completed Transaction. On September 30, 2010, the Company issued 16,666,667 restricted shares of common stock pursuant to the 
Transaction Fee Agreement in relation to the acquisition of the Handeni Properties.
 
The fair value of the 133,333,333 shares of the Company’s common stock issued to IPP Gold pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement and the 16,666,667 shares of the 
Company’s common stock issued pursuant to the Transaction Fee Agreement totalled $60,000,000.
 
On November 30, 2010, the capitalized acquisition costs of the Handeni Properties were tested for impairment by the Company’s management as required by ASC 360. 
Management determined that no positive cash flows from the Handeni Properties could be identified or supported and a full impairment loss was recognized in expenses 
for the $60,000,000 acquisition cost. 
 
On August 5, 2011, the Company entered a Mineral Property Acquisition Agreement (the “2011 Acquisition Agreement”) with Handeni Resources Limited (“Handeni 
Resources”), a limited liability company registered under the laws of Tanzania. The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company has an existing ownership
and/or  beneficial  interest(s)  in  Handeni  Resources.  Pursuant  to  the  2011  Acquisition  Agreement,  the  Company  had  an  exclusive  option  to  acquire  from  Handeni 
Resources a 100% interest in mineral licenses covering an area of approximately 2.67 square kilometres to the east of Magambazi Hill, which is adjacent to the area 
covered by the Company’s four existing prospecting licenses (totalling approximately 800 square kilometres) in the Handeni District.

Handeni Properties, Tanzania, Africa (continued) 
 
On November 30, 2011, the Company completed the 2011 Acquisition Agreement and issued 15,000,000 restricted common shares to Handeni Resources as payment. 
As at November 30, 2011, the fair market price of the Company’s common stock was $0.11 per share; accordingly, the Company recorded a total fair market value of
$1,650,000 as the mineral licenses acquisition cost. 
 
To comply with the laws and regulations of the Republic of Tanzania whereby foreign companies may not own primary mining licenses (“PMLs”), on July 19, 2012, the 
Company entered into an Addendum agreement to the 2011 Acquisition Agreement whereby Handeni Resources, on behalf of the Company, administers the 32 PMLs 
until  such time as a  mining  license on the 32 PMLs (2.67 km2  ) have been  allocated. During this period Handeni Resources is conducting exploration and mining 
activities on the PMLs as directed by the Company. 
 
Mkuvia Alluvial Gold Project, Tanzania, Africa 
 
On  June  27,  2008,  the  Company  entered  into  a  Joint  Venture  Agreement  that  grants  the  Company  the  right  to  explore  for  minerals  on  properties  in  Liwale  and 
Nachigwea Districts of Tanzania known as the Mkuvia Alluvial Gold Project, in consideration for the payment of $1,000,000 (paid) upon signing the agreement and 
$540,000 over five years beginning July 15, 2008. The $540,000 is payable in stages on a quarterly basis of which $80,000 must be paid in the first year, and $460,000 
over the next five years. The holder of the property licenses retains a net smelter royalty return of 3%.
 
On June 5, 2009, the Company entered into a new joint venture which reduced the area covered by the original agreement to approximately 380 square kilometres. 
Pursuant to the new joint venture agreement, the Company was required to pay $40,000 upon the signing of the new agreement. In addition, the joint venture partner is 
still entitled to receive a perpetual net smelter royalty return of 3% from any product realized from the property underlying the prospecting licenses. By entering into the 
new joint venture agreement, the Company is no longer required to pay the balance of the $460,000 previously due under the prior joint venture agreement. The new 
joint venture agreement covers prospecting licenses No. 5673/2009, No. 5669/2009, No. 5664/2009, and No. 5662/2009, all of which were renewed on June 12, 2009 
for a period of three years. 
 
On November 7, 2009, the Company entered into its first agreement with Ruby Creek Resources Inc. (“RCR”) in which RCR has the right to acquire a 70% interest in 
125  square  kilometres  of  the  Company’s  interest  in  the  380  square  kilometres  covered  by  the  four  prospecting  licenses  in  the  Mkuvia  Alluvial  Gold  Project  in 
consideration for $3,000,000 payable as follows:

$750,000 payable within 12 months of closing.
 
$750,000 payable within 24 months of closing, and
 
$750,000 payable within 36 months of closing. This payment may be made in common shares of RCR. The shares will be valued at the 10 day average trading
price of RCR’s common stock prior to the payment date.
During fiscal 2010 the Company recognized $350,000 in other income for the receipt of option payments.
On  May  24,  2010,  in  a  second  agreement  (fully  executed  on  June  16,  2010)  between  RCR  and  the  Company,  RCR  has  to  the  right  to  earn  a  70%  interest  in  the 
remaining 255 square kilometres of the 380 square kilometre Mkuvia Alluvial Gold Project by making additional payments totalling $6,000,000 to the Company.
The schedule by which RCR is to pay such $6,000,000 to the Company is as follows:

Mkuvia Alluvial Gold Project, Tanzania, Africa (continued)
 
Thus, the combined payments under the November 7, 2009 and the May 24, 2010 agreements provide for a total commitment of $9,000,000 payable to the Company by 
RCR to purchase a 70% interest in the entire 380 square kilometre Mkuvia Alluvial Gold Project. The ownership structure of the interest in the Mkuvia Alluvial Gold 
Project  shall  be  a  70%  interest  RCR,  a  25%  interest  for  the  Company,  and  a  5%  interest  for  Mr.  Mkuvia  Maita,  the  original  owner  of  the  underlying  prospecting 
licenses. In addition, Mr. Maita retains a 3% net smelter royalty.
 
On June 3, 2010, the Company and RCR incorporated Ruby Creek Resources (Tanzania) Limited (“Ruby Creek Tanzania”) to manage the mining operations in the 
Mkuvia  Gold  Project  in  Tanzania.  Ruby  Creek  Resources  (Tanzania)  Limited,  a  joint  venture  company  (the  “Joint  Venture  Company”),  is  owned  by  Ruby  Creek 
Resources (70%), the Company (25%) and Mr. Mkuvia Maita (5%).
 
During fiscal 2011 the Company recognized a total of $3,110,000 in other income for the receipt of the shares at fair market value and the option payments (i) and (ii). 
The  Company  has  not  yet  received  the  $450,000  option  payment  (iii)  nor  received  the  $1,000,000 option payment (iv)  which  are  overdue  and  the  agreement  is  in 
default. Prospecting licenses numbered 5664/2009 and 5669/2009, which form a part of the joint venture project, were registered to a third party without the Company’s 
approval. 
 
RCR filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Supreme Court, State of New York, on February 8, 2012, alleging the Company’s involvement in a fraudulent transfer 
and breach of agreements. The Company is of the view that such allegations are without merit and intends to vigorously contest the action. On February 23, 2012, the 
Company filed a lawsuit against RCR in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, seeking relief for RCR’s breach of its payment obligations under these agreements and 
seeking an order that RCR remove the U.S. restrictive legend from RCR shares issued to the Company under the agreements (see Note 12c).
 
On April 27, 2006, the Company entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement with Canaco Resources Inc. (“Canaco”), a Canadian public company. Under the terms of 
the agreement, Canaco paid $350,000 (received during fiscal 2007) to the Company. In connection with this agreement, the Company was required to issue 200,000 
restricted shares of common stock with a fair value of $88,000. As at May 31 and November 30, 2011, the 200,000 shares were not issued and $88,000 was included in 
common stock subscribed. During fiscal 2012 it was determined that the Company no longer has any obligations under this agreement, including the obligation to issue 
such 200,000 shares, and therefore $88,000 was recorded as a recovery of mineral property costs for stock no longer issuable. 
 
On November 17, 2006, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Atlas to acquire Prospecting License No. 3920/2006 known as “Shinyanga” or 
“Magembe,” which covers an area of approximately 46 square kilometres in Tanzania. The Licenses were transferred to the Company’s name on signing the agreement 
for  an  aggregate  purchase  price  of  $200,000  (paid)  and  4,500,000  restricted  shares  of  common  stock.  The  Company  determined  the  fair  value  of  the  shares  to  be 
$3,172,500. As at May 31, 2007, the Company issued 1,500,000 shares at the fair value of $1,057,500. During fiscal 2010, the Company decided to focus on other 
properties and has let the Magembe prospecting license lapse. As at May 31 2011, the remaining 3,000,000 shares at the fair value of $2,115,000 was included in 
common stock subscribed. During fiscal 2012 it was determined that the Company no longer has any obligations under this agreement, including the obligation to issue 
such 3,000,000 shares, and therefore the $2,115,000 was recorded during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2012 as a recovery of mineral property costs for stock no longer 
issuable. 
 
On  November  17,  2006, the Company entered into an  Asset  Purchase Agreement  with  Hydro  Geos  to  acquire six  Prospecting  Licenses, which  covered  an area  of 
approximately 2,388.79 square kilometres in Tanzania. Prospecting License No.’s 3868/2006, 3671/2005, 3398/2005, 3105/2005, 3211/2005, and 2961/2004 had been 
transferred to the Company’s name on signing the agreement for a then aggregate and proposed purchase price of $600,000 (the “Cash Payments”) and the proposed 
issuance of 4,000,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock at a fair value of $2,820,000. An initial Cash Payment of $150,000 was made on the signing of 
the agreement, however, no further Cash Payments were made and no common shares of the Company were issued due to the fact that the underlying Prospecting 
Licenses were allowed to lapse by Hydro Geos. As at May 31, 2011 and November 30, 2011, $250,000 was included in accrued liabilities. During fiscal 2012 it was 
determined that the Company no longer has any obligations under this agreement, including the obligation to pay such $250,000, and therefore the accrued $250,000 
liability was written off during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2012.

On August 5, 2011, the Company entered a Mineral Property Acquisition Agreement (the “2011 Acquisition Agreement”) with Handeni Resources Limited (“Handeni 
Resources”),  a  limited  liability  company  registered  under  the  laws  of  Tanzania.  The  Chairman  has  an  existing  ownership  and/or  beneficial  interest(s)  in  Handeni
Resources. Pursuant to the 2011 Acquisition Agreement, the Company had an exclusive option to acquire from Handeni Resources a 100% interest in mineral licenses 
covering  an  area  of  approximately  2.67  square  kilometres  to  the  east  of  Magambazi  Hill,  which  is  adjacent  to  the  area  covered  by  the  Company’s  four  existing 
prospecting licenses (totalling approximately 800 square kilometres) in the Handeni District. On November 30, 2011, the Company completed such acquisition and 
issued 15,000,000 shares of restricted common stock at a fair market price of $0.11 per share to Handeni Resources in connection with the acquisition (see Note 7a).
 
During the six months ended November 30, 2012, the Company paid $57,000 (2011 - $72,000) and incurred $15,000 payables (2011 - $Nil) of administration and

The Company was committed to the payment of a cash fee of 7% within 48 hours of the receipt of proceeds from the exercise of any warrants attached to the 17,757,777 
units sold by Rodman & Renshaw in the March 2011 private placements. During the six months ended November 30, 2012, 5,446,667 stock purchase warrants related 
to such units expired. The remaining 12,311,110 stock purchase warrants related to such units are exercisable on or before September 29, 2013.
 
The Company is committed to the payment of a cash fee of 7% of the purchase price and the issuance of warrants equal to 7% of the shares issued with respect to any 
public or private financing provided by investors whom Rodman & Renshaw introduced, directly or indirectly, in the March 2011 private placements within 24 months 
of the closing of the March 2011 private placements. 
 
On February 8, 2012, RCR filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Supreme Court, State of New York, in which RCR alleges that the Company participated in a 
fraudulent transfer of certain mineral property interests in Tanzania that RCR had the right to purchase pursuant to a series of agreements with the Company (see Note 
7b). 
 
On February 23, 2012, the Company filed a lawsuit against RCR in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, seeking relief for RCR’s breach of its payment obligations 
under these agreements and seeking an order that RCR remove the U.S. restrictive legend from RCR shares issued to the Company (see Note 3) under the agreements. 
As of August 31, 2012, RCR is in default with respect to $1.45 million in scheduled payments due to the Company under the agreements.
 
The Company is of the view that RCR’s allegations are without merit and intends to continue to vigorously defend against the RCR lawsuit and to pursue its claims 
against RCR. No future legal costs that may be incurred have been accrued as an expense and no loss or gain from the lawsuit and claim can be reasonably estimated or 
recorded at this time.
Fair Value Measurements 
 
ASC 820 requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value
hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value 
hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair
value:
Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar 
assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); 
or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of 
the assets or liabilities.

Fair Value Measurements (continued) 
 
Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash equivalent and restricted marketable securities are determined based on “Level 1” inputs, 
which  consist  of  quoted  prices  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets.  Management  believes  that  the  recorded  values  of  all  of  the  Company’s  other  financial  instruments 
approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.
 
As at November 30, 2012, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis presented on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
 
Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis were presented on the Company’s balance sheet as of November 30, 2012, as follows:

Management believes that the recorded values of all of our other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates
or durations.
The Company has operations in Tanzania, which results in exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency rates. The financial risk is the risk to the Company’s 
operations that arise from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the degree of volatility of these rates. Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to reduce
its exposure to foreign currency risk.

Overview
We are an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. We have interests in mineral claims known as the Handeni District Project and the 
Mkuvia Alluvial  Gold  Project  (of which the  licenses  have  lapsed), located in the Republic of  Tanzania in East Africa,  through prospecting  licenses issued  by  the government  of the 
Republic of Tanzania.
None of our mineral claims contain any substantiated mineral deposits, resources or reserves of minerals to date. Exploration has been carried out on these claims, in particular the 4 PLs 
(prospecting licenses) of 800 km2 in the Handeni District. Accordingly, additional exploration of these mineral claims is required before any conclusion can be drawn as to whether any 
commercially viable mineral deposit may exist on any of our mineral claims. Our plan of operations is to continue exploration and drilling work in order to ascertain whether our mineral 
claims warrant further advanced exploration to determine whether they possess commercially exploitable deposits of minerals. We will not be able to determine whether or not any of our 
mineral claims contain a commercially exploitable mineral deposit, resource or reserve, until appropriate exploratory work has been completed and an economic evaluation based on that 
work concludes economic viability.
We are considered an exploration or exploratory stage company, because we are involved in the examination and investigation of land that we believe may contain valuable minerals, for 
the purpose of discovering the presence of ore, if any, and its extent. There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on the properties underlying our mineral claim 
interests, and considerable further exploration will be required before a final evaluation as to the economic and legal feasibility for our future exploration is determined.
Our Mineral Claims
Handeni District Prospecting Licenses
Currently, our primary focus is on the Handeni District Project. Effective September 21, 2010, our Board of Directors ratified the entering into and immediate closing of a certain Mineral 
Property Acquisition Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) dated September 15, 2010 with IPP Gold Limited (“IPP Gold”), pursuant to which we acquired an undivided 100% legal, 
beneficial and registerable interest in and to four prospecting licences (the “PLs”), totaling approximately 800 square kilometres, located in the Handeni District of Tanzania and which 
were owned or controlled by IPP Gold and its affiliates.
In accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, effective September 21, 2010, IPP Gold has now become a major stakeholder in our Company. Pursuant to the terms of the 
Acquisition Agreement, we issued 133,333,333 restricted shares of common stock to IPP Gold in exchange for 100% interest in the four PLs of the Handeni Project, with no further 
payments in shares or cash required.
The Commissioner for Minerals of Tanzania has confirmed the recording in the Central Register and the transfer of 100% of each of the Prospecting License Nos. 6742/2010, 6743/2010, 
6744/2010 and 6779/2010, which comprise the Handeni Project, from IPP Gold to our Company, and that such transfer has been duly recorded on the terms and conditions contained in 
such Prospecting Licenses.
We obtained a Technical Report on the Handeni Property (the “Handeni Report”), dated April 25, 2011, as prepared at our request by Avrom E. Howard, MSc, FGA, PGeol (Ontario), 
Principal Consultant at Nebu Consulting LLC. Mr. Howard is a Qualified Person in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 “Standards for Disclosure of Mineral Projects”
and its Companion Policy (collectively, “NI 43-101”)  and is a Practicing Professional Geologist registered with the Association of Professional Geoscientists of Ontario (registration
number  0380).  The  Handeni  Report  follows  on  the  heels  of  a  detailed  geological  compilation  and  exploration  report  prepared  in  2010  by  Dr.  Reyno  Scheepers,  a  South  African 
professional geologist who has been a director of our Company since 2010 and is our current Chief Executive Officer. Upon independent review by, and to the satisfaction of Mr. Howard, 
much of the content from Dr. Scheepers’s report has been referred to and referenced in the Handeni Report.
20
On August 5, 2011, the Company entered a Mineral Property Acquisition Agreement (the “2011 Acquisition Agreement”) with Handeni Resources Limited (“Handeni Resources”), a 
limited  liability  company  registered  under  the  laws  of  Tanzania. The  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  has  an  existing  ownership  and/or  beneficial  interest(s)  in 
Handeni Resources. Pursuant to the 2011 Acquisition Agreement, the Company had an exclusive option to acquire from Handeni Resources a 100% interest in mineral licenses covering 
an  area  of  approximately  2.67  square  kilometers  to  the  east  of  Magambazi  Hill,  which  is  adjacent  to  the  area  covered  by  the  Company’s  four  existing  prospecting  licenses  (totaling
approximately 800 square kilometers) in the Handeni District.
On November 30, 2011, the Company completed the 2011 Acquisition Agreement and issued 15,000,000 restricted common shares to Handeni Resources as payment. As at November 30, 
2011, the fair market price of the Company’s common stock was $0.11 per share; accordingly, the Company recorded a total fair market value of $1,650,000 as the mineral licenses 
acquisition cost.
To comply with the laws and regulations of the Republic of Tanzania whereby foreign companies may not own primary mining licenses (“PMLs”), on July 19, 2012, the Company:
(1)
(2)
entered into an Addendum agreement to the 2011 Acquisition Agreement whereby Handeni Resources will administer the 32 PMLs until such time as a mining
license (“ML”) on the 32 PMLs (2.67 km2 ) have been allocated; and 
 
during this period Handeni Resources will be conducting exploration and mining activities on the PMLs as directed by the Company.
Much of the information regarding the Handeni District Project as provided below is based on information provided in the Handeni Report.
The author of the Handeni Report visited the Handeni property on February 26, 2011, accompanied by Dr. Scheepers. Given the almost total absence of outcrop across the property area, 
on the one hand, and the abundance of district to regional scale geological data, recent exploration data, intensive artisanal mining activity in the boundary area between the Company’s 
Handeni property and the adjacent Magambazi property belonging to Canaco Resources Inc. and their well-publicized news releases and developments, on the other, the author of the 
Handeni  Report  determined  that  he  was  able  to  complete  a  meaningful  property  visit  within  the  timeframe  of  a  single  day  to  his  technical  satisfaction  sufficient  for  the  purpose  of 
preparing the Handeni Report.
Location and Access
The Handeni property lies  within the  historic Handeni artisanal gold mining district,  located in Tanga  Province,  roughly 175 kilometers northwest of  Tanzania’s largest city, Dar  Es 
Salaam, and 100 kilometers southwest of the more northerly coastal city of Tanga. The road from Dar Es Salaam to Tanga is paved; the secondary road that heads northwest from this road 
to the town of Handeni, a distance of 65 kilometers, is currently being upgraded and paved. The Handeni property is located roughly 35 kilometers south of the town of Handeni. From this 
point, a number of dirt roads head south across various portions of the Handeni property and beyond. Driving time from Dar Es Salaam is approximately five hours, depending on traffic 
and the weather.
Access during the dry season is not difficult and does not even require a 4X4 vehicle. Roads within the licenses are mostly tracks, some of which are not accessible during the rainy 
season. The area experiences two rainy seasons, namely a short wet period during November and December and the main rain season lasting from April to June. Exploration conditions 
during the rainy periods may be difficult, specifically during the April to June period. Fuel is available at a number of points along the north - south portion of the journey and in Handeni 
town itself.
The average elevation in the Company’s license area is 450 meters above sea level. The area is densely vegetated with tall trees and grass over undulating hills of gneiss that comprise the
main topographic feature in the area. Muddy, slow moving rivers and creeks crisscross the valleys and plains; some of the larger streams may experience high flow during intense rainfalls.
The area is scarcely populated with occasional small villages where people are engaged in small scale mixed farming and artisanal gold mining. Handeni town is a community of several 
thousand inhabitants haphazardly spread over a series of small, rounded hills, where basic services and accommodation are available.

Within the property are several, smaller areas that belong to small scale artisanal miners, all of which are indicated in red in the license map presented below. The areas found within PL 
6742/2010 predate the arrival of IPP Gold and remain in the hands of the local artisanal miners to whom Primary Licenses, or what are informally known as “Primary Mining Licenses” or 
PMLs have been issued. The rectangular area in red on PL6743/2010 belonged to Handeni Resources as discussed below. Artisanal gold mining activity remains ongoing in some of these 
areas.

License Map, Handeni Property Prospecting Licenses, showing excluded areas in red
Toward the western edge of PL 6743/2010 are several more PMLs that do not belong to the Company. The area colored in green in the figure below is a unitized block of four PMLs that 
were acquired by Canaco Resources Inc. (“CRI”) from their owners; this is where the most intensive artisanal gold mining activity is currently taking place, with laborers working at a 
variety of mining and milling sites adjacent to and up the hill from a shanty town of huts that is found just north of Magambazi hill. It is the Company’s understanding that CRI has 
reached an agreement with the original owners of these PMLs and the people currently working there which will lead to their ceasing artisanal operations and vacating the site.
Ownership of a single, isolated claim block, depicted in fuchsia below remains uncertain; and which is something that IPP Gold and the Company are attempting to ascertain. Ownership 
of the smaller, rectangular red block that overlies the CRI-Company boundary also remains unknown; and which again is another matter that IPP Gold and the Company are currently 
pursuing. The remaining block of 32 PMLs, shown as a grid of blue lines below, belongs to the Company as described above.

History
General. Mining in Tanzania in the modern era dates back over one hundred years, first under German colonial rule; during the First World War a number of military engagements took
place there. After the war ended control of the area was ceded to the British, under whose colonial authority mining and other activities continued and expanded. Mining focused on gold, 
diamonds and a variety of colored gemstones, notably including the discovery and development of the world’s largest diamondiferous kimberlite pipe (to date) by Canadian geologist John 
Williamson, a deposit that remains in production to this day. Shortly after achieving independence from the British in 1961, Tanzania nationalized most private sector industries, in turn 
resulting in the exodus of foreign investment and private capital and the consequent decline in economic activity in all sectors, including mining. Finally, beginning in the 1990s, in line 
with many other developing countries around the world, the Tanzanian government instituted several reforms to move towards a free market economy, privatize the mining industry and 
encourage both domestic and foreign investment in all economic sectors. In the case of the mining industry, this was supplemented, in 1998, through the passage of a new, more industry-
friendly mining code. This code has been streamlined under the Mining Act of 1998 (revised 2010) (the “Mining Act”) currently controlling exploration, mining and related activities in 
the country.
Tanzania is a significant producer of gold, diamonds and a variety of colored gemstones including tanzanite; the trade name for generally heat treated, bluish-purple zoisite. The Merelani 
Hills, east of Arusha, is the only place o n e a r t h where this gemstone variety of V-rich zoisite is found in commercial quantities. A recently discovered uranium deposit is currently 
under development, as well, in the southeast area of the country. Tanzania is Africa’s third leading gold producer, after Ghana and South Africa, with several major and junior companies
producing and exploring for gold, mostly in northwestern Tanzania, south of Lake Victoria, in an area informally known as the Lake Victoria gold belt.
The Handeni Property. Gold has been known in the Handeni area for many years with some attributing its discovery to the Germans prior to World War One; however, it was the increase 
in gold prices and consequent increase in artisanal gold mining activity in the Handeni area that led to the discovery of larger deposits of placer gold, in turn leading in 2003 to a classic 
gold rush. The discovery and mining of lode deposits followed, soon after, along with the growth of a shanty mining town at the northern base of Magambazi Hill.
In 2005, the Company’s majority shareholder, IPP Gold, entered into negotiations with a group of 34 local artisanal miners that collectively controlled four PMLs on and near Magambazi 
Hill, site of the area’s known lode mineralization, and upon failing in this endeavor acquired a number of PMLs east of Magambazi Hill from other local owners. A portion of a large
(1,200 km2) Prospecting Reconnaissance License (“PLR”) which belonged to Midlands Minerals Tanzania Limited was also acquired by IPP Gold.
Between 2005 and 2010, IPP Gold carried out exploration over its PLR leading to the upgrading of its holdings from one PLR to four PLs of 800 km2, in August 2010. Exploration work 
included airborne magnetic and radiometric surveys, ground magnetic surveys, reconnaissance geological mapping, soil sampling, pitting and trenching. It is these four PLs that were 
acquired by the Company from IPP Gold.
Geological Setting
Regional Geology. The geological framework of Tanzania reflects the geologic history of the African continent as a whole. Its present appearance is a result of a series of events that began 
with the evolution of the Archean shield, followed by its modification through metamorphic reworking and accretion of other continental rocks, in turn covered by continentally derived 
sediments. Pre-rift magmatism followed by active rifting has also left a major mark upon the Tanzanian landscape.
Several regional geological mapping programs have been carried out across the country over the past one hundred plus years, which has led to the recognition of several major litho-
structural provinces from Archean to recent age. The Archean craton covers most of the western two thirds of the country, roughly bounded to the east by the East African Rift. Archean 
rocks host all of the country’s kimberlite pipes and contained lode diamond deposits, and most of its lode gold deposits. The Archean basement terrain is bounded to the east and west by a 
series of Proterozoic mobile belts; this area, particularly that to the east, hosts most of the country’s wide variety of colored gemstone deposits. Some recent research suggests that portions 
of this assumed Proterozoic terrane may actually consist of Archean crust that has undergone a later phase of higher grade metamorphism.
The Phanerozoic is represented by a series of sedimentary units of Paleozoic to Mesozoic age, in turn followed by a pre-rift period of kimberlitic and related, alkalic, mantle-derived 
intrusive and extrusive activity that presaged active rifting. Rocks related to this event intrude up to Upper Mesozoic and Lower Cenozoic sedimentary formations. Next came a period of 
rift-related intrusive and extrusive activity concentrated in the Arusha area – to the northeast and Mbeya area – to the southwest, which is responsible for volcanoes such as Mt. Meru and 
Mt. Kilimanjaro. Finally, a wide variety of recent and largely semi- to un-consolidated wind, water and weathering-derived recent formations are found across the country, a number of 
which host placer gold, diamond and colored gemstone deposits.
Property Geology. The geology of the Handeni area comprises amphibolite to granulite facies metamorphic rocks interpreted to originally have formed a sequence of ultramafic to felsic 
volcanic flows, black shales and quartz-bearing sedimentary rocks. High grade metamorphism has converted these original lithologies to a variety of metamorphic equivalents, including
biotite-hornblende-garnet-pyroxene gneiss, migmatitic augen garnet- hornblende-pyroxene gneiss, quartzo-feldspathic hornblende-biotite-pyroxene gneiss, pyroxene-hornblende-biotite-
garnet granulite and others. The entire assemblage has been folded into a synform with a northwest-southeast axis, complicated by numerous faults, some of which are spatially associated
with gold mineralization.
Recent research by geologists from the University of Western Australia suggests that much of what has previously been considered to be of Proterozic age (Usagaran System) may in fact 
be overprinted Archean crust. This hypothesis has been invoked to help interpret the geology within which gold in this area is found and as the basis for an analogy between this gold 
mineralization and that found in less metamorphosed, bona fide Archean rocks in the Lake Victoria gold district, a few hundred km to the northwest. However, this is a hypothesis, only, 
one that may be used for exploration modeling purposes but one that still requires more work.
24
Mineralization
The Handeni property is at an early stage of exploration. There are no known mineral resources or reserves on the Handeni property, nor are there any known deposits on the property.
Insufficient work has been completed on the Company’s property to be able to comment to any significant extent about the nature of gold mineralization found and that may be found 
therein. However, comments regarding mineralization may be made upon the basis of information released by CRI, the company that owns the immediately adjacent Magambazi gold 
deposit, a deposit that remains the subject of an ongoing drilling program and geological studies and which is considered to be the type occurrence/deposit for the evolving Handeni 
district. The hill within which this deposit is found extends southeast onto the Company’s property.
According  to  the  aforementioned  report  prepared  by  Dr.  Scheepers,  gold  is  found  within  garnet-amphibolite  zones  within  biotite-feldspar  gneiss  at  three  locations  in  the  Company’s 
property, locations where historical lode gold occurrences have been documented. Gold occurs in quartz veins as well as within the garnet amphibolites adjacent to the quartz veins. Proof 
of this association is informally corroborated by the testimony of local, artisanal miners, who apparently recover gold both from quartz veins and gold-bearing gneiss that is not quartz vein 
bearing. Gold in the Company’s property has also been documented in soils and placers, at a variety of locations, as well.
Exploration Activities
Whereas gold was known in the Handeni area prior to the arrival in 2005 of the Company’s predecessor, IPP Gold, there is no history of any formal exploration in the area aside from
limited work at Magambazi Hill itself. IPP Gold’s initial work consisted of soil sampling and a ground magnetic survey over an area of 200 square kilometers covering the area now 
located  within  PL6743/2010  immediately  east  of  Magambazi  Hill.  Over  the  five  years  that  ensued,  this  was  followed  by  a  series  of  exploration  campaigns  involving  a  variety  of 
exploration methods, in turn followed by interpretation and further work in an iterative fashion. A table summarizing the work completed by IPP Gold (much of which was completed 
under the supervision of Dr. Scheepers) may be found below.

The Company
Several  exploration  targets  were  delineated  on  the  basis  of  the  aforementioned  work  either  based  upon  anomalous  gold  soil  geochemical  results  alone,  or  other  features  singly  or  in 
combination, that based upon gold deposit models have been deemed significant. Paramount among these are structural features are folds, shear zones, faults and thrust faults that have 
been interpreted on the basis of the magnetic and radiometric data, particularly where they have been seen to be coincident with anomalous gold in soils or locations of historical artisanal 
mining.  Regardless  of  the  gold  deposit  model  one  favors,  structure  is  of  fundamental  significance  as  a  conduit  for  and  host  to gold  bearing  solutions  and,  in  this  light  therefore,  all 
locations where anomalous gold has been found coincident with interpreted structures must be considered significant, particularly at this early stage of exploration on the Handeni property 
and in the district as a whole.
Conclusions and Recommendations
The author of the Handeni Report indicated that the most important conclusions to be derived at this juncture are:
1.
2.
Based upon CRI’s public disclosure, it appears as if a bona fide gold deposit has been discovered at Magambazi Hill, a deposit where ongoing drilling is finding more 
gold; 
 
The southeast extension of Magambazi Hill and, presumably, gold mineralization found within, continues onto the Company’s PL6743/2010;
25
3. 
 
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
Historical placer and lode artisanal mining was a guide to Magambazi’s potential;
 
There are a number of other locations where intensive placer and artisanal gold mining took place within the Handeni property, notably the Kwandege and Mjembe 
areas; 
 
Processed airborne magnetic and radiometric data have delineated linear features that have been interpreted to represent a variety of structures such as shears, thrust 
faults and cross faults; 
 
Limited soil geochemical surveying, carried out across some of these interpreted northwest-southeast trending structural features, has revealed several locations hosting 
anomalous gold in soils (statistically established to be gold values exceeding 10 parts per billion);
 
G old appears to be further concentrated at the intersection between the northwest-southeast trending structural features and northeast-southwest trending structural 
features, interpreted to represent later cross faults; and 
 
These associations suggest a relationship between structures and gold, in turn providing a basis upon which to select additional areas within the Handeni property for 
more detailed gold exploration.
Exploration conducted 2011/2012.
During our fiscal year ended May 31, 2012, we achieved the following:
a)
b)
c)
d) 
 
e)
A helicopter based TEM electromagnetic and radiometric aerial survey program was completed by FUGRO over the entire Company licence area (800 km2 ) at 200 meter spaced 
flight lines in a north-south direction. Electromagnetic (TEM) as well as radiometric data for K (Potassium), U (Uranium), and Th (Thorium), as well as total count was collected 
simultaneously for the 4740 line kilometres flown. Selected areas were flown at a line spacing of 100 meters.
 
The  interpreted  data  clearly  delineated  subsurface  geological  features  of  importance  to  gold  and  base metal  mineralization  in  this  high  grade  metamorphic  terrain.  The  data
proved to be invaluable in the definition of structurally important sites and target definition.
 
An intensive ground based geophysical program on the Magambazi East as well as the Kwandege target zones was completed. This data (combined with geochemical results)
were used to create drill targets on the two selected areas, the results of which are reported below.
 
A  multi-element  soil  geochemical  program  was  completed  on  the  Kwandege  target  delineating  the  extent  of  the  mineralization  zone  and  assisting  the  interpretation  of  the
geophysical data to locate drill positions. 
 
A large soil sampling program of two targets in PL6743/2010 was initiated and is still continuing.
 
28 diamond core holes (5,347 meters) were drilled on the Magambazi East and related targets (figure below). 20 of these holes (4228 m or 79.1% of the total 5347 meters of
drilling) were drilled on the main geophysical and geochemical anomaly considered to be an extension of the main Magambazi Hill mineralization zone. A single hole (MZD 28;
159 m or 3.0%) was drilled on a potential mineralization zone north of the main Magambazi mineralization trend and one hole (MZD 25; 201 m or 3.8%) was drilled on a
potential mineralization zone south of the main mineralization zone. Both these zones were delineated by ground geophysics and soil geochemistry producing well defined drill
targets. Six holes (MZD 05, MZD 12, MZD 13, MZD 15, MZD 26 and MZD 27 totaling 445 m or 14.2%) were drilled on targets potentially related to the Magambazi Hill
mineralization zones by faulting and / or folding.

The drilling program on the Magambazi East targets outlined the following:
f)
i)
ii)
iii)
A gold enriched mineralization zone extends for a distance of approximately 500 m to the south east of the Magambazi Hill mineralization as defined by CRI. Gold 
mineralization along the zone is related to a folded sequence of garnet amphibolite and consists of free gold closely related to quartz veins as well as gold related to 
sulphides within this zone. The mineralization is structurally complex and is most likely part of a synclinal structure plunging to the north west with higher grade gold 
zones confined to the fold axis of steeply northwest plunging secondary fold structures on the limbs of the syncline. The repetition distances of these structures are 
unpredictable based on the current results and drill spacing and an intensive and directed drilling program will be needed to investigate their economic potential. The 
best intersection achieved on the main zone was 4.2 g/t over 5 meters.
 
A mineralization zone to the north of the main zone (the North eastern Zone) shows gold potential. The strike distance of this zone on the Handeni Gold property is 
approximately 330 m. Three mineralized intersections were obtained. The zone may be interpreted as refolded main zone on the north eastern flank of the syncline or a 
“lower amphibolite zone” at a lower level of the main Magambazi synclinal structure. The most promising intersection on this zone was 3.75 g/t over 1 meter.
 
A  mineralization  zone  with  a  strike  distance  of  approximately  450  m  to  the  south  of  the  main  zone  (the  South  western  Zone)  was  intersected.  The  geological 
interpretation is the same as for the North eastern zone. Four mineralized intersections were obtained in this zone of which 1.31 g/t over 1 meter was the intersection 
obtained. 
 
Evaluation of the economic potential of the three mineralization zones will only be possible with closely spaced directional drilling to follow out the mineralization. We 
will continue its evaluation of the Magambazi East project based on a detailed interpretation of the available drill core and an intensive program of close spaced ground 
geophysics. The project will finally be ranked against 15 other already identified targets (the decision to continue drilling on its Kwandege project has already been 
taken) before a decision on a possible continuation of the drilling program on Magambazi East will be taken. Intercepts were reported as drilling widths due to extreme 
folding of layers. More drilling will be needed to confirm true widths. For the holes reported for this phase of the assay program sampling was conducted along one 
meter continuous intervals of the core.
37 drill holes (4,989 meters in total) have been drilled on the Kwandege mineralized zone, completing the first phase drilling program on this project. The total number of drill
holes on the main Kwandege target for the first phase drilling phase were 33, including a single hole abandoned due to bad drilling ground. 26 of the 32 drill holes on the main
Kwandege target yielded gold assay values of more than 0.5 g/t over a one-meter interval or thicker intersection, whereas four of the remaining holes had anomalous gold values 
of up to 0.49 g/t. Three holes were drilled on a chargeability and radiometric target south of the main Kwandege target and one on a potential south eastern extension of the main
Kwandege target (Figure below).
Kwandege drill hole positions.
Blue dots represent positions of current artisanal workings and the area outlined in purple is an approximately 1km2 sulphide and radioelement 
enriched zone. Hole KW2_10 was drilled on a potential south eastward extension of the main Kwandege mineralized zone.
Of the three drill holes drilled on the chargeability zone (outlined in purple on figure above (KW3_01, KW3_02 and KW3_03) (Fig. 1), all three intersected the zone associated
with gold mineralization in the Handeni area but only KW3_01 yielded anomalous gold values of 0.24 g/t over 1 m intersections. Thus, despite large percentages of pyrite, as
well as some arsenopyrite being present in most of the core intersected on the chargeability anomaly as outlined, general gold values over this anomaly are unexpectedly low. The
potential for gold on the perimeter of the chargeability zone however remains high and further drilling is required.
27
Anomalous gold values were intercepted over large portions of drill core in KW2_10, drilled on a potential south eastern extension of the main Kwandege mineralization zone.
Although no values of economic grade are present in this single drill hole, the garnet amphibolite (the favourable zone for gold mineralization) was intersected. The lower values
are most likely due to an unfavourable sub-surface structural intersection and further drilling is necessary to assess the (new) south eastern extension of the main Kwandege 
target.
The best intersections obtained on the first phase of the Kwandege drilling project (32 holes) were:
i)

An  important  feature  of  the  Kwandege  target  is  the  fact  that  low  level  gold  values  (0.5  g/t  to  1  g/t)  were  encountered  in  numerous  intersections  in  the  drill  holes  and  also
confirmed by the latest assay results. Anomalous gold with some potentially economic intersections have been encountered in an E - W (strike) direction of 1,501 meters (based
on the results of the completed phase 1 drilling program). The open ended nature of the mineralization in an E-W direction was confirmed. 
 
The structural control on the gold mineralization is an important feature of mineralization at Kwandege. Based on the current results, gold is particularly enriched in the upper of
two garnet amphibolite layers separated by a felsic gneiss unit. Within the garnet amphibolite, gold is most likely concentrated in the proximity of fold noses. The package of
garnet amphibolite as well as felsic gneiss units are contained within a SSW towards NNE thrust unit.
 
A confined alluvial mining evaluation program was initiated to investigate the potential to economically mine alluvial gold on the prospecting licenses.

The Company’s Recent Exploration Activities
During the quarter ended August 31, 2012, we:
a)
b)
c)
Collected a total of 5,050 soil samples (including blanks and standards) from targets in PL6743 that are currently being analysed by XRF and prepared for submission to 
assay laboratories. In collaboration with the Tanzanian Geological Survey a soil sampling program is currently being undertaken on Target 6 on PL6779/2010.
 
Received the results of the soil sampling program on Target 5 which to date are highly encouraging with gold in soil values of up to 200 ppb encountered. Au (gold) 
assay results were received for 2,331 samples. The geochemical target coincides with a magnetic and electro-magnetic geophysical anomaly on surface over an area of 
approximately  1.8  km  (N-S)  by  900  m  (E-W).  The  anomalous  gold  zone  apparently  dips  E  -  SE  as  part  of  a  large  fold  structure.  High  Au  values  coincide  with 
topographic highs. The evaluation of this target will be continued by pitting, trenching and ground IP.
 
Are evaluating the “alluvial” gold potential of an area proximal to our Magambazi East target area. The drilling of 3 successful RC holes for water solved the constant 
water shortage problem and is now providing the washing and separation operations with a sustainable 15,000 liters per hour from two of the holes currently being 
utilized. This water also secured a water source for future drilling operations on our licenses. Approximately 32% of a pitting, trenching and separation exercise on the 
area targeted for the evaluation of a potential “alluvial” gold operation is currently completed.
28
Other exploration related activities currently under way on the companies Handeni licenses include:
a) 
b) 
c) 
d)
Identification of potential alluvial mining areas other than those currently know and being evaluated by utilizing remote sensing activities.
A detailed geophysical interpretation of already collected geophysical data.
A petrological, geochemical and mineralogical investigation of the Kwandege drill core to understand the style of gold mineralization at this locality.
XRF (hand held) analyses of soil samples taken to produce an algorithm to relate Au anomalies to soil geochemistry. The aim is to reduce assay cost as well
as to characterize the two main styles of mineralization identified on the HNDI properties.
During the quarter ended November 30, 2012, the Company:
a) 
b) 
c) 
d)
Completed the soil sampling program on Target 6 in collaboration with the Tanzanian Geological Survey. These samples are currently being prepared for gold analyses.
Completed the field work to evaluate the alluvial potential of the area selected in the vicinity of our Magambazi East target. 
Completed the geophysical evaluation of our four (4) prospecting licenses (PL’s).
Completed a detailed structural investigation into structural controls on gold mineralization on our 4 prospecting licenses.
A major focus of the company at this stage is target prioritization and selection of areas on the property to retain. The first draft of recommendations in this regard is to be finalized by the 
Company’s technical committee. The final draft of the document is expected to be handed in by middle March 2013.
Mkuvia Alluvial Gold Project
Our other property of interest is the Mkuvia Alluvial Gold Project. On June 27, 2008 but effective on August 4, 2008 when ratified by our Board of Directors, we entered into a Joint 
Venture Agreement with Mkuvia Maita (“Mr. Maita”), the registered holder of certain PLs over certain areas covering approximately 430 square kilometers located in the Liwale and 
Nachigwea Districts of Tanzania. Pursuant to this agreement we had the right to enter, sample, drill and otherwise explore for minerals on the property underlying the prospecting licenses 
as granted by the Government of Tanzania under the Mining Act, subject to a perpetual net smelter royalty return of 3% payable to Mr. Maita.
Effective on July 14, 2009, our Board of Directors ratified, confirmed and approved our entering into of a new Joint Venture Agreement (the “New Mkuvia Agreement”) with Mr. Maita. 
The New Mkuvia Agreement covers a slightly smaller area than the original agreement, covering an area of approximately 380 square kilometers located in the Liwale and Nachigwea 
Districts of Tanzania, and more particularly described as follows:
(cid:122) Prospecting License No. 5673/2009;
(cid:122) Prospecting License No. 5669/2009;
(cid:122) Prospecting License No. 5664/2009; and
(cid:122) Prospecting License No. 5662/2009.
The New Mkuvia Agreement, which is dated for reference June 5, 2009, supersedes and replaces the prior joint venture agreement as entered into by and between our Company and Mr. 
Maita (the “Prior Agreement”) regarding prior prospecting licenses held by Mr. Maita over substantially the same area, known as the “Mkuvia Project”, which is the focus of our current 
exploration and development efforts.
Pursuant to the terms of the New Mkuvia Agreement we shall continue to have the right to enter, sample, drill and otherwise explore for minerals on the property underlying the new PLs 
as granted by the Government of Tanzania under the Mining Act and any other rights covered by the PLs listed above.
In consideration for the entry into of the New Mkuvia Agreement, we were required to pay Mr. Maita US$40,000 upon signing of the New Mkuvia Agreement. In addition, and upon 
commencement of any production on the property underlying the prospecting licenses, Mr. Maita is still entitled to receive a perpetual net smelter royalty return of 3% from any product 
realized from the property underlying the PLs under the New Mkuvia Agreement. By entering into the New Mkuvia Agreement, we are no longer required to pay Mr. Maita the balance of 
approximately  US$460,000  in  aggregate  yearly  cash  payments  previously  due  under  the  Prior  Agreement  in  consideration,  in  part,  of  our  Company  reducing  the  current  unexplored 
property area underlying the prospecting licenses under the New Mkuvia Agreement by approximately 50 square kilometers.
The  Company  is  aware  that  the  four  PLs  expired  during  May  and  June  of  2012.  The  Company  is  also  informed  that  renewal  applications  were  submitted  (50%  of  each  of  the  four 
properties) by the owner, Mr. Maita, as renewal licenses, and that applications for the remaining 50% of each of the four licenses were submitted. If there are other applicants for the 
remaining 50% of each of the four PLs, the Company understands that there will be a tender process for these PLs. At this time the Company is considering its interest in these PLs going 
forward but no final determination has been made as of yet.
29
The property has several overlying primary mining licenses (again PMLs) that have mineral rights that lie within the boundaries of the Mkuvia property. Generally, PMLs represent 
limited mining rights which allow the small scale exploration of minerals by local miners and must predate the establishment of a prospecting license. PMLs are retained exclusively for 
Tanzanian citizens. The maximum size of the demarcated area for a PML for all minerals other than building materials is 10 hectares. The PML is granted for a period of five years, 
renewable once upon request. When a PML expires, the mineral rights succeed to the underlying PL and cannot be renewed or re-staked thereafter, so long as the PL remains valid. 
Specifically, the PMLs on the Mkuvia property consist of approximately 115 licenses owned by Mr. Maita, and have been provided for in the New Mkuvia Agreement. Upon a successful 
mining permit application and receipt, the PMLs will be collapsed and superseded by the PL rights.
We obtained a Technical and Recourse Report on the Mkuvia Alluvial Gold Project, dated July 24, 2009, as prepared by Laurence Stephenson, P. Eng., and Ross McMaster, MAusIMM. 
This report was prepared in accordance with NI 43-101. Much of the information regarding the Mkuvia Alluvial Gold Project as provided below is based on information provided in that 
NI 43-technical report.
Effective November 7, 2009, we entered into a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Ruby Creek Resources, Inc. (“Ruby Creek”), pursuant to which Ruby Creek has the 
right to purchase a 70 percent interest in 125 square kilometres of our 380 square kilometre Mkuvia Alluvial Gold Project upon payment of $3,000,000 over a three-year period. The 
schedule by which Ruby Creek is to pay such $3,000,000 to our Company is as follows:
(cid:122) $100,000 within five business days of signing of the Purchase Agreement (received);  
(cid:122) $150,000 within 15 business days of signing of the Purchase Agreement (received);  
(cid:122) $100,000 upon satisfactory completion of Ruby Creek’s due diligence (received);  
(cid:122) $400,000 upon closing under the Purchase Agreement and receipt of the first mining license;  
(cid:122) $750,000 within 12 months of closing;  
(cid:122) $750,000 within 24 months of closing and  
(cid:122) $750,000 within 36 months of closing (this final payment may be made, in Ruby Creek’s discretion, in cash or shares of Ruby Creek).
In a further purchase agreement between our Company and Ruby Creek dated for reference May 19, 2010 and fully executed on June 16, 2010 (the “Further Purchase Agreement”), Ruby 
Creek agreed to purchase 70% of the remaining 255 sq km of the Mkuvia Alluvial Gold Project in accordance with the terms of such Further Purchase Agreement. Under the terms of the 
Further Purchase Agreement, Ruby Creek will earn a 70 percent interest in the remaining 255 square kilometres of our 380 square kilometre Mkuvia Alluvial Gold Project by making 
payments totaling $6,000,000 to us. The schedule by which Ruby Creek is to pay such $6,000,000 to us is as follows:
(cid:122) $200,000 due within seven days of execution of the Further Purchase Agreement (received);  
(cid:122) $150,000 (received) plus the issuance of 4 million restricted shares of common stock of Ruby Creek, with an agreed upon value of $0.80 per share for a stated valuation of $3.2 
million, within 30 days of the receipt of Certificates of Acknowledgement for all underlying and related Agreements from the Commissioner for Minerals in Tanzania as required 
by the Mining Act of Tanzania (Certificates of Acknowledgement received August 12, 2010, and shares issued on December 16, 2010);
(cid:122) $450,000 on June 1, 2011 (unpaid);  
(cid:122) $1,000,000 on June 1, 2012 (unpaid); and  
(cid:122) $1,000,000 on June 1, 2013 (which may be satisfied by the issuance of stock by Ruby Creek).
Thus, the combined payments under the November 2009 and the June 2010 Purchase Agreement and Further Purchase Agreement provide for a total commitment of $9,000,000 payable 
to our Company by Ruby Creek to purchase a 70% interest in the entire 380 square kilometre Mkuvia Alluvial Gold Project.
The ownership structure of the interest in the Mkuvia Alluvial Gold Project shall be a 70% interest for Ruby Creek, a 25% interest for our Company and a 5% interest for Mr. Mkuvia 
Maita, the original owner of the underlying PLs. In addition, Mr. Maita retains a 3% net smelter royalty. However, the Further Purchase Agreement also provides that Ruby Creek may 
increase its ownership position from a 70% interest to 75%, reducing our position to 20%, by giving notice to us and paying $1,000,000 to us by June 1, 2011 (unpaid).
As indicated in “PART II – OTHER INFORMATION, Item 1. – Legal Proceedings” below, on February 8, 2012, Ruby Creek filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Supreme Court,
State of New York, in which Ruby Creek alleges that the Company participated in a fraudulent transfer of the mineral property interests that Ruby Creek had the right to purchase pursuant 
to the above-referenced Purchase Agreement and Further Purchase Agreement with the Company. The Company is of the view that such allegations are without merit and intends to 
vigorously contest the action. On February 23, 2012, the Company filed a lawsuit against Ruby Creek in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, seeking relief for Ruby Creek’s breach of 
its payment obligations under the above-referenced Purchase Agreement and Further Purchase Agreement and seeking an order that Ruby Creek remove the U.S. restrictive legend from
Ruby Creek shares issued to the Company under the agreements. To date, Ruby Creek is in default with respect to $1.45 million in scheduled payments due to the Company under the 
Purchase Agreement and Further Purchase Agreement.
We have not received any update from Ruby Creek on its exploration activities conducted on the Mkuvia properties during the financial year ended May 31, 2012 to date. The Company is 
hopeful that it will be able to receive such exploration data in order to assist it in determining whether to make an application for the remaining portion of the PLs through what the 
Company is informed is a tender process to come.
30
Compliance with Government Regulation
We are subject to local laws and regulation governing the exploration, development, mining, production, importing and exporting of minerals; taxes; labor standards; occupational health; 
waste  disposal;  protection  of  the  environment;  mine  safety;  toxic  substances;  and  other  matters.  We  require  licenses  and  permits  to  conduct  exploration  and  mining  operations. 
Amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities of mining companies or more stringent implementation thereof could have a material adverse impact on 
our Company. Applicable laws and regulations will require us to make certain capital and operating expenditures to initiate new operations. Under certain circumstances, we may be 
required to close an operation once it is started until a particular problem is remedied or to undertake other remedial actions. This would have a material adverse effect on our results and 
financial condition.
Our mineral interests in Tanzania are held under PLs granted pursuant to the Mining Act for an initial period of three years and are renewable in two successive periods of two years only. 
The annual rental fees following the first renewal will be US$150 per square kilometer per year and following the second renewal the rental fee will be US$200 per square kilometer per 
year. There is also an initial one-time “preparation fee” of $200 per license. Upon renewal, we pay a fee of $300 per license. Renewals of our PLs can take many months and even years to 
process by the regulatory authority in Tanzania.
All PLs in Tanzania require the holder to employ and train local residents, typically amounting to $5,000 per year, and make exploration expenditures, as set out in the Mining Act. At 
each renewal, at least 50% of our licensed area must be relinquished. If we wish to keep the relinquished one-half portion, we must file a new application for the relinquished portion.
The geographical area covered by a PL may contain one or more previously granted PML. A PML is a mining license granted only to a Tanzanian citizen consisting of an area of not to 
exceed 10 hectares. Once a PL is granted, no additional PMLs can be granted within the geographical area covered by the PL. The PL is subject to the rights of previously granted and 
existing PMLs. The holder of a PL will have to work around the geographical area of the PML unless the PL holder acquires the PML and any rights to the land covered by the PML.
We must hold a mining license to carry on mining activities, which are granted only to the holder of a PL covering a particular area. A mining license is granted for a period of 25 years or 
the life of the mine. It is renewable for a period not exceeding 15 years. Other than the PMLs being held under Handeni Resources, we do not hold any mining licenses, only PLs. An 
application for the 32 PMLs being held under agreement by Handeni Resources to be changed into a mining license (ML) is underway. Prospecting and mining license holders must 
submit regular reports in accordance with mining regulations. Upon commercial production, the government of Tanzania imposes a royalty on the gross value of all production at the rate 
of 3% of all gold produced. The applicable regulatory body in Tanzania is the Ministry of Energy and Minerals.
In July 1999, environmental management and protection regulations under the Mining Act came into force. An environmental impact statement and an environmental management plan 
must accompany special mining license, mining license and gemstone mining license applications for mineral rights. In addition to the establishment of environmental regulations, the 
Tanzanian government has improved management procedures for effective monitoring and enforcement of these regulations by strengthening the institutional capacity, especially in the 
field offices. The government has provided rules for the creation of reclamation funds to reinstate land to alternative uses after mining and it has developed guidelines for mining in 
restricted areas, such as forest reserves, national parks, near sources of water and other designated areas. These regulations have not had any material effect on our operations to date.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry, competing with other mining and exploration companies, and institutional and individual investors, which are actively seeking minerals 
exploration properties throughout the world together with the equipment, labour and materials required to exploit such properties. Many of our competitors have financial resources, staff 
and facilities substantially greater than ours. The principal area of competition is encountered in the financial ability to cost effectively acquire prime minerals exploration prospects and 
then exploit such prospects. Competition for the acquisition of minerals exploration properties is intense, with many properties available in a competitive bidding process in which we may 
lack technological information or expertise available to other bidders. Therefore, we may not be successful in acquiring, exploring and developing profitable properties in the face of this 
competition. No assurance can be given that a sufficient number of suitable minerals exploration properties will be available for acquisition, exploration and development.
Employees
Other than our officers and directors, we had approximately 16 full-time equivalent employees and consultants as of November 30, 2012, and 14 of which were located in Tanzania. We 
retain independent geologists and consultants on a contract basis to conduct the work programs on our mineral properties in order to carry out our plan of operations.
Research and Development Expenditures
We have not incurred any research or development expenditures since our incorporation.
31
Subsidiaries
The  Company  has  two  subsidiaries,  both  of  which  are  Tanzanian  companies:  (i)  HG  Limited  (formerly  DLM  Tanzania  Limited);  and  (ii)  Douglas  Lake  Tanzania  Limited,  which  is 
inactive.
Patents and Trademarks
We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark.
Plan of Operations
Our plan of operations for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2013 is to focus on the exploration of our mineral properties in Tanzania, particularly on the Handeni property. During this fiscal 
year, we anticipate an expenditure of approximately $2,500,000 for our annual plan of exploration work mainly on ground geophysics, mapping, trenching and sampling ($500,000), 
drilling ($950,000), sundry and contingencies ($500,000) as well as payment of geologists, field personnel and general exploration (US$550,000).
We also estimate approximately $1,500,000 for our annual consulting, general and administration, professional and other operating expenses during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2013.
During the six months ended November 30, 2012, we spent $407,000 cash in exploration and approximately $696,000 in other operating expenses.
At November 30, 2012, we had cash of $297,000 and working capital of $933,000. Our actual expenditures may exceed our estimations. As such, we estimated as of November 30, 2012 
that we will need a minimum of $1.96 million in additional funds to cover our planned operations through to our fiscal year ending May 31, 2013, either through the sale of capital stock or 
from borrowing.
During the six months ended November 30, 2012, we have received subscription funds in the amount of $500,000 pursuant to proposed private placements related to the Company’s 
Tanzanian and East African fund raising. On December 7, 2012, the Company entered into a facility agreement with IPP Ltd., a private company controlled by the chairman of Handeni 
Gold Inc. The facility agreement ensures that the Company will have sufficient funding for its key exploration activities up to June 2013. The funding will be in the form of an interest free 
unsecured loan to the Company of up to $720,000 by way of monthly drawdowns of a maximum amount of US$100,000 per calendar month from December 2012 up to and including 
June 2013.
We anticipate that we will not generate any revenue during this fiscal year. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain additional financing in order to pursue our plan of operations. We 
believe that external debt financing will not be an alternative for funding additional phases of exploration as we do not have tangible assets to secure any debt financing. We anticipate that 
additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient 
funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our acquisition and exploration program going forward. In the absence of such financing, we will not be able to continue acquisition 
and exploration of mineral claims and our business plan will fail. Even if we are successful in obtaining equity financing to fund our acquisition and exploration program, there is no 
assurance that we will obtain the funding necessary to pursue any advanced exploration of any mineral claims. If we do not continue to obtain additional financing, we will be forced to 
abandon our mineral claims and our plan of operations.
Results of Operations
We have had no operating revenues since our inception (January 5, 2004) to November 30, 2012. We anticipate that we will not generate any revenues for so long as we are an exploration 
stage company.

Three Months Ended November 30, 2012 Compared to Three Months Ended November 30, 2011
Our expenses for the three months ended November 30, 2012 decreased by $3,082,000 to $699,000 from $3,781,000 for the three months ended November 30, 2011, as follows:
(cid:122) Our consulting, general and administrative fees decreased approximately by $333,000 to $415,000 during the three months ended November 30, 2012 (2011 - $748,000), primarily 
due to decreases in stock-based compensation and cash expenditures. Included in consulting, general and administrative fees was $183,074 of the fair value of the stock-based 
compensation during the three months ended November 30, 2012 (2011 - $421,947). Our cash expenditures in consulting, general and administrative fees decreased approximately 
by $94,000 during the three months ended November 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to cost management;
(cid:122) Our depreciation fees increased by $17,000 to $51,000 during the three months ended November 30, 2012 (2011 - $34,000) mainly due to our increased expenditures on camp and
equipment;
(cid:122) Our exploration expenses decreased by $2,404,000 to $175,000 during the three months ended November 30, 2012 (2011 - $2,580,000) due to our decreased exploration activities
during the period;
(cid:122) Our professional fees decreased by $235,000 to $30,000 during the three months ended November 30, 2012 (2011 - $265,000) primarily due to decreased legal and accounting
service fees as a result of more work performed in-house by management and significant changes in the management during 2011.
(cid:122) Our travel and investor relations expenses decreased by $102,000 to $13,000 during the three months ended November 30, 2012 (2011 - $115,000) primarily due to less travel
expenses and cost management.
Six Months Ended November 30, 2012 Compared to Six Months Ended November 30, 2011
33
Our expenses for the six months ended November 30, 2012 decreased by $3,707,000 to $1,688,000 from $5,395,000 for the six months ended November 30, 2011, as follows:
(cid:122) Our consulting, general and administrative fees decreased approximately by $308,000 to $956,000 during the six months ended November 30, 2012 (2011 - $1,264,000), primarily 
due to decreases in stock-based compensation and cash expenditures. Included in consulting, general and administrative fees was $488,982 of the fair value of the stock-based 
compensation during the six months ended November 30, 2012 (2011 - $599,704). Our cash expenditures in consulting, general and administrative fees decreased approximately
by $197,000 during the six months ended November 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to cost management;
(cid:122) Our depreciation fees increased by $33,000 to $103,000 during the six months ended November 30, 2012 (2011 - $70,000) mainly due to our increased expenditures on camp and
equipment;
(cid:122) Our exploration expenses decreased by $2,894,000 to $407,000 during the six months ended November 30, 2012 (2011 - $3,301,000) due to our decreased exploration activities
during the period;
(cid:122) Our professional fees decreased by $385,000 to $112,000 during the six months ended November 30, 2012 (2011 - $497,000) primarily due to decreased legal and accounting
service fees as a result of more work performed in-house by management and significant changes in the management during 2011.
(cid:122) Our travel and investor relations expenses decreased by $125,000 to $66,000 during the six months ended November 30, 2012 (2011 - $191,000) primarily due to less travel
expenses and cost management.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company has been reviewing its budgets for its current business needs and its further exploration. We estimate that our total expenditures for our fiscal year ending May 31, 2013 will 
be approximately $4 million, as outlined above under the heading “Plan of Operations”. During the six months ended November 30, 2012, we spent $407,000 cash in exploration and 
approximately $696,000 in other operating expenses. At November 30, 2012, we had cash of $297,000 and working capital of $933,000. As such, we estimated as of November 30, 2012 
that  we  need  a  minimum  of  $1.96  million  in  additional  funds  to  fund  our  planned  operations  through  May  31,  2013.  Although  we  have  entered  into  a  $720,000  facility  agreement 
subsequent to November 30, 2012, as described in the following paragraph, we will need a minimum of $1.34 million in additional funds to fund our planned operations through May 31, 
2013, either through the sale of capital stock or from borrowing.
During the six months ended November 30, 2012, we have received subscription funds in the amount of $500,000 pursuant to proposed private placements related to the Company’s 
Tanzanian and East African fund raising. On December 7, 2012, the Company entered into a facility agreement with IPP Ltd., a private company controlled by the chairman of Handeni 
Gold Inc. The facility agreement ensures that the Company will have sufficient funding for its key exploration activities up to June 2013. The funding will be in the form of an interest free 
unsecured loan to the Company of up to $720,000 by way of monthly drawdowns of a maximum amount of US$100,000 per calendar month from December 2012 up to and including 
June 2013. As of the date of this report, the Company received a total of $245,683 from IPP Ltd.
We have not generated revenues since the date of inception on January 5, 2004, and our cash has been generated primarily from the sale of our securities. During our fiscal year ending 
May 31, 2013, we anticipate that we will not generate any revenue. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain additional financing in order to pursue our plan of operations through the 
end of our fiscal year ending May 31, 2013. We anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. We cannot provide investors 
with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our acquisition and exploration program going forward. In the absence of 
such financing, we will not be able to continue acquisition and exploration of mineral claims and our business plan will fail. Even if we are successful in obtaining equity financing to fund 
our acquisition and exploration program, there is no assurance that we will obtain the funding necessary to pursue any advanced exploration of any mineral claims. If we do not continue to 
obtain additional funding, we will be forced to abandon our mineral claims and our plan of operations.
Net Cash Used in Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $1,103,000 during the six months ended November 30, 2012, as compared to $2,019,000 during the same period ended November 30, 2011. The 
lower cash expenditure during the six months ended November 30, 2012 was mainly due to the Company lower exploration and operating expenses during the period. Net cash used in 
operating activities from our inception on January 5, 2004 to November 30, 2012 was $18,552,000.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in the purchase of equipment was $9,000 and cash received from disposal of equipment was $22,000 during the six months ended November 30, 2012. During the six 
months ended November 30, 2011, net cash used in the purchase of equipment was $144,000 for exploration activities in Tanzania. Net cash used in investing activities from our inception 
on January 5, 2004 to November 30, 2012 was $864,000.
34
Net Cash from Financing Activities
During the six months ended November 30, 2012, we received $500,000 net cash from financing activities (receipt of stock subscriptions), as compared to $14,000 during the same period 
ended November 30, 2011. We have funded our business to date primarily from sales of our common stock. From our inception on January 5, 2004 to November 30, 2012, net cash 
provided by financing activities was $19,713,000.
There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing. If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to 
continue our plan of operations, then we will not be able to continue our exploration of the property underlying our mineral claim interest and our venture will fail.
Going Concern
We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive exploration activities. For these reasons our auditors stated in their report 
on our audited financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2012 that they have substantial doubt we will be able to continue as a going concern.
Future Financings
We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our 
existing  shareholders.  There  is  no  assurance  that  we  will  achieve  any  additional  sales  of  our  equity  securities  or  arrange  for debt  or  other financing  to  fund  our  planned  exploration 
activities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.
Related Party Transactions
The details of related party transactions are disclosed in footnote 8 of our company’s interim unaudited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2012 
(Item 1, above).
Segment Disclosures
The Company operates in one reportable segment, located in Tanzania Africa, being the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. The details of segment disclosures are disclosed 
in footnote 16 of our company’s interim unaudited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2012 (Item 1, above).
Inflation
We do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

On December 7, 2012, the Company entered into a facility agreement with IPP Ltd., a private company controlled by the chairman of Handeni Gold Inc. The facility agreement
ensures that the Company will have sufficient funding for its key exploration activities up to June 2013. The funding will be in the form of an interest free unsecured loan of up to
$720,000 to the Company by way of monthly drawdowns of a maximum amount of US$100,000 per calendar month from December 2012 up to and including June 2013. The
total amount drawn down by the Company is due to be repaid on or before December 31, 2013.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our  financial  statements  and  accompanying  notes  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  United  States  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  applied  on  a  consistent  basis.  The 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting periods.
35
We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. In general, management’s estimates are based on historical experience, on
information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates made by management.
We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Basis of Presentation
The Company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and are expressed in
U.S. dollars. The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries described as follows. In June 2011, the Company incorporated in 
Tanzania a new wholly-owned subsidiary, DLM Tanzania Limited (now known as HG Limited), which undertakes mineral property exploration activities in Tanzania. The Company also
has a wholly-owned non-operating Tanzanian subsidiary (Douglas Lake Tanzania Limited).
All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The Company’s fiscal year-end is May 31.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. The 
Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability and useful life of long-lived assets, mineral prospecting licenses, stock-based compensation, deferred 
income tax asset valuation allowances and contingent liabilities. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it 
believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and 
expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent 
there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share
The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) on 
the  face  of  the  income  statement.  Basic  EPS  is  computed  by  dividing  net  income  (loss)  available  to  common  shareholders  (numerator)  by  the  weighted  average  number  of  shares 
outstanding  (denominator)  during  the  period.  Diluted  EPS  gives  effect  to  all  dilutive  potential  common  shares  outstanding  during  the  period  using  the  treasury  stock  method  and 
convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be 
purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
ASC 220, Comprehensive Income establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements. As at November 30, 2012, the 
Company’s components of other comprehensive income (loss) and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are an unrealized fair value gain (loss) on available for sale marketable
securities.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value and they comprise cash on hand, deposits held with banks and other highly liquid investments. Highly liquid investments are readily 
convertible to cash and generally have maturities of three months or less from the time acquired. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions 
which the Company believes limits credit risk.
Marketable Securities
The Company reports investments in marketable equity securities at fair value based on quoted market prices. All investment securities are designated as available for sale with unrealized 
gains and losses included in stockholders’ equity. Unrealized losses that are other than temporary are recognized in earnings. Realized gains and losses are accounted for on the specific 
identification method.
The Company periodically reviews these investments for other-than-temporary declines in fair value based on the specific identification method and writes down investments to their fair 
value when an other-than- temporary decline has occurred. When determining whether a decline is other-than-temporary, the Company examines (i) the length of time and the extent to 
which the fair value of an investment has been lower than its carrying value: (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, including any specific events that may 
influence  the  operations  of  the  investee  such  as  changes  in  technology  that  may  impair  the  earnings  potential  of  the investee: and  (iii)  the Company’s  intent  and  ability  to  retain  its 
investment in the investee for a sufficient period of time to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. The Company generally believes that an other-than-temporary decline has 
occurred when the fair value of the investment is below the carrying value for one year, absent of evidence to the contrary.

Mineral Property Costs
The Company has been in the exploration stage since its inception on January 5, 2004 and has not yet realized any revenues from its planned operations. It is primarily engaged in the 
acquisition and exploration of mining properties. Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred. Mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized. The Company 
assesses  the  carrying  costs  for  impairment  under  ASC  360,  Property,  Plant,  and  Equipment at  each  fiscal  quarter  end.  When  it  has  been  determined  that  a  mineral  property  can  be 
economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs then incurred to develop such property, are capitalized. Such costs will be amortized using the 
units-of-production  method  over  the  estimated  life  of  the  probable  reserve.  If  mineral  properties  are  subsequently  abandoned  or  impaired,  any  capitalized  costs  will  be  charged  to 
operations.
Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with ASC 360, Property Plant and Equipment the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant 
adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; 
current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset 
will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain 
instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with the provisions of ASC 440 Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations which requires the Company to 
record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result 
from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. The Company did not have any assets retirement obligations as of November 30, 2012 and May 31, 2012.
Financial Instruments
ASC 825, Financial Instruments requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and the fair value of financial instruments, which include cash and cash equivalents, restricted 
cash equivalent, restricted marketable securities, and accounts payable were estimated to approximate their carrying values due to the immediate or short-term maturities of these financial 
instruments.
The Company’s operations are in Canada and Africa, which results in exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency rates. The financial risk is the risk to the Company’s 
operations that arise from fluctuations in foreign exchange  rates  and  the degree of volatility of these rates. Currently,  the Company  does not use  derivative  instruments  to reduce its 
exposure to foreign currency risk.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss 
and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional and reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to United States dollars 
in accordance with ASC 740, Foreign Currency Translation Matters, using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are translated at rates of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Average rates are used to translate revenues and expenses.
37
Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income. The Company has not, to the 
date of these financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
To the extent that the Company incurs transactions that are not denominated in its functional currency, they are undertaken in Canadian dollars and Tanzanian shillings. The Company has 
not, to the date of these financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.
Stock-based Compensation
The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Based Compensation and ASC 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees, 
which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including stock 
options.
ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing 
model as its method of determining fair value. This model is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables. These subjective
variables include, but are not limited to the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviours.
The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the statement of operations over the requisite service period.
All transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or 
the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.
Recent Issued Accounting Pronouncements
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and does not believe that there are any 
other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
Reclassification
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years’ financial statements to conform to the current year’s presentation.

Item 4.                     Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
An  evaluation  was  performed  under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  the  Company’s  management,  including  the  Company’s  Chief  Executive  Officer  (“CEO”),  Reyno 
Scheepers, and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), Melinda Hsu, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures 
pursuant to Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon the evaluation, the Company’s CEO and CFO have 
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this 
report (that is, as of November 30, 2012), due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as disclosed in the Company’s annual report for our fiscal year 
ended May 31, 2012, which have not been resolved as of November 30, 2012.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably 
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

On February 8, 2012, Ruby Creek Resources Inc. (“RCR”) filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Supreme Court, State of New York, in which RCR alleges that the Company 
participated  in  a  fraudulent  transfer  of  certain  mineral  property  interests  in  Tanzania  that  RCR  had  the  right  to  purchase  pursuant  to  a  series  of  agreements  with  the  Company.  The 
Company is of the view that such allegations are without merit and has and intends to vigorously contest the action.
On February 23, 2012, the Company filed a lawsuit against RCR in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, seeking relief for RCR’s breach of its payment obligations under the above-
referenced agreements and seeking an order that RCR remove the U.S. restrictive legend from RCR shares issued to the Company under the agreements. To date, RCR is in default with 
respect to over $1.3 million in scheduled payments due to the Company under the agreements.
On October 25, 2012, Craig Alford filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Supreme Court of British Columbia for breach of an alleged employment agreement. Mr. Alford claims the 
agreement was for a term of three years, commencing on March 1, 2011, with a monthly salary of $12,500. Mr. Alford claims that the Company wrongfully terminated the agreement in 
October 2011 and is seeking judgment in the amount of $362,500. The Company is of the view that the allegation is without merit and intends to vigorously contest the action.
