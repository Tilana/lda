Protection of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> General Assembly resolution 53/144 of 9 December 1998, by which the 
Assembly adopted by consensus the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of 
Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms annexed to that resolution, and reiterating the 
importance of the Declaration and its promotion and implementation, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> the continued validity and application of all the provisions of the 
above-mentioned Declaration,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling further</i> all previous resolutions on this subject, in particular General 
Assembly resolution 64/163 of 18 December 2009 and Human Rights Council resolution 
7/8 of 27 March 2008, 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing</i> that the level of respect and support for human rights defenders and their 
work is important to the overall enjoyment of human rights,  
</p>
<p> <i>Gravely concerned</i> by threats, harassment, violence, including gender-based 
violence, and attacks faced by many human rights defenders, reflected, inter alia, in the 
reports of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and other 
human rights mechanisms, 
</p>
<p> <i>Gravely concerned also</i> that, in some instances, national security and counter-
terrorism legislation and other measures have been misused to target human rights 
defenders or have hindered their work and endangered their safety in a manner contrary to 
international law, 
</p>
<p>  
 * The resolutions and decisions of the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of the 
</p>
<p>Council on its thirteenth session (A/HRC/13/56), chap. I. 
</p>

<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the immediate need to put an end to and take concrete steps to prevent 
threats, harassment, violence, including gender-based violence, and attacks by States and 
non-State actors against all those engaged in the promotion and protection of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms for all, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Takes note</i> of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders (A/HRC/13/22) on the security and protection of human rights defenders; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Urges</i> States to promote a safe and enabling environment in which human 
rights defenders can operate free from hindrance and insecurity; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Underscores</i> that the legal framework within which human rights defenders 
work peacefully to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms is that of 
national legislation consistent with the Charter of the United Nations and international 
human rights law; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Urges</i> States to publicly acknowledge the legitimate role of human rights 
defenders and the importance of their work as an essential component of ensuring their 
protection; 
</p>
<p> 5 <i>Encourages </i>States to create and strengthen mechanisms for consultation and 
dialogue with human rights defenders, including through establishing a focal point for 
human rights defenders within the public administration where it does not exist, with the 
aim of, inter alia, identifying specific needs for protection, including those of women 
human rights defenders, and ensuring the participation of human rights defenders in the 
development and implementation of targeted protection measures; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Urges</i> States to take timely and effective action to prevent and protect against 
attacks on and threats to persons engaged in promoting and defending human rights and 
fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Declaration and their relatives, when they are 
attacked or threatened as a result of these activities, including through the possibility of 
developing, in consultation with human rights defenders, an early warning system to 
facilitate broader awareness of imminent risks and to enable effective responses; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Also</i> <i>urges</i> States not to discriminate against human rights defenders on any 
grounds, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or 
social origin, property, birth or other status, and to desist, in this context, from any 
discriminatory measures against them, including intimidation, profiling, confiscation of 
assets, suspension of activities and exclusion from national consultative processes;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Calls upon</i> States to fully support the role of human rights defenders in 
situations of armed conflict and provide them with the protection due to all civilians in such 
situations; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Welcomes</i> the role of national human rights institutions as human rights 
defenders and protectors, and encourages States to strengthen the mandate and capacity of 
national human rights institutions where they exist, as necessary, to enable them to fulfil 
this role effectively and in accordance with the Paris Principles; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Calls upon</i> States to ensure both coordination within national and local levels 
and that those involved in the protection of human rights defenders and their relatives are 
trained in human rights and the protection-related needs of human rights defenders at risk, 
including those promoting the rights of members of marginalized groups; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Also calls upon</i> States to allocate resources for the effective implementation 
of necessary protection measures, including specific training for persons involved in their 
implementation; </p>


<p> 12. <i>Urges</i> States to investigate, in a prompt, effective, independent and 
accountable manner, complaints and allegations regarding threats or human rights 
violations perpetrated against human rights defenders or their relatives and to initiate, when 
appropriate, proceedings against the perpetrators so as to ensure that impunity for such acts 
is eliminated;
