<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In resolution 24/10, the Human Rights Council requested the Expert Mechanism on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to continue its study on access to justice in the promotion 
and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples, with a focus on restorative justice and 
indigenous juridical systems, particularly as they relate to achieving peace and 
reconciliation, including an examination of access to justice related to indigenous women, 
children and youth, and persons with disabilities, and to present it to the Council at its 
twenty-seventh session. 
</p>
<p>2. The Expert Mechanism called for submissions from States, indigenous peoples, non-
State actors, national human rights institutions and other stakeholders to inform the study. 
The submissions are, where permission was granted, publicly available on the Expert 
Mechanism&#8217;s website.1 The study also benefits from contributions made at the United 
Nations Expert Seminar on Restorative Justice, Indigenous Juridical Systems and Access to 
Justice for Indigenous Women, Children and Youth and Persons with Disabilities, held on 
17 and 18 February 2014, organized by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights and the University of Auckland Faculty of Law. The 
Expert Mechanism appreciates the submissions and is informed by them. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Access to justice for indigenous peoples 
</b>3. The Expert Mechanism carried out a study on access to justice in the promotion and 
protection of the rights of indigenous peoples, which was presented to the Human Rights 
Council at its twenty-fourth session (A/HRC/24/50). This study outlined the right to access 
to justice as it applies to indigenous peoples. It examined the international and regional 
legal frameworks, with special emphasis on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples. The study analysed the relationship between access to justice and 
other rights. It proposed key areas for advancing the right to access to justice, including the 
role of national courts and criminal justice systems and the recognition of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; justice systems. It gave special consideration to issues relevant to indigenous 
women, children and youth, and persons with disabilities. The study also examined the 
important role of truth and reconciliation processes to promote access to justice for 
indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>4. One of the conclusions of the previous study was the need for further analysis of 
three specific aspects of access to justice in the promotion and protection of the rights of 
indigenous peoples, which prompted the need for the current study. First, there was an 
identified need to examine the role of indigenous juridical systems, building upon past 
work on international and State recognition of these systems. Second, this study will also 
expand the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s analysis of barriers and remedies in access to justice for 
indigenous women, children and youth, and persons with disabilities. Finally, while the 
previous study addressed the issue of truth and reconciliation, with a focus on transitional 
justice and truth commissions, this study will examine the broader concept of restorative 
justice, linking it to self-determination, peace and reconciliation. 
</p><p>5. As the Expert Mechanism expressed in its 2013 study, &#8220;[a]ccess to justice requires 
the ability to seek and obtain remedies for wrongs through institutions of justice, formal or 
informal, in conformity with human rights standards. It is essential for the protection and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>

<p>promotion of all other human rights&#8221; (<i>ibid.</i>, para. 3). The Expert Mechanism noted that 
access to justice is of particular importance &#8220;given the gravity of the issues facing 
indigenous peoples, including discrimination in criminal justice systems, particularly for 
indigenous women and youth&#8221; (A/HRC/21/52, p. 4). It also underlined the importance of 
examining the issue in a holistic manner, taking into account other human rights challenges 
faced by indigenous peoples, such as structural discrimination, poverty, lack of access to 
health and education, and lack of recognition of lands, territories and resources. In keeping 
with the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s broad understanding of access to justice, in addition to 
addressing formal State systems, the study will also examine the role of indigenous 
juridical systems in facilitating access to justice. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Indigenous juridical systems 
</b>6. Indigenous peoples have always utilized their own framework of juridical systems 
and laws based on their conceptions of justice and as an inherent right.2 Despite the 
historical injustices that indigenous peoples have faced, the values and ideals of their legal 
systems have survived thanks to the resilience of the peoples themselves, and the close 
relationship between indigenous law and the land.3 Over centuries, these laws and norms 
have provided a context sufficient for creating and managing harmonious relationships 
among indigenous peoples and between indigenous peoples and their lands and territories.  
</p>
<p>7. Indigenous juridical systems often comprise both legislative and judicial aspects, 
usually maintained by traditional institutions. They can be exercised at local and 
subregional levels, or within a specific group of communities. Customary laws, which form 
the basis for indigenous juridical systems, are mostly handed down through oral tradition, 
but they may also be legislated through existing traditional institutions.  
</p>
<p>8. The traditional justice systems of indigenous peoples have largely been ignored, 
diminished or denied through colonial laws and policies and subordination to the formal 
justice systems of States. However, law is a complex notion arising in explicit and implicit 
ideas and practices. It is grounded in a people&#8217;s worldview and the lands they inhabit, and 
is inextricably linked to culture and tradition. As such, a narrow view of justice that 
excludes the traditions and customs of indigenous peoples violates the cultural base of all 
legal systems. Without the application and understanding of traditional indigenous 
conceptions of justice, a form of injustice emerges that creates inaccessibility and is based 
on unacceptable assumptions.4 
</p>
<p>9. The Expert Mechanism has therefore recognized the importance of giving due 
regard to the customary laws and traditions of indigenous peoples in its previous work. In 
its study on the right of indigenous peoples to education, the Expert Mechanism highlighted 
the link between traditional education and lands, territories and natural resources, calling 
for the legal recognition and protection of such lands &#8220;with due respect for indigenous 
peoples&#8217; customs, customary law and traditions&#8221; (A/HRC/12/33, Annex, para. 11). In its 
study on the role of languages and culture in the promotion and protection of the rights and 
identity of indigenous peoples, the Expert Mechanism underlined that indigenous justice 
systems and their practice constitute a key element of the right to culture (A/HRC/21/53, 
para. 21) and called for the &#8220;recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; governance structures,

<p>including their laws and dispute resolution processes&#8221; as a form of redress (<i>ibid.</i>, Annex, 
para. 23). 
10. In the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s Comment on the Human Rights Council&#8217;s Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights as related to Indigenous Peoples and the Right to 
Participate in Decision-Making with a Focus on Extractive Industries, it calls on both States 
and business enterprises to utilize conflict resolution procedures that &#8220;take into account the 
customs, traditions, rules and legal systems of Indigenous peoples concerned&#8221;, including 
&#8220;traditional mechanisms like justice circles and restorative justice models where indigenous 
elders and other traditional knowledge keepers may be helpful&#8221; 
(A/HRC/EMRIP/2012/CRP.1, paras. 46 and 55). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Indigenous juridical systems under international law 
</b>11. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples affirms the 
right of indigenous peoples to maintain and strengthen their own juridical systems. Several 
of its articles promote recognition and respect for indigenous juridical systems, in particular 
article 34, which states: &#8220;Indigenous peoples have the right to promote, develop and 
maintain their institutional structures and their distinctive customs, spirituality, traditions, 
procedures, practices and, in the cases where they exist, juridical systems or customs, in 
accordance with international human rights standards.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>12. Article 5 refers to indigenous peoples&#8217; right to maintain and strengthen their distinct 
political, legal, economic, social and cultural institutions, while retaining the right to 
participate fully in the political, economic, social and cultural life of the State. Article 27 
refers to the recognition of indigenous peoples&#8217; laws and land tenure systems in processes 
to adjudicate rights pertaining to lands, territories and resources. Article 40 addresses the 
right to access conflict resolution procedures and effective remedies, including &#8220;due 
consideration to the customs, traditions and legal systems of the indigenous peoples 
concerned and international human rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>13. The Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention (No. 169) of the International 
Labour Organization also elaborates on the right of indigenous peoples to maintain their 
customs and customary laws. Article 8 (2) recognizes the right of indigenous and tribal 
peoples to retain their customs and institutions, adding the proviso &#8220;where these are not 
incompatible with fundamental rights defined by the national legal system and with 
internationally recognised human rights&#8221;. Again with the same proviso, article 9 (1) states 
that &#8220;the methods customarily practised by the peoples concerned for dealing with offences 
committed by their members shall be respected&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Recognition of indigenous juridical systems 
</b>14. The level of recognition afforded to indigenous juridical systems varies widely 
among regions and countries. In Latin America, many national constitutions recognize 
indigenous juridical systems and the jurisdiction of indigenous authorities. There is a 
growing recognition of legal pluralism in the region, through which indigenous legal 
systems co-exist with State-based systems. The Constitutions of Colombia (1991), Peru 
(1993), the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (1999), Ecuador (2008) and the Plurinational 
State of Bolivia (2009) all recognize legal pluralism to varying degrees. In other countries, 
such as Guatemala and Mexico, acceptance of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to exercise their </p>


<p>own forms of dispute resolution in their communities has increased.5 In Guatemala, for 
example, measures are being taken by the Public Ministry and the Supreme Court to 
improve coordination with indigenous juridical systems, and indigenous conflict resolution 
mechanisms are increasingly being respected.6  
</p>
<p>15. In Asia, the situation of indigenous juridical systems varies. In Thailand, for 
example, customary law is not recognized by the Government. Indigenous peoples&#8217; 
customary law is only applied at the village level. In Nepal, indigenous legal systems were 
suppressed by the national legal system, and efforts to revitalize them have been hindered 
by the fact that they are not documented. Communities are in varying situations with 
respect to the implementation and recognition of their legal systems from the State and 
within the communities themselves. In Bangladesh, traditional institutions such as the 
Three Circle Chiefs in the Chittagong Hill Tracts are recognized by the State and have the 
authority to adjudicate disputes, but their powers are limited. In Malaysia, native courts are 
legally recognized in Sabah and Sarawak, but several problems exist, notably unclear 
jurisdictions with Syariah courts and the lack of full recognition of customary laws in the 
Constitution.7  
</p>
<p>16. The continued use and support of customary law systems alongside Western justice 
systems is a characteristic of the legal systems of the Pacific. The level of support of 
customary law systems or <i>kastom </i>is recognized in many constitutions, including those of 
Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu,8 and continues to be a feature of 
everyday life, especially in relation to certain areas of conflict, including traditional lands.9 
Explanations for this level of legal pluralism include the limited influence of Western law 
in some areas along with the continued operation of <i>kastom. </i>Postcolonial independence is a 
feature of many Pacific societies and there are examples of these societies (like the 
highlands of Papua New Guinea) reverting to older, familiar justice systems after 
independence. In Australia and New Zealand, formal systems of law are more dominant, 
although there are many examples in New Zealand of the incorporation of <i>tikanga M</i>&#257;<i>ori</i> 
(M&#257;ori law) into justice processes.10 
17. In general, the laws of the Russian Federation do not refer to indigenous customary 
law as such, but allow for indigenous legal practices to be taken into account when concrete 
cases with indigenous peoples are considered. Nonetheless, the Federal Law regarding the 
general principles of organization of indigenous communities allows the resolution of 
&#8220;local issues&#8221; by applying customary law. However, in practice these provisions are rarely 
used by judges and lawyers due to a lack of specialized courses in law faculties and in the 
occupational training system. Judicial officials often ignore indigenous legislation, leading 
to its incorrect interpretation and enforcement, without considering the cultural specificities 
of indigenous peoples of the north.11

<p>18. Human rights treaty bodies, including the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, have addressed indigenous juridical systems and the role they can play in 
increasing access to justice. In its concluding observations on Guatemala, for example, the 
Committee urged the State party to &#8220;recognize the indigenous legal system and to ensure 
respect for, and recognition of, the traditional systems of justice of indigenous peoples, in 
conformity with international human rights law&#8221; (CERD/C/GTM/CO/12-13, para. 8). 
</p><p>19. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples has also repeatedly 
emphasized the need for recognition of indigenous juridical systems. For example, in the 
report from his country visit to the Republic of the Congo, the Special Rapporteur called 
for the acknowledgement of &#8220;traditional dispute resolution as a legitimate form of 
justice&#8221;.12  
</p>
<p><b> C. The role of indigenous juridical systems in facilitating access to justice 
</b>20. Indigenous juridical systems can play a crucial role in facilitating access to justice 
for indigenous peoples, particularly in contexts where access to the State&#8217;s justice system is 
limited due to, among other factors, distance, language barriers and systematic 
discrimination. Informal justice institutions can provide better access to justice because 
they may reduce the need for travel if they are conducted in the local area, may cost less, 
may be less prone to corruption and discrimination and can be conducted by trusted people 
in a language that everyone understands and in a culturally accessible manner.13 This is 
particularly true in contexts where State justice systems are plagued by inefficiency and 
corruption.  
</p>
<p><b> D. The relationship between indigenous juridical systems 
and international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>21. A central issue in relation to the use and implementation of indigenous justice 
systems is the potential for conflict with international human rights norms. While affirming 
the right of indigenous peoples to promote, develop and maintain their juridical systems or 
customs, article 34 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
states that this must be done &#8220;in accordance with international human rights standards&#8221;. 
Three allegations that are frequently made against indigenous juridical systems are that 
they are gender biased and thus do not provide equal access to justice for women;14 that 
indigenous justice systems often do not follow due process; and that remedies may include 
the use of corporal punishment.15 Although these critiques hold true in some cases, they 
should not be used as an argument to invalidate indigenous juridical systems altogether 
under the pretext of non-compliance with international human rights norms. Furthermore,

<p>indigenous justice systems, despite sharing certain characteristics, are highly diverse and 
context-specific.  
</p>
<p>22. The treaty bodies have highlighted some cases where differences may arise between 
indigenous juridical systems and international human rights law. In its concluding 
observations on Mexico, for example, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women noted its concern about &#8220;cultural practices within the indigenous legal 
systems that are based on gender-stereotyped roles for men and women, such as the &#8216;bride 
price&#8217;, and that perpetuate discrimination against indigenous women and girls&#8221; 
(CEDAW/C/MEX/CO/7-8, para. 34). In the same vein, the Human Rights Committee 
expressed concern at the use of corporal punishment in the community-based justice system 
in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, and requested the State party to &#8220;conduct public 
information campaigns in the native indigenous <i>campesino</i> and other jurisdictions in order 
to raise awareness among the general public of the prohibition and harmful effects of 
corporal punishment&#8221; (CCPR/C/BOL/CO/3, para. 16). 
23. There is a commonly held notion that indigenous juridical systems are static and 
unchanging. Indigenous juridical systems are in fact highly dynamic, and examples show 
that respect for both the legal autonomy of indigenous peoples and international human 
rights law are by no means mutually exclusive. As Sieder and Sierra argue, &#8220;[t]he norms, 
authorities and practices of indigenous justice systems reflect the changing relationships of 
indigenous peoples with dominant society, but they also reflect changes and tensions within 
indigenous communities and movements themselves&#8221;.16 The example of the <i>alcald&#237;a 
ind&#237;gena</i> in Santa Cruz del Quich&#233;, Guatemala is illustrative of how some indigenous 
juridical systems are increasingly incorporating human rights norms and discourse. The 
<i>alcald&#237;a</i>, &#8220;a supracommunal coordination of indigenous communal authorities[,] &#8230; works 
to mediate disputes and reduce the incidence of lynchings of suspected criminals, drawing 
on discourses about Mayan identity but also paradigms of universal human rights and the 
collective rights of indigenous peoples&#8221;.17 Gender discrimination issues are also being 
addressed within the <i>alcald&#237;a,</i> with an increasing number of women being selected as 
<i>alcaldes</i>. This can be seen as a consequence of increasing participation of indigenous 
women in Mayan social movements, &#8220;but also of demands within indigenous communities 
that women&#8217;s dignity and physical integrity be respected&#8221;.18  
</p>
<p>24. Another possible source of tension is the collective nature of the rights of indigenous 
peoples, which could potentially conflict with the needs and rights of individuals within the 
community. The Committee on the Rights of the Child states clearly that &#8220;[i]n the case of 
children, the best interests of the child cannot be neglected or violated in preference for the 
best interests of the group&#8221;.19 
</p>
<p><b> E. Barriers and remedies 
</b></p>
<p>25. The challenges faced by indigenous peoples in freely exercising their juridical rights 
and pursuing juridical development within their societies are diverse and complex. In 
situations where State law recognizes a high degree of autonomy, the major challenges are 
in properly implementing these constitutionally recognized rights. In most cases, there is a 
gap between what international and national frameworks proclaim and the situation on the 
ground, as indigenous juridical systems continue to be subordinated despite legal

<p>recognition. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, for example, the Constitution grants 
ordinary jurisdiction and indigenous native <i>campesino</i> jurisdiction (<i>jurisdicci&#243;n ind&#237;gena 
originaria campesina</i>) equal status. However, a law for interlegal coordination (<i>ley de 
deslinde jurisdiccional</i>), adopted in December 2010 has been criticized by indigenous 
organizations for subordinating indigenous jurisdiction to the ordinary jurisdiction of the 
State, both in terms of where indigenous law can be applied and in what domains.20  
</p>
<p>26. In situations where an interface between State and indigenous institutions has 
developed, even to the degree of legal pluralism, the jurisdiction of indigenous courts may 
not have the same standing as the State system. For example, the native courts of Sabah and 
Sarawak in Malaysia are perceived as inferior, and some of their decisions are not respected 
by the civil and Syariah courts as an exercise of judicial authority. In situations of conflict 
of law, indigenous laws must be fully recognized, especially at the local community level.  
</p>
<p>27. Often, the major challenge that remains is the formal recognition of indigenous 
juridical systems and indigenous peoples&#8217; right to promote, develop and maintain them. 
</p><p>28. Protecting specific groups, including women and children, from discrimination 
within indigenous juridical systems also remains a challenge. Improving the gender balance 
in indigenous peoples&#8217; collective leadership structures and juridical bodies is one strategy 
that has been pursued. Certain communities in Asia have established quota systems for 
women representatives in the elders&#8217; councils and are moving towards transforming the 
male-dominated traditional leadership.21 In Ecuador, women&#8217;s participation and decision-
making in the jurisdictional functions of indigenous authorities is protected by the 
Constitution.22 
</p>
<p>29. In Asia, some communities have had to deal with the challenges that come with the 
codification of their customary laws. With codification, the judicial freedom to interpret 
customary laws and understand indigenous juridical concepts can become curtailed. For 
instance, the Sabah Native Court Rules of 1995 were identified by native chiefs as a 
stumbling block in administering justice, as they were overprescriptive in terms of penalties 
for various offences.  
</p>
<p>30. The danger of indigenous legal systems and institutions being co-opted to serve the 
interests of the State is another considerable challenge. An additional crucial hurdle is the 
financing of indigenous juridical systems. Without sufficient resources, these systems are 
not sustainable and their contribution to ensuring access to justice is compromised.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Access to justice for specific groups 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overarching issues 
</b></p>
<p>31. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples places special 
emphasis on indigenous women, children and youth, and persons with disabilities. Article 
22 (1), for example, reads as follows: &#8220;Particular attention should be paid to the rights and 
special needs of indigenous elders, women, youth, children and persons with disabilities in 
the implementation of this Declaration.&#8221; Article 22 (2) requires States and indigenous

<p>peoples to ensure that indigenous women and children are protected against all forms of 
violence and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>32. Indigenous women, children and youth and persons with disabilities face 
discrimination on multiple grounds, which often puts them in a particularly disadvantaged 
situation. There is a need to pay particular attention to the situation of these specific groups, 
who face cumulative discrimination.23  
</p>
<p>33. Access to justice, in addition to being a right in itself, is also of paramount relevance 
as a means to obtain remedies. Barriers to this right and related remedies exist for 
indigenous women, children and youth and persons with disabilities, who face challenges 
including discrimination in the criminal justice system and overrepresentation among the 
incarcerated population.  
</p>
<p>34. The situation of indigenous women, children and youth, and persons with 
disabilities with regards to access to justice must also be viewed from a holistic perspective, 
as access to justice is inextricably linked to other human rights challenges that indigenous 
peoples face, including poverty, lack of access to health and education and lack of 
recognition of their rights related to lands, territories and resources. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Indigenous women 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Barriers 
</b></p>
<p>35. Numerous barriers exist for indigenous women in accessing justice on an equal basis 
to others. These barriers exist within society (particularly related to high levels of violence, 
discrimination and marginalization), within State criminal justice systems and within 
indigenous juridical systems.  
</p><p>36. Indigenous women are disproportionately at risk of experiencing all forms of 
violence, compounded by multiple forms of discrimination based on race, gender and other 
forms of identity, including disability and sexual orientation. Forms of violence facing 
indigenous women include physical, emotional and sexual violence against women and 
girls (usually perpetrated by men) through interpersonal relationships (domestic or family 
violence), leading to high levels of assault and murder. Sexual violence is a serious issue of 
concern. For example, indigenous women in Papua New Guinea still endure forced 
marriage, exchange of a bride price and polygamy. In North America as well as many other 
regions of the world, indigenous women and girls are at high risk of being murdered or 
being sexually exploited in the sex trade. Trafficking of indigenous women and girls is also 
a serious human rights concern. Violence has a negative impact on the sexual and 
reproductive health and rights of indigenous women, including the right to decide the 
number and spacing of one&#8217;s children, the right to sexual health information, the right to 
access reproductive health products and services and the right to access culturally sensitive 
health services and products, including traditional medicines and trauma-informed healing 
services (E/C.19/2012/6, pp. 5&#8211;6). All of these forms of marginalization play a part in 
limiting indigenous women&#8217;s access to justice.  
37. Remote or rural location is a further barrier to justice experienced by indigenous 
women. Discriminatory practices related to land ownership also impact indigenous 
women&#8217;s access to justice. Some customary laws do not permit women to inherit property 
nor do they allow women to hold leadership positions within indigenous justice institutions.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>23
 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 20, para. 17. </p>


<p>38. Extractive industries operating near or on indigenous territories often increase the 
risk of violence (from workers) and health-related problems of indigenous women, such as 
cancer from contaminated water (E/C.19/2012/6, p. 8). State laws have too often fallen 
short of adequately protecting against corporate human rights violations, or providing 
adequate redress mechanisms (A/HRC/21/55). 
</p><p>39. Indigenous women are overrepresented in national criminal justice systems. In the 
case of New Zealand, for example, while M&#257;ori comprise approximately 15 per cent of the 
population, 58 per cent of women in prison are M&#257;ori.24 This negative trend is present in 
other nations as well, as the proportion of indigenous women in prison increases. The 
examples of disproportionate representation of indigenous women in justice systems often 
result from systemic biased use of discretionary powers, poverty, marginalization and 
violence against indigenous women.25 
</p>
<p>40. Reporting of violence against indigenous women is often lacking, for numerous 
reasons. Where discrimination and bias exist in criminal justice systems, indigenous 
women may not feel comfortable filing complaints. Other times, they may be unaware of 
the available services and protections, particularly those living in rural or remote areas, 
where services may simply not exist. Lack of options to leave abusive relationships may 
lead to indigenous women recanting initial reports of violence, and then being charged with 
making false allegations. Crimes committed against indigenous women that are reported 
are often downplayed or have the penalties reduced, leading to unequal legal protection.26 
Indigenous women often experience marginalization, disbelief and bias in the legal system, 
and may be discriminated against and harassed by police when reporting abuse. 
</p>
<p>41. Traditional justice systems can increase access to justice for indigenous women by 
providing access to justice in a culturally relevant form. Yet in many instances these 
systems are male dominated and discriminatory against women. Traditional justice systems 
need to be strengthened in their ability to protect indigenous women from violence, and 
advocate for fair and equal treatment. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Remedies 
</b></p>
<p>42. Amelioration of social and economic barriers to full, effective and meaningful 
participation of indigenous women in society in general would greatly enhance indigenous 
women&#8217;s ability to access justice. Programmes that disseminate information on available 
programming and law reform can help protect indigenous women.  
</p>
<p>43. Fundamental to ensuring that the rights of indigenous women are represented in 
legal systems is increasing the appointments of indigenous women to both indigenous and 
non-indigenous judicial systems. It is very important to appoint women magistrates for 
cases where women do not want to appear before a male justice; this can be a method of 
improving indigenous women&#8217;s comfort with, and access to, the justice system.27  
</p><p>44. Gender sensitization training of justice and law enforcement officials should be 
pursued, as well as awareness-raising on the cultural specificities of working with 
indigenous women. Criminal justice institutions should also be encouraged to become more 
open and accepting of indigenous women leaders, and their role in decision-making.

<p>45. Indigenous and State legal institutions can benefit from dialogue on rights-based 
notions of equality, centring on women&#8217;s rights and fair and equal treatment. The 
promotion of equality rights of indigenous women within all aspects of State and 
indigenous juridical systems is integral to removing barriers to accessing justice 
(A/HRC/24/50, para. 65).  
</p><p>46. Where they do not exist, increasing development of community systems to provide 
justice will have a positive impact. When improving access to justice for indigenous 
women, their children and families, law reform processes must include holistic and healing- 
based responses. These solutions must address the underlying role of patriarchy caused by 
the imposition of colonial cultures. The participation of indigenous women as leaders 
within traditional indigenous juridical systems should be facilitated through targeted 
efforts.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Indigenous children and youth 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Barriers 
</b></p>
<p>47. Although the available data is limited, several studies show that indigenous children 
and youth are disproportionately represented in criminal justice systems. As the Committee 
on the Rights of the Child has pointed out, disproportionately high rates of incarceration of 
indigenous children &#8220;may be attributed to systematic discrimination from within the justice 
system and/or society&#8221;.28 In Australia, for example, indigenous youth aged 10&#8211;17 are 15 
times more likely than non-indigenous youth to be under community-based supervision and 
almost 25 times as likely to be in detention.29 In New Zealand, M&#257;ori youth appear in court 
at a rate more than double the rate for all young people.30  
</p>
<p>48. Another area in which persistent barriers remain is access to justice for indigenous 
children who have been victims of domestic violence or sexual abuse.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Remedies 
</b></p>
<p>49. The Committee on the Rights of the Child listed a series of barriers and remedies to 
access to justice for indigenous children in its General Comment No. 11 (2009). Paragraph 
23 underlines that States parties must ensure that the application of the principle of non-
discrimination can be &#8220;appropriately monitored and enforced through judicial and 
administrative bodies&#8221;. States are also reminded that effective remedies for non-
discrimination should be &#8220;timely and accessible&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>50. There is a considerable lack of data on indigenous children and youth in the justice 
system, which, in addition to making it difficult to ascertain the magnitude of the 
challenges at hand, also hinders the design and implementation of adequate policies to 
address their overrepresentation in the justice system. The Committee on the Rights of the 
Child highlighted the need for disaggregated data collection pertaining to indigenous 
children in order to identify discrimination,31 indicating that States should make efforts to 
improve disaggregation of data within their juvenile justice systems. Furthermore, the

<p>Committee stressed the need for positive measures to eliminate conditions that lead to 
discrimination, such as access to culturally appropriate juvenile justice services.32  
</p><p>51. Article 40 (3) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires States to 
undertake measures to deal with children alleged as, accused of or recognized as having 
infringed penal law without resorting to judicial proceedings, whenever appropriate. 
Furthermore, the Committee has repeatedly pointed out that &#8220;the arrest, detention or 
imprisonment of a child may be used only as a measure of last resort&#8221;.33 In the case of 
indigenous children, traditional restorative justice systems consistent with international law 
could be used to address cases involving children and youth. The Committee also 
recommends the development of community-based programmes and services that consider 
the needs and cultures of indigenous children, their families and communities.34 In 
Australia, for example, the Indigenous Justice Program funds programmes that focus on 
case management and diversionary activities for children and youth.35 
</p>
<p>52. States should design and implement programmes to train law enforcement and 
judicial personnel, as well as other relevant civil servants, on indigenous children&#8217;s rights, 
special protection measures for indigenous children and youth, and culturally sensitive 
approaches.36 It is also crucial that the law enforcement and judicial workforce is trauma 
informed, and able to deal sensitively with issues including violence and sexual abuse.37 
</p>
<p>53. Another principle that must be respected at all times is that of respect for the views 
of the child. Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child upholds the right of 
children to be heard in judicial and administrative proceedings that affect them. In the case 
of indigenous children, measures to fulfil the right to be heard in judicial or criminal 
proceedings include providing an interpreter free of charge and guaranteeing legal 
assistance in a culturally sensitive manner.38 In Guatemala, the judiciary established the 
Centre for Indigenous Translation and Interpretation with the purpose of facilitating access 
to justice for indigenous peoples, and, in particular, indigenous women and children. The 
centre has legal translators and interpreters, with national coverage and expertise in the 22 
Mayan languages spoken in the country.39  
</p>
<p>54. As highlighted above, it is crucial to adopt a holistic approach when addressing 
access to justice for indigenous children. One area that deserves particular attention is 
education. Quality education can play an enabling role for the exercise of human rights, 
benefitting both individual children and their communities. More specifically, human rights 
education for indigenous children and youth should be pursued as a means to empower 
them as individuals and to achieve the self-determination of their communities.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Indigenous persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Barriers 
</b></p>
<p>55. Indigenous persons with disabilities face numerous and compounded barriers in 
accessing justice. These barriers exist within society (particularly related to violence,

<p>poverty, marginalization and discrimination), within State criminal justice systems and 
within indigenous juridical systems. 
</p><p>56. Indigenous persons with disabilities are disproportionately at risk of experiencing all 
forms of violence and neglect, compounded by discrimination based on race, gender, 
identity and sexual orientation. These forms of violence include physical, emotional and 
sexual violence. Violence against indigenous persons with disabilities often originates 
within their own families.40 Fearing abandonment and often unable to seek alternative care 
or communicate with outside sources, indigenous persons with disabilities can be forced to 
remain in abusive situations,41 or, when successful in obtaining care, are often violently 
abused by the caregivers who are meant to protect them.  
</p>
<p>57. Lack of culturally appropriate and accessible systems of assessment reduces access 
to justice by indigenous persons with disabilities. Also, due in large part to poverty, 
isolation and marginalization, indigenous persons with disabilities are unable to receive 
proper assessment, care or treatment. In many cases, the first contact indigenous persons 
with disabilities, particularly intellectual disabilities, have with disability services is after 
they have come into contact with the criminal justice system.42 
58. Indigenous persons with disabilities also face high rates of incarceration and suffer 
further barriers while incarcerated, including arbitrary or indefinite detention in long-stay 
institutions, particularly where mental health issues or intellectual disabilities are present 
(E/C.19/2013/6, p. 9). Indigenous persons with disabilities face barriers within the justice 
system which prevent them from accessing support and services. For example, in Australia, 
indigenous persons with intellectual disabilities are often detained and assessed as unfit for 
trial. When this occurs, their detentions often become indefinite. The reports received by 
the Expert Mechanism suggest that indigenous persons are often incarcerated in 
inappropriate conditions, such as in maximum security prisons in Australia, which have 
held indigenous persons with intellectual disabilities and have been reported to subject 
them to excessive mechanical and chemical restraint (<i>ibid.</i>). 
59. The limited availability of information in accessible formats creates a substantial 
barrier for indigenous persons with disabilities. Accessing information on rights and other 
legal and educational material is often difficult without the necessary assistive technology 
and materials in alternative formats, including within State, indigenous and United Nations 
institutions. In rural or remote areas, such access is often non-existent.  
</p>
<p>60. Some indigenous languages do not have concepts or words for disability. Stories of 
indigenous persons with disabilities are often covered up and hidden by indigenous 
communities.43 These realities are a direct result of stigmatization of persons with 
disabilities, often based on the imposition of Western models of development, where 
communities have failed to recognize and accept indigenous persons with disabilities. Lack 
of support for families of children with disabilities too often leads to separation of children 
from their families into the child welfare system. This is more likely where historical

<p>trauma of indigenous peoples has occurred, such as through the imposition of residential 
school systems (E/C.19/2013/6, pp. 6 and 11&#8211;12).  
</p><p>61. The sexual health and reproductive rights of indigenous persons with disabilities, 
particularly women, are frequently violated through sexual violence, forced contraception 
and sexual and reproductive stigma.44 This can be compounded for indigenous persons with 
disabilities who are also LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) persons, suffering 
discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and thus experiencing 
compounded discrimination and isolation.45  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Remedies 
</b></p>
<p>62. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples specifically 
provides that the rights and special needs of indigenous persons with disabilities should be 
promoted through measures aimed at improving their economic and social conditions and 
the implementation of the Declaration, including justice-related articles (articles 21 and 22, 
respectively). The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provides a general 
framework for promoting the rights of persons with disabilities, including accommodations 
to ensure non-discrimination and equality in relation to access to justice (article 13 (1)) and 
training for justice administrators (article 13 (2)). Preambular paragraph (p) expresses a 
concern regarding indigenous persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>63. Education on a number of levels would help increase access to justice for indigenous 
persons with disabilities &#8211; including education on disabilities for the general public and 
those involved in the administration of criminal justice, as well as education on human 
rights for persons with disabilities, the general public and those involved in the criminal 
justice system.46  
</p><p>64. If greater support were available to families of persons with disabilities &#8211; who are 
often the primary caregivers &#8211; this would assist in reducing intrafamily violence. Often, 
family members are untrained and lack the capacity, support and funding necessary to fulfil 
the role of caregiver.47  
</p>
<p>65. Increased access to legal counsel could lead to improvements, for example, where 
appropriate free legal aid is needed, but not offered, or where available counsel is not 
appropriately trained to address the legal and other needs of indigenous clients with 
disabilities. Moreover, indigenous persons with disabilities may face transportation-related 
barriers to obtaining legal or related services due to a lack of accessible transportation.  
</p>
<p>66. Involving persons with disabilities by providing them a role in criminal justice 
systems would empower and protect them to a greater degree. Particular measures should 
be taken to expand judicial support and protection of indigenous persons with disabilities, 
to decrease their vulnerability.

<p><b> V. Restorative justice 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Towards a definition of restorative justice 
</b>67. The continued development and application of restorative justice processes means 
that it is impossible to give a single comprehensive definition of the term. Processes that 
are identified as restorative may differ in important ways such as the necessity or 
desirability of retribution and punishment, the extent to which affected parties should 
participate and interact, and the degree of focus on victims. Despite these differences, 
several features are commonly associated with restorative justice processes. These include 
the provision of an opportunity to share experiences, a focus on restoring relationships, a 
requirement of an apology and/or reparation, active participation by the parties in 
negotiating a just resolution and an emphasis on creating a dialogue between the parties.48 
68. A feature of restorative justice processes is that they may be applied in a broad range 
of contexts. Therefore, in determining the scope and nature of restorative justice, it is useful 
to consider the various uses of these processes and to compare these with others arising 
from different traditions, such as indigenous legal systems and customary law. Restorative 
justice processes can address a wide range of issues, from matters affecting entire peoples 
and communities (such as colonization and forced assimilation; for example, the Indian 
Residential School systems in North America) to disputes between individuals at the 
community level. 
</p>
<p>69. Some restorative justice processes are usually associated with particular types of 
use. For example, sentencing circles are commonly used in the criminal sphere and truth 
commissions are often used in post-conflict societies.49 The distinction between practices 
and the contexts in which they are used is not always clear-cut. For example, in a criminal 
context, there is a focus on using restorative justice in relation to the victim, offender and 
those affected by the crime. However, the use of these processes may also facilitate peace 
and reconciliation within broader society by reducing rates of recidivism,50 increasing 
community autonomy and fostering understanding between the parties.51 
</p>
<p>70. Another factor in considering restorative justice processes is their role in facilitating 
access to justice in relation to large-scale issues, such as gross violations of human rights 
and past injustices towards indigenous peoples by a State. When used in this way, 
restorative justice processes again demonstrate that this type of use is not completely 
distinct from that involving criminal acts of individuals. For example, although a truth 
commission may be designed to address injustice experienced by the wider community, its 
operation will affect how justice is accessed, administered and delivered to individuals. 
Other examples include national land inquiries related to systemic dispossession of

Commission of Malaysia. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The relationship between restorative justice, customary law 
and indigenous juridical systems 
</b>71. The relationship between restorative justice processes and those originating from 
indigenous and customary systems of law helps to define the scope of restorative justice. 
This is particularly relevant because restorative justice processes are often used by or in 
relation to indigenous peoples. There are several facets to this relationship, including the 
level of commonality between indigenous or customary law and restorative justice 
processes, the manner in which restorative processes are introduced (such as whether they 
are imposed on or derived from the community) and the appropriateness of transferring 
restorative justice processes that have been influenced by customary or indigenous law to 
other societies. 
</p>
<p>72. Systems of customary law are used in many parts of the world and frequently exist 
alongside more formal systems of law. They may share characteristics and objectives with 
restorative justice processes, such as an aspiration to achieve reconciliation between the 
parties, negotiate an outcome and involve the community in the delivery of justice. In some 
cases, restorative justice systems may adopt features of indigenous systems and in this way 
form a connection with the community. Despite these similarities, restorative justice 
processes and customary/indigenous law are distinct processes in that they differ in their 
origins. Furthermore, many indigenous peoples, tribes and Nations view their customary 
and indigenous laws as originating from inherent rights. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Restorative justice and self-determination 
</b>73. An important and contentious issue for indigenous peoples and postcolonial nations 
today is that of indigenous peoples&#8217; self-determination and what this may mean in terms of 
juridical systems. The right to self-determination is enshrined in the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which gives a strong normative directive 
to provide for indigenous control and participation in the justice processes by which they 
are affected. As highlighted above, several articles, in particular article 34, affirm that the 
use of indigenous juridical systems is an expression of, or contributes to, self-determination 
(see also articles 3, 4, 11.1 and 33). 
74. The flexible and participatory nature of restorative justice processes, along with 
their inherent similarities to customary law, mean that they may provide a vehicle to 
support the use of indigenous justice systems and hence facilitate indigenous self-
determination. Practices such as mediation are useful tools that can bridge the gap between 
formal legal systems and grass-roots justice work. However, features of some restorative 
justice processes may undermine their ability to support access to justice and self-
determination, including &#8220;top-down&#8221; imposition and the possible politicization of these 
processes. 
</p>
<p>75. Confusion between those practices that are truly indigenous and those that merely 
adopt some features of customary law poses a threat to the facilitation of indigenous self-</p>


<p>determination through restorative justice, as there is an increased risk that processes may be 
co-opted to by States or other actors.52  
</p>
<p><b> D. Restorative justice for peace and reconciliation 
</b>76. Restorative justice for the broader purposes of peace and reconciliation has been 
utilized in multiple contexts, including indigenous-related truth commissions in Australia, 
Canada, Chile, Guatemala, Peru, the Australian Apology and subsequent reconciliation 
initiatives, the Maine Wabanaki-State Child Welfare Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission, the Waitangi Tribunal in New Zealand, and the use of customary law both in 
peaceful and post-conflict indigenous societies.53  
</p>
<p>77. Truth commissions have varying purposes and modes of operation, yet many display 
features that align with or support restorative justice principles. For example, truth 
commissions may make a contribution to restoration by illuminating the truth of what 
occurred, identifying institutions responsible for abuses, recognizing victims and providing 
a forum in which they can share their experiences and tell their stories, as well as making 
recommendations on how to provide remedies and prevent future violations.54 They may 
also allow for, or be influenced by, customary practices. For example, Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu has described the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
(SATRC) as having been influenced by <i>ubuntu </i>(traditional African concepts of healing and 
well-being).55 Further, truth commissions may facilitate access to justice in situations where 
this would otherwise be very difficult to achieve, such as in the context of past treatment of 
indigenous peoples.56  
</p>
<p>78. Although it was not established to align with the principles of restorative justice, the 
operation of the SATRC has been described as &#8220;restorative&#8221;.57 For example, through the 
use of both an Amnesty Committee (for perpetrators) and a Human Rights Committee (for 
victims), the process was able to include both the perpetrators and victims of injustice in 
the process.58 However, this feature has also been criticized as it maintained separation 
between the parties.59 The SATRC has also been criticized for its limited ability to make 
reparations, a power that was reserved for the Government.60  
</p>
<p>79. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, established in 2008, is aimed 
at achieving peace and reconciliation by addressing the legacy of the residential school 
system imposed on indigenous children in Canada. It has a mandate to hear the truth, 
promote healing and facilitate reconciliation. It is restorative in its role of seeking out truth-
telling in the form of sharing and recording of information, leading to greater understanding

<p>of individuals and communities. The methodology of the Commission is based on 
indigenous customs, such as healing circles, traditional counselling provided to participants 
and other customary and spiritual ceremonies. Through this process, new relationships will 
be established based on mutual recognition and respect. Under the court-monitored Indian 
Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, financial redress is provided outside the 
Commission through a modest common experience payment to all former students and a 
separate independent assessment process for abuse claims.  
</p>
<p>80. The Waitangi Tribunal in New Zealand, established in 1975, is an example of a 
restorative justice process to facilitate reconciliation derived from the needs of the 
community, including the M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257;.61 The Tribunal broadly fit the ideals of 
restorative justice through the provision of a forum for grievances by participants, the 
validation of claimants&#8217; experiences through research and the incorporation of M&#257;ori 
tradition through a focus on restoring the <i>mana</i> (authority) of the victims, their families and 
the offenders&#8217; families.62  
</p>
<p>81. The Australian Apology in 2008 officially recognized the harm caused by its policy 
of removal of indigenous children from their families.63 The context and purpose of the 
Apology demonstrate similarities with aspects of restorative justice process in that it was 
intended to help heal the damage of the past and prepare for the future.  
</p>
<p>82. The Maine Wabanaki-State Child Welfare Truth and Reconciliation Commission is 
mandated to consider the widespread transfer of indigenous children from their families to 
non-indigenous families precipitated by the Indian Child Welfare Act. The Commission 
gives a voice to the Wabanaki people, promising to practice equal State/indigenous 
involvement in order to achieve peace and reconciliation through a restorative justice 
model.  
</p>
<p>83. As these cases illustrate, restorative justice must be understood as a process, not an 
event. Robert Andrew Joseph suggests eight &#8220;giant steps&#8221; in the process of achieving 
reconciliatory justice: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Recognition: finding truth and describing injustices;  
&#8226; Responsibility: the acknowledgement of responsibility for injustices;  
&#8226; Remorse: a sincere apology for injustices; 
&#8226; Restitution of lands and resources, and the power to determine their use;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Reparation for injustices in financial terms, recognizing that many harms are 
untouched by this compensation;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Redesigning State political-legal institutions and processes to empower indigenous 
participation in self-government and State governance;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Refraining from future injustices by assuring past and present injustices will not be 
repeated;

done unto them.64 
</p>
<p>84. An issue with restorative justice has been that sometimes the mechanisms put in 
place by States are insufficient to adequately address past grievances. Though beneficial, 
actions such as apologies and processes such as truth and reconciliation commissions are 
only fully effective when comprehensively supported by indigenous participation. 
Furthermore, in order to provide redress, the views of indigenous peoples on its appropriate 
forms should be prioritized.

<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Expert Mechanism Advice No. 6 (2014): Restorative justice, 
indigenous juridical systems and access to justice 
for indigenous women, children and youth,  
and persons with disabilities  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General 
</b></p>
<p>1. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples constitutes a 
principled framework for justice, reconciliation, healing and peace. It affirms that the 
United Nations, its bodies and specialized agencies, and States have a duty to promote 
respect for and full application of the provisions of the Declaration and follow up on its 
effectiveness. Full implementation of the Declaration necessarily entails the protection and 
promotion of indigenous peoples&#8217; right to access to justice and to effective remedies.  
</p><p>2. Indigenous juridical systems can play a crucial role in facilitating access to justice 
for indigenous peoples. The Declaration affirms indigenous peoples&#8217; right to promote, 
develop and maintain their juridical systems or customs, in accordance with international 
human rights standards (article 34). The Declaration also upholds indigenous peoples&#8217; right 
to maintain and strengthen their distinct political, legal, economic, social and cultural 
institutions, while retaining the right to participate fully in the political, economic, social 
and cultural life of the State (article 5). 
3. Access to justice, in addition to being a right in itself, is of paramount importance to 
indigenous women, children and youth, and persons with disabilities, as a means of 
obtaining timely and effective remedies. It must be viewed holistically, since access to 
justice is inextricably linked to other human rights challenges faced by indigenous peoples, 
including their status in society as indigenous women, children and youth, and persons with 
disabilities, as well as poverty, lack of access to health and education, and lack of 
recognition of their lands, territories and resources. 
</p>
<p>4. In this regard, several recent judicial decisions highlight the role that access to 
justice can play in asserting indigenous peoples&#8217; rights over their lands, territories and 
resources.65 
</p>
<p><b> B. Advice for States 
</b></p>
<p>5. In accordance with the Declaration, States must recognize indigenous peoples&#8217; right 
to maintain, develop and strengthen their own juridical systems, and must value the 
contribution that these systems can make to facilitating indigenous peoples&#8217; access to 
justice. In this regard, States must allocate resources to support the adequate functioning 
and sustainability of indigenous juridical systems and help ensure that they meet the needs 
of communities, in accordance with article 39 of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>65
  See for example <i>Tsilhqot&#8217;in Nation</i> v. <i>British Columbia</i>, 2014 SCC 44 (Supreme Court of Canada), 
</p>
<p>which relates to indigenous peoples&#8217; title to land and resources based on a territorial approach, and 
Decision Number 35/PUU-X/2012 of the Constitutional Court of Indonesia, which recognizes the 
rights of the Indigenous Peoples of the Archipelago over their customary forests. </p>


<p>6. In States in which legal pluralism is recognized, the jurisdiction of indigenous 
juridical systems should be adequately clarified, recognizing that indigenous justice 
systems are highly diverse and context-specific. State justice systems should demonstrate 
respect for customary laws (which can be a means to increasing access to justice) and 
customary laws should respect international human rights norms. 
</p>
<p>7. States have an obligation to protect and support the work of indigenous human 
rights defenders in the promotion of access to justice for indigenous peoples, in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 22/6. 
</p>
<p>8. States should adopt a holistic approach to access to justice for indigenous women, 
children and youth, and persons with disabilities, and take measures to address the root 
causes of multiple forms of discrimination facing these groups, including systemic biased 
use of discretionary powers, poverty, marginalization and violence against indigenous 
women.  
</p>
<p>9. States should make greater effort to disaggregate data regarding their criminal 
justice systems so that a clearer picture of indigenous women, children and youth, and 
persons with disabilities currently in detention can emerge. Such data would permit the 
improved development and implementation of policies to better address the situation of 
indigenous women, children and youth, and persons with disabilities deprived of their 
liberty. 
</p>
<p>10. States should ensure that indigenous women, children and youth, and persons with 
disabilities have access to an interpreter where required, in all legal and administrative 
proceedings. In the case of indigenous persons with disabilities, States should take 
measures to ensure all forms of accessibility. 
</p>
<p>11. States should work with indigenous peoples to develop alternatives for indigenous 
children in conflict with the law, including the design and implementation of culturally 
appropriate juvenile justice services and the use of restorative justice approaches. Arrest, 
detention or imprisonment should only be used as a measure of last resort.  
</p>
<p>12. Together with indigenous peoples, States should promote human rights education 
and training among indigenous women, children and youth, and persons with disabilities as 
a means for empowerment. Furthermore, links between indigenous and State legal 
institutions can benefit from dialogue on rights based notions of equality, centring on 
awareness of the rights of indigenous women and persons with disabilities. This can lead to 
improved gender balance and participation of indigenous persons with disabilities in 
juridical systems and indigenous peoples&#8217; juridical systems.  
</p><p>13.  States should work in partnership with indigenous peoples so as to ensure 
harmonious and cooperative relations in the implementation of the Declaration&#8217;s provisions 
regarding access to justice.  
14.  There cannot be a rule of law without access. States have an obligation to ensure 
access to justice so that the right of indigenous peoples to effective remedies is fully 
realized. 
</p>
<p>15. States have a duty to protect against corporate violations of the human rights of 
indigenous peoples, especially in view of their vulnerability. Particular attention is required 
for indigenous women, children and youth, and persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>16.  States should take measures to increase appointments of indigenous women to the 
judiciary. It is also important to promote a greater representation of indigenous women in 
international legal systems, such as the human rights treaty bodies. </p>


<p><b> C. Advice for indigenous peoples  
</b></p>
<p>17. Indigenous peoples should strengthen advocacy for the recognition of their juridical 
systems; increased development of such systems can improve access to justice. Together 
with States, indigenous peoples should in particular raise awareness about their right to 
administer their own justice among policymakers and judicial and law enforcement 
officials.  
</p>
<p>18. Indigenous peoples must also ensure that these systems respond to the needs of the 
community, in particular indigenous women, children and youth, and persons with 
disabilities.  
</p>
<p>19. Reforms and strategies are critical to ensure traditional indigenous juridical systems 
and leadership are efficient and independent. This includes making more resources 
available to the indigenous leadership, supporting indigenous juridical systems and 
ensuring they perform their duties with independence and integrity. The participation of 
indigenous women as leaders within traditional indigenous juridical systems should be 
facilitated through targeted efforts, based on holistic and healing-based approaches.  
</p>
<p>20. Indigenous juridical systems should ensure that indigenous women, children and 
youth, and persons with disabilities are free from all forms of discrimination. The 
participation of indigenous women, children and youth, and persons with disabilities in 
indigenous justice institutions should be respected and promoted. Accessibility should be 
ensured for indigenous persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>21. Indigenous peoples should ensure that knowledge regarding their juridical systems 
and customary laws is transferred across generations, enabling every member of the 
community to understand indigenous concepts of justice. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Advice for international organizations  
</b></p>
<p>22. The United Nations and its bodies and specialized agencies have an essential role in 
the promotion and protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; human rights, including their right to 
promote, develop and maintain their juridical systems. The work of international entities 
should be inclusive of indigenous peoples in both developing and developed States. 
Particular attention is required for indigenous women, children and youth, and persons with 
disabilities. 
</p>
<p>23. The United Nations should dedicate resources to the development and 
implementation, in cooperation with indigenous peoples, of training on the rights of 
indigenous peoples, and particularly indigenous women, children and youth, and persons 
with disabilities, for law enforcement officials and members and staff of the judiciary. In 
addition to indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, training should also address cultural sensitivity 
issues and trauma. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Advice for national human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>24. National human rights institutions can play a catalytic role in the promotion of 
access to justice for indigenous peoples. Jointly with indigenous peoples, they can 
encourage recognition of and provide support to indigenous juridical systems. They can 
also provide training on human rights to both State and indigenous judicial authorities and 
disseminate and promote the advice of the Expert Mechanism among the judiciary and the 
legal profession, so that it can be used to inform legal cases and opinions. National human </p>


<p>rights institutions can bring together indigenous peoples and States, acting as facilitators in 
restorative justice processes.
