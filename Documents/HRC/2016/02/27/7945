<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>1. The United Nations Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence 
against Women was established in 1996, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 
50/166, and is an important benchmark in the commitment of Member States to 
implement the legal and policy promises to end violence against women. 
Administered by the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the 
Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), on behalf of the United Nations system, the 
Trust Fund brings synergy and coherence to the work of the United Nations in this 
critical field. It is a vital platform for realizing the &#8220;Delivering as One&#8221; initiative. The 
Trust Fund is the only global multilateral grant-making mechanism specifically 
dedicated to addressing violence against women, irrespective of the type or context of 
this gross human rights violation. Guided by its strategy document for 2010-2015, 
&#8220;Vision 2015&#8221;, the Trust Fund supports national and local governments, 
non-governmental organizations and United Nations country teams in their 
programmes aimed at preventing violence, expanding services to survivors and 
strengthening institutional responses to address the causes and consequences of 
violence against women and girls.  
</p>
<p>2. By the end of 2012, the $63.5 million active grant portfolio of the Trust Fund 
included 95 programmes covering 85 countries and territories, touching the lives of 
over 24 million women and girls and influencing over 5,000 formal and informal 
institutions. The present report, prepared for the fifty-seventh session of the 
Commission on the Status of Women and the twenty-third session of the Human 
Rights Council, describes the progress and achievements of the Trust Fund in 2012.  
 
 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background and context 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>3. Violence against women and girls is one of the most widespread violations of 
human rights. In some countries, up to 7 out of 10 women experience physical 
and/or sexual violence at least once in their lifetime.1 Women and girls in 
communities and countries across the world continue to live in a state of systematic 
insecurity that transcends geography, ethnicity, culture, socioeconomic status and 
religion. This violence and insecurity is exacerbated by the cumulative and 
intersecting discrimination and exclusion experienced by various groups of women 
and girls. Today, violence against women is increasingly recognized as a threat to 
democracy, a barrier to lasting peace, a burden on national economies and an 
appalling human rights violation.2  
</p>
<p>4. The recognition that violence against women is a major social and political 
problem is evident in the record number of countries adopting or strengthening 
</p>

<p> 1  See World Health Organization (WHO), <i>Multi-country study on women's health and domestic 
violence against women</i>, Geneva, 2005. The study found that the prevalence of physical and/or 
sexual violence by a partner varied from 15 per cent in urban Japan to 71 per cent in rural 
Ethiopia, with most areas being in the 30-60 per cent range. See also &#8220;Violence against women 
prevalence data: surveys by country&#8221;, compiled by the United Nations Entity for Gender 
Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), 2011.

2011&#8221;. </p>

</b> 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>laws, policies and action plans to address this violence.3 The reinforcement of these 
laws at the international level through successive resolutions of the General 
Assembly and Security Council4 calling for intensified action in this field is a 
further testament to the progress made so far towards a global legal framework in 
the area of violence against women.  
</p>
<p>5. Through the mandate conferred by the General Assembly, the Trust Fund 
invests in collaborative, coordinated and innovative programmes that aim to end 
violence against women and enable women and girls to be safe and able to live 
dignified lives, free from fear and with access to justice as the norm, not the 
exception. 
</p>
<p>6. Consistent with this mandate, the Trust Fund focuses on translating the global 
promise to end violence against women into practice by supporting initiatives that 
address the gender-based discrimination and exclusion that allows violence to 
flourish. The programmes implement strategies to transform unjust laws, inequitable 
social norms and harmful practices; to provide a high quality of services and access 
to justice to survivors of violence; to keep women and girls safe in conflict, post-
conflict and transitional settings; and to break the link between violence and 
HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>7. Knowledge, lessons learned and good practices generated through funded 
programmes are fast becoming the foundations and drivers of policy change in the 
dynamic process of addressing violence against women. Evidence gathered through 
baseline studies, evaluations and research conducted by grantees is being 
transformed into instruments for public education, policy advocacy with institutions 
and programming. The funded initiatives play a key role in increasing knowledge, 
transforming behaviour and modifying practices based on prejudice. The Trust Fund 
considers these valuable efforts to be the building blocks for preventing violence 
and promoting women&#8217;s empowerment.  
 
 
</p>
<p><b> III. Translating promise into practice 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>8. Programmes supported by the Trust Fund combine multiple areas of 
interventions that seek to protect and fulfil women&#8217;s interrelated rights. Efforts for 
the prevention of violence are implemented in conjunction with service delivery 
programmes, legal and judicial reform and institutional strengthening, thus forging a 
coherent and holistic approach to ending violence against women and girls, and 
addressing the manifold causes of violence and its complex consequences on 
multiple levels. These efforts are helping shape a model to prevent, respond to, and 
address violence, and to prioritize the sustainability and institutionalization of good 
practices. Together with its partners, the Trust Fund has learned through its work 
that ending violence against women requires sustained engagement with 
communities, that the use of multimedia and social marketing lead to increased 
awareness and visibility of violence, and that research based on solid evidence can 
improve advocacy, policymaking and programme implementation.

<p>9. The accomplishments of the Trust Fund grantees in 2012 make a compelling 
case for how much can be achieved by providing strategic and direct grants to 
programmes of high quality led by effective institutions. Through the programmes 
supported by the Trust Fund, grantees are building the foundation for an evidence-
based, comprehensive model to prevent violence against women that can be scaled-up 
and replicated regionally, nationally and globally. The Trust Fund helps fill a critical 
gap in resources and increases the number of successful initiatives that have proven 
to be a factor in the reduction of violence against women and girls. 
 
</p>
<p><b>  Preventing violence 
</b> 
</p>
<p>10. Investing in primary prevention efforts at the individual, community, and 
societal levels to stop violence before it occurs remains a priority for the Trust Fund. 
This requires the identification of, and response to, the underlying causes of the 
problem, rather than focusing only on the consequences of violence. In addition, 
preventing violence entails interventions aimed at transforming unequal power 
relations based on gender, eliminating discriminatory social norms and confronting 
attitudes and behaviours that condone and normalize violence against women and 
girls, both in public and in private. To break the cycle of inequality, exclusion and 
marginalization that fuels violence, primary prevention focuses on changing the 
mind-sets and stereotypes that are at their roots. Primary prevention is a 
fundamental part of any long-term strategy that aims to eliminate violence against 
women and girls.  
</p>
<p>11. The Trust Fund has invested approximately $16 million of its active portfolio 
in community mobilization initiatives with the goal of bringing violence prevention 
efforts within reach of women and girls. By creating community support and zero 
tolerance for gender-based violence, these ongoing programmes are promoting 
changes at the individual level while increasing the protection of women at the 
community level.  
</p>
<p>12. The Trust Fund has also invested approximately $6 million on school-based 
prevention programmes that aim to create safe spaces for girls to continue their 
education. Engaging school administrators, girls, boys, parents and their 
communities, these interventions are recognized as an important component of any 
comprehensive strategy that will bring the intergenerational transmission of 
violence to a halt by tackling the norms that legitimize violence in society and the 
family. 
</p>
<p>13. The school-based prevention programmes supported by the Trust Fund provide 
girls and their support networks with the tools to realize their human rights and 
avoid potentially abusive situations. By engaging girls and boys, parents, school 
administrations and communities, the programmes directly target systematic gender 
discrimination and social norms that devalue girls, with the aim of changing 
personal behaviours and institutional and community rules that condone violence. In 
doing so, Trust Fund grantees are strengthening the role of girls and boys as agents 
and subjects of change in the achievement of gender equality and the elimination of 
violence against women and girls.  
</p>
<p>14. Responding to high levels of rural migration, the Beijing Cultural Development 
Centre for Rural Women is implementing a programme aimed at preventing violence 
against young girls left behind by their parents who have migrated to cities for work 
(girls being raised by relatives in their parents&#8217; absence), who are particularly </p>


<p><b>E/CN.6/2013/8
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>5 </b>12-64357 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>vulnerable to physical and sexual abuse. The centre is creating a community safety 
network for children by training guardians, teachers, police officers and medical 
professionals on how to better protect this group and identify the physical and 
mental trauma experienced by abused children who have been left behind. As a 
result of the programme, government departments cooperating in the pilot areas 
have increased their awareness of the importance of protecting left-behind girls and 
have shown interest in integrating components of the intervention into their routine 
work. For example, until 2012, local education policy in Suizhou City did not 
include safety and sex education in the education and training plan for teachers and 
students. Through the efforts of the centre, 1,675 local primary and junior high 
school students received critical sexual education and self-protection training, and 
sexuality and safety education was included in the annual training plan for teachers 
by the Suizhou Education Bureau for the first time. In addition, three resource 
centres were established in 2012 as safe spaces for guardians and left-behind 
children to share information and experiences, to learn and to help each other. The 
centre and its partners have taken the first crucial steps to establish measures for 
preventing violence against girls in the context of communities affected by 
migration. In doing so, the centre has demonstrated how a strategic, small-scale 
investment can have an important multiplier effect.  
</p>
<p>15. In Zambia, Equality Now is empowering adolescent girls to prevent, identify 
and report sexual violence through the creation of safe spaces for girls where they 
can build their protective assets. The programme has reached over 1,800 girls in 
four schools. Knowing that engaging boys is critical to any prevention effort, the 
programme reached 1,500 school-age boys with messages aimed at challenging 
stereotypes that condone sexual violence against girls, thus eroding the 
discriminatory attitudes and behaviours that have prevented them from becoming 
champions of girls&#8217; rights. The attitude change generated by the programme became 
evident through the commitment of over 600 boys in four schools to become agents 
of change to address sexual violence against girls, with an emphasis on becoming 
the next generation of partners in the fight against violence.  
</p>
<p>16. Recognizing the important role that men and boys can play in promoting zero 
tolerance of violence, the Trust Fund has invested approximately $6.3 million in 
programmes that specifically engage men and boys as agents of change.  
</p>
<p>17. Another grantee working to engage men and boys in preventing violence 
against women and promoting gender equality is the Brazilian organization Instituto 
Promundo. With support from the Trust Fund, the institute implemented a multi-
country programme in Brazil, Chile, India and Rwanda, that ended in 2012. The 
programme sought to test and evaluate an array of interventions that engage young 
and adult men in the prevention of gender-based violence, including in the fields of 
sport, education, health and the workplace. The programme was subject to an impact 
evaluation in 2012 that demonstrated statistically significant changes both in 
attitudes towards violence against women and in the self-reported decrease in the 
use of violence against female partners. Qualitative results further affirmed 
decreased support for attitudes that encourage men&#8217;s use of intimate partner 
violence. In India, the programme generated a decline in self-reported perpetration 
of intimate partner violence among participants. In Jaunpur, for example, there was 
a decrease of self-reported use of physical violence against women over the course 
of three months, from 19 per cent at the baseline to 9 per cent at the end-line survey. 
The evaluation also showed an increase in knowledge of laws pertaining to violence </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/17 
E/CN.6/2013/8 </b> 
 
</p>
<p>12-64357 <b>6 
 
</b></p>
<p>against women. In Brazil, following the sport-based intervention with workshops, 
campaigns and tournaments, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of 
men that agreed that intimate partner violence was acceptable. Of the participants in 
the football tournament, half reported that they had learned how to interact with 
women differently and over 20 per cent said they had learned how to better control 
themselves when they had been tempted to act violently. In Chile, the health sector 
intervention showed a significant positive change in participants&#8217; self-reported 
behaviour, including an increase in condom use. The evaluation also showed a 
significant increase in gender-equitable behaviour by participants and over 80 per 
cent of the youth reported that the intervention had provided them with more tools 
to solve problems without resorting to violence.  
</p>
<p>18. In Cambodia, the Trust Fund grantee CARE and its local implementing 
partner, the People Health Development Association, have been highly successful in 
engaging young men in dialogue on sexual health and gender-based violence. In 
2012, the programme scaled up its gender-based violence prevention initiative with 
male university students in 10 major universities in Phnom Penh, reaching over 
6,500 young men. The initiative builds the ability of peer leaders to conduct peer 
education on gender, women&#8217;s rights and responsible behaviour towards women in 
general, and pre- and post-training tests have affirmed the improved understanding 
and awareness of gender-based violence issues among trained university students. In 
2012, the Executive Director of People Health Development Association was also 
appointed by the Secretary-General as a Youth Ambassador and member of the 
Network of Men Leaders in recognition of his role in engaging young men to 
address the issue of violence against women.  
</p>
<p>19. The Trust Fund is increasing investment in programmes using media to target 
discriminatory gender norms, attitudes and behaviours that place women and girls at 
an increased risk of violence. The Trust Fund grantee Puntos de Encuentro has been 
one of the pioneers in the area of so-called &#8220;edutainment&#8221; or education through 
entertainment. It developed the popular television series <i>Contracorriente</i>, which 
addresses key issues affecting young women in Nicaragua, such as commercial 
sexual exploitation, young female labour at factories and sexual abuse and its 
effects, through the day-to-day struggles of a working class family in Nicaragua. 
Puntos de Encuentro has further utilized the convening power of <i>Contracorriente</i> to 
spark discussions on sexual exploitation with over 1,500 young men and women, 
using selected episodes of the series. As a result, participants reported being able to 
identify risks of sexual exploitation and ways to prevent it. The grantee has also 
produced the popular magazine <i>La Boletina</i>, reaching out to more than 
140,000 beneficiaries across the country, covering more than 84 per cent of the 
municipalities. <i>La Boletina</i> is disseminated through a network of more than 
282 women&#8217;s organizations, and has become a channel of cohesion, coordination 
and dialogue for the women&#8217;s movement in the country. An evaluation in 2012 
showed that readers of <i>La Boletina</i> reported having increased their understanding of 
the interconnectedness of their rights, including sexual and reproductive rights, 
economic rights and the right to a life free of violence. They also reported being 
able to make their rights respected to a larger extent, making decisions that affect 
their lives, establishing their own personal goals, ensuring political participation or 
organizing with other women to speak out. The Trust Fund is now scaling-up the 
strategy to prevent violence against women and girls in 11 countries, through the 
support of the &#8220;Pop Culture With a Purpose&#8221; programme implemented by Oxfam-</p>

sharing and helping replicate its experiences throughout Asia and Africa.  
 
</p>
<p><b>  Expanding access to support services for survivors 
</b> 
</p>
<p>20. The Trust Fund supports coordinated, comprehensive and multisectoral 
approaches to ending violence against women. To ensure that the range of 
interrelated needs and rights of women survivors of violence are being addressed 
effectively, grantees engage with multiple sectors and institutions, including those 
related to health, security and/or police, legal matters, education, social affairs, 
youth affairs, labour and urban planning.  
</p>
<p>21. In Mozambique, in 2012, Pathfinder International, a grantee, established the 
first integrated centre in the country to care for and assist survivors of violence 
against women, bringing together health, psychosocial, law enforcement, paralegal 
and social services under one roof. The programme is strengthening the capacities of 
police and health providers in the Gaza province, contributing to the now fully 
functional directorates of assistance for women and children victims of violence in 
the police stations of Chokw&#232; and Xai-Xai City. In these Cabinets, trained health 
providers receive and treat survivors, and refer them to appropriate services. The 
programme is also building the capacity of provincial and district directorates to 
plan, budget (e.g., training on gender-responsive budgeting), implement and monitor 
interventions to prevent violence against women. All partners and associates have 
been trained on gender and policies/laws related to the elimination of violence 
against women. These activities are the crucial building blocks for increasing 
ownership and sustainability of the strategies and interventions beyond the lifetime 
of the programme.  
</p>
<p>22. Moreover, the Trust Fund supports a number of pioneering initiatives aimed at 
strengthening service delivery for particularly vulnerable women and girls. As part 
of the $9.6 million allocated to the special thematic window5 addressing the 
intersection of HIV/AIDS and violence against women, the recipients of grants from 
the Trust Fund are working to increase access for women and girls to critical 
services. The Ukrainian Foundation for Public Health is implementing a programme 
to improve the lives of women living with HIV and women and girls living on the 
streets, who are survivors of gender-based violence, by improving their access to 
care and support, and by building the systems, capacity and commitment of the 
Government to prevent and respond to violence. The initiative established first 
identification, referral and service provision system in Kiev for cases of violence 
against women and girls living with HIV/AIDS and living on the streets. The 
foundation is also piloting an innovative programme to engage over 400 perpetrators 
of violence in behavioural change counselling and education, in four cities 
throughout the country. In India, the Karnataka Health Promotion Trust is 
implementing a programme to address high levels of violence and increased 
vulnerability to HIV/AIDS experienced by sex workers in the Southern Indian state 
of Karnataka, where nearly 135,000 women work in sex work, of whom 26 per cent 
report having been beaten or raped in the past year alone. By intervening at the 
individual, community and institutional levels, the programme is improving 
</p>

<p> 5  The Trust Fund launched a special funding window as part of its fifteenth call for proposals, 
focusing on programmes that address the twin pandemics of HIV/AIDS and violence against 
women. </p>

<p>knowledge, attitudes and behaviour among community members, sex workers and 
their partners, and service providers, on the intersection of HIV and violence against 
women. The programme has started yielding results and recognition by important 
stakeholders during its first year of implementation. In 2012, the judiciary in 
Karnataka decided to institutionalize the training across all districts through the 
judicial academy.  
</p>
<p>23. Conflict, post-conflict and transitional settings pose particular challenges to 
service delivery for survivors of violence. Across conflict-affected zones around the 
world, the organizations in partnership with the Trust Fund are working to meet 
those complex challenges so as to ensure that women receive the critical services 
they need. In Iraq, the International Medical Corps is building an integrated model 
of care for women survivors of violence by strengthening the capacity and 
coordination efforts of key service providers across multiple sectors of care in 
Baghdad and is establishing a referral system to respond to violence against women 
and girls. In partnership with the Ministry of Health, more than 100 medical staff 
from over 40 hospitals and primary health-care centres have been trained to provide 
better support and services to survivors. The knowledge gained by doctors, nurses, 
midwives, medical assistants and other medical staff is being integrated into the 
country&#8217;s basic health-care system. The training of local authorities, the Iraqi Bar 
Association of lawyers, community social workers and non-governmental 
organizations promotes the cross-sectoral coordination needed to ensure a 
comprehensive approach for the provision of services to survivors. The 
non-governmental organization Resonance, based in the Republic of Moldova, is 
implementing a programme in the region of Transdniestria, aimed at preventing and 
combating domestic violence. The organization has developed techniques for 
integrated service delivery to women survivors of violence, including an effective 
system of referrals. Service providers have applied the programme&#8217;s assistance 
model to their day-to-day work and have established a system of internal recording 
and reporting. The programme has been effective at reaching out to women, many of 
whom have become advocates and volunteers, passing on their first-hand 
experience, knowledge and skills to other survivors. The programme is increasing 
public participation in campaigns aimed at eliminating violence against women. In 
addition, the grantee was the driving force behind a draft domestic violence law that 
was intensively discussed, finalized and considered in the official agenda during 
parliamentary hearings in 2012. Overall, the Trust Fund has invested $7.5 million in 
interventions benefiting women and girls in conflict, post-conflict and transitional 
settings. 
 
</p>
<p><b>  Strengthening the institutional response to violence 
</b> 
</p>
<p>24. To ensure that policies and laws adopted around the world result in tangible 
changes for women and girls, the Trust Fund supports a range of initiatives aimed at 
strengthening the institutional response to violence. By expanding the quality and 
quantity of support available for the effective implementation of national laws and 
action plans, the Trust Fund promotes accountability, transparency and citizen 
participation and oversight. 
</p>
<p>25. The Trust Fund supports a number of initiatives that focus on strengthening the 
response of justice systems to human rights violations. In many countries, gaps in 
capacity and insufficient clarity regarding accountability, institutional mandates and 
responsibilities have led to justice systems in which impunity is the norm. By </p>


<p><b>E/CN.6/2013/8
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>9 </b>12-64357 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>setting up new criminal investigation guidelines and crime registration systems, 
grantees aim at creating institutional environments that can truly address women&#8217;s 
needs. For example, a programme led by the International Rescue Committee is 
working to combat impunity and promote access to fair and timely justice in Sierra 
Leone. The Committee has provided financial and technical assistance to the police 
in Sierra Leone in the conceptualization and dissemination of the country&#8217;s first 
standard operating procedures for the investigation of sexual and domestic violence 
offences. The procedures will improve the consistency and effectiveness of 
procedures for documenting, investigating and prosecuting sexual and domestic 
violence nationwide. The Committee was also an instrumental partner in the passing 
of the Sexual Offences Act by the national parliament of Sierra Leone. The Act 
provides a more consistent and comprehensive legal framework for the prosecution 
of a wide range of sexual crimes, including rape, sexual assault and sexual 
exploitation and is currently awaiting the signature of the President to be passed into 
law. It is anticipated that the law will create the legal framework for a more 
consistent and effective investigation and prosecution of sexual crimes, regardless 
of the victim&#8217;s age or relationship to the perpetrator. Once the bill has been signed 
into law, the Committee will join other stakeholders in ensuring that the law is 
disseminated in Sierra Leone through a range of public education and training 
activities supported by the Trust Fund. The initiative builds on and scales up an 
earlier programme supported by the Trust Fund and the Department for International 
Development of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 
demonstrating the importance of strong and sustained partnerships. The replication 
of the programme in other countries where the Committee is present is also being 
planned.  
</p>
<p>26. The Trust Fund supports several programmes aimed at establishing and/or 
strengthening referral mechanisms. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a United Nations 
country team programme implemented jointly by the United Nations Population 
Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in close 
collaboration with the Government, is building lines of communication and 
coordination between entities and both the local and State levels with the goal of 
establishing an effective referral mechanism for use by key stakeholders. The eight 
targeted municipalities have committed resources to ensure its sustainability. The 
programme has also contributed to the development and adoption of local plans and 
programmes on the prevention of gender-based violence by local authorities in 
13 municipalities, which are provided with funding allocations through the national 
gender action plan. The target referral mechanisms have also developed and adopted 
their own plans for the prevention of violence in their local communities as a sign of 
long-term commitment to eliminating violence against women and girls.  
</p>
<p>27. Other grantees of the Trust Fund focus on strengthening the implementation of 
protection orders and criminal investigations of gender-motivated killings of 
women. In Mexico, Cat&#243;licas por el Derecho a Decidir (Catholics for the Right to 
Free Choice) is establishing a standardized protocol for the criminal investigation of 
cases of murder and forced disappearance of women, which will serve as a model 
for state-level Attorneys General. In partnership with the National Citizens&#8217; 
Observatory on Femicide, the grantee has developed the first draft protocol for the 
criminal investigation of cases of femicide in Mexico City. The protocol will be 
replicated in other states in the country. By the end of 2012, 11 of the 17 Mexican 
States that had codified femicide had made use of the minimum guidelines for </p>

E/CN.6/2013/8 </b> 
 
</p>
<p>12-64357 <b>10 
 
</b></p>
<p>investigation developed by the grantee. In response to the lack of, or inadequate, 
data on murders of women across the country, Cat&#243;licas por el Derecho a Decidir 
has also identified eight minimum variables that should be reported when 
registering cases of femicide. These variables have been adopted by the Attorney 
General of Mexico City and will likely be replicated in other states and at the 
federal level.  
 
 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Generating knowledge and developing capacities 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>28. As the leading global fundraising mechanism dedicated to the elimination of 
violence against women and girls, the Trust Fund is an international hub of 
knowledge generation and dissemination. The knowledge generated through 
programmes supported by the Trust Fund provides a blueprint for what works to 
eliminate violence against women, but also highlights gaps in programming and 
funding that must be addressed.  
</p>
<p>29. What is increasingly becoming evident is that ending violence against women 
requires a comprehensive approach that includes prevention, assistance to survivors, 
a robust legal and policy framework and law enforcement capability. Without 
exception, programmes supported by the Trust Fund identify deep-seated stigma and 
discrimination against women and girls at the individual, community and 
institutional levels as the most important factors contributing to the vulnerability of 
women and girls. Analysis and evaluations of programmes supported by the Trust 
Fund are revealing that when it comes to the elimination of violence against women, 
strategies for change are the responsibility of all. The elimination of violence 
against women requires systematic and continuous reflection by individuals, 
communities and national and international institutions on beliefs, behaviours and 
practices and how these beliefs and practices may affect policies, programmes and 
actions.  
</p>
<p>30. The collective experiences of the programmes supported by the Trust Fund 
reveal that there are four common approaches that are critical to delineating a 
comprehensive response to ending violence against women. The analysis shows that 
90 per cent of the grantees have put in place initiatives to strengthen the response to 
violence against women, to prevent the occurrence of violence and, where violence 
is perpetrated, to support survivors in the most effective way. Grantees of the Trust 
Fund have identified the need for multidimensional responses to ending violence 
against women, in the preventive, remedial and rehabilitation stages of the spectrum 
and have implemented this approach through one-stop centres, common protocols 
and the building of individual and institutional capacities to foster a unified 
response to violence against women. More than one third of the grantees have 
identified eradicating the root causes of violence against women as a core strategy 
and have used numerous interventions to change the beliefs, traditions, perceptions 
and behaviour of people. Among these interventions, those involving working with 
men and boys and with community, tribal and religious leaders are the most 
relevant, along with those promoting community-based research and awareness-
raising through public information campaigns. A third approach is the production 
and enrichment of knowledge to support advocacy for social transformation, policy 
and action, with 41 per cent of the portfolio of active grants using this strategy 
mainly through (a) conducting surveys and baseline research; (b) mapping resources 
and services; (c) piloting programmes and drawing on knowledge from individual </p>


<p><b>E/CN.6/2013/8
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>11 </b>12-64357 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>and collective experiences; (d) conducting specialized research; and (e) building 
upon existing knowledge. The fourth core approach is the empowerment of 
survivors to enable them to move from a state of victimhood towards taking control 
of their lives and being agents of change for other survivors. Close to one fifth of 
grants have used such a strategy, creating support systems such as peer educators, 
counsellors and survivors&#8217; networks and programmes to provide women survivors 
with skills to reduce their vulnerability to violence. Specific interventions that have 
proven effective in promoting healing and transformation among survivors are 
related to the use of edutainment techniques and the creation of solidarity and 
support groups where women can have a voice to make their needs and priorities 
acknowledged and respected. 
</p>
<p>31. There is no single solution for ending violence against women, but rather 
various measures, models and approaches that can be applied in a coherent way. The 
impact of programmes is rarely immediate, as change is a slow process even in the 
best of circumstances. The lessons learned on best approaches for addressing 
violence against women accentuate the impact that the current funding environment 
can have on programming. While the importance of the multisectoral and 
multipartner approaches are increasingly highlighted through research and 
evaluations, the lack of long-term funding available in the field makes it challenging 
to carry out these recommendations and to push forward the lessons learned. Long-
term investments in programmes that combine several strategies, bringing together 
multiple actors to address the many causes and consequences of violence against 
women and girls in a coherent manner, are crucial.  
</p>
<p>32. In 2012, the Trust Fund continued its support of global learning initiatives 
through its special thematic windows. In its sixteenth grant making cycle, the Trust 
Fund launched a special thematic window on addressing violence against women in 
conflict, post-conflict and transitional settings. The special thematic windows are 
particularly relevant for generating knowledge and stimulating actions in strategic 
areas to advance the field of ending violence against women and girls.  
</p>
<p>33. The Trust Fund special thematic window on addressing the twin pandemics of 
violence against women and HIV/AIDS also continues to scale up efforts for 
evidence-based programmes. In 2012, the Trust Fund produced a policy paper on 
effective approaches for addressing the intersection of violence against women and 
HIV/AIDS. The policy paper reinforced the message that investing in long-term 
interventions and challenging discrimination and harmful norms against women and 
girls is the way towards a future with zero violence and zero HIV/AIDS. The policy 
paper was presented at the International AIDS Conference, held in July 2012, in 
Washington, D.C., at a session co-sponsored by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) and UN-Women.  
</p>
<p>34. In 2012, the Trust Fund intensified its efforts to develop the capacities of 
grantees to conduct effective monitoring and evaluation and to improve the overall 
processes of the Trust Fund for capturing and disseminating knowledge. The Trust 
Fund provided technical feedback to grantees, starting in the proposal development 
phase, and continued its assistance in developing and implementing grantees&#8217; 
monitoring and evaluation plans. It also extended its capacity development training 
for recently funded grantees on evidence-based programme design, monitoring and 
evaluation. The Trust Fund held a five-day capacity-building workshop in Mexico 
City, reaching a total of 14 organizations. The workshop was tailored for new </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/17 
E/CN.6/2013/8 </b> 
 
</p>
<p>12-64357 <b>12 
 
</b></p>
<p>grantees to gain a global overview of evidence-informed best practices on 
programming. It brought the partners together to gain a fuller understanding of their 
programmes and to ascertain how their evidence-informed approaches can be 
strengthened.  
 
 
</p>
<p><b> V. Building new partnerships, ownership and  
expanded commitment 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>35. Mobilizing broad-based participation of both established and new actors in the 
field of eliminating violence against women is a key pillar of the strategic plan of 
the Trust Fund for 2010-2015. The Trust Fund is actively contributing to the United 
Nations &#8220;Delivering as one&#8221; initiative, by bringing the system together and ensuring 
coordination at the operational, decision-making and programme implementation 
stages. At the operational and programme management levels, the primary vehicle 
for the participation of the United Nations system comprises the 14 local inter-agency 
programme advisory committees and the Global Programme Advisory Committee of 
the Trust Fund. The Global Programme Advisory Committee advises the Trust Fund 
on strategic priorities and grant-making issues. The subregional inter-agency 
programme advisory committees ensure synergies with existing United Nations 
efforts towards the elimination of violence against women and national priorities. 
The decentralized and broadly participatory structure ensures that funding 
allocations conform to the capacities and needs of diverse countries and regions, 
thereby promoting the overall relevance of the Trust Fund to national priorities and 
contexts. In its grant-making cycle for 2012, the Trust Fund recorded the 
participation of 105 individuals and 17 organizations of the United Nations system6 
throughout the entire process, which illustrates the commitment of the entire United 
Nations system to the work and mission of the Trust Fund, and demonstrates the 
ability of the Fund to bring the system together in an open, transparent and 
participatory manner. Equally, it highlights the capacity to generate a platform for 
open discussion on strategies for the elimination of violence against women 
worldwide.  
</p>
<p><b>__________________

<p> 6  In 2012, members of the programme advisory committees at the global and subregional levels 
included: the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); the Economic 
Commission for Africa (ECA); the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific 
(ESCAP); the International Labour Organization (ILO); the Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs; the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR); the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS); the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP); the United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO); the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment 
of Women (UN-Women); the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF); the United Nations 
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC); the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA); the 
United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA); the 
World Health Organization (WHO); the World Food Programme (WFP); the World Bank; United 
Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict; and the Office of the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. Programme advisory committees also 
comprised of leading representatives of non-governmental organizations, intergovernmental 
organizations and other experts at the global and field levels, including representatives from the 
Centre for Women&#8217;s Global Leadership, Equality Now, the Open Society Institute, the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM) and others. </p>

<p>36. The Trust Fund is also supporting joint programmes off United Nations 
country teams, thereby contributing to the synergized, coordinated and collective 
efforts of the United Nations system, at the country level, for the elimination of 
violence against women. Since 2008, the Trust Fund has received joint programme 
proposals from 50 country teams, and is currently supporting 13 such joint 
programmes, with a total investment of $12.6 million in Belarus, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, China, Ecuador, Indonesia, Mexico, Nepal, Panama, Serbia, Sri Lanka, 
Thailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Uruguay. The targeted 
programme support of the Trust Fund is serving as an important incentive for agencies 
of at the country level to gather the collective knowledge and experiences of the 
United Nations system for systematic, coordinated and comprehensive programming. 
Joint programmes promote a multisectoral and holistic response to violence and are 
focused on supporting Governments in the establishment of systems and 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>37. The Trust Fund continues its close collaboration with the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and its support to the 
mandates of the special procedures mechanisms established by the Human Rights 
Council. The country offices of OHCHR are working closely with the grantees to 
ensure the integration of a human rights perspective at every stage of programme 
implementation. The Trust Fund&#8217;s annual call for proposals solicits proposals from 
organizations working to address gaps in the realization of recommendations made 
by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences. 
The Trust Fund has also engaged the office of the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict during the development of the 
new special thematic window on violence against women and girls in conflict, post-
conflict and transitional settings, to ensure that the proposals submitted address gaps 
in the implementation of Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000), 1820 (2008) and 
1888 (2009). The collaboration will continue throughout the implementation of the 
programmes supported within this focus area. By funding these programmes, the 
Trust Fund is also supporting the Secretary-General&#8217;s UNiTE campaign by targeting 
one of its five key outcomes: addressing sexual violence in conflict and post-
conflict situations. 
</p>
<p>38. In June 2012, the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session, 
Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, hosted a cultural event in the General Assembly 
hall with the aim of boosting support for the Trust Fund and celebrating the work of 
UN-Women. Through this event, the General Assembly reaffirmed its commitment 
to the cause of ending violence against women and the mandate of the Trust Fund to 
take action on behalf of the United Nations system. The increasing commitment and 
partnership was illustrated, subsequent to the special event, by first-time donor 
contributions from Africa, Latin America and Arab States.  
 
 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Grant-making cycle 2012 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>39. The Trust Fund&#8217;s annual call for proposals solicits applications that focus on 
addressing all forms of violence against women. In ensuring that the core principles 
of an open, fair, transparent, competitive and merit-based process are maintained, 
the Trust Fund makes the call for proposals available in six languages and solicits 
applications in English, French and Spanish. The Trust Fund prioritizes applications 
that demonstrate multisectoral approaches and collaboration between various </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/17 
E/CN.6/2013/8 </b> 
 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>stakeholders; evidence-based interventions; meaningful investments in monitoring 
and evaluation; and systems to document knowledge and lessons learned. It also 
underscores the potential for scaling up successful initiatives, while emphasizing the 
development of national capacities to foster sustainability. 
</p>
<p>40. The demand for grants from the Trust Fund has increased exponentially over 
the past five years. During its sixteenth grant-making cycle (2011-2012), the Trust 
Fund was able to meet less than 1 per cent of the total amount requested in grant 
applications (total requests amounted to $1.06 billion). In any given year, the Trust 
Fund has been able to meet less than 5 per cent of the demand for resources to 
address violence against women and girls.  
</p>
<p>41. In 2012, the Trust Fund awarded $8.4 million in new grants to 12 initiatives in 
19 countries. Grants distributed in the sixteenth grant-making cycle are expected to 
reach over 1.9 million beneficiaries between 2012 and 2015. The largest number of 
grants distributed in 2012 went to Latin America and the Caribbean region, with 
Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe and Central Asia and cross-regional programmes each 
receiving an equal number of grants, followed by the Arab States. In terms of the 
value of grant distribution, programmes from Latin America and the Caribbean were 
awarded the greatest amount of funds (23 per cent), followed closely by cross-
regional programmes (20 per cent); Africa (18 per cent); Europe and Central Asia 
(15 per cent); and Asia-Pacific and the Arab States (12 per cent respectively). The 
vast majority of new grantees (75 per cent) are civil society organizations, followed 
by governmental organizations (17 per cent) and United Nations country teams 
(8 per cent).  
</p>
<p>42. The number of Member States contributing to the Trust Fund showed a 
significant increase from 24 in 2011 to 33 in 2012, reaching the largest number of 
contributing Member States since the establishment of the Trust Fund in 1996. 
Through its contributions, the Trust Fund serves as a barometer of the commitment 
of the international community to advancing efforts for the elimination of violence 
against women. These new partnerships represent a step towards the achievement of 
the goal set by the Secretary-General through the UNiTE campaign to raise, by 
2015, $100 million annually for the Trust Fund grant-making cycle. For its sixteenth 
grant-making cycle, the Trust Fund benefited from the generous support of 
17 Member States: Australia, Bahrain, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Kazakhstan, 
Kuwait, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Morocco, the Netherlands, Oman, 
Pakistan, South Africa and Switzerland. In 2012, Johnson &amp; Johnson was the 
leading private sector partner of the Trust Fund, while the United Nations Federal 
Credit Union made its second contribution to the Fund. From the non-profit sector, 
Zonta International has reaffirmed its commitment to the cause of the Trust Fund 
with its eighth consecutive contribution, while the United Nations Women for Peace 
initiative and the Universal Peace Federation made their first contributions to the 
Trust Fund in 2012. The work of the Fund was also supported by national 
committees for UN-Women in Austria, Finland, Iceland, Japan and the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Around the world, committed 
individuals have also embraced and supported the cause of the Trust Fund through 
their contributions.  
</p>
<p>43. Grants awarded in 2012 continue to support work along the thematic and 
priority areas identified by the Trust Fund, with some grantees partnering with and 
building on the achievements of past grants from the Trust Fund, and others </p>

</p>
<p><b>15 </b>12-64357 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>breaking new ground with novel approaches and learning in the field, as illustrated 
in the following examples:  
</p>
<p> (a) The organization Concern Worldwide will work to reduce school-related 
gender-based violence in the Nsanje district of Malawi by partnering with local 
non-governmental organizations and government agencies to establish effective 
awareness, prevention and response mechanisms and promote equal access to 
quality primary education for girls and at-risk children in 25 schools. In Papua New 
Guinea, Voice for Change, a local women&#8217;s human rights organization, will support 
the local government in drafting by-laws for the newly established Jiwaka Province 
to address many forms of violence against women that remain widespread in the 
province;  
</p>
<p> (b) Five new grantees will focus on strengthening local and national laws, 
policies and action plans that address violence against women. In Peru, DEMUS 
will build on its record of successful advocacy for legislative change by seeking 
improved application of the new Peruvian Criminal Procedure Code for cases of 
sexual violence by strengthening the capacity of justice officials responsible for 
providing protection and reparation to women survivors. In Belize, the Women&#8217;s 
Department will lead efforts towards the implementation of the country&#8217;s National 
Plan of Action on Gender-based Violence, prioritizing primary prevention by 
addressing the causes of violence against women through specialized school 
curricula and the engagement of teachers as allies. The Women&#8217;s Resource Centre in 
Armenia will promote the Government&#8217;s accountability for the implementation of 
the 2011-2015 Strategic Action Plan to Combat Gender-based Violence through 
developing monitoring mechanisms and providing recommendations to relevant 
government agencies on legal and policy changes. The United Nations country team 
in Serbia will contribute to the establishment of a coordinated institutional response 
to address violence against women, in line with the National Strategy for Prevention 
and Elimination of Violence against Women in the Family and in Intimate Partner 
Relationships 2011, through a set of prevention and protection measures. The 
Institute for the Advancement of Gender Equality in Cape Verde will spearhead 
implementation of the 2011 Gender-based Violence Law with a focus on the 
prevention of violence and the coordinated institutional response of the Government 
and non-governmental organizations; 
</p>
<p> (c) The Trust Fund is supporting four new programmes in conflict, 
post-conflict and transitional settings in 2012, awarding close to $3.5 million to 
these vital initiatives and providing grants for the first time to programmes in Libya. 
The International Medical Corps will work to ensure that gender-based violence is 
appropriately addressed and prioritized by local and national authorities during 
Libya&#8217;s current transitional period. It will increase the service and coordination 
capacities of Government and community-based service providers and train people 
in five key facilities across the country on gender-based violence guiding principles 
and psychological first aid. The Women&#8217;s Initiatives for Gender Justice will address 
the matter of accountability for gender-based crimes in the context of four armed 
conflict and post-conflict settings where the International Criminal Court is 
conducting ongoing investigations. The grantee will strengthen local capacity to 
undertake documentation programmes in order to generate credible data on gender-
based crimes. The International Centre for Transitional Justice will work to ensure 
that transitional justice mechanisms are designed to address the specific needs of 
victims of gender-based violence in six programme countries, by providing </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/17 
E/CN.6/2013/8 </b> 
 
</p>
<p>12-64357 <b>16 
 
</b></p>
<p>technical assistance and trainings to national policymakers and others involved in 
the design of transitional justice measures. In Thailand, the International Rescue 
Committee will scale up an already proven approach to service delivery for gender-
based violence in humanitarian contexts, through a survivor-centred, multisectoral 
approach to address the needs of survivors in two refugee camps along the 
Thailand/Myanmar border, and by helping a local community-based organization to 
become the leader of this approach. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> VII. The way forward  
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>44. As the Trust Fund approaches its seventeenth year of grant-making, it will 
continue to offer a global platform to Member States, civil society organizations and 
the United Nations system for concerted efforts towards eliminating violence 
against women. Through its grants, the Trust Fund will continue to support high 
quality, evidence-based programmes that will improve the lives of women and girls 
around the world. It will continue to be a catalyst for new ideas, a source of support 
for strategic action and a hub of knowledge on emerging best practices in the field. 
Building on the knowledge generated by its grantees on the ground, the Trust Fund 
will continue to shed light on the necessary components of a global approach that 
enables a holistic response to end violence against women.  
</p>
<p>45. In order to meet the increasing demand for grants from the Trust Fund, efforts 
will be redoubled to ensure that necessary resources and attention are obtained. As 
of December 2012, the Governments of Australia, Austria, Honduras, Iceland, 
Ireland, Kazakhstan, Turkey and the United States of America have contributed to 
the seventeenth grant-making cycle of the Trust Fund, alongside formal pledges 
from the Governments of Germany and the Netherlands.  
</p>
<p>46. Closing the gap on the implementation of national laws, policies and action 
plans will continue to be the overarching framework of the Trust Fund&#8217;s call for 
proposals. In particular, the Trust Fund will seek to support areas of work that 
remain underresourced and largely underserved by existing development 
programming. Given that exposure to violence at a young age has devastating and 
potentially lifelong physical and mental health consequences, the call for proposals 
launched in November 2012 included a special focus area on addressing violence 
against adolescent and young girls. This capitalizes on the first ever International 
Day of the Girl Child, which was celebrated on 11 October 2012, and will reinforce 
the commitment to respect, protect and realize the human rights of girls. This area of 
grant-making focuses on preventing and protecting adolescent and young girls from 
all forms of gender-based violence, abuse and exploitation, and ensuring that girls 
who experience violence receive critical services and access to justice. This includes 
addressing violence against those most at risk of violence, such as girls who are out 
of school, isolated by marriage, or &#8220;invisible&#8221; domestic workers. The funding 
window allows the Trust Fund to provide much needed resources and support to 
non-governmental organizations, Governments and United Nations country teams 
dedicated to advancing the rights of adolescent and young girls through integrated 
interventions that address and respond to their needs. By doing so, this new cohort 
of grantees will also be generating essential knowledge on best practices and 
identifying models that can be scaled up and replicated in other contexts. The Trust 
Fund envisions working closely in 2013 with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF), the Coalition for Adolescent Girls and others to share information on </p>


<p><b>E/CN.6/2013/8
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>17 </b>12-64357 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>programming and expand the network of partners with extensive experience of 
working with adolescent and young girls.  
</p>
<p>47. The new group of grantees working in 10 conflict, post-conflict and 
transitional settings will be invited to share the experiences gained and lessons 
learned during the implementation of their programmes. At the end of the grant 
cycle, and based on the programme evaluations, the Trust Fund will disseminate 
knowledge and produce policy papers that outline good practices in addressing 
gender-based violence in conflict, post-conflict and transitional settings. Case 
studies will also be developed to identify promising practices in this area of gender-
based violence programming. In terms of grantees working to address the 
intersection of violence against women and HIV/AIDS, the Trust Fund will continue 
to provide specialized technical assistance to partners.  
</p>
<p>48. Under the auspices of UN-Women as the administrator of the Trust Fund, the 
organizations of the United Nations and of civil society that form the Global 
Programme Advisory Committee of the Fund, including WHO, the Joint United 
Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA, the 
International Labour Organization (ILO), OHCHR, Equality Now, the Centre for 
Women&#8217;s Global Leadership and the regional commissions, are closely collaborating 
in documenting the lessons learned from the programmes supported by the Trust 
Fund. This collaboration and coordination will continue in 2013 and beyond in an 
effort to ensure the integration of the elimination of violence against women as a 
core part of the development agenda beyond 2015 and as the critical enabler in 
achieving gender equality, advancing women&#8217;s human rights and empowering entire 
communities.
