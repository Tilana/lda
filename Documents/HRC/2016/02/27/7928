</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, Ms. Farida Shaheed, submits 
the present report in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 19/6. 
</p>
<p> In this report, the Special Rapporteur addresses the multi-faceted ways in which the 
right to the freedom indispensable for artistic expression and creativity may be curtailed. 
She reflects upon the growing worldwide concern that artistic voices have been or are being 
silenced by various means and in different ways. This report addresses laws and regulations 
restricting artistic freedoms as well as economic and financial issues significantly 
impacting on such freedoms. The underlying motivations are most often political, religious, 
cultural or moral, or lie in economic interests, or are a combination of those.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur encourages States to critically review their legislation and 
practices imposing restrictions on the right to freedom of artistic expression and creativity, 
taking into consideration their obligations to respect, protect and fulfil this right. The 
Special Rapporteur notes that more discussion is urgently needed in several areas that she 
has considered.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report focuses on the right to the freedom indispensable for artistic 
expression and creativity, protected under articles 15 of the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and 19 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).  
</p>
<p>2. Art constitutes an important vehicle for each person, individually and in community 
with others, as well as groups of people, to develop and express their humanity, worldview 
and meanings assigned to their existence and development. People in all societies create, 
make use of, or relate to, artistic expressions and creations.  
</p>
<p>3. Artists may entertain people, but they also contribute to social debates, sometimes 
bringing counter-discourses and potential counterweights to existing power centres. The 
vitality of artistic creativity is necessary for the development of vibrant cultures and the 
functioning of democratic societies. Artistic expressions and creations are an integral part 
of cultural life, which entails contesting meanings and revisiting culturally inherited ideas 
and concepts. The crucial task of implementation of universal human rights norms is to 
prevent the arbitrary privileging of certain perspectives on account of their traditional 
authority, institutional or economic power, or demographic supremacy in society. This 
principle lies at the heart of every issue raised in the debate over the right to freedom of 
artistic expression and creativity and possible limitations on that right.  
</p>
<p>4. There is no intention to propose a definition of art, or to suggest that additional 
rights should be recognized for artists. All persons enjoy the rights to freedom of expression 
and creativity, to participate in cultural life and to enjoy the arts. Expressions, whether 
artistic or not, always remain protected under the right to freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p>5. This report aims to understand the challenges and obstacles that impede the 
flourishing of artistic creativity, and make specific recommendations to overcome them. 
The approach adopted is broad. The report addresses forms of expression that carry an 
aesthetic and/or symbolic dimension, using different media including, but not limited to, 
painting and drawing, music, songs and dances, poetry and literature, theatre and circus, 
photography, cinema and video, architecture and sculpture, performances and public art 
interventions, etc., irrespective of whether their content is sacred or profane, political or 
apolitical, or whether it addresses social issues or not. It recognizes that artistic activity 
relies on a large number of actors not reducible to the artist <i>per se</i>, encompassing all those 
engaged in and contributing to the creation, production, distribution and dissemination of 
artistic expressions and creations. The Special Rapporteur is convinced that freedom of 
artistic expression and creativity cannot be dissociated from the right of all persons to enjoy 
the arts, as in many cases restrictions on artistic freedoms aim at denying people access to 
specific artworks. Hence, removing creative expressions from public access is a way to 
restrict artistic freedom. Ironically enough, restrictions are often imposed in the name of the 
public which, however, is prevented from making its own judgement.  
</p>
<p>6. Artistic expressions and creations come under particular attack because they can 
convey specific messages and articulate symbolic values in a powerful way, or may be 
considered as doing so. Motivations for restrictions stem from political, religious, cultural, 
moral or economic interests, and disturbing cases of violations are found on all continents.1 
</p>
<p>  
 1  First World Conference on artistic freedom of expression, Oslo, 25-26 October 2012, 
</p>
<p>http://artsfreedom.org/?p=4057. </p>


<p>7. The issue of violations of artistic freedom should be addressed more 
comprehensively by intergovernmental organizations. Media attention to cases of a few 
prominent artists tends to eclipse the reality lived by many people engaged in artistic 
activities around the world. Initiatives such as the establishment of safe cities for artists<i>2</i> 
and the enhanced development of networks between artists and human rights defenders3 
need to be supported.  
</p>
<p>8. In order to collect the views of States and other stakeholders, the Special Rapporteur 
disseminated a questionnaire on the right to artistic freedom. Responses were received from 
28 States and 23 other stakeholders (annex I). The Special Rapporteur convened an experts&#8217; 
</p>
<p>meeting on the issue on 4 and 5 December 2012 (annex II), and a public consultation on 6 
December 2012. The Special Rapporteur is grateful to all those who contributed. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Protection in universal, regional and national instruments 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Universal and regional human rights instruments  
</b></p>
<p>9. The most explicit provisions protecting the freedom of artistic expression and 
creativity are to be found in article 15 (3) of ICESCR, under which States &#8220;undertake to 
respect the freedom indispensable for&#8230;creative activity&#8221; and in article 19 (2) of ICCPR, 
which states that the right to freedom of expression includes the freedom to seek, receive 
and impart information and ideas of all kinds &#8220;in the form of art&#8221;. Articles 13 and 31 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, article 13 (1) of the American Convention on 
Human Rights and article 14 of its Protocol in the area of Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, and article 42 of the Arab Charter for Human Rights also contain such explicit 
provisions. In addition, under article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(UDHR), everyone has the right &#8220;to enjoy the arts&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>10. Implicit provisions encompass those guaranteeing the right to freedom of expression 
or the right to take part in cultural life without specific reference to arts or creative 
activities. Relevant provisions include article 19 of the UDHR, article 10 of the European 
Convention for the Safeguard of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, articles 9 and 
17 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, and article 32 of the Arab Charter 
for Human Rights. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stressed 
that the right to take part in cultural life entails rights of participation in, access to, and 
contribution to cultural life, and encompasses the right of everyone &#8220;to seek and develop 
cultural knowledge and expressions and to share them with others, as well as to act 
creatively and take part in creative activity.&#8221;4 
</p>
<p>11. Other important provisions linked to artistic freedoms relate to the right to freedom 
of opinion, and freedom of thought, conscience and religion, since art is also a means of 
expressing a belief and developing a world vision. For many people, the experience of the 
aesthetic dimensions of life is intimately connected to the sacred or divine. The right to 
artistic freedom also relates to (a) the right of peaceful assembly; (b) the right to freedom of 
association, including the right of artists and creators to form and join trade unions; (c) the

<p>right to benefit from the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any 
literary or artistic production of which a person is the author; and (d) the right to leisure.  
</p>
<p>12. Provisions are to be implemented without any discrimination of any kind, such as 
race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, 
property, birth or other status, as stated in article 2 of ICESCR and ICCPR. Article 5 (e) 
(vi) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, article 13 (c) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women, articles 43 and 45 of the Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and article 21 of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, stress that all persons, irrespective of 
their specific situation or status have the right to freedom of artistic expression and 
creativity.  
</p>
<p>13. Article 27 of ICCPR is crucial for guaranteeing the artistic freedoms of persons 
belonging to ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities. Particular attention must also be paid 
to article 31 of the Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>14. Important positive obligations devolve on States. Under article 15 (2) of ICESCR 
and article 14 of the San Salvador Protocol, States must adopt steps necessary for the 
conservation, the development and the diffusion of culture, which includes arts. Article 30 
of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities calls for measures providing 
persons with disabilities the opportunity to develop and utilize their creative, artistic and 
intellectual potential. Article 42 of the Arab Charter for Human Rights stresses that States 
shall work together and enhance cooperation among them at all levels, with the full 
participation of intellectuals and inventors and their organizations, in order to develop and 
implement recreational, cultural and artistic programmes. 
</p>
<p>15. Few decisions in the United Nations system relate to artistic freedom. In its 
Communication 926/2000 of 2004, concerning a painter, Hak-Chul Shin, who had been 
convicted for a painting deemed to be an &#8220;enemy-benefiting expression&#8221; contrary to the 
National Security Law, the Human Rights Committee found that the Republic of Korea had 
violated article 19 of ICCPR. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, it its Opinion 
32/2011, declared that Lapiro de Mbanga, a famous Cameroonian musician and composer, 
had been arbitrarily detained for the legitimate exercise of his right to freedom of 
expression.  
</p>
<p>16. Some court decisions have also been adopted at the regional level, particularly by 
the European Court of Human Rights.5 At least on one occasion, the Inter-American Court 
on Human Rights adopted a decision relating to artistic freedom.6 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Relevant UNESCO instruments</b>7<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Recommendation concerning the status of the artist 
</i></p>
<p>17. The underlying principle of the 1980 United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organizational (UNESCO) Recommendation Concerning the Status of the Artist is 
that Governments should help to create and sustain a climate encouraging freedom of 
artistic expression and the material conditions facilitating the release of creative talents. The

<p>recommendation addresses issues such as freedom of expression, support to artistic 
creation, artistic education and training, social and labour rights, and intellectual property 
rights. It stresses that artists shall benefit from the rights and protection provided for in 
international and national legislation relating to human rights, in particular in the area of 
freedom of expression and communication (articles III-6 and V 2).  
</p>
<p>18. States have a duty to protect, defend and assist artists and their freedom of creation 
(article III-3). They should ensure that artists have the freedom to establish and be a 
member of trade unions and professional organizations, and should enable organizations 
representing artists to participate in the formulation of cultural policies and employment 
policies (article III-4). Artists should be able to participate fully, either individually or 
through their associations or trade unions, in the life of the communities in which they 
practise their art, and be associated in the formulation of local and national cultural policies 
(article III- 7). 
</p>
<p>19. States should promote the free international movement of artists and not hinder their 
freedom to practise their art in the country of their choice (articles IV-1 j and k; and VI-8).  
</p>
<p>20. Furthermore, States should stimulate public and private demand for the fruits of 
artistic activity in order to increase the opportunities of paid work for artists, <i>inter alia</i> by 
means of subsidies to art institutions, commissions to individual artists, or the organization 
of artistic events, and by establishing art funds (article VI-1 c). 
</p>
<p><i> (b) The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions 
</i></p>
<p>21. According to article 2 of the 2005 UNESCO Convention on the Protection and 
Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, &#8220;Cultural diversity can be protected 
and promoted only if human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of 
expression, information and communication, as well as the ability of individuals to choose 
cultural expressions, are guaranteed. No one may invoke the provisions of this Convention 
in order to infringe human rights and fundamental freedoms as enshrined in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights or guaranteed by international law, or to limit the scope 
thereof.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>22. Under article 7, States endeavour to create an environment which encourages 
individuals and social groups to create, produce, disseminate, distribute and have access to 
their own cultural expressions as well as to diverse cultural expressions from within their 
territory as well as from other countries of the world. States shall also endeavour to 
recognize the important contribution of artists as well as all those involved in the creative 
process, and their central role in nurturing the diversity of cultural expressions. 
</p>
<p>23. The Convention &#8211; based on the principle that cultural goods and services, as vectors 
of identity, values and meaning, must not be treated as mere commodities or consumer 
goods &#8211; recognizes the right of States to develop cultural policies that do not necessarily 
coincide with free market rules. It enhances their capacity to adopt measures necessary for 
the conservation, the development and the diffusion of culture, as required by article 15 of 
ICESCR.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Standards at the national level 
</b></p>
<p>24. As shown in responses to the questionnaire and other information, many 
constitutions expressly protect the right to &#8220;artistic creation&#8221; or &#8220;artistic creativity&#8221;.. Others 
protect the right to &#8220;artistic/creative expression&#8221;, &#8220;freedom of creation&#8221; or of &#8220;artistic 
endeavour&#8221;, or of &#8220;cultural creativity&#8221;, or make reference to &#8220;freedom of the arts&#8221;. Some </p>


<p>constitutions protect the artistic freedom implicitly through the rights to freedom of 
expression, to participate in cultural life, to access culture and to cultural development.8 
</p>
<p><b> B. Limitations to artistic freedoms  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Standards on possible limitations 
</b></p>
<p>25. Article 4 of ICESCR authorizes &#8220;limitations as are determined by law only in so far 
as this may be compatible with the nature of these rights and solely for the purpose of 
promoting the general welfare in a democratic society.&#8221; Limitations must be necessary and 
proportionate, and established by legal rules that are transparent and consistently applied in 
a non-discriminatory way.9  
</p>
<p>26. Under article 19 of ICCPR, the right to freedom of expression, including in the form 
of art, may be subject to certain restrictions that are provided by law and are necessary (a) 
for the respect of the rights or reputations of others; or (b) for the protection of national 
security or of public order, or of public health or morals. Responses to the questionnaire 
demonstrate that some constitutions mirror article 19 of ICCPR, while others regrettably go 
much further in the restrictions they allow.  
</p>
<p>27. Under article 20, any propaganda for war, as well as any advocacy of national, racial 
or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, shall 
be prohibited by law. 
</p>
<p>28. Over the last years, the meaning of articles 19 and 20 of ICCPR has been further 
clarified, in particular through General Comment 34 (2011) of the Human Rights 
Committee on article 19 of ICCPR, and the report of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
opinion and expression on the challenge to reconcile the need to protect and promote the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression and to combat discrimination and incitement to 
hatred (A/67/357).10 The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights conducted 
activities focused on the relationship between freedom of expression and hate speech, 
especially in relation to religious issues. The process culminated with the &#8220;Rabat Plan of 
Action on the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes 
incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence&#8221;.11  
</p>
<p>29. Under article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, States, with due regard to the principles embodied in the UDHR, 
shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial 
superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or 
incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic 
origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing 
thereof. 
</p>
<p>30. These various texts set the parameters for defining possible limitations of artistic 
freedoms.  
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur notes in particular the recommendation to clearly 
distinguish among (a) expression that constitutes a criminal offence; (b) expression that is 
</p>
<p>  
 8  All responses to the questionnaire are available on the website of the Special Rapporteur, at the 
</p>
<p>following address: 
http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/CulturalRights/Pages/SRCulturalRightsIndex.aspx.  
</p>
<p> 9  E/C.12/GC/21, para. 19.  
 10  See also A/66/290. 
 11  A/HRC/22/17/Add.4.  </p>


<p>not criminally punishable but may justify a civil suit or administrative sanctions; and (c) 
expression that does not give rise to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions but still 
raises a concern in terms of tolerance, civility and respect for the rights of others.12 In other 
words, what may be morally objectionable (from one point of view) may not necessarily be 
legally inadmissible or condemnable. Criminal sanctions should be the very last resort 
measures only, to be applied in strictly justifiable situations. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that many artists have been disproportionately sentenced under the 
criminal code, including under charges of offences such as &#8220;extremism&#8221;, &#8220;terrorism&#8221; or 
&#8220;hooliganism&#8221;. A particularly useful suggestion in the Rabat Plan is to use a six-part 
threshold test for those expressions that are criminally prohibited, implying an analysis of 
the context, speaker, content or form (which implicitly also refers to &#8220;the form of art&#8221;), 
extent of the speech, and likelihood, including imminence.  
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur considers that States have the challenge of ensuring the full 
implementation of artistic freedoms and resort to limitations only when absolutely 
necessary. States shall bear in mind that they shall not single out some individual 
conceptions of the beautiful or sacred for official protection, as all persons are equal before 
the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection of the law 
(article 26 of ICCPR). Moreover, &#8220;it is not compatible with the [ICCPR] for a restriction to 
be enshrined in traditional, religious and other such customary law&#8221;.13 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Application to artistic freedoms: specific challenges 
</b></p>
<p>33. States and other stakeholders often refer to the necessity of regulating the 
dissemination of artistic expressions deemed to, for example, call for discrimination, hatred 
and violence against specific groups or persons, amount to drug propaganda, or contain 
pornographic content. The necessity to protect children and adolescents against specific 
contents, such as extreme violence or pornography, the right to privacy and the moral and 
material rights of authors, and the rights of indigenous peoples, has also been mentioned in 
responses to the questionnaire. The attention of the Special Rapporteur was also drawn to 
examples of songs having encouraged ethnic hatred and the broadcasts of these songs 
having had an amplifying effect on genocide.14 
</p>
<p>34. These concerns need to be addressed in compliance with international standards 
regarding possible limitations as described above. The Special Rapporteur encourages 
States, when applying these standards, to take into consideration the specific nature of 
artistic expressions and creations.  
</p>
<p>35. Artists, like journalists and human rights defenders, are at particular risk as their 
work depends on visibly engaging people in the public domain. Through their expressions 
and creations, artists often question our lives, perceptions of ourselves and others, world 
visions, power relations, human nature and taboos, eliciting emotional as well as 
intellectual responses.  
</p>
<p>36. Artistic expression and creativity may entail the re-appropriation of symbols, 
whether national (flags, national anthems), religious (figures, symbols, venues) or 
social/economical (a certain brand for example), as part of a response to the narratives 
promoted by States, religious institutions or economic powers.15 States, religions, corporate

</p>
<p>Oslo Conference, p. 2. </p>


<p>companies and social groups also use art to propagate their ideas and promote their 
interests, including concepts of right and wrong to create homogeneity of belief and 
behaviour. In most cases, restrictions on artistic freedoms reflect a desire to promote a 
world vision or narrative &#8220;while simultaneously blocking all others&#8221;.16  
</p>
<p>37. An artwork differs from non-fictional statements, as it provides a far wider scope for 
assigning multiple meanings: assumptions about the message carried by an artwork are 
therefore extremely difficult to prove, and interpretations given to an artwork do not 
necessarily coincide with the author&#8217;s intended meaning. Artistic expressions and creations 
do not always carry, and should not be reduced to carrying, a specific message or 
information. In addition, the resort to fiction and the imaginary must be understood and 
respected as a crucial element of the freedom indispensable for creative activities and 
artistic expressions: representations of the real must not be confused with the real, which 
means, for example, that what a character says in a novel cannot be equated with the 
author&#8217;s personal views. Hence, artists should be able to explore the darker side of 
humanity, and to represent crimes or what some may consider as &#8220;immorality&#8221;, without 
being accused of promoting these.17  
</p>
<p>38. While policies designed to attract wider audiences to art should be encouraged, this 
should not exclude controversial works because unprepared audiences may be put in 
contact with them. Rather, it is imperative to enhance arts education, which can be seen as a 
strong and efficient alternative to censorship.  
</p>
<p>39. The open access to, and circulation of, artworks through the Internet has increased 
challenges, with instances of conflicts ignited over artistic expressions made locally, but 
distributed globally. However, the issue of the Internet must not obfuscate the fact that a 
great majority of violations of artistic freedoms concern artists working in their own 
country and questioning their own cultural heritage, traditions and surroundings.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Restrictions and obstacles: the need for national assessments  
</b></p>
<p>40. The multifaceted character of restrictions and obstacles to artistic freedoms needs to 
be acknowledged so as to provide a better understanding of the obligations of States to 
respect, protect and fulfil these freedoms and develop good practices.  
</p>
<p>41. In a large number of cases, States resort to imposing restrictions authorized under 
international law in inappropriate or abusive ways, favouring some worldviews over others. 
Consequently, stakeholders lose confidence in State institutions, leading to a loss of 
credibility of Governments, including when they legitimately impose limitations in 
accordance with articles 19 (3) or 20 of ICCPR. This effect is amplified when rules are 
ambiguous and procedures are not transparent.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Persons impacted  
</b></p>
<p>42. Obstacles to artistic freedoms impact on the enjoyment of rights by a wide range of 
people: the artists themselves, whether professionals or amateurs, as well as all those 
participating in the creation, production, distribution and dissemination of artwork. They 
include authors, musicians and composers, dancers and other performers, including street

publishers, distributors, directors and staff working in libraries, galleries, museums, 
cinemas or theatres, curators and organisers of cultural events. Audiences may also be 
affected. It is important to recognize the artistic freedoms of all persons when they 
participate in cultural life or wish to engage in creative activities.  
</p>
<p>43. Restrictions on artistic freedoms may target some categories of the population more 
specifically. Women artists and audiences are at particular risk in some communities, and 
are prohibited from performing arts altogether, from solo performances before mixed 
audiences, or from performing with men. In a number of countries, many women making a 
living as artists, or wishing to engage in artistic careers, particularly in the area of cinema, 
theatre, dance and music, continue to be labelled as &#8220;loose&#8221; or &#8220;prostitutes&#8221;. Ethnic and 
religious minorities may also suffer from prohibitions such as using a language or artistic 
style specific to a region or a people. People with disabilities may suffer particular 
prejudice when wishing to perform or display their work. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Actors imposing restrictions or creating obstacles 
</b></p>
<p>44. A wide range of actors may create obstacles or impose restrictions to freedom of 
artistic expression and creativity. These include States, but also non-State actors in their 
own spheres of influence, such as mass media, broadcasting, telecommunications and 
production companies, educational institutions, armed extremists as well as organized 
crime, religious authorities, traditional leaders, corporations, distribution companies and 
retailers, sponsors, as well as civil society groups such as parents&#8217; associations.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Motivations  
</b></p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur recalls that the expression of political dissent and 
participation in public debate, including in the form of art, is protected under article 19 of 
ICCPR. Public figures, including those exercising the highest political authority, are 
legitimately subject to criticism and political opposition. Therefore, laws on matters such as 
<i>l&#232;se majest&#233;,
</i></p>
<p> 
<i>desacato,
</i></p>
<p> disrespect for authority, disrespect for flags and symbols, defamation 
of the head of State and the protection of the honour of public officials, do raise concern. 
States should not prohibit criticism of institutions such as the army or the administration.18  
</p>
<p>46. The suppression of political dissent, the quest for nation-building and pursuit of 
hegemonic policies have always been prominent reasons for art censorship. In some 
countries, artistic expressions openly critical of a Government are still systematically 
suppressed. Lyrics, visual and performance art criticizing public figures or institutions 
(such as the police), or using national symbols (such as flags, the image of a monarch or 
head of State and/or Government, or the national anthem), may be censored. In countries 
engaged in armed conflicts, artistic expressions questioning the legitimacy or the conduct of 
the war are frequently marginalized or suppressed. The accusation of &#8220;separatism&#8221; or 
&#8220;terrorism&#8221; or being &#8220;unpatriotic&#8221; can be levelled at artworks criticizing the Government.  
</p>
<p>47. Restrictions on artistic freedoms based on religious arguments range from urging the 
faithful not to partake in various forms of artistic expression to outright bans on music, 
images and books.19 Artists have been accused of &#8220;blasphemy&#8221; or &#8220;religious defamation&#8221;, 
</p>

<p>insulting &#8220;religious feelings&#8221; or inciting &#8220;religious hatred&#8221;. Artistic activities or artworks 
concerned include those quoting sacred texts, using religious symbols or figures, 
questioning religion or the sacred, proposing an unorthodox or non-mainstream 
interpretation of symbols and texts, adopting a conduct deemed not to follow religious 
precepts, addressing abuse of power by religious leaders or their linkage with political 
parties or criticizing religious extremism.20  
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur recalls that &#8220;prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a 
religion or other belief system, including blasphemy laws, are incompatible with [ICCPR], 
except in the specific circumstances envisaged in article 20, paragraph 2, of the 
Covenant.&#8221;21 Blasphemy laws have a stifling impact on the enjoyment of freedom of 
religion or belief and impede a healthy dialogue and debate about religion.22  
</p>
<p>49. In some cases, cultural institutions and artists have abstained from presenting 
&#8220;controversial works&#8221; under high pressure from communities, including threats of violence 
and violence itself, and &#8220;policy makers and arts administrators have come broadly to accept 
the argument that it is morally unacceptable to cause offence to other cultures.&#8221;23 It must be 
recalled that, within any collective identity, there will always be differences and debates 
over meanings, definitions and concepts.24 To understand who speaks for which culture or 
community, and ensure that predominance is not accorded to one voice over the other, most 
often out of prejudice, are particular challenges. The fear that some communities may 
protest should not be sufficient to lead to the conclusion that some artworks should not be 
displayed or performed; a certain level of contest and dispute is often inherent to 
contemporary art. 
</p>
<p>50. Issues relating to gender, sexuality and sexual orientation, in relation to religion and 
morals, continue to be highly debated in connection with artistic expressions and creations. 
Artworks that are concerned range from those addressing the issue of love and romance, or 
representing or exposing nudity, to those resorting to pornography or certain forms of 
pornography. References to, or descriptions of, homosexual relationships in literature, 
music and visual arts are criminalized in several countries, or face particular censorship in 
some others. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the motivation of protecting 
children from certain content may be used to and lead to prohibited access for adults.25 She 
further stresses that according to some information, &#8220;despite widely publicized claims that 
adverse effects [of sexual or violent content on children] have been proven, the studies are 
ambiguous, disparate and modest in their results&#8221;.26 Arts education, together with education 
that teaches children how to interpret and critique media and entertainment messages, may 
be a far better and more effective solution than censorship.  
</p>
<p>51. The protection of corporate interests may also play an important role in art 
restrictions. Underlying motivations include the desire to silence criticism from artists of

<p>corporate activities, or to protect a specific logo or brand.27 Sponsors have also played a 
direct role in having artwork considered too controversial or not fitting their own interests 
to be removed from artistic competitions, television shows or magazines.  
</p>
<p>52. The aesthetic censorship of art,28 when artists are not free to choose their preferred 
style or to borrow from others, is a field which is often overlooked. Specific styles of music 
or visual arts are deemed to be political, and/or considered to carry a foreign ideology. The 
claim that such styles are devoid of any artistic merit has led, for example, to the banning 
of, or restrictions on, abstract or conceptual art. Artistic expressions specifically concerned 
can include musical systems or styles such as heavy metal music (described as &#8220;satanic&#8221;) or 
Reggae Ton and Dance Hall (criticized as demeaning of women).  
</p>
<p><b> D. Specific measures and practices impacting on the right to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>artistic expression 
</b></p>
<p>53. Restrictions can be imposed at various stages of the artistic creation, from the 
development of the idea through to production, performance, publication and distribution. 
Restrictions on artistic freedoms can result from oppressive laws and regulations, but can 
also be the outcome of a fear of physical or economic coercion.  
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned that artists in many parts of the world 
feel threatened or have been attacked by aggressive audiences. Violence includes 
assassinations, death threats, beating, burning of theatres and cinemas, blowing up of 
DVD/CD stores, and destruction of artworks or musical instruments. Artists have been 
accused of, and prosecuted for, incitement to violence when, in fact, aggressive individuals, 
groups or crowds, sometimes with the duplicity of local or foreign State authorities, were 
responsible for the incitement. Reactions to controversial artwork can be expressed through 
the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, but must never 
take the form of violence. The Special Rapporteur also regrets that in some cases, the police 
charged artists and cultural institutions to provide protection. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Laws and regulations 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Unclear regulations 
</i></p>
<p>55. Restrictions on artistic freedom are often implemented through unclear regulations 
or directives without legal basis. In too many cases, regulations are implemented without 
consistency by non-transparent mechanisms with no possibility of appeal. In the area of 
cinema or public art in particular, artists may be required to obtain additional permits from 
State and non-State, as well as official and non-official authorities, &#8220;giving influential 
parties and individuals the power to interfere and restrict freedom of expression&#8221;.29 
Difficulties multiply when overlapping laws and regulations are used to prevent public 
access to artworks.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur recalls that laws imposing restrictions &#8220;must be formulated 
with sufficient precision to enable an individual to regulate his/her conduct accordingly and

<p>it must be made accessible to the public. A law may not confer unfettered discretion for the 
restriction of freedom of expression on those charged with its execution. Laws must 
provide sufficient guidance to those charged with their execution to enable them to 
ascertain what sorts of expression are properly restricted and what sorts are not.&#8221;30  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Prior censorship  
</i></p>
<p>57. An important issue relates to the question of whether prior censorship, occurring 
before the production or publication of an artwork, such as movies and theatre plays or 
public art, for the purpose of &#8220;proscribing content, prohibiting its public presentation, 
and/or preventing its creators from working towards its realisation&#8221;,31 is in accordance with 
international human rights standards. As a matter of principle, a negative answer must be 
given, in line with the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion 
and expression, who considers that prior-censorship bodies &#8220;should not exist in any 
country&#8221;,32 and the view of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which 
considers that States must &#8220;abolish censorship of cultural activities in the arts and other 
forms of expression&#8221;.33  
</p>
<p>58. Article 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights clearly states that freedom 
of expression shall not be subject to prior censorship but only to subsequent imposition of 
liability. In its judgement regarding the controversial movie <i>The Last Temptation of Christ</i>, 
the Inter-American Court found a violation of article 13 for this reason. Article 13 further 
states that public entertainment may be subject by law to prior censorship for the sole 
purpose of regulating access to them for the moral protection of childhood and adolescence. 
Thus, under this provision, censorship is understood as &#8220;regulating access&#8221; by children and 
adolescents only, and exclusively in the area of public entertainment. Regulations take 
various forms, and it is important that States always choose the least restrictive measure 
possible.  
</p>
<p>59. Responses to the questionnaire indicate that a number of States have prohibited 
censorship or prior censorship in their constitutions, albeit sometimes with limited 
exceptions. Many countries do not have censorship bodies mandated to decide on possible 
restrictions on artworks. However, this does not mean that censorship is not imposed by 
executive authorities.34 Moreover, in practice, bodies not entrusted with the responsibility 
of censoring artworks sometimes function as censorship commissions, with no information 
on their membership, rules of procedure and activities, and no appeal mechanisms.35 
</p>
<p>60. Some States have established bodies authorized to issue distribution restrictions for 
the protection of children, in particular in the area of press, movies and entertainment 
software, while others have bodies mandated to overview electronic and print media, radio 
and television broadcasting, which also can have an impact on artistic freedoms.  
</p>
<p>61. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, prior censorship should be an exceptional 
measure, taken only to prevent the imminent threat of grave irreparable harm to human life 
or property. A system whereby content automatically requires official clearance before it 
can be released would be unacceptable, as its harm to freedom of artistic expression and

<p>creativity would by far outweigh the benefit of its goals.36 In countries where prior-
censorship bodies exist, the immediate abolition of these bodies should be envisaged, as 
regulating access for children and youth can best be implemented through rating and 
classification procedures.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Classification and rating 
</i></p>
<p>62. For some specific areas of artistic creativity, to the use of regulation, understood as 
&#8220;the disinterested classification of content according to publicly available guidelines&#8221;,37 
seems a better option. For example, one collective of artists has advocated for regulation 
instead of censorship in their country, and suggested the implementation of &#8220;a regulatory 
system that is user-friendly, transparent and accountable.&#8221;38 Regulation as classification 
includes greater freedom of expression, as works fitting in the highest rated category shall 
remain uncut except materials that are prohibited by a court of law in accordance with the 
law; accordingly, with such very limited exceptions, adults shall be able to have access to 
all artworks. Regulation as classification would also enable the public to make an informed 
decision about what they want to experience, or allow their children to experience; and 
setting clearer rules for all stakeholders.39 
</p>
<p>63. Classification bodies have been established in many countries to protect children 
from contents that are easily accessible by them, in particular movies, music and video 
games. These include private voluntary rating associations or self-regulatory bodies. In 
some States, it is clearly indicated that classification bodies may not order the deletion of 
specific scenes in movies, or that &#8220;adults should be able to read, hear and see what they 
want&#8221;. Some States have, however, retained a level of classification which leads to 
prohibition of content.  
</p>
<p>64. Such regulations constitute limitations and may be acceptable only to the extent that 
they fully comply with international standards. Classification and rating may be used as 
tools of oppression and should be used with care and transparency.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Regulation over the use of public space 
</i></p>
<p>65. To what extent may those engaged in artistic activity use public spaces to share their 
works? This concerns various kinds of artistic expressions and creations, from street theatre 
performances to graffiti, reciting poems or shooting films in open spaces, street dancing, to 
displaying commissioned visual art in city plazas and streets. A related question is the 
extent to which people may engage in &#8220;public art&#8221;, in reference to &#8220;artistic practices, which 
use locations outside of traditional art spaces for the production, exhibition, and mediation 
of art. (&#8230;) Often, pieces in public space critically deal with social and political issues, 
</p>
<p>which aim at stimulating discussions, propelling social interaction, inviting locals for 
participation in the conception and execution of the work, and finding alternative audiences 
with a broader range of spectators.&#8221;40 The use of public space for art is crucial as it allows 
people, including marginalized people, to freely access, enjoy and sometimes contribute to 
the arts, including in its most contemporary forms. In some cases, artistic expressions and

<p>creations are used in public spaces as a peaceful way of manifesting dissent or alternative 
viewpoints. 
</p>
<p>66. Several questions ensue: What is &#8220;public space&#8221; and to whom does it belong? Who 
should decide what is allowed, when, where and for how long? To what degree should the 
public have a say, in particular locals who may be subjected to sounds and images that they 
dislike in their daily environment? Why should artistic expression be given less space than, 
for example, advertising?  
</p>
<p>67. In this area, States&#8217; practices vary significantly. Responses to the questionnaire 
indicate that regulations relating to public assemblies, level of noise, the respect due to 
historic buildings or private property, are applicable to artists as to other persons, and are 
frequently managed by local authorities, or the police. Consequently, situations may vary 
considerably within a country. Prior authorization is generally required. The response to 
non-authorized street visual and performing art can be ignored by the authorities, dealt with 
leniency or may be systematically prosecuted for administrative or criminal offences. Some 
cities have initiated innovative procedures, such as &#8220;space reservation&#8221; on particular days of 
the month.41  </p>
<p>68. People engaged in creative activities encounter manifold difficulties, including (a) 
the bureaucracy&#8217;s reluctance and tardiness in granting free use of public spaces; (b) 
arbitrariness in the granting of permits and requirements to obtain multiple authorizations 
from various authorities; (c) censorship over content before authorization is granted; (d) 
inadequate or abusive licensing systems for street performers and live entertainment;42 and 
(e) increasing encroachment of public space by private properties.  
</p>
<p><i> (e) Restrictions on mobility  
</i></p>
<p>69. Travel restrictions include the retention of artists&#8217; passports to impede their 
travelling abroad, as well as restrictions on the issuance of visas and work permits, which 
affect artists&#8217; options to perform and audiences&#8217; possibilities to access artistic expressions 
and creations. Many tour, concert and festival organizers, agents, management companies, 
cultural organizations and others, when organizing concerts and tours of foreign artists, face 
non-transparent, time-consuming and costly application procedures to obtain a visa. Some 
festivals have stopped inviting artists from particular countries owing to the unpredictable 
nature of their visa application procedures.43 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Economic and financial issues 
</b></p>
<p>70. Responses to the questionnaire indicate that many States have adopted various ways 
of supporting the arts, including financial support to cultural institutions or artistic projects, 
bursaries, prizes and support for training and international exchange. However, many 
stakeholders stress that the main impediments artists encounter in their work relate to their 
precarious economic and social situation. The current financial crisis has led to severe cuts 
in public spending, resulting in great unemployment amongst artists, the closure of art 
institutions, and a shift towards private sponsorship. In their responses to the questionnaire, 
some stakeholders stressed the absence of or a reduced market in their country. One

<p>challenge for artists is to enjoy freedom including from their sponsors, whether State or 
private.  </p>
<p><i> (a) Restricted access to State support and cuts in financial support 
</i></p>
<p>71. State cultural policies need to take artistic freedoms into consideration, in particular 
when establishing criteria for selecting artists or institutions for State support, the bodies in 
charge of allocating grants, as well as their terms of reference and rules of procedure. The 
system in place can help to avoid undue government influence on the arts.  
</p>
<p>72. Reconciling public intervention and freedom is not an easy task. The pivotal factor 
is ensuring that the system as a whole is neutral. In this regard, policies developed on the 
basis of a &#8220;principle of pluralism&#8221; may be worth exploring as a good practice.44 The &#8220;arm&#8217;s 
length principle&#8221;, whereby independent experts, in particular peers, are mandated for a 
limited time period to allocate funds and grants, also seems a good guarantee against undue 
political influence. Another way of supporting the arts without interference with regard to 
content is through improving the social status of artists, in particular their social security, 
which seems a widely shared concern amongst them.  
</p>
<p>73. Criticism over publicly funded artworks made by Government, Parliament, or any 
group, remains part of the debate. However, financial cuts and harsh criticism against 
cultural institutions or specific artworks may also be a cover for censorship.45 As one 
observer stresses, &#8220;When state authorities threaten to withdraw financial support from 
certain cultural institutions while giving preference to others whose political views are 
closer to their own, they are engaging in a violation of freedom of speech.&#8221;46 
</p>
<p><i> (b) </i>&#8220;<i>Market censorship</i>&#8221; </p>
<p>74. Private art institutions may enable critical, unconventional, controversial and &#8220;avant-
garde&#8221; art works to be displayed or performed. However, the adverse consequences on 
artistic freedoms of the increasing weight of corporate sponsorship need to be assessed. 
Cultural producers and artists refer to the existence of a &#8220;censorship by the market&#8221;, arising 
in particular when cultural industries are basically market-oriented, public funding is under 
pressure and alternative distribution is minimal. 
</p>
<p>75. The following are of particular concern: (a) corporation consolidation within all 
branches of cultural production, which frequently results in <i>de facto</i> monopolistic control; 
and (b) the incorporation of media, arts and entertainment holdings into corporate empires, 
and their impact on artistic freedoms and on people&#8217;s access to the arts.47 Whole chains of 
production of artworks, in particular in the area of music and movies, are controlled from 
creation to distribution by particular corporations. Companies may have control over 
bookstores, concert halls and cinemas. This may lead to situations where, for example, 
music bands&#8217; protests against war plans resulted in their songs being removed from 
</p>
<p>hundreds of radio stations controlled by a media conglomerate, very large consumer 
retailers censoring any CD labelled &#8220;Parental Advisory&#8221;, and musicians and record 
companies agreeing to create a &#8220;sanitized&#8221; version of lyrics for particular megastores. The 
recent refusal by a major private digital distributor to publish an e-book containing several 
photographs of nude hippies is another example.48 The drastic reduction in the number of 
independent book and music stores in comparison to chain and megastores, which &#8220;have

<p>vast advertising budgets at their disposal, enormous sales forces, and an extremely efficient 
network of press contacts&#8221;, is worrisome. Financial and marketing strategies often drive the 
decision to publish a specific book or not.49  
</p>
<p>76. A current tendency is for States to co-fund with corporate sponsors. While some 
artists and arts organizations call for legislation enabling private (and corporate) 
sponsorship of the arts, others fear a reduced scope for contemporary, experimental and 
provocative artistic expressions. States should ensure that, in the process, the arts and artists 
do not become mere advertisers of corporate interests.50 
</p>
<p>77. Artists&#8217; autonomy can only be guaranteed through diversity of funding and a good 
balance between public and private sponsorship, both of which may open space for artistic 
creation. States should not monopolize funding of the arts but cannot leave sponsorship 
entirely to corporations. Corporations tend to show little interest in funding alternative 
cultural spaces or institutions and prioritize funding high-profile programmes such as 
blockbuster exhibitions.51  
</p>
<p>78. These issues are complex and need to be urgently addressed. While it is important to 
ensure producers and distributors are free to select what to support or promote, strategies 
are needed to ensure that artists not fitting market strategies may still make their voices 
heard. This underscores the importance of the 2005 UNESCO Convention, which affirmed 
the right of Parties to introduce cultural policies and measures to support the creation, 
production and distribution of local cultural goods and services. Some stress, however, that 
support provided to local productions sometimes does not enable a clear added value, and 
that what is actually subsidized does not really differ from what the private market may 
offer. </p>
<p><i> (c) The protection of the moral and material interests of artists and authors 
</i></p>
<p>79. One way of silencing artists is to impede their livelihood options as professionals in 
a career devoted to artistic creations. According to article 27 of the UDHR and 15 of 
ICESCR, all individuals have the right to benefit from the protection of the moral and 
material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which s/he 
is the author. As stressed by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its 
General Comment 17, the protection of these interests is not to be equated with legal 
entitlements recognized in intellectual property systems.  
</p>
<p>80. While the Special Rapporteur understands the concern that piracy and file sharing 
may threaten the potential of artists to earn their living, she also stresses the need to 
acknowledge the percentage of royalties that go to publishing houses/copyright holders 
rather than to the artists themselves. Concern has been expressed about coercive contracts 
that authors and artists identify as a primary obstacle to fair remuneration. Under such 
contracts, which are frequent, creators sign away all their rights to their creation in order to 
gain a commission for creating a work. Consequently, they lose control over their creation, 
which can be used in contradiction to their own vision.

<p>81. In a number of countries, non-profit collective societies, with a majority of board 
members being artists, have been established to collect the income from artistic 
creations/performances. This system, under which collective societies do not own the 
artists&#8217; rights, and in which the artist has the freedom to participate or not, should be 
promoted and protected.  
</p>
<p>82. A highly debated issue is whether the moral rights and copyright systems have 
evolved in such a manner that the balance between the rights of authors and artists on the 
one hand, and the need to promote creativity and access to culture on the other, is no longer 
achieved. Some observers stress that spaces within those systems that allow &#8220;certain free 
uses of work&#8221;, 52 are shrinking.53 Others consider that strengthening moral rights would help 
to promote such free uses of work. This debate is particularly vivid in the world of hip-
hop/rap culture, where sampling is an art in itself,54 but also concerns other areas of 
contemporary art.55 The challenge is to find flexible solutions, which neither infringe on 
artists&#8217; moral right nor the fair interests of remuneration for publishers but, at the same 
</p>
<p>time, respect the right of artists to &#8220;quote&#8221; or refer to other artists&#8217; productions.  
</p>
<p>83. Another concern relates to the pressure exerted by entertainment and media 
companies to impose their ownership on material that is part of shared cultural heritage, 
though demanding the extension of the duration of the period of copyright, which they have 
obtained in some countries. The Bern Convention states that all works except photographic 
and cinematographic shall be copyright for at least 50 years after the author's death, but 
authorizes longer terms. The limitation of material in the public domain and the narrowing 
of possibilities of free use may fly &#8220;directly in the face of contemporary art practices&#8221;.56  
</p>
<p>84. One additional concern is that on all these issues, artists are reluctant to enter into 
lengthy and costly judicial proceedings against corporations, which in turn can be a 
deterrent to artistic creativity.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusion and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>All persons enjoy the right to freedom of artistic expression and creativity, 
which includes the right to freely experience and contribute to artistic expressions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>creations, through individual or joint practice, to have access to and enjoy the arts, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to disseminate their expressions and creations.</b>57  
</p>
<p>86. <b>The effects of art censorship or unjustified restrictions of the right to freedom 
of artistic expression and creativity are devastating. They generate important cultural, 
</b></p>
<p><b>social and economic losses, deprive artists of their means of expression and livelihood, 
</b></p>
<p><b>create an unsafe environment for all those engaged in the arts and their audiences, 
</b></p>
<p><b>sterilize debates on human, social and political issues, hamper the functioning of 
</b></p>
<p><b>democracy and most often also impede debates on the legitimacy of censorship itself.
 </b> 
</p>
<p>87. <b>In many cases, censorship is counterproductive in that it gives wider publicity 
to controversial artworks. However, the fear censorship generates in artists and art 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions often leads to self-censorship, which stifles art expression and 
</b></p>

<p><b>impoverishes the public sphere.</b>58<b> Artistic creativity demands an environment free 
</b></p>
<p><b>from fear and insecurity. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon States to review critically their legislation 
and practices imposing restrictions on the right to freedom of artistic expression and 
</b></p>
<p><b>creativity, taking into consideration relevant international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p><b>provisions and in cooperation with representatives of independent associations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>artists and human rights organizations. The full array of States obligations to respect, 
</b></p>
<p><b>protect and fulfil the right of every person to freedom of artistic expression and 
</b></p>
<p><b>creativity should be considered for this exercise.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Artists and all those engaged in artistic activities should only be subject 
</b></p>
<p><b>to general laws that apply to all people. Such laws shall be formulated with sufficient 
</b></p>
<p><b>precision and in accordance with international human rights standards. They shall be 
</b></p>
<p><b>made easily accessible to the public, and implemented with transparency, consistency 
</b></p>
<p><b>and in a non-discriminatory manner. Decisions on restrictions should clearly indicate 
</b></p>
<p><b>motives and be subject to appeal before a court of law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) States should abolish prior-censorship bodies or systems where they exist 
</b></p>
<p><b>and use subsequent imposition of liability only when necessary under article 19 (3) 
</b></p>
<p><b>and 20 of ICCPR. Such liability should be imposed exclusively by a court of law. Prior 
</b></p>
<p><b>censorship should be a highly exceptional measure, undertaken only to prevent the 
</b></p>
<p><b>imminent threat of grave irreparable harm to human life or property. Avenues for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>appeal before an independent entity of any decision to exercise prior restraint should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be guaranteed; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Classification bodies or procedures may be resorted to for the sole 
</b></p>
<p><b>purpose of informing parents and regulating unsupervised access by children to 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular content, and only in the areas of artistic creation where this is strictly 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary due in particular to easy access by children. States shall ensure that (a) 
</b></p>
<p><b>classification bodies are independent; (b) their membership includes representatives 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the arts field; (c) their terms of reference, rules of procedure and activities are 
</b></p>
<p><b>made public; and (d) effective appeal mechanisms are established. Particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>attention should be paid to ensuring that the regulation of access by children does not 
</b></p>
<p><b>result in prohibiting or disproportionately restricting access for adults; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Decision makers, including judges, when resorting to possible limitations 
</b></p>
<p><b>to artistic freedoms, should take into consideration the nature of artistic creativity (as 
</b></p>
<p><b>opposed to its value or merit), as well as the right of artists to dissent, to use political, 
</b></p>
<p><b>religious and economic symbols as a counter-discourse to dominant powers, and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>express their own belief and world vision. The use of the imaginary and fiction must 
</b></p>
<p><b>be understood and respected as a crucial element of the freedom indispensable for 
</b></p>
<p><b>creative activities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) States should abide by their obligation to protect artists and all persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>participating in artistic activities or dissemination of artistic expressions and creations 
</b></p>
<p><b>from violence by third parties. States should de-escalate tensions when these arise, 
</b></p>
<p><b>maintain the rule of law and protect artistic freedoms. The police should not charge 
</b></p>
<p><b>artists and cultural institutions for the costs of their protection; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) States should address issues regarding the use of public space for artistic 
</b></p>
<p><b>performances or displays. Regulation of public art may be acceptable where it 
</b></p>
<p>  
 58  Svetlana Mintcheva, &#8220;Symbols into soldiers&#8230;&#8221;, p. 2. </p>


<p><b>conflicts with other public uses of the space, but such regulation should not 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminate arbitrarily against specific artists or content. Cultural events deserve the 
</b></p>
<p><b>same level of protection as political protests. States, private institutions and donors 
</b></p>
<p><b>are encouraged to find creative solutions so as to enable artists to display or perform 
</b></p>
<p><b>in public space, through, for example, offering open spaces to artists. Where relevant, 
</b></p>
<p><b>in particular for permanent visual artworks, States should facilitate dialogue and 
</b></p>
<p><b>understanding with the local communities; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) States should review their visa issuance system and adjust it to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific difficulties encountered by touring artists, their host organizations and tour 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) States should ensure the participation of representatives of independent 
</b></p>
<p><b>associations of artists in decision-making related to art, and refrain from nominating 
</b></p>
<p><b>or appointing cultural administrators or directors of cultural institutions on the basis 
</b></p>
<p><b>of their political, religious or corporate affiliation. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that States and other stakeholders assess 
and address more comprehensively restrictions to artistic freedoms imposed by 
</b></p>
<p><b>corporations, as well as the impact on artistic freedoms of aggressive market strategies 
</b></p>
<p><b>and situations of monopolies or quasi-monopolies in the area of media and culture. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The support provided to cultural industries should be revisited from the perspective 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the right to artistic freedom. The Special Rapporteur recommends in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>that States: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Enact and/or implement anti-trust legislation and legislation against 
</b></p>
<p><b>monopolies in the area of media and culture; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Support securing the survival of independent bookstores, music stores 
</b></p>
<p><b>and cinemas threatened by megastores, multiplexes and global distributors; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that measures established to support private sponsorship of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>arts do not negatively impact on artistic freedoms; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Establish a clear national legal framework prohibiting coercive contracts 
</b></p>
<p><b>under which creators sign away their rights to their creation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Support the establishment of non-profit collective societies mandated to 
</b></p>
<p><b>collect and distribute income from artistic creations and performances, with a 
</b></p>
<p><b>majority of artists sitting on their board; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Encourage initiatives to support free legal representation for artists or 
</b></p>
<p><b>other forms of legal aid; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Assess and address comprehensively the impact of current intellectual 
</b></p>
<p><b>property rights regimes, </b>especially of copyrights and authors&#8217; rights, <b>on artistic 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedoms;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Fully support artistic creativity and the establishment of cultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutions accessible to all. Public agencies should function as a financial backup for 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes that do not attract corporate sponsors, based on the understanding that 
</b></p>
<p><b>they cannot interfere with contents. Various systems of State support can be 
</b></p>
<p><b>envisaged, including delegating decisions on funding to independent peer-review 
</b></p>
<p><b>bodies, which should act in conformity with transparent terms of reference and rules 
</b></p>
<p>of procedure. These bodies&#8217; decisions should be motivated and subject to appeal;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Fully implement the UNESCO Recommendation Concerning the Status 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the Artist; </b></p>


<p><b>(j) Develop and enhance arts education in schools and communities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>instilling respect for, appreciation and understanding of artistic creativity, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>evolving concepts of acceptability, awakening the ability to be artistically creative. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Arts education should give students a historical perspective of the constant evolution 
</b></p>
<p><b>of mentalities on what is acceptable and what is controversial.  
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that national human rights institutions 
and non-governmental organizations: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Document more systematically violations of the right to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>artistic expression and creativity;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Submit their findings to relevant national and international bodies, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights Committee; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Support artists who are threatened through in particular legal support. </b></p>
