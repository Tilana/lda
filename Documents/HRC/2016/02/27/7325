</p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twenty-first session 
</p>
<p>from 19 to 30 January 2015. The review of Kuwait was held at the 16th meeting on 28 
</p>
<p>January 2015. The delegation of Kuwait was headed by Hend Subaih Al-Subaih, Minister 
</p>
<p>of Social Affairs and Labour/Minister of State for Planning and Development. At its 18th 
</p>
<p>meeting, held on 30 January 2015, the Working Group adopted the report on Kuwait. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Kuwait: Bolivia (Plurinational State of), India 
</p>
<p>and South Africa. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
</p>
<p>Kuwait: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation prepared in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/21/KWT/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/21/KWT/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/KWT/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, 
</p>
<p>Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom of 
</p>
<p>Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Kuwait through the troika. These 
</p>
<p>questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Minister of Social Affairs and Labour/Minister of State for Planning and 
</p>
<p>Development stated that, although basic principles of human rights were enshrined in the 
</p>
<p>Constitution and laws issued for its implementation, UPR recommendations had led to 
</p>
<p>progress in that field. Kuwait considered the interactive dialogue to be a process for 
</p>
<p>exchanging views that could reinforce mutual understanding with the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>6. The Minister highlighted that, in seeking to follow up on its international human 
</p>
<p>rights obligations and commitments, Kuwait had established a standing committee to 
</p>
<p>prepare all national reports on human rights and supervise the follow-up. The second 
</p>
<p>national report had been prepared by all government agencies, in coordination with civil 
</p>
<p>society and non-profit organizations. 
</p>
<p>7. Since the previous review in 2010, Kuwait had established national mechanisms for 
</p>
<p>the promotion and protection of human rights. The National Assembly&#8217;s Committee for the 
</p>
<p>Defence of Human Rights was one of them. The Government had drawn up a bill to 
</p>
<p>establish an independent human rights institution in accordance with the Paris Principles 
</p>
<p>and also drafted three bills emanating from the voluntary pledges or UPR recommendations 
</p>
<p>received in 2010. Those bills were related to the rights of the child, the establishment of a 
</p>
<p>Family Court, and juveniles.  </p>


<p>4<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>8. Kuwait attached great importance to women&#8217;s rights and their protection. 
</p>
<p>Participation by Kuwaiti women in the labour market had increased during 2010&#8211;2013 to 
</p>
<p>51 per cent in the private sector and 45 per cent in the government sector. The proportion of 
</p>
<p>women in senior posts in both sectors had reached 20 per cent. The principle of equal pay 
</p>
<p>between men and women for work of equal value in the private sector had been established. 
</p>
<p>Employment of women in the judiciary was approved, while it had previously been limited 
</p>
<p>to men only.  
</p>
<p>9. A new law on public assistance had been promulgated in 2011, ensuring better 
</p>
<p>standards of living for members of society, especially those in low-income groups such as 
</p>
<p>Kuwaiti women married to limited-income non-Kuwaiti men, as well as women over 
</p>
<p>55 years of age with no income, and married students. Furthermore, Act No. 2/2011 had 
</p>
<p>introduced amendments to the Housing Welfare Act. Housing requests from Kuwaiti 
</p>
<p>women married to non-Kuwaiti men after they obtained citizenship were now taken into 
</p>
<p>account, and they were also granted housing loans by the Kuwait Credit Bank. 
</p>
<p>10. In its Development Plan 2015/2016&#8211;2019/2020, Kuwait had included objectives for 
</p>
<p>the empowerment of women by reviewing legislation and suppressing discrimination 
</p>
<p>against them through a joint committee of representatives from civil society institutions.  
</p>
<p>11. The Constitution considered the protection of children to be a fundamental social 
</p>
<p>principle, through which the integrity of the family was preserved and its ties strengthened 
</p>
<p>(art. 9). The State was obligated to protect children from exploitation and from moral, 
</p>
<p>physical, and spiritual neglect (art. 10). 
</p>
<p>12. In the light of the above, Kuwait had decided to raise the standard of living of 
</p>
<p>children by issuing the new Public Assistance Act No. 12/2011 and decree No. 23/2013 
</p>
<p>concerning entitlement to public assistance, and to provide a suitable environment for 
</p>
<p>children to prepare them for pre-public education, through the Private Cr&#232;ches Act 
</p>
<p>No. 22/2014.  
</p>
<p>13. Kuwait was a country that attracted foreign workers. Their number was constantly 
</p>
<p>increasing and had exceeded 1.496 million. In total, foreign workers amounted up to more 
</p>
<p>than two-thirds of the population, representing more than 164 different nationalities. 
</p>
<p>Kuwait had made sure during the review of its labour regulations that the new Private 
</p>
<p>Sector Employment Act No. 6/2010 included more rights and legal safeguards for workers. 
</p>
<p>14. In that context, the Public Manpower Authority had been established under Act 
</p>
<p>No. 109/2013. This authority had the exclusive responsibility of bringing over foreign 
</p>
<p>workers based on employers&#8217; requests to facilitate their transition and mitigate the influence 
</p>
<p>of the employers on them. Furthermore, a permanent shelter had been inaugurated to house 
</p>
<p>foreign workers facing labour disputes.  
</p>
<p>15. Kuwait was determined to provide a decent life for illegal residents, through various 
</p>
<p>legislation and procedures. The Central Agency for Regularization of the Status of Illegal 
</p>
<p>Residents had been established by Amiri Decree No. 467/201. Ministerial Decision 
</p>
<p>No. 409/2011 concerning the provision of facilities and services for illegal residents 
</p>
<p>provided for their access to medical treatment, education, the issuance of official 
</p>
<p>documents, such as birth and death certificates, marriage and divorce certificates, 
</p>
<p>succession certificates, passports, driving licences, ration cards and employment. Act 
</p>
<p>No. 8/2010 concerning the rights of persons with disabilities applied to illegal residents 
</p>
<p>without discrimination or exclusion. Illegal residents were entitled to housing welfare and 
</p>
<p>social services. They also had the right to seek legal redress and enjoy public freedoms. 
</p>
<p>16. For dissemination of the culture of human rights, a legislative amendment had been 
</p>
<p>made to the law of the Constitutional Court, which had opened the way for citizens to 
</p>
<p>directly address the Court to challenge the constitutionality of laws. In the education sector, </p>


<p><b> </b>5 
</p>
<p>human rights curricula were taught in both the general and higher education segments. 
</p>
<p>Teachers were receiving training in the domain and were regularly updated on human rights 
</p>
<p>issues, and provided with the Human Rights Education Manual.  
</p>
<p>17. Employees in the judiciary and law enforcement, as well as prison supervisors were 
</p>
<p>trained with international organizations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had also included 
</p>
<p>in its development plan a major project that sought to consolidate the concepts and values 
</p>
<p>of human rights, through specialized training courses in collaboration with local and 
</p>
<p>international agencies.  
</p>
<p>18. Kuwait remained firmly committed to submitting its periodic reports to treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies. Since the previous UPR in 2010, Kuwait had submitted reports to the Committee 
</p>
<p>against Torture (CAT), the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women (CEDAW), the Human Rights Committee (HR Committee), the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and 
</p>
<p>the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, its third periodic 
</p>
<p>report had been submitted to HR Committee in November 2014. In 2015, Kuwait would be 
</p>
<p>submitting its third periodic report to CAT in June, its fifth and sixth periodic reports to 
</p>
<p>CEDAW in October, and its first periodic report to the Committee on the Rights of Persons 
</p>
<p>with Disabilities.in September. 
</p>
<p>19. Kuwait had welcomed the request by the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
</p>
<p>of slavery, its causes and consequences to visit the country during January&#8211;March. Kuwait 
</p>
<p>had also welcomed the visit of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>the right to freedom of opinion and expression. However, owing to internal commitments 
</p>
<p>related to the country&#8217;s presidency of the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit, the Arab 
</p>
<p>Summit, and the African-Arab Summit, the visit had not taken place. The Permanent 
</p>
<p>Mission in Geneva would take the necessary measures to agree with the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on a date for the visit. 
</p>
<p>20. Kuwait had established consistent principles for providing humanitarian assistance 
</p>
<p>to peoples of disaster-stricken countries and to poor nations. It had relied on guiding 
</p>
<p>instruments that could assess the real humanitarian needs of those countries, bearing in 
</p>
<p>mind that human rights issues could not be divided. This philosophy was summarized by 
</p>
<p>His Highness the Amir when he said that since gaining its independence, the State of 
</p>
<p>Kuwait had followed a consistent approach in its foreign policy, based essentially on the 
</p>
<p>need to render humanitarian assistance to all needy countries, regardless of their geographic 
</p>
<p>location, religious beliefs or ethnic composition, in keeping with its firm faith in 
</p>
<p>international partnership and the importance of activating global efforts to maintain and 
</p>
<p>preserve the quintessence of life itself, namely the human spirit. 
</p>
<p>21. Kuwait had spared no effort to ease the humanitarian crisis. For that reasons, His 
</p>
<p>Highness the Amir had accepted the appeal of the Secretary-General to host the third donor 
</p>
<p>conference to assist the Syrian people in Kuwait on 31 March 2015. It should be recalled 
</p>
<p>that Kuwait had not hesitated to accept the requests of the United Nations to host the 
</p>
<p>previous two donor conferences for the relief of the Syrian people, in 2013 and 2014. The 
</p>
<p>international community had succeeded on those occasions in raising a total of 3.9 billion 
</p>
<p>dollars, of which 800 million dollars had been contributed by Kuwait and paid in full to the 
</p>
<p>United Nations relief bodies. 
</p>
<p>22. Accordingly, as a token of the international community&#8217;s appreciation for the 
</p>
<p>important humanitarian role of Kuwait, His Highness the Amir was granted the title of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;humanitarian leader&#8221; by the Secretary-General on 9 September 2014, and Kuwait was 
</p>
<p>henceforth considered to be a &#8220;humanitarian hub&#8221;. In parallel, His Highness the Amir had 
</p>
<p>also been granted awards and certificates of appreciation by many international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian organizations, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner </p>


<p>6<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
</p>
<p>Affairs (UNOCHA), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF). 
</p>
<p>23. The Minister underscored that Kuwait would tirelessly pursue its endeavours to 
</p>
<p>further promote human rights, in accordance with its national plans and objectives and its 
</p>
<p>Arab and Islamic heritage. The Minister then invited members of the delegation to 
</p>
<p>elaborate on some specific issues. 
</p>
<p>24. The delegation indicated that Kuwait had taken a number of measures to guarantee 
</p>
<p>the rights of women. Article 9 of the Constitution stipulated that the family was the prime 
</p>
<p>entity of society, and article 29 referred to equality between men and women. There was no 
</p>
<p>discrimination on the grounds of race, origin, language or religion. All of those rights were 
</p>
<p>protected by the establishment of the Constitutional Court. Kuwait had also promulgated a 
</p>
<p>number of laws aimed at the protection of women from violence. The Penal Code contained 
</p>
<p>provisions which criminalized violence against women and considered it under aggravating 
</p>
<p>circumstances. The Personal Status Code guaranteed the right of women to request a 
</p>
<p>divorce on the grounds of harm and their right to custody, pension and housing. 
</p>
<p>25. The Government had submitted to Parliament a bill of law on the establishment of a 
</p>
<p>family court, whereby a Family Court would be established in every governorate in order to 
</p>
<p>resolve conflicts within a family. A fund had been set up under the Ministry of Justice to 
</p>
<p>provide assistance to women and wives or divorced women and children as necessary. A 
</p>
<p>department within the Ministry of Interior provided counselling and assistance in the case 
</p>
<p>of domestic violence. The labour codes required equal pay for equal work. Kuwait had been 
</p>
<p>endeavouring to provide a preponderance of places to women in civil service, military, 
</p>
<p>judiciary and diplomatic services. Kuwait had also been ensuring that the State 
</p>
<p>Development Plan for the coming years would guarantee the rights of women. 
</p>
<p>26. With regard to the question of illegal residents, the delegation stated that it was not 
</p>
<p>limited to Kuwait. However, unlike other countries, Kuwait provided them with many 
</p>
<p>services, which were equivalent to those given to its citizens. &#8220;Illegal resident&#8221; was the 
</p>
<p>term used in Decree No. 467/2010. Those residents had contravened the Kuwaiti Residence 
</p>
<p>of Aliens Act No. 17 of 1959 by applying for Kuwaiti citizenship while concealing their 
</p>
<p>passports. In order to address the situation, a roadmap had been adopted by the Council of 
</p>
<p>Ministers. 
</p>
<p>27. Those who applied for regularization of their situation would not be prevented from 
</p>
<p>applying for Kuwaiti citizenship. A full review of the files of some of those illegal 
</p>
<p>residents, who were eligible for Kuwaiti citizenship in line with the Citizenship Law, would 
</p>
<p>be conducted. The roadmap also indicated that their situation would be regularized, 
</p>
<p>passports issued, and free residency in the country for a period of five years granted, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with Act No. 17 of 1959.  
</p>
<p>28. Over the previous four years, around 6,325 persons had regularized their situation 
</p>
<p>and been issued with passports. The Council of Ministers had issued Decision 
</p>
<p>No. 409/2011, whereby those persons would be provided with services and facilities for 
</p>
<p>decent living conditions. They had been accepted for enrolment in higher education 
</p>
<p>institutions and their children were exempted from presenting the necessary documents for 
</p>
<p>enrolment in schools. The costs were being covered by the Charitable Fund. Children of 
</p>
<p>illegal residents were issued with birth certificates and all other personal status documents. 
</p>
<p>They were provided with ration cards and entitled to a driving licence. There were also 
</p>
<p>other measures, such as social insurance, health insurance and housing benefits. 
</p>
<p>29. The delegation stated that the Constitution guaranteed the freedom of opinion, 
</p>
<p>expression, the press and peaceful assembly. That included discussions on the social media 
</p>
<p>and internet. Kuwait had eliminated obstacles to freedom of opinion in the publication and </p>


<p><b> </b>7 
</p>
<p>audiovisual media, including prohibition of any prior censorship of the press. The police 
</p>
<p>provided the security of demonstrations, in accordance with article 49 of the Constitution, 
</p>
<p>which guaranteed observance of public order and respect for public morals. That did not go 
</p>
<p>beyond the framework of article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights (ICCPR). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review
