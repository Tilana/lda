The President’s Statement
Stronger and more attractive
after a record year
Few years in Boliden’s history have
been more eventful than 2004.
Our first year as new Boliden has
included two new rights issues, a
refinancing and a streamlining of
operations, and the simultaneous
launch of a comprehensive and
successful process of integration.
These measures, coupled with
rising metal prices, have helped
to transform new Boliden into a
stronger company with a better
balance sheet and increased po-
tential to take advantage of inter-
nal and external opportunities for
growth.
A stronger company with every possibility
of becoming one of the world’s leading
producers of zinc and copper. That is the
picture for new Boliden after a record
year for both results and major changes.
We are already Europe’s leading company
in our sector, and the measures that we
have implemented during the past year
have enabled us to lay a solid base for
continued growth.
Even when we completed the structural
deal with Outokumpu, whereby we com-
bined our mining and smelting holdings,
we knew that the new company would
have world class skills and assets. New
Boliden’s first year has not only shown that
we were correct in this belief but, in add-
ition, that the coordination benefits that
we initially envisaged may well turn out
to be even greater than anticipated.
We are also pleased to announce that the
integration between the various units has
gone smoothly and with a total absence of
personal prestige to hamper the work –
due largely, of course, to the positive re-
sponse to the changes among our staff.
The copper smelters in Harjavalta and
Rönnskär, which are already – for all prac-
tical purposes – functioning as a single
unit, is a prime example of this attitude.
Financial successes
We have, in principle, achieved all of the
goals that we set out for the new com-
pany’s first year of operations. We have
completed two successful new rights issues;
which were among the biggest in Sweden
that year. Both were oversubscribed.
The rights issues not only strengthened
our balance sheet, they also allowed us to
achieve our goal of broadening the owner-
ship base with a number of major new
international investors. Futhermore, they
enabled us to increase the liquidity of our
share – turnover in the Boliden share has
quadrupled. At the same time, our biggest
owner, Outokumpu, has reduced its hold-
ing from around 49 percent to approxi-
mately 16 percent.
The refinancing of Boliden’s loans was
another important event last year. The
tough loan conditions that Boliden was
forced to accept in conjunction with the
financial crisis that the company suffered
in 2000 and 2001 have burdened oper-
ations during the past few years. The refin-
ancing of loans for a total of EUR 840
million, which was completed in October
2004, has led to a normalisation of the
loan conditions. This will allow, among
other things, the payment of a share divi-
dend to our shareholders in the future. 
Boliden’s successful currency hedging,
whereby a significant part of our dollar
sales were hedged at a high level, was yet
another positive factor in the financial
sphere, counteracting the weakening of
the US dollar against the krona and the
euro during the year.
Operational successes
This was also a successful year in an oper-
ational sense. The Business Area Mining
Operations increased the production of
concentrate for the majority of metals
that Boliden produces – mainly zinc,
lead and gold – in comparison with
2003. The sale of the Canadian mine,
Myra Falls, was completed in July, and
Boliden’s operations are hence now con-
centrated in northern Europe. The sale 
is just one example of the operational
streamlining currently taking place.
Production at the smelters developed
positively in 2004, with both the Rönn-
skär copper smelter and the Kokkola zinc
smelter reporting production records,
while Harjavalta reported high levels of
copper production. The Odda zinc smel-
ter was modernised and is now one of the
most modern zinc smelters in the world.
The Bergsöe lead smelter achieved a re-
cord result in 2004, despite slightly lower
production levels than last year.

“We have, in principle,
achieved all of the goals
that we set for the new
company’s first year of
operations.”
The planned sale of this smelter was halted
in January 2005 and Bergsöe will hence-
forth be integrated into the Production
Area Copper.
One of Boliden’s strengths is the balance
between our zinc mining and smelting
operations, which allows us to produce
metal from our own concentrate. The
balance also has positive effects on the
company’s long-term profitability as we
earn money at more stages of the econo-
mic cycle – we have a natural hedge against
changes in treatment charges and receive
the full benefit of changes in metal prices.
We are also striving to increase the
balance between mining and smelting
operations for copper. Last year, for
example, we improved the availability of
copper concentrate for the copper smelters
through the long-term partnership agree-
ment signed with the Canadian mining
company EuroZinc Mining Corporation
for deliveries of copper concentrate from
the Portuguese Neves Corvo mine.
Positive market trend
The formation of new Boliden occurred
at an advantageous point in the business
cycle, something which has provided a real
boost for the new company. Metal price
trends were extremely healthy during the
last year after a number of years of falling
prices. Substantial price increases for cop-
per, lead, silver and gold were followed
during the latter half of the year by a rise
in the price of zinc. Global consumption
of copper and zinc increased faster than
production, and stocks have fallen accord-
ingly. Copper stocks are currently at critic-
ally low levels, while zinc stocks did not
start to decline until the end of 2004. 
The volume of copper concentrate in
the market increased in 2004, causing a
rise in spot treatment charges. Boliden,
which is a net purchaser of copper con-
centrate, benefits from high treatment
charges.
The positive trend in the metals market
is driven by a strong demand from Asia
in general and China in particular, where
industrial production grew by a massive
16 percent in 2004. The growth is strong-
est in transport and infrastructure – two
sectors that consume large volumes of
copper and zinc.
In the USA, industrial production rose
by 4.5 percent, and this, too, helped
increase demand, while the correspond-
ing figure for Europe was a modest 1.7
percent.
The future and financial goals
We see no signs, as yet, of a slowing down
in last year’s positive metals market trend.
The combination of operational improve-
ments, increased synergy benefits, current
6
The President’s Statement
metal prices and rising treatment charges
are expected, by and large, to outweigh
the effects of the ongoing weakness of the
US dollar.
Accordingly, we anticipate further
strong results in 2005, and expect a sub-
stantial improvement in the non-restricted
cash flow.
“Boliden aims to deliver
added value for its 
shareholders – both
through growth in value
and through yield.”
In 2004, Boliden’s Board of Directors
set new financial goals for the operations.
One of the overriding goals is for Boliden
to deliver added value for its shareholders
– both through growth in value and
through yield. The target for return on
capital employed is to exceed 10 percent
over a business cycle. The net debt/equity
ratio goal is 0.50-0.75. The Board also
decided to set a goal of paying a dividend
as of the 2005 fiscal year.
Result
The positive market trend, coupled with
high production levels both by mining and
smelting operations as well as the coord-
ination benefits from the structural deal
with Outokumpu, enabled Boliden to
report its best result in modern history.
Operating profit for 2004 as a whole in-
creased to SEK 1,666 million, in compari-
son with SEK -19 million for the previous
year. The profit after financial items sim-
ultaneously rose to SEK 1,200 million, in
comparison with SEK -251 million.
Continued focus on growth
The future also looks bright for Boliden.
The all-embracing changes carried out
in 2004 – from the structural deal with
Outokumpu to the refinancing and new
rights issues – have given the company an
excellent starting point for playing an
active part in the ongoing structural trans-
formation of the industry, where take-
overs and partnerships mean that the mar-
ket will increasingly be dominated by a
few large players. We are now focusing
on continued growth, both organically
and by playing an active part in the on-
going process of consolidation.
This will mean, among other things,
an increased focus on exploration with the
aim of finding new mineral resources and
expanding our ore reserves. The focus on
exploration applies both to mine-site ex-
ploration and new projects, possibly in
partnership with other companies.
We also have a number of potential
internal growth projects in the areas of
mining and smelting of both copper and
zinc. One of Boliden’s important prin-
ciples is that all growth in production
must be achieved through the applica-
tion of the latest technology, which is
also the most environmentally friendly.
The environmental know-how within the
company provides a competitive advan-
tage that we intend to develop even further.
We also intend to explore the poten-
tial for new partnerships and acquisitions.
Boliden has been a strong brand name
for many years, and we are already seeing
the effects of the merger with Outo-
kumpu’s mines and smelters on the further
strengthening of our brand name.
Boliden’s vision and mission, our core
values and identity, are documented under
our brand name platform, entitled “The
New Boliden Way”. This lays down the
direction in which Boliden is going and
it is designed to guide every Boliden em-
ployee towards achieving the goals that
the company has set for its future.
The challenges we face in the year
ahead include exploiting the excellent
potential that has been generated for
Boliden and ensuring that the coordina-
tion benefits already identified are genu-
inely realised. The enthusiasm which our
employees and shareholders have shown
for developments over the past year gives
me every hope that we will succeed.

The Boliden Share
Increased liquidity and broader
international ownership
Boliden carried out two new rights
issues in 2004, both of which were
oversubscribed. The rights issues
generated increased liquidity in the
share and the average turnover per
trading day in the Boliden share
more than quadrupled during the
year – an increase that was paral-
leled by an international broaden-
ing of the ownership base.
The Boliden share is listed on the O-list
of the Stockholm Stock Exchange and
is also traded on the Toronto Stock Ex-
change (TSX), where it has a secondary
listing.
Trading and price trend
Since January 2004, the Boliden share has
been traded on “Attract 40”, where shares
with the O-list’s highest turnover rate are
traded. A total of 273 million (62.5 m)
Boliden shares were traded on the Stock-
holm Stock Exchange in 2004, corre-
sponding to a turnover rate of 180 percent
(73%). The average trade in the Boliden
share quadrupled to 1,100,000 (250, 000)
shares per trading day. A full lot corre-
sponds to 500 shares. In 2004, the share
price fell from SEK 32.73 (adjusted for
issues) at the beginning of the year to
SEK 28.40 at the end of the year – 
a fall of 13 percent. The Stockholm Stock
Exchange’s SAX index noted a rise of 18
percent (30%). The Boliden share is in-
cluded in the Stockholm Stock Ex-change’s
SX 15 Materials industry index, which
noted a rise of 2 percent (15%) during
the year. The highest price paid during
the year was SEK 35.10 (5th April) and
the lowest, SEK 24.60 (17th May). At
the end of 2004, Boliden’s market value
had increased to SEK 8.2 billion (SEK
6.5 b).

Rights issues
Boliden carried out two new rights issues
in 2004, both of which were oversubscrib-
ed. In April 2004, an underwritten rights
issue was carried out as an integral part
of the structural deal with Outokumpu,
and generated SEK 1,361 million for
Boliden. A directed rights issue of 37
million shares for Swedish and internation-
al institutional shareholders was carried
out in December. The subscription price
for the new shares was SEK 25 per share.
The directed rights issue generated SEK
889 million for Boliden and was designed
to further improve Boliden’s financial
position, to broaden its ownership, and to
improve the share liquidity.
Ownership structure  
Boliden’s ownership structure has been
broadened in 2004 and early 2005 thanks
to an increase in the number of Swedish
and international institutional investors.
This broadening of the ownership was
made possible partly by the directed rights
issue of 37 million new Boliden shares
and partly by the reduction by Outo-
kumpu, Boliden’s principal owner, of its
holding in the company by 47 million
shares. In March 2005, Outokumpu
reduced its holding in Boliden further
from 26.6 percent to 16.2 percent of the
company. The biggest directly registered
owners in Boliden at the beginning of
March were Outokumpu (16.2 percent),
Skandia (3.6%), the Odin group (2.7%),
SEB investment funds (2.7%) and Nordea
investment funds (2.4%). As of 11th
March, Boliden had 70,091 (72,448)

Strategies
Europe’s leading mining and smelting company – 
aiming for world leadership in the industry
The launch of new Boliden on 1st
January 2004 created one of
Europe’s biggest mining and smelt-
ing companies. Much work has
been done during the past year to
draw up strategic guidelines for the
new company. As a result, Boliden
has decided to focus on developing
and strengthening its existing ope-
rations, i.e. its mining and smelting
operations within the fields of its
main metals; zinc and copper. The
goal is to become one of the world’s
leading companies in this sector.
A summary of how Boliden plans
to achieve this is presented below.
New Boliden runs copper and zinc min-
ing and smelting operations. The company
also produces and sells lead, precious
metals, sulphur products, and lead- and
tin alloys. The operations are concentrated
on the early processing stages of the metal
industry’s value chain, i.e. on exploration,
mining, smelting, and refining. Recycling
of metals also comprises a growing part
of the business.
Boliden has mines at Aitik, the Boliden
Area and Garpenberg in Sweden, and at
Tara in Ireland. The company has two
zinc smelters, one at Kokkola in Finland
and one at Odda in Norway. Boliden
also has two copper smelters, one at Harja-
valta in Finland and one in Sweden, at
Rönnskär, together with a lead smelter at
Bergsöe in Sweden. The head office is
located in Stockholm. The company has
around 4,500 employees. Its share is listed
on the O-list “Attract 40”, of the Stock-
holm Stock Exchange,  and has a second-
ary listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange
in Canada.
Business concept
Boliden’s business concept is to extract
minerals and produce high-quality metals
in a cost-effective and environmentally-
friendly way, and to exploit the commer-
cial opportunities that the market offers,
thereby creating value for shareholders,
customers and employees.
Market position
Boliden is one of Europe’s leading inte-
grated producers of zinc and copper.
According to information supplied by in-
dustry analyst company Brook Hunt,
the company is the largest producer of
mined zinc in Europe (sixth largest in
the world) and the third largest zinc
smelting company in Europe (number
five in the world). Boliden is also the
third largest copper smelting company
in Europe (fourteenth in the world), and
the European market leader in the rapid-
ly growing metal recycling industry.
Boliden’s operational goals
–  to be a leading integrated mining and
smelting company
–  to improve the balance  between its
mining and smelting operations
–  to be one of the industry’s most cost-
effective companies
Boliden’s financial goals
–  to deliver added value for its share
holders via growth in value and yield
–  to generate a return on capital
invested exceeding 10 percent over 
an economic cycle
–  to achieve a net debt/equity  ratio of
50-75 percent
–  to pay dividends as of the 2005
financial year
Strategies
Boliden’s goal of becoming a leading inte-
grated mining and smelting company will
be achieved through a combination of
organic growth and participation in the
consolidation of the industry. Boliden has
established a unique and strong position

Strategies
in zinc and copper, primarily in Europe.
This position gives Boliden an advantage
and an important platform for exploiting
the external strategic opportunities gene-
rated by the ongoing consolidation of the
industry.
Boliden also aims to improve the bal-
ance between its mining and smelting
operations in order to optimise a conti-
nuous generation of value throughout
the economic cycle of metals.
Economies of scale are key with regard

Increasing prices and shrinking
stocks characterised the metals
market in 2004. The trend was
mainly driven by China, the world’s
biggest consumer of copper and
zinc, where the ongoing expansion
of the transport system and in-
frastructure is consuming large
quantities of both metals.
Global consumption of metals is expected
to grow by around 3 percent per annum
over the next 10 years. Around 40 percent
of this growth is expected to take place
in China. The forecast is based on the
enormous growth that has taken place in
the Chinese economy in recent years. 
In 2004 alone, industrial production in
China increased by 16 percent.
The upturn in metal prices in 2004 can
largely be explained by developments in
China – China consumes around 20-25
percent of all zinc produced globally, for
example. During the past year, for the first
time ever, the country was a net importer
of the metal, substantial domestic levels of
zinc production notwithstanding. China’s
mining of zinc ore was, however, negative-
ly affected by disruptions of electricity
supplies, something which also affected
Chinese smelters.
Other parts of the world also showed
good economic growth, benefiting metal
price trends. In the USA, for example,
industrial production rose by 4.5 per-
cent. Europe, however, reported a con-
siderably more modest growth of around
1.7 percent.
Driving forces
Several factors influence the price of base
metals, the most important being changes
in industrial supply and demand. One of
the biggest buyers of both zinc and cop-
per is the construction industry, and prices
are hence heavily influenced by economic
fluctuations. The activities of dominant
financial players in the metals market also
have an important effect. The price of pre-
cious metals is, furthermore, determined
to some extent by political factors.
Base metal prices are set daily on the
London Metal Exchange (LME), whilst
the price of precious metals is set by the
London Bullion Market Association
(LBMA). The price of the metal concen-
trate produced by the mines is set by
taking the current global market price for
the payable metal content, less treatment
and refining charges, making any adjust-
ments required for quality.
Treatment and refining charges are the
remuneration received by the smelters for
processing the metals. They are negotiated
annually by the major players in the min-
ing and smelting industry. Mines bene-
fit from high metal prices and low treat-
ment charges, whilst smelters benefit from
high treatment charges.
A majority of the trade on the LME
– around 65 percent – is conducted by
investment funds, banks and other play-
ers outside of the metals industry.
Zinc
The biggest consumers of zinc are the
construction and automobile industries
– zinc is used to galvanise steel and there-

The Metals Market
by prevent corrosion. These industries
collectively account for around 70 per-
cent of total consumption.
China, Australia, Peru, Canada and
the USA are among the world’s biggest
mining producers of zinc, while the
massive steelworks in China, the USA,
Japan and Germany are among its biggest
consumers.
The trade in zinc concentrate – what
the mines produce, in other words – is
global, while sales of zinc metal – the end
product of the smelters – usually take
place in the vicinity of the smelters, due
to the high cost of transportation. Price
is the primary means of competition, al-
though factors such as quality and ability
to deliver also play a part.
The zinc market is relatively fragmented
with numerous players. This is equally true
with regard to mine and smelter owner-
ship. This has resulted in poor discipline
when it comes to adapting production
to demand. The high cost associated with
closing down mining and smelting pro-
duction has helped to ensure that the
majority of zinc producers have opted to
maintain operations, even during periods
when this entails making a loss.
The long-lasting recession for zinc over
the past decade has led to increasing
industry consolidation, with takeovers,
mergers and reduced mine production.
At the same time, demand for the metal
has increased, driven not least by the
strong developmental trend in China.
This has resulted in stocks of zinc concen-
trate falling dramatically, primarily over
the past year, and in the smelters experi-
encing a shortage of the raw material. This
shortage of zinc concentrate is expected
to continue for the next few years.
The imbalance in the zinc market has
led to a rise in the price of zinc. The in-
crease was particularly marked during
the last quarter of 2004 and the first few
months of 2005. At the same time, treat-
ment charges continued to come under
pressure due to the shortage of concen-
trate.
Boliden’s current production of zinc
metal accounts for around 17 percent and
4.1 percent of the total European and
global production, respectively. The com-
pany’s mining production of zinc accounts
for 43.8 percent and 3.9 percent of the
total European and global production,
respectively. A total of approximately 10.4
million tonnes of zinc with a combined
value of approximately SEK 80 billion
were consumed worldwide in 2004.
Copper
Copper is excellent at conducting heat
and electricity, and is consequently used
in electric power distribution systems,
electrical equipment and heat exchangers,
etc. The construction of new infrastructure
currently in progress in China is conse-
quently consuming vast amounts of cop-
per. The biggest consumers of the metal
are, in other words, the construction, elec-
trical and electronics industries. Copper
is also an important component of cars
and white goods, for example.
The biggest producers of copper are
Chile, China, Japan, the USA, Russia,
Germany, Poland and Peru, while the
biggest consumers, apart from China,
include the USA, Japan, Germany and
South Korea.
The copper metal market is dominat-
ed by a few large integrated mining and
smelting companies. There are also a
number of independent smelters in Japan
and Europe, whose raw material supplies
come from a variety of mining companies.
The smelters are often located in the vicin-
ity of the major producers of semi-finished
goods in the industrial countries of western
Europe, Asia and the USA.
The trade in both copper concentrate
and copper metal is global. The last 20
years have seen a gradual increase in the
over-production of copper, due to the
launch of several new large production
units and the simultaneous introduction
of new and efficient extraction technology.
This has resulted in stocks building up
and prices falling for several years in
succession. The market has, however,
adapted to these conditions in the past
few years, and production has been cut
at the same time as demand for copper
has increased, leading to a reduction in
stocks. In 2004, the LME stocks of cop-
per fell by around 80 percent, while cop-
per prices rose by 60 percent.
Treatment and refining charges for cop-
per have fluctuated greatly since 1997,
reaching their lowest levels ever, calculat-
ed in real terms, in early 2004. During
the second quarter of 2004, however, a
substantial recovery began and this upturn
has continued in early 2005.
Boliden’s mining production of copper
accounts for around 9.6 percent of the

storage, where recycling is simple and
environmentally friendly. Lead production
and consumption levels in China have
also been high for some time. The lead
market is heavily dependent on car pro-
duction levels, primarily in Europe and
the USA. The price of lead has varied con-
siderably more than those of copper and
zinc in the past 20 years, but as with these
metals, the lead price rose markedly in
2004 – by a massive 72 percent on the
previous year’s levels.
Gold is not only present in complex
ores, it is also extracted at smelters from
electronic waste, etc. The primary areas
of use are in the manufacture of precious
objects, ornamental items, jewellery, elec-
trical contacts and connectors in the tele-
communications technology and electron-
ics industries. The biggest producer of
gold is South Africa, accounting by itself
for approximately 15 percent of the total
global gold mining production.
The price of gold remained consistent-
ly low during the period from 1998 to
2001, but in 2002, it returned to the high
levels 1997. This was due to gold once
again beginning to attract investors as the
US dollar weakened and both global poli-
tical uncertainty and inflationary fears in-
creased. But the considerable fluctuations
in the price of gold in 2003 notwithstand-
ing, the trend was clearly upwards. In the
autumn, the price reached its highest level
in seven years. The trend continued in
2004 and by the end of the year, the price
of gold had risen by 13 percent on the
previous year’s levels.
Photographic film is one of the main
uses for silver, but the metal is also used in
electrical conductors, advanced electrical
equipment, and the manufacture of jewel-
lery. The world’s biggest silver producers in-
clude Mexico, Peru, Australia and China.
The price of silver is affected by actual
supply and demand to a greater extent
than that of gold. Demand has outstripped
supply in recent years, pushing the price
upwards. In 2004, the price of silver rose
by 36 percent following a 20 percent in-
crease in the previous year.

total European production. Boliden also
accounts for 14.4 percent and 2.3 percent
of the total European and global product-
ion of copper metal, respectively. A total
of approximately 16.9 million tonnes of
copper with a combined value of approxi-
mately SEK 335 billion were consumed
worldwide in 2004.
Other metals
Lead is primarily used to produce lead
batteries. Lead concentrate has been in
very short supply in recent years. As a re-
sult of low lead prices over a long period,
there are scarcely any true lead mines left.
The lead concentrate produced today is
primarily a by-product of zinc and silver
mines. The major mining producers of
lead include China, Australia, the USA
and Peru.
Rather than using concentrate, lead
smelters use secondary lead to a very large
extent, primarily from lead batteries. The
market for secondary lead is fragmented,
with many small suppliers feeding the lead
smelters. Recycling levels for lead batteries
are high in the industrial countries at over
90 percent. Boliden’s lead smelter Bergsöe,
which had a 3 percent share of the Euro-
pean lead market in 2004, is the biggest
purchaser of used lead batteries in the
Nordic region.
There has been a downward trend in the
global production of lead concentrate for
several decades, but this has been com-
pensated for by an up-turn in the pro-
duction of secondary lead. The reduction
in lead consumption for environmental
reasons has, instead, been compensated
for by an increase in batteries for energy
Business Area Marketing & Sales
Task: 
identifying new business opportunities
Purchases of raw materials for
smelters and sales of the output
from Boliden’s mines and smelters
are coordinated by the Business
Area Marketing & Sales. Its tasks
include securing the supply of
materials for the smelters and
handling risk management and log-
istics. A single shared organisation,
close to the customers, also facili-
tates the discovery – and exploita-
tion – of business opportunities.
Marketing & Sales is divided into two
areas – one for zinc, Zinc Commercial,
and one for copper, Copper Commercial.
The reason for this division is that the
markets – and the commercial arrange-
ments applied in those markets – are
different for these two metals. Staff func-
tions such as accounts, risk management
and logistics, are, however, shared.
Zinc Commercial has offices in Rotter-
dam in the Netherlands, Stockholm in
Sweden, and Espoo in Finland. Boliden
adopted a similar methodology for its cop-
per trading in early 2004, with Copper
Commercial located close to the Swedish
copper smelter at Rönnskär and in Espoo,
Harjavalta and Pori in Finland. Lead trad-
ing will also be integrated into this unit
during 2005.
The Business Area Marketing & Sales
does not work exclusively with these main
products, however; it also coordinates sales
of sulphuric acid.
The Business Area has a total of 35
employees at present, but this figure will
rise with the transfer of certain personnel
to Marketing & Sales from Mining Oper-
ations and Smelting Operations.
Goals
The overall goal of the operations is to
strengthen competitiveness by ensuring
that the company’s resources are used in
the best possible way – and by ensuring
that the focus is always on the company’s
overall profitability. This can involve, for
example, selling the raw material produ-
ced in-house when it is most profitable to
do so and using it for the company’s own
smelters when that yields the highest
margins.
The coordination is designed to impro-
ve our exploitation of the business oppor-
tunities offered – and thereby bring about
a faster decision-making process and an
optimisation of revenues.
Other objectives include ensuring that
Boliden’s smelters have access to raw mate-
rials and optimising logistics. Substantial
amounts of both concentrate and sulp-
18
huric acid pass through the company and
the coordination of transports is thus an
important area for cost-cutting.
Over and above these duties, the Busi-
ness Area Marketing & Sales also works
alongside Boliden’s Treasury department
in the field of risk management with 
regard to metal and currency hedging.
Customer structure
The zinc metal produced by Boliden’s
smelters is primarily sold as a protection
against corrosion. The biggest customer
group comprises steelworks, which use
the metal for galvanisation in order to
prevent the steel from corroding. In terms
of volume, the biggest markets are the
UK and Germany, as well as Boliden’s
domestic markets, Finland and Sweden.
The Business Area has around 200 custo-
mers, the biggest of which are the Arcelor
Group and Rautaruukki. There are con-
siderably fewer customers for copper –
around ten. The biggest of these are the
Swedish firm, Elektrokoppar, and Outo-
kumpu in Finland. Other customers are
primarily located in the UK and France.
Purchases and sales, of both copper and
zinc, are usually based on long-term agree-
ments, with some of the conditions be-
ing renegotiated once a year. Close and
amicable customer relationships hence
have a high priority, providing a good
insight into planned operational changes
on the part of suppliers and customers
alike allowing Boliden to adapt its pro-
duction accordingly.

Increased production, mainly of zinc,
lead and gold, coupled with a sharp
rise in metal prices, all helped to
ensure a positive performance by
the Business Area Mining Oper-
ations in 2004. New Boliden’s main
strength in the context of its min-
ing operations is competitive cost
levels (cash cost). The challenges
it faces include developing this
advantage – while ensuring that it
continuously creates the conditions
for establishing new ore reserves
through efficient exploration.
Operations
New Boliden’s most important metals are
zinc and copper, but the company also
mines both lead and the precious metals,
gold and silver. The mining operations 
are conducted in three areas in Sweden –
Aitik, the Boliden Area and Garpenberg –
and at Tara in Ireland. All of Boliden’s
mines are underground mines, with the
exception of Aitik and Maurliden. Maur-
liden is part of the Boliden Area.
Aitik
Aitik, outside Gällivare, is one of Europe’s
biggest copper mines and has been oper-
ational since 1968. The mine comprises an
almost 3 km long and 330 m deep open-
pit. Approximately 18 million tonnes of
ore containing copper, gold and silver are
mined and milled every year at Aitik. The
facility produces just over 200,000 ton-
nes of copper concentrate annually, which
are transported by rail to the Rönnskär
smelter, 400 kms to the south.
Ore availability is not an immediate pro-
blem for Aitik, but the exploration work
in and around the mine area has been in-
tensified in recent years with the aim of
increasing Boliden’s identified mineral re-
sources in the area, thereby enabling the
company to create the conditions neces-
sary for an increase in production.
Aitik has approximately 380 employees.
Boliden Area (BAO)
The Boliden Area comprises the Kristine-
berg, Renström, Petiknäs and Maurliden
mines. The original Boliden mine was
depleted in 1967. Boliden also operates
the Storliden mine, which is owned by
North Atlantic Natural Resources, (NAN).
Boliden sold its 37 percent holding in
NAN in December 2004, but continues
to act as a contractor at the Storliden
mine.
The town of Boliden lies around 30
kms west of Skellefteå. The concentrator
at Boliden is nowadays used to treat ore
from the five mines in the area. There is
also a gold leaching facility connected to
the concentrator.
All of the mines currently in operation
in the Boliden Area mine complex ores
comprising zinc, copper, lead, gold and
silver.
Kristineberg, which at 1,170 m is
Sweden’s deepest mine, became operational
in 1940. In 2004, the mine produced
around 550,000 tonnes of ore. The Ren-
ström mine, where mining began in 1952,
produced around 215,000 tonnes, while
the Petiknäs mine, operational since 1992,
produced around 290,000 tonnes. The

around EUR 100 million in recent years.
These measures have also reduced the oper-
ating costs per unit, allowing Tara to re-
port a positive result for 2004. Additional
production increases are expected at Tara
over the next few years.
Tara employs around 660 people.
Exploration
Exploration is fundamental to the mining
industry, as the operations depend on the
addition of new deposits. Exploration
work was intensified in 2004 and add-
itional resources will be invested in the
years ahead. Boliden invested around SEK
120 million in exploration in 2004, com-
pared with approximately SEK 60 million
(excluding Tara) in the previous year. In
2005, this sum is expected to rise to about
SEK 147 million.
Of the SEK 120 million invested in
2004, approximately SEK 80 million
went to mine-site exploration and the
rest to field exploration. This ratio illu-
strates Boliden’s exploration strategy,
which prioritises mine-site exploration.
New discoveries close to an existing mine
mean that the time from discovery to
production can be reduced. Mine-site
exploration work is currently being con-
ducted in the vicinity of all of the existing
mines in Sweden and in Ireland, with
particular emphasis on Garpenberg and
the Boliden Area.
The primary objective of field explo-
ration is to secure mineral resources in
the medium and long term. The interval
between a discovery and a mine becom-
ing operational is usually 5-10 years,
sometimes longer. Field exploration in
recent years has been concentrated on a
small number of areas, where it now has
been intensified. The most important
area for field exploration is currently the
Skellefte field, as it is important to add
new mineral resources. Field exploration
is also being conducted in Ireland and in
Bergslagen, with work in the latter area
being carried out in partnership with
the Canadian mining company, Inmet
Mining.
Maurliden mine, which opened in 2000,
mined approximately 250,000 tonnes in
2004. The concentrator in Boliden treats
ore from the NAN-owned Storliden
mine, which produced approximately
290,000 tonnes in 2004.
Around 1.6 million tonnes of ore from
these mines are treated every year into
concentrates containing zinc, copper and
lead, together with the precious metals,
gold and silver. The copper and gold con-
centrates are shipped to the Rönnskär
copper smelter, while much of the zinc
concentrate is delivered to Boliden’s zinc
smelters at Kokkola in Finland and Odda
in Norway. The rest of the zinc concen-
trate is sold, along with the lead concen-
trate, to smelters throughout Europe.
Boliden is currently engaged in exten-
sive exploration work in the area in order
to secure future mineral resources. The
area is thought to contain significant, un-
identified resources, and historically speak-
ing, has continually yielded new mineral-
isations.
The Boliden Area employs a total of
approximately 430 people.
Garpenberg Area 
Boliden operates the Garpenberg and
Garpenberg Norra mines near Hedemora,
200 kms west of Stockholm. Boliden
bought the Garpenberg mine in 1957,
but mining operations have been con-
ducted in the area for hundreds of years.
Operations began at Garpenberg Norra
in 1972. The mines have been linked to
one another since 2004 via a connecting
drift.
Garpenberg’s ore bodies contain zinc,
lead and silver, together with some cop-
per and gold. The ore from the Garpen-
berg mines is treated at the area’s concen-
trator, which has a capacity in excess of
one million tonnes a year. The main pro-
ducts are zinc and lead concentrates, but
copper and precious metals concentrates
are also produced. Zinc production cur-
rently totals around 55,000 tonnes a year.
The copper, lead and precious metals
concentrates are shipped to the Rönnskär
smelter, while the zinc concentrate is
delivered to Boliden’s Kokkola and Odda
smelters and to external smelters in Europe.
As a result of intensive exploration
work, Boliden has discovered an exten-
sive mineralisation, known as Lappberget
and located between the two mines in
the area. The results of the exploration
work to date have been encouraging, with
indications of extensive zinc, lead and
silver mineralisations. The task of identify-
ing and categorising the resources in Lapp-
berget is in progress. Mining in the area
began in 2004 and Lappberget is expect-
ed, in future, to account for the biggest
percentage of total production in the area.
An extension of the already identified
Dammsjö mineralisation from the con-
necting drift between the Garpenberg
mine and Garpenberg Norra was disco-
vered around the 800 m level during the
year. Investigations of the zone are conti-
nuing, and production has already begun.
The Garpenberg area employs around
270 people.
Tara
Tara is a zinc and lead mine located near
Navan, 50 kms north-west of Dublin in
Ireland. Tara is Europe’s biggest zinc mine.
Drilling work began in the area in 1970
and production started in 1977.
Tara is an underground mine. The ore
body has been successively expanded
through exploration and acquisitions in
the Bula/Nevinstown area, where mining
began in 2004. The Tara concentrator,
which has a capacity of 2.8 million ton-
nes per year, produces zinc and lead con-
centrates that are shipped to Boliden’s
Kokkola and Odda smelters and sold to
other European customers. Tara has the
capacity to produce 400,000 tonnes of
zinc concentrate a year, and in 2004, the
zinc metal content of the concentrate
reached an historically high level at over
213,000 tonnes.
Production at Tara has increased to
around 2.5 million tonnes of ore per
year as a result of efficiency-boosting
programmes and investments totalling

Business Area Mining Operations
The agreement with Inmet Mining was
extended during the year until 2009, and
additional exploration partnerships may
be implemented in the future.
The exploration work in 2004 resulted,
for instance, in new deposits being found
at all of our existing mines, the most inter-
esting being at Kristineberg in the Boliden
Area and at Garpenberg and Aitik. An
application to enlarge the exploitation
concession at Aitik was submitted in
early 2005. The positive price trend for
gold, which Boliden estimates will be
long-term, has justified the resumption
in 2004 of studies of the gold minerali-
sation at Åkulla, which was discovered
in 1997 and is part of the Boliden Area.
It is envisaged that, by the end of 2005,
the data thus acquired will be sufficient
to enable a decision to be taken on
whether to mine the mineralisation.
Boliden’s ore reserves and mineral re-
sources are shown in tables on p. 88-89.
Competition
The end product from the mines is con-
centrate, which is sold to smelters for
refining into metal. An increasing percent-
age of the mined production goes to
Boliden’s own smelters.
Cost (cash cost) is the most important
competitive factor in the mining indust-
ry, although factors such as delivery relia-
bility and quality also play a part. The
market is currently undergoing a restruct-
uring. The trend is towards fewer, but
larger players.
Five major mining companies dominate
the market for mined copper production,
namely Codelco (Chile), Phelps Dodge
(USA), BHP Billiton (Australia, UK),
Anglo American (UK) and Rio Tinto

192 m), corresponding to an operating
margin of 30.5 percent (5.7%).
The operating result was positively
affected by higher metal prices, higher
production and lower treatment and refin-
ing charges, and by the sale of land at
the Tara mine (SEK 175 million). The
result was, at the same time, negatively
affected by reduced revenues resulting
from a deterioration in the US dollar ex-
change rate in comparison with last year.

Outlook for the future
The long-term investments in exploration
and measures designed to boost the effi-
ciency of the mining operations mean
that the future looks bright for the com-
pany’s mining operations.
Cost levels (cash cost) in Boliden’s
mines are competitive from an internation-
al standpoint and the ongoing investments
will see a further development of this com-
petitive advantage.
A further improvement in cost levels
is expected this year, and metal prices are
also expected to continue their positive
trend.

(UK). Boliden accounts for approximate-
ly 0.6 percent of global mined production
of copper and is hence ranked 19th in the
world.
The zinc mining market is still relative-
ly fragmented, but five of the world’s big-
gest producers currently account for al-
most 30 percent of the global production
of concentrate. The three biggest produ-
cers of mined zinc are Teck Cominco
(Canada), Zinifex, formerly known as
Pasminco (Australia), and Anglo American
(UK). Boliden is the sixth largest global
producer of mined zinc.
Production and technical
development
One of Boliden’s strengths is its in-depth
experience of the mining industry. This
know-how is utilised both in the context
of efforts to find new deposits and with
regard to the development of existing
mining production as well as measures
aimed at improving its efficiency. This is
critical in terms of the company’s ability
to continue to generate positive results,
even when metal prices are low.
Investments in the Business Area Mining
Operations totalled SEK 699 million in
2004, in comparison with SEK 745
million in the previous year. SEK 352
million (SEK 427 m) of this total is attri-
butable to the preparation work required
to mine ore deposits.

Important events during the year
– Investments in exploration increased
dramatically
– Sharply rising metal prices – the aver-
age price of copper rose by 60 percent
during the year, by 26 percent for zinc,
by 74 percent for lead, by 13 percent 
for gold, and by 36 percent for silver
– Total production of the majority of

contributed to production increases in
2004 in comparison with the previous
year for most of the metals that Boliden
produces. Cost levels (cash cost) at Boli-
den’s mines are now competitive and it is
estimated that further improvement will
be possible in this area in the year ahead.
Boliden has highly developed tech-
nology for processing low-grade ores.
Another area in which the company has
world-leading technology is that of pro-
duction control, known as flow-control
production, which is important to the
productivity of both Boliden’s under-
ground and open-pit mines. Mining met-
hods for deep-seated deposits are another
prioritised development area. Some of
Boliden’s mines operate at depths in
excess of 1,000 m, which means strict
demands on planning and technology as
a result of in-creasing rock pressure, for in-
stance. Development at the concentrators
is primarily focused on process automation.
– Production of zinc increased at Tara,
primarily as a result of higher head
grades in the ore mined from, for in-
stance, the new Nevinstown ore body,
which was gradually brought into
production during the latter half  of 
the year
– Continued good production levels at
Garpenberg
– Total copper production was on a par
with last year
– The result for the Boliden Area im-
proved, despite lower production levels
– Aitik’s result improved due to higher
copper and gold head grades
Turnover and result
Turnover from Boliden’s mining oper-
ations totalled SEK 4,568 million for the
year as a whole, in comparison with SEK
3,346 million the previous year. At the
same time, the operating result improved 
substantially to SEK 1,395 million (SEK

Production doubling platform at Odda
A production record at Boliden 
Kokkola and the launch of the new-
ly installed direct leaching method
at Odda. These were just two of
the most important events in the
Production Area Zinc in 2004.
Boliden is the world’s fifth largest
zinc producer, and its strategy is
to further reinforce its market 
position.
The Production Area Zinc comprises
the smelters at Kokkola in Finland and
Odda in Norway.
Boliden Kokkola
Boliden Kokkola is situated in the Finn-
ish coastal town of Kokkola, 500 kms
north of Helsinki. The smelter became
operational in 1969 and was part of Outo-
kumpu until the merger with Boliden 
in 2003.
Boliden Kokkola is the fifth largest zinc
smelter in the world and the second largest
in Europe. Its annual production capacity
is 280,000 tonnes, corresponding to ap-
proximately 3 percent of  total global
output. Its most important products are
high quality Special High Grade (SHG)
zinc, which comprises 99.995 percent zinc,
and CGG alloy (Continuous Galvanising
Grade) for the steel works. The facility
also produces sulphur dioxide as a by-
product. The sulphur dioxide produced
in conjunction with the roasting of the
zinc concentrate is sold to a sulphuric
acid plant adjacent to the smelter. High
pressure steam is also sold to a power plant
in the vicinity.
Boliden Kokkola is considered to be one
of the world’s most technically advanced
and cost-effective smelters of its type. The
raw material mainly comprises zinc con-
centrate, which is shipped by sea to the
smelter from mining producers worldwide,
including Boliden’s own mines in Sweden
and Ireland. Some of the raw material
also comes from the Pyhäsalmi mine in
Finland, which is owned by the Canadian
mining company, Inmet Mining. Boliden
Kokkola has its own port with a 13 m
deep channel, which can take vessels
with a dead weight of up to 60,000
tonnes.
Several types of concentrate are blended
to achieve the optimum mix for the pro-
cesses at the smelter. Over 80 percent of
the zinc produced at Kokkola is exported,
mainly to western European countries.
The primary sphere of use is in steel gal-
vanisation.
The smelter at Kokkola employs around
680 people.
Boliden Odda 
The Boliden Odda zinc smelter, which
came into production in 1929, is located
in the town of Odda on the Norwegian
west coast, approximately 370 kms from
Oslo.  In 1964, Boliden acquired 50 per-
cent of the shares in the company that
owned the smelter, and in 2001, sold this
holding to Outokumpu, which was then
in the process of buying the entire plant.
The merger  with Outokumpu in 2003
saw Odda return to Boliden’s ownership.
The Odda smelter mainly produces
zinc, but it also produces aluminium
31
Production Area Zinc
fluoride and sulphuric acid as by-products.
The annual production capacity is
160,000 tonnes of zinc metal and 29,000
tonnes of aluminium fluoride. Operations
at the plant are highly efficient and in-
clude systems for storing jarosite waste
in rock chambers. The smelter can pro-
cess zinc raw material with a high iron
content, unlike many other plants. The
operations at Odda also benefit from the
advantageous electricity prices that the
facility receives, thanks to the smelter’s
joint ownership of a hydroelectric power
plant in the area.
An extensive modernisation was com-
pleted at the smelter in 2004, and invol-
ved, among other things, the installation
of a new direct leaching facility. That is ex-
pected to generate an increase of around
10 percent in the total capacity of the
smelter, raising the capacity level to
160,000 tonnes. The project entailed the
establishment of a platform for a further
expansion of the capacity to up to 300,000
tonnes of zinc metal per year, i.e. a doubl-
ing of existing production levels.
The smelter has its own ice-free port
that can be used for deliveries of zinc
concentrate and other raw materials and
for shipping out the plant’s end-products.
The main raw material suppliers are Boli-
den’s own mines at Tara and the Boliden
area. Over 90 percent of the zinc metal
produced at Odda is exported – primari-
ly to the Nordic countries, the UK and
Germany. The aluminium fluoride pro-
duced at Odda is principally sold to Nor-
wegian aluminium smelters.
The Odda zinc smelter employs
approximately 360 people.
stage of the smelting process – i.e. roast-
ing – can be eliminated. This method will
also be used at Odda hence forward. The
end product of the zinc smelters is custom-
ised ingots.
Competition
The biggest producers of zinc metal inclu-
de both integrated mining and zinc smelt-
ing companies, such as Zinifex (Australia)
and Teck Cominco (Canada), and inde-
pendent smelters such as Korea Zinc in
Asia, and Umicore and Xstrata in Europe.
Chinese smelters, which account for
around 25 percent of total global produc-
tion, also play an important role in the
market – even if a significant percentage
of Chinese production is consumed
domestically. In 2004, China became a
net importer, after previously having been
a significant net exporter.
Boliden’s current zinc metal production
levels correspond to around 17 percent
and 4.2 percent of total European and
global production, respectively.
Production and technology
Several different techniques can be used
for producing zinc metal from zinc con-
centrate. In addition to concentrate,
secondary zinc material is also used in
the production process at Boliden’s zinc
smelters. The Kokkola smelter has in-
stalled a direct leaching process for the
production of zinc metal, whereby one
Important events
–  Increased output from Production
Area Zinc as a whole
– Production record at Boliden Kokkola
–  Installation of a direct leaching faci-
lity at Odda
–  Failure of Odda to achieve expected
production levels during the fourth
quarter of 2004 due to an inability
to fully utilise the newly-installed
facility. In January 2005, however,
the problems were resolved and the
direct leaching facility began produ-
cing in line with its capacity
Turnover and result
The Production Area Zinc’s turnover in-
creased to SEK 3,912 million for 2004
as a whole, in comparison with SEK
3,640 in the previous year. The opera-
ting result totalled SEK 10 million
(SEK 270 m), corresponding to an oper-
ating margin of 0.3 percent (7.4%). The
operating result was positively affected
by increased production and higher metal
prices than in 2003. Much of the upturn
in metal prices will not, however, be real-
ised until the result is calculated for 2005.

contacts provide a deep insight into the
customers’ operations and development
plans, allowing Boliden, in turn, to adapt
its products and services in line with the
customers’ future requirements. There is
potential for additional production in-
creases in the future within the Produc-
tion Area Zinc.

Outlook for the future
Spot smelting prices for zinc were at his-
torically low levels in 2004. The current
shortage of zinc concentrate is expected
to continue putting pressure on treat-
ment charges for zinc over the next few
years, but Boliden has a natural shield
against changes in treatment charges as 
a result of the zinc concentrate balance
existing between the company’s mines
and smelters. The smelters are expected
to be able to take advantage of – among
other things – their proximity to Boliden’s
zinc mines. There is also a long-standing
arrangement between zinc mines and
smelters, known as “price participation”
whereby, when the current price of zinc
exceeds a certain base level, the smelters
receive part of the difference in price.
This price base level is determined through
annual negotiations.
The company’s close and long-term
relationships with customers provide an
important competitive advantage for
Boliden. Moreover, Boliden Zinc Com-
mercial’s office in Rotterdam is located
close to many of the customers, thereby
further promoting close contacts. These

Rönnskär reported a production
record in 2004, partly as a result
of a fruitful partnership with Harja-
valta. Other important events in
the Production Area Copper in-
cluded the agreement concluded
regarding the supply of copper 
concentrate from the Portuguese
mine, Neves Corvo, and the halt-
ing of the sale of Bergsöe.
The Production Area Copper includes
the Rönnskär and Harjavalta copper
smelters in Sweden and Finland, respect-
ively, and the Swedish lead smelter,
Bergsöe.
Rönnskär
Rönnskär is located at Skelleftehamn in
north-eastern Sweden. A copper smelter
was built on the site in 1930 and a lead
smelter was erected there in 1943. The
smelter also houses a furnace for recyc-
ling of metal residues, together with
facilities for the production of sulphuric
acid and liquid sulphur dioxide, and a
precious metals plant.
Rönnskär smelts and refines copper
concentrate from the company’s mines
at Aitik, the Boliden area and Garpen-
berg, as well as from external mines. It
also processes lead concentrate from the
Garpenberg mine. Recycling materials
are bought from a number of external
suppliers. Copper and lead concentrate
account for approximately 80 percent
of the raw material, and more than half
of this comes from Boliden’s own mines.
The plant also refines anode copper
34
Production Area Copper
1941. The annual production capacity of
copper cathodes is 125,000 tonnes. Both
the smelter and the refinery were included
in the structural transaction between
Outokumpu and Boliden. Boliden Harja-
valta also smelts nickel in Harjavalta, on
a tolling basis for another company.
The bulk of Harjavalta’s production of
anode copper is currently refined at Pori,
with the rest shipped on to Rönnskär for
refining – one of the results of the inten-
sive synergy work currently taking place
within Boliden. Most of Boliden’s produc-
tion of copper cathodes at Pori is sold to
Outokumpu’s metalworks nearby.
Harjavalta buys copper concentrate on
long-term contracts from suppliers world-
wide, mainly from mines in South Ame-
rica and South East Asia. The Portuguese
mine, Neves Corvo, is also an important
supplier, thanks to the new partnership
agreement signed with the Canadian min-
ing company, EuroZinc Mining Corpora-
tion, in June 2004.
In addition to its main product, cop-
per, Boliden Harjavalta also produces
gold, silver and sulphuric acid.
Boliden Harjavalta has approximately
420 employees.
Boliden Bergsöe
Bergsöe, near Landskrona in southern
Sweden, is the Nordic region’s only smel-
ter for the recycling of lead and tin pro-
ducts. It is also one of the biggest and
most ecofriendly of its type in Europe.
Every year, the smelter recycles 4-5 million
scrap lead batteries from the Nordic and
Baltic regions. The production capacity is
approximately 50,000 tonnes of lead and
1,000 tonnes of tin per year.
The bulk of the lead production is ex-
ported to northern Europe.
Apart from what is essentially pure
lead, comprising 99.97 percent lead, the
smelter also produces standard alloys,
where the lead is alloyed with antimony,
copper, calcium, tin or silver, among other
things. Lead alloys are mainly used in the
manufacture of batteries, but also in the
construction industry, in the manufacture
from Harjavalta. The biggest external
suppliers of copper concentrate are mines
in South America.
Approximately 20 percent of the raw
material comes from recycling material,
mainly comprising metal residues from
brass foundries, various types of copper
and electronics scrap, and steelmaking
dust. Recycling of copper and precious
metals is an important part of operations
at Rönnskär. Approximately 20 percent
of copper production derives from recyc-
ling, as does 40 percent of gold produc-
tion and 75 percent of zinc production.
Rönnskär’s main products are copper,
lead, gold, silver and zinc clinker, and
its by-products include liquid sulphur
dioxide, sulphuric acid, selenium and
crude nickel sulphate. The annual pro-
duction capacity for copper, lead and
zinc clinker is 230,000 tonnes, 30,000
tonnes and 40,000 tonnes, respectively.
The corresponding figures for gold and
silver are 15 tonnes and 475 tonnes, 
respectively.
The smelter has its own port, which
facilitates the import of raw materials.
An important part of the transport system
are the special trains that leave Rönnskär
for Helsingborg five days a week, loaded
with copper cathodes, carrying electronic
scrap and other smelting materials back
to Rönnskär. There is also a train con-
nection that carries copper concentrate
from Aitik to Rönnskär on a daily basis.
Rönnskär employs approximately 870
people.
Boliden Harjavalta (Harjavalta/Pori)
Copper production began at Harjavalta,
close to Pori in south-western Finland, in
1945, and the smelter soon became the
centre of Outokumpu’s development of
the copper flash smelting method. After
an extensive expansion programme, com-
pleted in 1995, the production capacity
at the plant is 170,000 tonnes of anode
copper per year.
The refining of anode copper into cop-
per cathodes takes place at Pori, 30 kms
from Harjavalta, at a refinery built in
35
Production Area Copper
of electronics, and for medical applica-
tions. Bergsöe is the Nordic region’s mar-
ket leader with regard to the production
of tin solder for the electronics, enginee-
ring and vehicle industries.
Bergsöe has approximately 100 em-
ployees.
Competition
The market for copper metal is fragment-
ed, with a few large integrated mining
and smelting companies and a number
of independent smelters that buy their
raw materials from various mining pro-
ducers. The largest integrated companies
include Codelco (Chile), Phelps Dodge
(USA) and Rio Tinto (UK), together with
Grupo Mexico, Norilsk Nickel in Russia
and KGHM in Poland. Boliden’s main
competitors in Europe are KGHM, Nord-
deutsche Affinerie (Germany), Umicore
(Belgium) and Atlantic Copper (Spain).
Chilean smelters also compete by expor-
ting copper cathodes to Europe.
Boliden’s shares of the European and
global copper consumption markets are
approximately 8.7 percent and 2.1 per-
cent, respectively.
Production and technology
The end-product of the copper mining
and smelting industry is refined copper,
or “cathode copper”. The copper concen-
trate delivered by the mining producers
undergoes a pyrometallurgical treatment
process – a number of smelting and puri-
fication stages – at the smelters. Some
smelters, such as Rönnskär, use recycled
material as input materials, in addition to
concentrate.

Development work at these smelters is de-
signed to increase production capacity and
process value, and includes optimisation
of the process chain, choice of raw mate-
rials, and new quality assurance systems.
Important events
– Production increases, mainly for cop-
per, lead and gold
– Production record at Rönnskär, partly
as a result of the start during the year
of the shipping of anode copper from
Harjavalta to Rönnskär for processing
into copper cathodes
– Increased production optimisation and
increased stability in external concen-
trate flows, which has had a positive
effect on production
– Signing of an agreement with Euro-
Zinc regarding supplies of copper
concentrate from the Neves Corvo 
mine in Portugal, which will further
stabilise these flows
– The halting of the sale of Bergsöe
– Record result reported at Bergsöe,

Rönnskär and Harjavalta an advantage
to their competitors ahead of impending
environmental legislation.
Successful environmental work is also
important from a competition viewpoint
for Bergsöe, which has a well-maintained
facility with emission levels well below
current limit values. Additional measures
to boost efficiency will be implemented
in 2005/2006, which will result in, among
other things, reduced internal transpor-
tation and reduced natural gas consump-
tion.

Outlook for the future
Treatment and refining charges for copper
have fluctuated widely since 1997. The
spot treatment charge for copper bottom-
ed out in early 2004, and has since risen
sharply due to the favourable trend in the
price of copper. This has resulted in an in-
crease in the amount of the metal mined
– which has also led to an increase in the
market availability of copper concentrate.
The rise in contract treatment charges (see
diagram to the right) will not occur until
2005, in conjunction with the annual re-
negotiation of smelter terms. The short-
age of copper has also resulted in increased
premiums.
The quest for synergies between Rönn-
skär and Boliden Harjavalta is continuing,
and a number of growth projects are cur-
rently also being conducted within the
Production Area Copper. These suggest
that there is considerable potential for
additional production increases at a rela-
tively low investment cost.
Early investments in environmental
improvement measures have given both

Turnover by the Production Area Copper
rose to SEK 12,688 million in 2004, in
comparison with SEK 9,579 million in the
previous year. The operating profit also in-
creased, to SEK 741 million (SEK 334 m),
corresponding to an operating margin of
5.8 percent (3.5%). The operating profit
was positively affected by higher metal
prices, increased production, and a stock
profit of SEK 45 million (SEK -18 m) in
the process stock at Rönnskär. Both Harja-
valta and Bergsöe also reported among
their best results to date in 2004. At the
same time, a lower US dollar exchange
rate and lower treatment and refining
charges had a negative effect on the result.
Human Resources
Goal:
creating shared values
Merging two companies does not
just mean combining the tangible
assets. Far more important than
this is the combination of know-how,
creativity and contact networks.
The year 2004 saw approximately
one hundred employees of new
Boliden involved in the creation of
a shared value base for the new
company.
New Boliden’s two components – namely
the mining and smelting operations from
Boliden and Outokumpu – each represent
strong brand names, a rich history, and
in-depth knowledge. The merger at the
turn of the year 2003/2004 presented the
new company with the challenge of com-
bining these into a single, shared, strong
corporate culture – in other words, per-
suading thousands of employees in five
countries to work together towards the
same goals.
An extensive programme of work de-
signed to create a shared value base and
to strengthen the Boliden brand name
was launched in May 2004. Approxi-
mately hundred managers and key emp-
loyees, who represent different operatio-
nal sectors and countries, were engaged
in the project. The result of their work,
“The New Boliden Way”, was introduced

in February 2005. The New Boliden Way
includes, for instance, the company’s
vision, mission, core values and identity.
The New Boliden Way will help to make
new Boliden a leader in the fields of:
– RESPONSIBILITY – comprehensive 
ethical and long-term management
of the environment, employees and 
society
– RELIABILITY – with regard to the 
quality of our methodology, with 
customers, suppliers and other 
interested parties
– CUSTOMER SATISFACTION – by
living up to and exceeding customers’ 
expectations in everything new  
Boliden does. Ensuring that the 
company meets customers’ demands 
in the most effective way – by adding 
value at every stage
– PERFORMANCE – by delivering to the 
company’s shareholders a total return 
that exceeds the industry average
The section on Boliden’s strategies con-
tains further details of, among other
things, the vision and the mission that
were also defined. Those who participated
in the process were given the important
task of acting as “ambassadors” and pass-
ing the results of the discussions on 
to their colleagues and employees.
Almost 4,500 employees in five
countries
At the end of 2004, new Boliden had
4,479 employees, 2,243 of whom work in
Sweden, 1,180 in Finland, 366 in Norway,
661 in Ireland, and 29 in other countries.
This corresponds to a reduction of 418
employees since the turn of the year
2003/2004 largely due to the sale of the
Myra Falls mine. 536 of the company’s
employees are women, and 3,943 men.
Recruitment and training
Boliden has been working closely with
universities and upper secondary schools
for a number of years, with the aim of
making more young people interested in
working in the mining and smelting in-
dustry. Boliden’s cooperation with LKAB,
involving the sponsorship of three acade-
mic chairs in the mining industry, is part
of this work. Boliden also awards scholar-
ships to students studying metallurgy and
mineral engineering at the Luleå Univer-
sity of Technology during the final two
years of their studies.
Another example is the initiative aim-
ed at replacing skills that are disappea-
ring with the current generation shift at
Boliden Kokkola smelter. This initiative,
which has been in place since 1996, came
about as a result of the age structure at
the smelter – approximately 60 percent
of employees at that time were aged 50
or more. The work resulted in a custom-
ised training programme designed to meet
the smelter’s need for trained personnel,
launched by the smelter, in cooperation
with the local labour market and educat-
ion authorities. This programme is used
to recruit all the workers who will later
be employed by the smelter. The interest
has been considerable, with 100-200
people applying for each course. Sixteen
of these applicants are accepted on each
occasion, and to date, around 195 peop-
le have been recruited to the smelter in
this way. In 2004, Boliden Kokkola was
rewarded by the Finnish Ministry of
Education for its educational efforts.
Skill development is conducted in a
38
variety of ways by the various units in
the company, both internally and exter-
nally, with ventures that may involve, for
example, setting up personal training plans
for every employee or encouraging per-
sonnel to take further education courses
through the reward system, job rotation or
building knowledge dissemination net-
works. Boliden has, among other things,
implemented a series of managerial devel-
opment programmes involving approxi-
mately 100 employees. These were com-
pleted in 2004. A program for aspiring
managers was also launched in some of
Boliden’s units in 2004.
The first network for knowledge dis-
semination will be initiated for young
graduates in Boliden in 2005. The pro-
gramme will give graduate employees the
opportunity to visit and study the com-
pany’s various operations. The aim is both
to give them a good insight into how all
the vital parts of Boliden operate, and for
them to get to know colleagues in other
units and other countries. The company’s
hope is that they will build personal net-
works with the aim of promoting the inte-
gration work and that they will become
ambassadors, spreading knowledge to their
colleagues of how the rest of the company
works.
radiation, for example. New directives
have also been issued with regard to the
exposure of employees to chemical sub-
stances, such as sulphuric acid and lead.
Boliden’s strategy regarding health
and safety work is to minimise the risks
to which employees are exposed as far as
possible – and hence to be always one
step ahead of the legislation in these areas.
The company has a long tradition of this
kind of work, something which has estab-
lished a positive trend in Boliden’s mines
and smelters with regard to the number
of people on sick leave as well as to the
number of accidents. The goal is to con-
stantly increase the number of accident-
free days at each unit. In 1999, for examp-
le, the Harjavalta smelter adopted a zero
vision with regard to accident statistics,
which has helped bring about a radical
reduction in the number of accidents to
around 2.8 per million working hours.
The Boliden Kokkola smelter received
a special award from the Finnish indust-
rial organisation, Technology Industry,
for its risk assessment work, which was
part of the health and safety management
system drawn up by the smelter in 2004.
The environmental section of the re-
port contains additional information on
Boliden’s health and safety work.
Health and safety
EU and national legislation contain 
numerous regulations relating to health
and safety, which are of major importance
to the mining and smelting industry. A
number of new directives have  been issu-
ed in recent years addressing health and
safety matters, related to employees ex-
posed to risks deriving from vibration,
noise, electromagnetic fields and optical
Trade union cooperation
The majority of the approximately 4,500
Boliden employees are members of one
of the trade union organisations represent-
ed within the company. Boliden has trad-
itionally enjoyed good relationships with
the trade unions and works actively to
strengthen and improve these relation-
ships on an ongoing basis. 
Within the company there is a long-
standing agreement with the trade union
organisations, involving cooperation at
several levels within the group. Boliden
has a group-wide, international trade
union body, the Boliden Works’ Council,
comprising trade union representatives
from various countries. In January 2005,
Boliden concluded a new agreement,
adapted to the new corporate group struc-
ture, with the trade union organisations. 
The Boliden Works’ Council is also an
important part of the communication
between the employees’ representatives
and the company management. The
Council is thus an important disseminator
of the corporate culture, building bridges
between different units and countries. 
The laws of the respective countries
apply regarding conditions of employment
and labour market regulations.
Equal opportunities
Boliden operates in a traditionally male-
dominated business, but the company is
striving to increase its percentage of female
employees. These efforts include measures
designed to:
–  enable employees to combine work
and family life
–  counteract gender-based distortion in
different occupational groups,
–  increase the percentage of female
managers
–  maintain equal opportunities for men
and women within the group’s oper-
ations
– ensure that no pay discrimination
occurs

Sandra Kempers, Market Analyst
“INTENSIFYING CUSTOMER
CONTACTS CREATES NEW
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES”
She spends her working hours
broadening the contacts between
Boliden and its customers. Her 
leisure hours are spent behind 
the yoke of an aircraft. Sandra
Kempers works as a market ana-
lyst at Boliden Zinc Commercial 
in Rotterdam and was originally 
attracted to Outokumpu in Finland
by the chance to work in such an
“exotic” location as Helsinki. 
Sandra Kempers was born and raised in
Germany, but has lived in a number of
places throughout Europe. In 1997, how-
ever, when she was offered a job at Outo-
kumpu in Helsinki, the most northerly
city in which she had lived was London.
The position she was offered was as head
of the Marketing & Sales Department of
Outokumpu’s nickel division.
“Up until then, I had worked in the
banking sector, so the idea of being able
to combine this experience with the know-
ledge I had gained from my university
studies in marketing and accountancy
was tempting – and Finland felt exotic,”
she says.
Eventually, her work and Outokumpu
took her onwards to Rotterdam and the
marketing and sales division for zinc,
where Sandra Kempers now works as a
market analyst. One of her most import-
ant tasks is intensifying the links between
Boliden and the company’s customers.
“I run a number of projects in which
the zinc industry and the end users, includ-
ing the vehicle and construction industries,
combine forces to develop new markets
and to promote the advantages of zinc
over competing materials. The work has
had three main advantages for Boliden.
Firstly, it gives us first-hand information
on what’s happening in our customers’
markets, which is of business strategic im-
portance for Boliden. Secondly, it allows
us to support our customers in their de-
velopment of their markets; and thirdly,
it enables us to offer our customers added
value,” she says.
Sandra Kempers is fascinated by the
zinc market, which is currently undergo-
ing a revolutionary restructuring process.
“The zinc industry has always had a
more conservative image than copper, and
especially aluminium. But during the last
two years, in particular, the industry has
been undergoing a change, whereby cer-
tain competitors have disappeared from
the market and others have merged.
Those still around have modern product-
ion facilities and a considerably more
product- and customer-orientated focus,”
she says.
Sandra Kempers believes that one of
the advantages of the merger by Outo-
kumpu and Boliden of their mining and
smelting operations is the promise of
precisely that – the emergence of a more
modern and dynamic organisation.
“I think we’ll have an increased custom-
er focus and that the cooperation between
the various units will be intensified – at
the same time as we retain our leading
technological position,” she says.

DIPLOMA IN CHEMICAL
INDUSTRY
Timo Lankila belongs to those who
have completed the Boliden Kokkola
smelter’s zinc course. Born and 
raised in the coastal town of Kokkola,
the training gave him not only the
opportunity to stay in his home town,
but also a job with real opportunities
for development – and he’s made the
most of them.
In the mid-1990s, Timo Lankila heard about
the zinc courses that had just started in his
home town of Kokkola, thanks to a partner-
ship between the smelter and the regional
education and labour market authorities.
The course sounded attractive, as Timo
Lankila was keen to stay in Kokkola, where
the smelter was the biggest private sector
employer. Together with many others, both
from the region and from others of Finland,
he sent in an application – and was among
the candidates selected for one of the 16
places.
Timo Lankila, Serviceman
“The training lasted about one year and
involved alternating periods of theoretical
study with a number of periods gaining
practical work experience at the smelter,”
he remembers.
In October 1997, after completing his
studies, Timo Lankila was offered a job at
the smelter. Today, after eight years at the
zinc plant, he works as a serviceman in the
facility’s leaching department. Timo Lankila
works shifts, which he, personally, regards
as a huge bonus.
“It gives me the scope to spend time
during the day on the leisure activities that
are an important part of my life – things
like working on my house, pottering around
the garden, taking care of my child, and
playing sports,” he says.
Timo Lankila also appreciates the op-
portunities for further education that the
smelter offers.
“By studying while working, I’ve manag-
ed to get a professional degree qualification
in industrial chemistry. It took me two years
to complete my studies. Not only did they
give me the opportunity to develop my own
duties at work, but also move up the wage
ladder,” he says.

complex ore types in different geological
environments,” she says.
But it wasn’t just the composition of
the Skellefte field that attracted her. She
also puts her choice of workplace down
to factors such as career opportunities
and access to the knowledge present in
the company.
“As Boliden is a big company, it gives
me the opportunity to have an interest-
ing career with a variety of different tasks
within the company. Boliden invests more
in exploration than any other company
in Sweden. Furthermore, the company
conducts the majority of its operations
in a geologically interesting area,” she
says.
“In many ways, Boliden is a unique
workplace. It’s very unusual in the world
of exploration geologists to be able to
combine a normal family life in a pleasant
small town with an interesting and exci-
ting job,” she says.
“DETECTIVE WORK TO UNDER-
STAND AN AREA’S GEOLOGY”
“Boliden invests more in exploration
than any other company in Sweden.
Furthermore, the company con-
ducts the majority of its opera-
tions in a geologically interesting
area.” This is how Ann Pettersson,
geologist, explains why she applied
to Boliden for a job.
Her childhood dream was to become a
professional violinist. But growing up on
an island in Stockholm’s northern archi-
pelago also aroused a strong interest in
nature – and after a study trip during
upper secondary school to the School of
Geology at Uppsala University, her choice
of profession was pretty much set. And
even though Ann Pettersson has never
abandoned music, it’s a leisure interest
nowadays as she spends her working hours
involved in exploration.
Ann Pettersson started her career at
Boliden in June 2003, when she got a
summer job at the company while study-
ing to become a geologist at Lund Uni-
versity. Her duties involved taking part in
field exploration for gold in the Skellefte
field. Afterwards, she returned to the uni-
versity to complete her degree course. At
the turn of the year 2003/2004 she was
back at Boliden as a newly qualified geo-
logist. Today, she works with mine-site
exploration at the Renström mine.
“Ore geology and mine-site exploration
are very interesting. I like the challenge
and the detective work required to under-
stand the geology of an area and to find
ore. And because, geographically speaking,
the Skellefte field is a relatively small area,
it gives me the opportunity to follow the
ore’s route from the mine to finished
metal at close quarters, which is incredibly
exciting. The work is also a huge challen-
ge as the Skellefte field includes several

Environment, Health and Safety
An important part of the recycling society
Environment, health and safety are
of strategic importance to metal
producing companies. New Boliden
has a more than 80-year-old tradi-
tion of progressive work aimed at
making workplaces safer, institut-
ing effective corporate healthcare,
and protecting the surrounding en-
vironment. The vision is to become
a world-leading mining and smelt-
ing company also in these respects.
For a mining and metals company like
Boliden, it is important to have access
to committed and skilful employees, a
secure supply of raw materials, energy
at an acceptable cost, and land for ex-
ploration and establishment of new
operations.
The employees
The most important resource for work-
ing successfully with environmental,
health and safety issues are the employees.
Integration between the units in new
Boliden offers increased development
opportunities through the transfer of
know-how and experience in the form 
of networks, staff rotation, and various
forms of internal and external bench-
marking processes.
The raw materials
New Boliden’s structure, with integrated
mining and smelting operations, offers
greater control over the origin of the raw
material for the smelting processes. For
zinc and lead, mine production is roughly
equal to the smelters’ capacity, whilst
mined copper production is sufficient
for approximately 25 percent of metal
output. There is also extensive processing
of recycled materials. Boliden’s smelters
are an important part of the recycling
society – at the Rönnskär smelter, 20
percent of copper production, 40 percent
of gold production and 75 percent of all
the zinc produced, originates from re-
cycled materials. At the Bergsöe smelter
at Landskrona, 100 percent of the lead
produced comes from recycled metal.
Energy
Both mines and smelters both need sub-
stantial amounts of energy in their proces-
ses. Major advances have been made in
reducing energy consumption; electricity
consumption per tonne of ore produced
in the mines is currently around half of
what it was in 1970. Sweden has a special
national Energy Efficiency Programme,
PFE, that offers potential tax reductions,
provided that a SS 62 77 50 standard
compliant management system is intro-
duced and certified. The goal is to imple-
ment and certify a system of this kind at
the Rönnskär smelter and in the Swedish
mines in 2006.
Boliden’s facilities both consume and
generate energy. The smelters supply large
amounts of hot water and steam to exter-
nal customers, and also generate electri-
city by utilising the steam produced by
the processes.
Land
Mining companies actively involved in
exploration need access to large areas of
land in order to investigate and map the
geology. It is, therefore, of utmost import-
ance that the legal framework relating to
permitting is clear and well-established,
not least with regard to the permits need-
ed to set up and run production oper-
ations. Boliden’s principle is to cooperate
with landowners and other interested
parties.
Systematic environmental,  
health and safety work
Boliden’s environmental, health and safety
work is conducted on a systematic basis,
via management systems. A variety of
voluntary undertakings in the form of
general management systems has existed
within Boliden for more than a decade.
Boliden is currently working towards the
introduction of a group-wide manage-
ment system that will serve as a tool for
total quality work, with ongoing improve-
ments to every aspect of the operations.
The aim is to establish a uniform metho-
dology that also offers the potential for
experience transfer and the dissemina-
tion of knowledge between the produc-
tion units.
International standards exist for manage-
ment systems in the workplace environ-
ment sphere. The Odda and Kokkola
zinc smelters were certified in accordance
with OHSAS 18001 in 2004  and the
Tara mine was qualified for ISRS level
6. A special project has been launched 
for the Swedish mining units, with 
the aim of quality assuring and certify-
ing the workplace environment-related 
activities.
42
The international ISO 14001 standard
for environmental management systems
has been implemented at several of the
production units. In 2004, the Pori cop-
per refinery achieved certification in
accordance with ISO 14001.
The table to the right shows the current
status with regard to certified manage-
ment systems within Boliden.

Group-wide guidelines were drafted in
2004 for the external environment and
for the workplace environment and cor-
porate healthcare.
Risk management
Assessment of risks in the workplace en-
vironment, for the external environment
and for dam safety, is conducted on a
systematic basis as part of the manage-
ment systems. The risks are classified and
remedial programmes and action plans
drawn up. Employees and relevant author-
ities are then informed of the results of
the risk analyses and the measures in
question.
Health promotion work
Boliden believes that there is an obvious
link between safe and healthy workplaces,
healthy and motivated employees, and
good production results. A long-term
programme of work has, therefore, been
launched in order to identify and develop
health-promoting factors in the various
units.
Recycling work
In addition to recycling metals, Boliden
also strives to act as a resource for society
in other areas of its sustainability work.
Methods to harmonise the environmen-
tal work with society’s need to manage
various waste products are constantly be-
ing developed. The use of sewage sludge
and other waste products for reclama-
tion work on mining and industrial areas
is just one example of this. Development
work is also being done on replacing
cement with combustion ash, using it
as a binding agent in conjunction with
the refilling of underground mined out
stopes.
Incidents
In September 2004, there was an emission
of 262 tonnes of lye from a heat exchan-
ger into the sea at Odda. The incident
has been investigated and reported to the
relevant authorities. No damage to the
environment occurred.
Conditions
The permits that regulate Boliden’s oper-
ational activities include a number of con-
ditions formulated as guidelines and limit
values. None of the prescribed limit values
were exceeded during the year.
Results
Sickness absence
Boliden works actively with healthcare
and rehabilitation. This has yielded good
results in the form of reduced sickness
absence. Sickness absence in the Swedish
units was previously at high levels, but
this trend was broken in mid-2003. In
2004 it decreased even further, approach-
ing the levels reported by the Finnish,
Norwegian and Irish units.
Accidents
The accident frequency trend has gener-
ally been very positive, with most of the
units reporting historically low levels.
This is the result of a long-term program-
me in which training as well as delegated
and clarified responsibility are important
factors.
Emissions
The emissions from mines and smelters
is a function, in part, of how much they
produce. Despite increased production,
total emissions to both air and water have
been reduced.
Boliden’s smelters are environmentally
among the cleanest in the world. Constant
development of the processes has led to
a substantial reduction in sulphur emis-
sions from Boliden’s plants, and measure-
ments of air quality around the smelters
have demonstrated low sulphur dioxide
levels outside of the industrial areas.
Sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid are
both extracted for external sale from the
sulphur-bearing process gases that are sep-
arated in the processes.
Sulphur emissions into the air from
mines and concentrators arise from the
use of diesel-powered machines and
vehicles, with fossil fuel-based heating,
and also sometimes with the dewatering
44
of mineral concentrates. Technology that
eliminates emissions to the air completely
is increasingly being used for dewatering
processes.
Burning fossil fuels leads to the for-
mation of carbon dioxide. Rules govern-
ing the trading in emission rights for
carbon dioxide were introduced in 2004,
but only affect Boliden with regard to
two oil fired boilers that are used as
back-up capacity for district heating at
Rönnskär. Boliden has been allocated
emission rights corresponding to the
requirement for these boilers.
Metals are emitted both into the air,
via process gases, primarily from the smel-
ters, and into water via used process 
and cooling water. Metal emissions have
generally fallen over the years due to the
introduction of more effective cleaning
techniques and an increase in the recirc-
ulation of water.
Waste
Tailings sand has been used for a number
of years to backfill the mined out stopes
in underground mines. Granulated slag
from copper smelters is also used as con-
struction material. New Boliden’s structu-
re as an integrated mining and smelting
company also offers new potential for
optimised handling of various waste pro-
ducts. Copper-bearing slag from Rönn-
skär has been transported for a number
of years now to the mill at Boliden,
where the metal content is extracted in
the concentrator process. Residual con-
tent of copper is also reclaimed from the
slag at Harjavalta in a separate milling
process. Mines and smelters have the
potential to supply construction materi-
als for various uses in society to a far
greater extent than they do today. At
the Aitik mine, waste rock that meets
most quality requirements for construc-
tion purposes has been set aside for some
years now. With the planned connection
to the railway that passes close to the
mine, large quantities of waste rock will
become available for external deliveries,
thereby reducing the need for rock and
gravel extraction in Sweden and the rest
of Europe.
Dams
Dams are used in the mining industry 
for deposition of tailings sand, for the
cleaning of process water and as process
water reservoirs – and sometimes as a
combination of all of the above. A need
for quality assurance in connection with
dam-related activities was identified in
the 1990s and special dam safety manuals
were drawn up for all of Boliden’s dams.
Boliden has also initiated the drafting 
of specific Swedish guidelines for mine
dams.
Reclamation work
The reclamation work carried out to date
at around 50 closed mines is an important
aspect of Boliden’s environmental work.
Society’s new regulations governing the
handling of waste products have created
opportunities for the development of re-
clamation methods that would not other-
wise have been possible. Boliden’s partner-
ship with Stockholm Vatten, whereby
sewage sludge is transported to the Aitik
mine for use as a cover material and as a
soil-conditioner, is an illustrative example
of the application of the recycling society.
In the Boliden Area, Boliden is engaged in
a partnership with Skellefteå Kraft involv-
ing the use of ash from the combustion
of biofuels for similar purposes. In Garpen-
berg Boliden is working with Stora Enso
by handling biological waste and ash
from the Fors cardboard factory.
Boliden’s goal is to carry out reclam-
ation work on an ongoing basis through-
out its operations to avoid the build-up
of any requirement for measures in the
future.

Directors’ Report
Directors’ Report
New Boliden in brief
New Boliden is a mining and smelting
company focusing primarily on the pro-
duction of copper, zinc, lead, gold and
silver. Boliden’s main products comprise
zinc and copper and its operations focus
on initial processing within the metal
industry. The Company is a strong Euro-
pean player with a significant global
market position.
The Group’s parent company, Boliden
AB, is listed on “Attract-40” of the O-list
of the Stockholm Stock Exchange (pri-
mary listing) and on the Toronto Stock
Exchange in Canada (secondary listing).
The operations are conducted within
three Business Areas, namely Mining
Operations, Smelting Operations and
Marketing & Sales. The breakdown into
units reflects the way Boliden conducts
its business and views its business oppor-
tunities, particularly with regard to en-
hancing the efficiency of its operations
and to marketing. For the purpose of
analysing the operations and reporting
the financial results, however, the oper-
ations are currently broken down into
three Production Areas, namely Mining
Operations, Zinc and Copper.
Net sales and results in 2004
Boliden’s net sales in 2004 totalled SEK
17,928 million (SEK 9,545 m). Operat-
ing result before depreciation and amortis-
ation (EBITDA) was SEK 2,977 million
(SEK 633 m), and the operating result
improved to SEK 1,666 million (SEK 
-19 m). Result after financial items increas-
ed to SEK 1,200 million (SEK -251 m).
Cash flow from operating activities totall-
ed SEK 1,552 million (SEK 956 m). Net
debt was SEK 6,656 million (SEK 8,957
m) at the end of the year and the net debt/
equity ratio improved significantly to 74
percent (147%). The equity/assets ratio
totalled 44.8 percent (30.7%) and return
on capital employed was 11.1 percent (-).
Average number of employees at the turn
of the year was 4,479 (4,897).
Events during 2004
The rights issue, which formed an inte-
gral part of the transaction with Outo-
kumpu, was completed during the second
quarter. The new rights issue, which was
oversubscribed, generated a total of SEK
1,361 million for the Company.
In June 2004, a cooperation agreement
was signed with the Canadian mining
company EuroZinc Mining Corporation
(EuroZinc) concerning the delivery of
copper concentrate from the Portuguese
Neves Corvo mine. Deliveries to Boliden
will total between 150,000 and 200,000
tonnes per year, which is equivalent to
approximately one-fifth of its external
requirements. The agreement is valid for
a period of ten years and deliveries began
in January 2005.
In July, Boliden completed the sale of
its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary,
Boliden Westmin (Canada) Limited
(BWCL) to the Canadian mining com-
pany Breakwater Resources Ltd (Break-
water). BWCL owns the Myra Falls mine.
Boliden received 18 million newly-issued
Breakwater shares, corresponding to
approximately 5 percent of the outstand-
ing shares. The sale of the mine generated
a capital gain of SEK 19 million. In
addition to the shares, the Company also
received five million options with an ex-
ercise price of CAD 1.00 and a duration
until 27th January 2009.
During the second quarter, the Board
of Directors of Boliden adopted new
general financial goals for the operations,
whereby Boliden must achieve good pro-
fitability over a single business cycle, with
a return on capital employed that exceeds
the market’s cost of capital. The return
on capital employed must exceed 10 per-
cent over a single business cycle, calculated
on the current capital base. Boliden’s goal
is to achieve a debt/equity ratio of 50-75
percent.
A further goal is to be in a position to
pay dividends as of the 2005 financial
year.
In September, the European Commis-
sion fined Boliden’s former subsidiary,
Boliden Cuivre et Zinc SA (BCZ) for
having conducted cartel operations re-
lating to sanitary copper tubing in the
European market during the period
1988-2001. The fine totalled EUR 32.6
million (approximately SEK 300 mil-
lion) and was fully provided for in the
reported result for the third quarter of
2004. Boliden has appealed the ruling.
In September, an area of land adjoin-
ing the Tara zinc mine in Ireland was
sold. The land has no significance to
mining operations at Tara and the sale
generated a capital gain for Boliden 
of approximately SEK 150 million 
after tax.
In October, Boliden successfully com-
pleted the refinancing of the Company’s
bank loans totalling EUR 840 million.
The new agreement is valid for five years
and replaces Boliden’s former bank agree-
ments signed in connection with the
reconstruction of the Company in 2001.
The loan agreement entails a normalisa-
tion of the terms and conditions of the
loans and will, among other things,
enable the Company to pay future divi-
dends to its shareholders.
In December, a new rights issue of
37 million Boliden shares directed to
institutional investors in Sweden and
abroad was concluded. The price was set
at SEK 25 per share and the oversubscrib-
ed new rights issue generated a total of

Zinc production at Tara increased sub-
stantially compared to last year. The
increase is primarily a result of higher
grades in the extracted ore, including
the new Nevinstown ore body that has
been brought into production gradually
over the latter half of the year. Lead
production at Tara also increased com-
pared with last year as a result of higher
grades.
Copper production and gold produc-
tion at the Aitik mine have both reported
an increase compared with 2003 as a
result of higher copper and gold grades.
Production of zinc, gold and silver in the
Boliden area was higher than in last year.
Copper production was lower as a result of
lower production from the Storliden mine.
Garpenberg is continuing to report
healthy production levels. In 2004, 
production at Lappberget accounted for
an increasing share of total production
from the mine area, and this has primar-
ily led to a gradual increase in zinc pro-
duction. Production of both zinc and
lead has been higher during the year com-
pared with 2003 as a result of the higher
grades.
Boliden’s combined production of
zinc, lead and gold has increased sub-
stantially compared with last year, while
total copper production was in line with
production in 2003.
SEK 889 million for the Company. In
conjunction with the directed new rights
issue, Outokumpu sold a total of 47 mil-
lion shares (including 10 million shares
in an over-alottment option). This sale
reduced Outokumpu’s ownership in
Boliden from 49.0 percent to 26.6 per-
cent (see also “Events after the end of
the financial year”).
In December, Boliden sold all its shares
in the associated company, North Atlantic
Natural Resources AB, to Lundin Mining
AB. Boliden received 2,176,800 newly
issued shares in Lundin Mining AB, 
corresponding to 6.7 percent of the votes
and capital in the company after full
dilution. This transaction generated a
profit of SEK 67 million for Boliden
(see also “Events after the end of the
financial year”).
Boliden’s income model
Boliden’s profitability is greatly affected
by external factors such as metal prices,
exchange rates and treatment and refining
charges. The effect of these factors on
income and profitability can be summar-
ised in the following income model for
mines and smelters.
business area mining 
operations
Income
Metal price (LME, LBMA)  
– less treatment and refining 
charges (TC/RC) and adjust-
ments for quality and metal 
content
Income for Boliden’s Mining Operations
is primarily affected by the level of metal
prices and smelter charges (treatment and
refining charges), as well as exchange rates,
volumes and metal content in the ore
mined and milled.
The upswing in metal prices noted in
2004, coupled with lower treatment and
refining charges, has had a positive impact
on the result, while a lower exchange rate
against the US dollar has had a negative
impact.

Treatment and refining charges
(TC/RC)
Income for Boliden’s Smelting Operations
is primarily affected by the level of smel-
ting charges (treatment and refining
charges), exchange rates, unit costs and
volumes, and, to a lesser extent, metal
prices. The balance between mining and
smelting production is a key factor that
affects these smelter charges. The smelters
can hedge the metal price risk between
the purchase of raw materials and the
sale of finished metal to customers by
using short-term financial instruments.
The upswing in metal prices noted in
2004 has had a positive impact on the
result, while a lower exchange rate against
the US dollar and lower treatment and
refining charges have had a negative
impact. There is a correlation between the
price level for zinc and copper and smelter
charges. Despite the fact that the concen-
trate and metal markets are separate, they
both develop in line with global econo-
mic and industry-specific cycles.
Performance per Business Area
business area mining operations
The operations of Business Area Min-
ing are conducted in three areas in
Sweden – Aitik, the Boliden area and
Garpenberg, plus the Tara mine on
Ireland.
The 2004 operating result for Busi-
ness Area Mining Operations was posi-
tively affected by higher metal prices,
increased metal production and lower
treatment and refining charges, as well 
as the sale of land at the Tara mine. At
the same time, the result was negatively
affected by the lower income resulting 
from a weaker US dollar exchange rate
compared to last year.

Directors’ Report
Boliden’s mines are well positioned, with
competitive cost levels that are expected to
improve even further in 2005. Boliden’s
exploration activities will be allocated
greater resources during the year, with
the goal to increase the proven and pro-
bable ore reserves, primarily at Garpen-
berg and the Boliden area.
the modernised plant and the new direct
leaching process led to a number of pro-
duction disruptions. Zinc production
at Boliden Kokkola, however, reported
record levels.
Output from  Production Area Zinc
in Business Area Smelting Operations is
illustrated in the table below:

Production Area Zinc
The operations of Production Area Zinc
are conducted at the Kokkola smelter 
in Finland and at the Odda smelter in
Norway. The smelters are primarily in-
volved in casting zinc, although Odda
also manufactures aluminium fluoride.
The 2004 operating result for Pro-
duction Area Zinc was positively affected
by increased production and higher metal
prices, compared to last year. At the
same time, the lower exchange rate
against the US dollar, as well as lower
treatment charges, planned shutdowns
for repairs and maintenance work and
higher costs in connection with produc-
tion disruptions at Odda, had a negative
impact on the result. The modernisa-
tion of the Odda zinc smelter was
completed in the fourth quarter and cor-
responded to an investment totalling
approximately SEK 800 million. The
modernisation began back in 2003.

Operations within Production Area
Copper are conducted at the Rönnskär
smelter near Skellefteå, the Bergsöe smel-
ter in Landskrona and the Harjavalta/Pori
smelter in Finland. Production mainly
comprises copper, lead, precious metals
and zinc clinker.
Production Area Copper’s operating
result for 2004 was positively affected 
by higher metal prices, increased produc-
tion and a stock profit on the process
stocks at Rönnskär. At the same time,
the lower exchange rate against the US
dollar and lower treatment and refining
charges had a negative impact on the
result. Both Harjavalta and Bergsöe are
reporting some of their best results so far.

Within Production Area Copper the oper-
ations performed well, primarily report-
ing an increase in the output of copper
cathodes, lead and gold compared with
last year.
Rönnskär reported a production
record for copper cathodes, partly as a
result of the fact that anode copper from
Harjavalta can now be processed and
refined into cathodes at Rönnskär. Harja-
50
valta’s copper cathode production was in
line with that of last year. Greater pro-
duction optimisation and more stable
flows of external mining concentrates
also had a positive impact on output in
Production Area Copper. Production of
lead at Bergsöe was slightly lower than
last year.
Boliden’s access to external mining
concentrate will remain stable through-
out 2005. As of the beginning of the
year, supplies from the Portuguese mine,
Neves Corvo also increased in accordance
with the ten-year collaboration agreement
signed in 2004. Deliveries from Neves
Corvo will total between 150,000 and
200,000 tonnes of copper concentrate
per year, which corresponds to approxi-
mately one-fifth of Boliden’s external
requirements.

Ore reserves and exploration
Exploration is fundamental to mining
and metal companies, as their operations
depend on the discovery of new mine-
ralisations. At the same time, it also 
involves risk, as there are no guarantees
that the effort will lead to new discoveries.
boliden’s exploration strategy 
Boliden’s strategy is to prioritise mine-site
exploration. New discoveries close to an
existing mine mean that the time from
discovery to production can be reduced.
As existing infrastructure can be used, the
capital requirement is also lower. The
Company is involved in mine-site explor-
ation at all its mines in Sweden and in
Ireland. The primary objective of field
exploration is to secure mineral resour-
ces in the medium and long term. The
time from a discovery being made to 
a mine becoming operational is often
5-10 years, and sometimes even longer.
Field exploration is, by nature, more risky
than mine-site exploration. Boliden’s field
exploration is currently conducted under
its own management, and in cooperation
with other companies. The geographic
scope of Boliden’s field exploration has
been reduced, and now mainly focuses on
the Skellefte field and, to a lesser extent,
on Bergslagen and on Ireland.
development
The Company’s objective is to maintain
an ore reserve sufficient for at least ten
years of production for all its mines. A
number of promising new discoveries
have been made in the last five years,
although a great deal of work still remains
to be done before the discoveries are con-
verted into ore reserves.
The Lappberget mineralisation at Gar-
penberg is currently being developed and
has the potential to meet Boliden’s goal
of a ten-year reserve. Current test drilling
indicates that that this could be one of
the most promising mineralisations so far
discovered in Sweden.
At Kristineberg in the Boliden area,
development and drilling work are con-
tinuing in an area known as the J zone.
The information that has so far emerged
suggests higher mineral grades than those
noted for previous mineralisations in the
area.
The Tara area has considerable poten-
tial and Boliden is conducting ongoing
exploration work in the same areas as
existing proven reserves. Mining permis-
sion was obtained in 2004 for the Nevins-
town zinc mineralisation and production
began in the third quarter of that year.
Boliden invested SEK 120 million in
exploration during 2004, compared with
SEK 60 million, (excluding Tara), in last
year. A total of SEK 80 million (SEK 40
m) of this sum was for mine-site explora-
tion and the remainder was for field ex-
ploration. Exploration work has intensi-
Directors’ Report
fied during the year and is expected to 
remain at a high level in coming years
with a view to maintaining and develop-
ing the Company’s mineral resources.
Operating risks
currencies
Boliden’s costs are primarily denominated
in Swedish kronor, euro and Norwegian
kronor, while its income is primarily in
US dollars. The trend in the US dollar ex-
change rate therefore has a critical impact
on the Group’s results.

of factors. The most important long-term
factor is changes in industrial supply and
demand, but the activities of financial
players also have a major impact on prices.
Political factors have a greater impact on
the prices of precious metals such as gold
and silver.
Smelter charges, which for base metals
comprise treatment and refining charges,
are the primary components of the
remuneration received by smelters for
the refining of concentrates to metals.
They are negotiated annually by the
major players in the mining and smelt-
ing industries and serve as benchmarks
for smaller players, while some concen-
trate transactions are conducted at spot
prices.

ation (LBMA).
The high growth rate in 
the global economy, with 
Asia, and particularly China,
reporting very strong growth, 
has contributed to an increa-
sed demand for metals. Global consump-
tion of copper and zinc has been higher,
exceeding production of these metals and
contributing to lower stocks. Global con-
sumption of zinc increased by 7 percent
and the figure for copper was 6 percent,
while the increase in metal production
for zinc was only 2 percent, and for cop-
per 6 percent in 2004, as compared to
2003.
metal prices and hedges
The prices of Boliden’s most important
metals, i.e. zinc, copper, lead, gold and
silver, were considerably higher in 2004
than in 2003. 
Copper – in 2004, 42 percent of the
copper production at Swedish mines was
hedged at USD 2,820 per tonne (USD
1.28 per lb). For 2005, 46 percent of
planned copper production at Swedish
mines has been hedged at USD 2,568

future metal prices is otherwise essentially
unhedged.

The table below provides an estimate 
of the effects of metal price fluctuations
on Boliden’s results for 2005 as a whole.
Average metal prices
that the smelters receive for converting
metal concentrates from the mines into
refined metals. These payments are re-
negotiated annually by the world’s major
mining and smelting companies, and their
terms then set the norm for the rest of the
market. Treatment and refining charges
are affected in the long term by metal
prices and in the short term by the supply
of and demand for metal concentrates.
Individually, these payments are also affect-
ed by the quality of the metal concentrate
and the smelter’s geographic position in
relation to the mines.
The shortage of copper concentrate
during 2003 led to historically low levels
of treatment and refining charges in 2004.
The supply of copper concentrate increa-
sed in 2004, causing spot treatment char-
ges (TC/RC) to rise dramatically. In all
important respects, Boliden’s 2004 con-
centrate supplies were contracted and
the increased treatment and refining
charges will therefore not have an im-
pact on the Company until 
2005. Boliden will be renego-
tiating approximately 60 per-
cent of its concentrate supplies 
during 2005, and the remaind-
er during 2006.

Spot treatment charges for zinc reached
historically low levels in 2004. New
Boliden is naturally protected against
changes in treatment charges by the bal-
ance it has now established between its
mining and smelting production.
In spite of a dramatic increase in the
price of lead, the supply of lead concen-
trate remained limited, with historically
low spot treatment charges. Since Boliden
is a net seller of lead concentrate, the
Company benefits from low treatment
charges.

The environment
The principal environmental impacts of
Boliden’s mining and smelting operations
comprise land usage, emissions to air
and water, noise and vibration, consump-
tion of energy and chemicals and waste
deposition. With regard to these activities,
Boliden is subject to extensive environ-
mental legislation and regulation in
Sweden, Finland, Norway, Ireland and
other countries. Where applicable, it is
also subject to joint EU regulations con-
cerning storage, emissions and waste
management and the management of
chemicals. In accordance with its environ-
mental protection undertaking, Boliden
has introduced systems and routines to
reduce the environmental impact of its
mines and smelters.
All of Boliden’s operations hold the
permits required for their ongoing activ-
ities and expansions. Several units are
currently preparing permit applications
for future production increases and other
changes. All operations during the year
were conducted within the framework
imposed by legislation and applicable
terms and conditions.
Boliden believes that the Company has,
wherever possible, taken the required re-
clamation steps involved in decommis-
sioning and has made relevant financial
provisions for the costs involved in future
reclamation work at mines and within
other operations.

The adoption of International
Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) as of 2005
As of 1st January 2005, the Boliden
Group will apply International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Interim
Report for Q1 2005 will be presented in
accordance with IFRS, with recalculated
comparative figures for 2004.
The recommendations of the Swedish
Financial Accounting Standards Council,
which are applied by the group, are pri-
marily based on earlier versions of IAS
that, in certain respects, have subsequent-
ly been updated under IFRS. As a con-
sequence most of Boliden’s accounts are
already in compliance with IFRS. The
effects that arise are thus mainly limited
to the updates made to existing IAS stand-
ards and the issuing of new standards
(IFRS 1-6) and statements.
Employees
At year-end 2004/2005, the average
number of employees at Boliden was
4 479, of whom 2,243 were in Sweden,
1,180 in Finland, 366 in Norway, 661
in Ireland and 29 in other countries. 
This is a reduction of 418 since last year,
when the number of employees was
4,897. The reduction is due to the sale
of the Myra Falls mine in Canada.

The work of the Board of
Directors
Boliden’s Board of Directors comprises
eleven members, three of whom are
employee representatives. Risto Virran-
koski is the Chairman of the Board and
Carl Bennet is the Deputy Chairman.
The other Board members, all elected by
the Annual General Meeting, are Marie
Berglund, Satu Huber, Jan Johansson,
Tapani Järvinen, Anders Sundström and
Christoffer Taxell. Ordinary members
appointed by employee organisations are
Alf Lindén, Lars Sundström and Hans-
Göran Ölvebo.
During the 2004 financial year, the
Board held a total of twelve Board meet-
ings, four of which were ordinary meet-
ings. The meetings were held at locations
where the Group conducts operations. On
9th February 2005, the Board discussed
the results for 2004, after which the pre-
liminary financial statement was publish-
ed. At the same Board meeting, the audit-
ors presented their observations made in
the course of their audit of the year’s ac-
counting records and their review of the
consolidated closing accounts.
The Board of Directors establishes a
yearly agenda that regulates the work of
the Board in greater detail, as well as an
instruction concerning the division of
labour between the Board of Directors
and the President.
The agenda for the Board states that
that the Board will make decisions con-
cerning:
–  The adoption of budgets and business
plans for the year ahead
–  Policies
–  Investments or undertakings outside 
the scope of the day-to-day operations
–  Acquisitions and sales of companies or
operating branches
– Subscriptions for, or the purchase or
sale of, shares
–  Loans, guarantees and securities
outside the scope of the day-to-day 
operations
According to a decision made by the
Annual General Meeting on 26th April
2004, a nomination procedure is applied
when electing the Board of Directors. 
It involves the Chairman of the Board
summoning representatives of the largest
shareholders to a meeting, where they
formulate a proposal that is presented to
the shareholders’ meeting, which makes
a decision. This proposal also includes
suggestions concerning the remuner-
ation paid to members of the Board.
The same procedure is used when prepar-
ing proposals relating to the election of
the auditors and the remuneration paid
to them.
In addition, the Board of Directors has
appointed a Salaries Committee headed
by the Chairman of the Board and com-
prising three members of the Board to
handle salaries and terms of employment
for the President and issue guidelines for
the terms applying to other senior execu-
tives. The Board of Directors makes deci-
sions concerning the remuneration paid
to the President, while the President makes
decisions concerning the remuneration
paid to senior executives, following con-
sultation with the Chairman of the Board.
The Board of Directors as a whole serves
as the Audit Committee.

Directors’ Report
The transition to IFRS is expected to in-
crease in shareholders’ equity with SEK
159 million for 31st December 2004 and
SEK 165 million for 1st January 2005 re-
spectively. The net result for 2004 is ex-
pected to increase by SEK 165 million.
The change is mainly attributable to the
fact that goodwill will no longer be amort-
ised. Accounting principles provides a
more detailed analysis of the preliminary
effects.
Events after the end of 
the financial year
In January 2005, the sales process relating
to Bergsöe was terminated since the parties
were unable to reach agreement concern-
ing terms and conditions. The lead smelter
is now being integrated into Boliden’s
Production Area Copper.
At the beginning of March, Outokumpu
reduced its holding in Boliden by approxi-
mately 30 million shares and, following this
transaction, they hold the equivalent of
16.1 percent of the shares in Boliden AB.
In March 2005, Boliden sold all of its
2,176,800 shares in Lundin Mining
Corporation, corresponding to approxi-
mately 6.7 percent of the votes and share
capital before full dilution. Pursuant to
prevailing regulations concerning the so-
called lock-up period, Boliden has sold
the shares to an Accredited Investor. The
sale generates a capital gain for Boliden
of approximately SEK 20 million, which
will be reported in net financial items in
the first quarter of 2005.
Future development and 
outlook for 2005
Boliden’s profitability and cash flow is
significantly affected by a number of
external factors, the most important of
which are metal prices, exchange rates
and treatment and refining charges. The
metal price trend has remained positive
in early 2005, and the zinc price in par-
ticular has strengthened considerably. 
At the same time, the US dollar has
weakened.
The increasing volume of copper con-
centrate in the market has had a positive
impact on copper treatment charges, and
both contracted and spot prices have in-
creased substantially. Boliden is a net
purchaser of copper concentrate and there-
fore benefits from higher treatment char-
ges. In addition, the copper cathode pre-
miums for 2005 have increased. Together,
these factors will have a positive impact
on Production Area Copper.
The treatment charges for zinc in 2005
are expected to fall even further than in
2004. The continued shortage of zinc con-
centrate is expected to lead to a further
weakening of the treatment charges for
zinc in 2005 compared with 2004. Boli-
den has in principle established a balance
between its zinc mining and smelting
production, and will therefore only be
affected to a limited extent by changes in
the treatment charges.
Due to its acquisition of Outokumpu’s
mining and smelting operations, the new
issues, the refinancing and the positive
trend in its results in 2004, new Boliden
has become a far stronger company.
The Board of Directors believes that
the currently healthy market situation
will remain throughout 2005. The im-
provement in the underlying operations,
as well as greater synergies, current high
metal prices and increased treatment and
refining charges for copper will, in all
important aspects, offset the effects of the
currently low level of the US dollar. Bear-
ing this in mind, the result after financial
items in 2005 is expected to remain
healthy, and a substantial improvement in
free cash flow is also expected in 2005.
The Parent Company
The Parent Company conducts no ope-
rations and has no employees.
Dividends
The Board of Directors of Boliden pro-
poses to the Annual General Meeting
that no dividend be paid for the 2004
fiscal year. The Board of Directors of
Boliden has adopted a dividend policy
whereby approximately 1/3 of the earn-
ings after tax should be distributed over
a single business cycle. In its annual divi-
dend proposal, the Board has to take the
Company’s development and investment
requirements into account. The goal of
the Board of Directors is to propose to
the Annual General Meeting that divi-
dends be paid in accordance with this
policy as of the 2005 fiscal year.
Proposed allocation of profits
The Group’s non-restricted shareholders’
equity is negative. The Board of Directors
and the President propose that no divid-
end be paid and that the profits of SEK
879,085 thousand be carried forward.

Consolidated Income Statements
Net sales
Boliden’s net sales totalled SEK 17,928
million (SEK 9,545 m) for the year as a
whole. The increase in net sales is largely
an effect of the structural transaction with
Outokumpu, whereby Boliden acquired
mines and smelters. Significantly improv-
ed metal prices and increased production
within both the Business Area Mining
Operations and the Business Area Smelt-
ing Operations also had a positive impact
on net sales, while the lower exchange
rate against the US dollar had a negati-
ve impact.
Operating result
The operating result before depreciation
and amortisation (EBITDA) totalled
SEK 2,977 million (SEK 633 m). The
operating result (EBIT) improved to SEK
1,666 million (SEK -19 m), which cor-
responds to an operating margin of 9.3
percent (neg.). The improvement in the
operating result is primarily attributable
to the improved result within the mining
and smelting operations for copper. The
positive effects of increased synergies have
been partially offset by higher costs for
input goods during the year. Items of a
non-recurring nature have affected the
operating result during the reporting
period by a net amount of SEK 47 mil-
lion, (SEK -300 million in provisions for
cartel fines, SEK 86 million for reversal of
the reserve for operations sold, SEK 19
million from the sale of the Myra Falls
mine, SEK 175 million from the sale of
land at the Tara mine, and SEK 67 mil-
lion from the sale of shares in North
Atlantic Natural Resources AB). The
full-year result was furthermore affected
by a stock gain at Rönnskär of SEK 45
million (SEK -18 m).
Result after financial items
The result after financial items increased
to SEK 1,200 million (SEK -251 m).
Costs connected with the refinancing
had a negative impact on net financial
items with SEK 73 million.
Net result and taxes
The Group’s net result totalled SEK
1,055 million (SEK 13 m). The year’s
tax expense totalled SEK 145 million
(tax income SEK 265 million). This is
equivalent to a rate of 12 percent. The
lower rate is primarily due to the fact
that an amount of SEK 222 million,
relating to tax losses carried forward
previously not recorded as tax assets, 
has been taken as income during 2004.

Financial position
New Boliden’s financial position has im-
proved significantly as a result of improved
profitability, the structural transaction with
Outokumpu and the new rights issues that
have been carried out. With a debt/equity
ratio of 0.74 at the end of the year, Boliden
succeeded in meeting the financial target it
had set itself of a debt/equity ratio within
the 0.50–0.75 interval.

Financing
Boliden’s net debt totalled SEK 6,656
million (SEK 8,957 m) at the end of the
year. The decrease is largely due to the fact
that the proceeds from the rights issues
were used to amortise loans.
Assets and capital employed
The Group’s total assets have only in-
creased marginally during the year from
SEK 19,861 million at the start of the
year to SEK 20,017 million at the end
of the year.
On 31st December, capital employed
totalled SEK 15,197 million (SEK
14,790 m).

1) In order to provide an overall picture of the transaction with Outokumpu, the 2003 non-cash issue is reported in the Statement of Cash Flow even though it
does not affect cash flow.
The cash flow from operating activities
totalled SEK 1,552 million (SEK 956 m).
Acquisitions of tangible fixed assets totalled
SEK -1,534 million (SEK -610 m). The
increased investments are primarily attri-
butable to investments in Odda and Tara.
The operations conducted by Boliden are
characterised by major fluctuations in
working capital, since individual incoming
and outgoing metal concentrate deliveries
and outgoing deliveries of products from
the smelters command high values.
Net liabilities of SEK 2,799 million (a net
amount of SEK 4,613 in loans) were
amortised during the period. The cash
flow was positively affected by a total 
of SEK 2,250 million from new rights
issues, of which SEK 1,361 million came
from the rights issue during the first
quarter and SEK 889 million from the
directed rights issue during the fourth
quarter.

Accounting Principles
Accounting Principles
General accounting principles
The Annual Report has been compiled
in accordance with the provisions of the
Swedish Annual Accounts Act. The Com-
pany complies with the recommendations
and guidelines issued by the Swedish Fin-
ancial Accounting Standards Council
(Redovisningsrådet).
As of 1st January 2004, the Swedish
Financial Accounting Standards Council’s
recommendation, RR 29 Remunerations
to employees, has come into effect.
According to actuarial calculations of
pension plans categorised as defined bene-
fit plans, the pension liability increases
by SEK 160 million. The net increase
after tax, SEK 115 million, has been
booked directly to shareholders’ equity as
an effect of the accounting principle
change.
Consolidated Statements
The Consolidated Statements have been
compiled in accordance with the acquisi-
tion accounting method. The Consolidat-
ed Statements comprise those companies
in which the Parent Company, either
directly or through subsidiaries, holds
more than 50 percent of the votes, or
otherwise has a controlling influence.
Companies that have been sold are in-
cluded in the Consolidated Statements
up to and including the date of their sale.
Companies acquired during the current
year are included in the Consolidated
Statements as of the acquisition date.
Associated companies
Shareholdings in associated companies,
in which the Group has a minimum of
20 percent and a maximum of 50 percent
of the votes, or otherwise has a significant
influence over operational and financial
management, are reported in accordance
with the equity method.
Under the equity method, the con-
solidated book value of the shares in the
associated companies corresponds to the
Group’s share of the associated compa-
nies’ shareholders’ equity and any residual
values from consolidated surplus and defi-
cit values. Shares in associated companies’
results are reported in the Consolidated
Income Statement as part of the operating
result and comprise the Group’s share in
the associated companies’ net results.
Shares in profits accumulated after the
acquisition of associated companies but
not yet realised through dividends con-
stitute part of the Group’s restricted sha-
reholders’ equity.
Conversion of foreign subsidiaries and
other overseas operations
The current method is applied to con-
vert the Income Statements and Balance
Sheets of independent overseas operations.
Under the current method, all assets, pro-
visions and liabilities are converted at
the rate of exchange applying on the clo-
sing day, while all items in the Income
Statement are converted at the average
exchange rate. Any exchange rate diffe-
rences that arise are booked directly to-
wards equity. Accumulated translation
differences arising in connection with the
conversion of subsidiaries’ results have
been reported as of 1999.
Boliden hedges its net investments in
foreign subsidiaries by adopting the oppo-
site position in the relevant foreign curren-
cy. The exchange rate difference on the
hedging measures is booked directly
towards the Group’s shareholders’ equity
after adjustment for the fiscal effects.
In conjunction with the sale of inde-
pendently run overseas operations, the
accumulated translation differences 
attributable to operations are realised 
in the Consolidated Income Statement,
after deductions for any currency hedg-
ing activities.
Receivables and liabilities in 
foreign currencies
Receivables and liabilities in foreign cur-
rencies are converted at the closing day
exchange rate. Exchange rate differences
on operating receivables and operating
liabilities are included in the operating
result, while exchange rate differences on
financial receivables and liabilities are re-
ported under financial items. Receivables
and liabilities in foreign currencies that
have been hedged using futures are con-
verted at the future rates.
Short term investments
Holdings of securities or other invest-
ments that are not fixed assets and are
not designated as liquid assets are report-
ed as short term investments. Short term
investments are valued at whichever is
the lower of the acquisition value and
the true value on the Balance Sheet
date.
Liquid assets
Short term investments with a duration
of three months or less that can easily be
converted into cash are classified as
liquid assets, as are cash and bank
balances.
Income reporting
Product sales are reported at the time of
delivery to the customer in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the sale
whenever significant rights and obliga-
tions associated with the title transfer to
the purchaser. These sales are reported
net after VAT, discounts and exchange
rate differences when sales are made in
foreign currencies.
Income from activities outside the
sphere of the regular operations is report-
ed as other operating income.
64
Exploration, research and
development
Expenses associated with research and
development are primarily booked as
costs when they arise. When the financial
potential for the exploitation of a mine
deposit has been confirmed, the expenses
are booked as costs up to that date. After
that date, the expenses are capitalised as
deferred mining costs, the governing prin-
ciple of which is described under the head-
ing “Tangible fixed assets”.
Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets include goodwill,
brands, patents and licenses, and are
booked at their acquisition value.
Tangible fixed assets
Land, plants and equipment, and capital-
ised costs associated therewith for devel-
opment and pre-production measures
are booked at the acquisition value. Inter-
est expenses attributable to development
financing and completion of significant
tangible fixed assets are included in the
acquisition value. Repair and mainten-
ance expenses are booked as costs, while
substantial improvements and replace-
ments are capitalised. Deferred mining
costs at mines comprise both the waste
rock mining required to access the ore
body, plus work relating to infrastructural
facilities, roads, tunnels, shafts and in-
clined drifts as well as service, electrici-
ty and air distribution facilities.
Accounting Principles
that the deposit is believed to contain.
When the percentage of waste rock for
the mines remains relatively constant over
the useful life of the mines, the costs are
normally reported when they arise.
Depreciation, amortisation 
and write-down principles for 
fixed assets
Depreciation according to plan is based
on the original acquisition value (or,
where relevant, the appreciated values)
and the estimated economic lifespan. 
Goodwill arising in conjunction with
corporate acquisitions of long-term stra-
tegic value is amortised over a maximum
of 20 years. Other intangible fixed assets
are amortised according to plan over their
economic lifespans.
The Company normally depreciates
plants and equipment used in the min-
ing operations linearly over whichever is
the lower of their anticipated useful life
and the useful life of the mine to which
they relate. Smelters and production
plants are depreciated linearly over their
anticipated useful lives.
The following depreciation periods
are applied to tangible fixed assets:
significant respects, transferred from the
lessor to the lessee. Leasing agreements
that are not classified as financial leasing
agreements is classified as an operational
leasing agreements.
Assets held in accordance with finan-
cial leasing agreements are reported as
fixed assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet at the lower of the market value 
of the assets or the present value of the
future lease payments. The Group’s lia-
bility in relation to the lessor is reported
in the Balance Sheet under the heading
“Other interest-bearing liabilities”, bro-
ken down into a current and a long-
term part.
Lease payments are broken down into
interest and amortication of liability.
The interest is distributed over the lea-
sing period so that an amount correspon-
ding to the fixed interest amount payable
on the liability reported in each period
is charged to each reporting period. The
leased asset is depreciated according to
the same principles as those that apply
to other assets of the same type.
The leasing charges for operational
leasing agreements are booked as costs
on a linear basis over the leasing period.

Deferred mining costs arising from
Processing plants
capacity expansion of the mining opera-
tion, the development of new ore bodies
and the preparation of mining areas for
future production are capitalised and
written off concurrently with production.
Mining costs associated with waste rock
removal from open pit sites are capitali-
sed and booked as costs in the opera-
tions based on the average percentage of
waste rock per mine. The average percent-
age of waste rock is calculated as the esti-
mated number of tonnes of waste rock
and ore that must be mined divided by
the estimated number of tonnes of ore
Equipment, tools and fixtures 
and fittings
3-10 years
When events or changes in prevailing
conditions indicate that the book value
of fixed assets exceeds the recovery
value, it is written down to its value in
use corresponding to the present value of
estimated future net cash flows.
Leasing
A financial leasing agreement is an agree-
ment whereby the financial risks and
benefits associated with a title are, in all
65
Inventories
Inventories are valued at whichever is
the lower of the acquisition value in
accordance with the so-called first-in-
first-out principle and the true value,
taking into account the risk for obsole-
scence. The acquisition value of inven-
tories of metals from the Company’s
mines and semi-finished and finished
products manufactured in house com-
prises the direct manufacturing costs plus
a reasonable surcharge for indirect
manufacturing costs. Supplies invento-
ries are valued at whichever is the lower
of the average acquisition value and the
replacement value.
Accounting Principles
Taxes
The tax expense (income) for the period
comprises current tax and deferred tax.
Taxes are reported in the Income State-
ment except when the underlying trans-
action is booked directly to shareholders’
equity, in which case the associated fiscal
effect is also reported to shareholders’
equity.
Current tax is the tax calculated on
the tax-liable result for each period. 
The year’s tax-liable result differs from
the year’s reported result in that it has
been adjusted for non-taxable and non-
deductible items. The Group’s current
tax liability is calculated in accordance
with the taxation rates stipulated or
announced on the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is reported using the
Balance Sheet method. This method
stipulates that deferred tax liabilities are
reported in the Balance Sheet for all tax-
liable temporary differences between
reported and fiscal values of assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax receivables are
reported in the Balance Sheet in respect
of deficit deductions and all deductible
temporary differences to the extent that
it is likely that the amounts can be used
to offset future tax-liable surpluses. The
reported value of deferred tax receivables
is checked at the end of each accounting
period and reduced to the extent that it
is no longer likely that sufficient tax sur-
pluses will be available for its use. De-
ferred tax is calculated in accordance with
the taxation rates that are expected to
apply to the period in which the asset is
recovered or the liability is settled.
Both deferred and current tax receiv-
ables and tax liabilities are offset when
they relate to income tax levied by the
same tax authority and when the Group
intends to settle the tax in the form of 
a net amount.
Provisions
Provisions are reported when the Group
has, or may be considered to have, an
obligation as a result of events that have
occurred and it is likely that payments
will be required in order to fulfil this
obligation. In addition, one of the pre-
requisites is that it should be possible to
make a reliable estimate of the amount
to be paid.
Provisions are made for the estimated
reclamation costs for the mining opera-
tions that are expected to arise when the
operations are decommissioned and are
reported as costs over the total estimated
operating period. The cost is reported as
part of the mines’ cost of goods sold.
Pension undertakings
The Group has a variety of pension sys-
tems in accordance with local conditions
and practice in the countries in which its
companies operate. Provisions for pension
undertakings are calculated in accordance
with recommendation RR 29, Remunera-
tions to employees, issued by the Swedish
Financial Accounting Standards Council.
For pension systems where the emp-
loyer is committed to premium-based
solutions, the undertaking in relation to
the employee ceases when the agreed pre-
miums have been paid.
For other pension systems where a
pension defined as a benefit has been
contractually agreed, the undertaking
does not cease until the agreed pensions
have been paid out. Boliden performs an
actuarial calculation of pension under-
takings relating to defined benefit
arrangements. In these calculations,
Boliden takes account of future salary
increases, the discount rate and the
return on assets held for investment pur-
poses, as well as other significant actuari-
al assumptions needed to perform the
calculation.
The pension cost for the year compri-
ses the present value of pensions earned
during the year, plus interest on the under-
taking at the start of the year, less deduc-
tions for the return on the assets held for
investment purposes of each pension plan.
Amortisation of actuarial gains/losses
and for changes to plans is additional.
Actuarial gains and losses are amortised
over the average remaining working life
of the employees covered by each pension
plan. Accumulated gains and/or losses that
are less than 10 percent of whichever is
the higher of the pension undertaking
and the present value of assets held for
investment purposes are not amortised.
When the accumulated gain or loss
exceeds this 10-percent limit, the excess
amount is amortised over the average 
remaining period of employment. This
principle is applied to each pension plan.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities primarily comprise
liabilities to credit institutions. These 
liabilities are reported in the Balance
Sheet at their acquisition value on the
settlement date. Interest expenses are
distributed over a fixed period and are
reported on an ongoing basis in the
Income Statement. Borrowing costs are
capitalised and charged to the result
over the term of the loans.
Financial derivative instruments
Currency derivatives
The Company uses a combination of
currency futures and options to hedge
contracted and forecast future commer-
cial currency flows. Hedge accounting is
applied, which means that the effects of
the currency derivative on the result are
reported at the same point in time as the
effects of the underlying (hedged) trans-
action on the result. Outstanding curren-
cy derivatives that do not meet the criteria
for hedge accounting are valued at their
market value, while unrealised losses are
booked to net financial items.
Effects arising from the extension of
currency future contracts signed for hedg-
ing purposes are reported as assets and
liabilities in the Balance Sheet and are
reported in the same period as the under-
lying (hedged) transaction is booked to
the result.
Raw material derivatives
To some extent, the Company makes
use of raw material derivatives to hedge
its planned metal production.
66
Accounting Principles
The Company uses hedging transactions
to limit the exposure of its inventories
and protect it from changes in raw mate-
rial prices. Hedge accounting is applied,
which means that the effects of raw
material derivatives on the result are
reported in the same period as the
underlying payment flows. Outstanding
raw material futures that do not meet
the criteria for hedge accounting are
valued at their market value, while
unrealised losses are booked to net
financial items.
Information per business line
The Company’s accounting comprises the
three business line within the Group:
– Mining Operations
– Copper 
– Zinc
With regard to net sales, the supplemen-
tary information provided in respect of
geographical markets in Note 26 shows
the location of the external clients.
Assets and investments are reported in
each asset’s location.
67
Accounting Principles
The adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) as of 2005
As of the financial year starting on 1st
January 2005, the Boliden Group will be
applying International Financial Report-
ing Standards (IFRS).
According to the transition rules gov-
erning first-time adoption of IFRS, a
comparative year is required. In all report-
ing for 2005, financial information for
2004 must be reported in accordance with
IFRS. The transition date for Boliden’s re-
porting in accordance with IFRS is there-
fore 1st January 2004 and all financial in-
formation for this fiscal year is recalculat-
ed for comparison purposes. The Interim
Report for Q1 2005 will thus be present-
ed in accordance with IFRS and will
include recalculated comparative figures
for 2004.
IAS 39, which relates to financial instru-
ments, is exempted  from the requirement
concerning recalculation of the comparati-
ve year and will therefore only be applied
by Boliden as of 1st January 2005.
Those EU directives, under which the
transition is reported, require that IFRS
is presented in full financial reports,
which means that the rules in force at the
end of 2005 are the rules that should be
applied in the IFRS transition. The effects
presented below are preliminary, since
new standards or statements may be in-
troduced during 2005, which Boliden
may choose to apply retroactively. Among
other things, IASB issued IFRS 6 in
December 2004, “Exploration for and
Evaluation of Mineral Resources”, which
has not yet been adopted by the EU.
The standard applies to financial years
beginning after 1st January 2006, with
the possibility of an earlier adoption.
Boliden’s initial assessment is that the
standard will not have an effect on the
company’s results and position.
Since major changes have been made
to IFRS standards during 2004, it is
possible that new interpretations may
emerge during the period before the pub-
lication of the 2005 Annual Report.
Background  
The recommendations of the Swedish
Financial Accounting Standards Council
which are applied by the Group are based
on the recommendations issued by IASC
and the statements made by SIC (Stand-
ing Interpretation Committee). IASB
has thereafter updated several of the re-
commendations and introduced certain
SIC statements into the standards that
form the basis for the introduction 
of IFRS. In addition, IASB has issued
another five standards that will be applied
by Boliden when the transition to IFRS
takes place.
The work performed in identifying
the effects of the transition to IFRS has
primarily been focused on identifying
the effect on Boliden of changes in pre-
vailing norms and standards, as compared
with the standards on which the Swedish
Financial Accounting Standards Council
based its recommendations. Boliden has
also identified the effects of the applica-
tion of standards newly issued (IFRS 1-5).
The standards that are relevant to Boliden
correspond relatively well with the pre-
viously applied recommendations of the
Swedish Financial Accounting Standards
Council, and the effects are therefore
primarily limited to the new standards.
Voluntary exceptions
In the transition to IFRS, Boliden
applies IFRS 1 (First-time adoption of
International Financial Reporting
Standards). As a rule, IFRS 1 requires
the standards in force at the point of
transition to IFRS to be applied retro-
actively when determining the opening
balance on 1st January 2004 in accor-
dance with IFRS. IFRS 1 does however
permit certain exceptions from this retro-
active application and Boliden has thus
chosen to apply the following principles:
–  Only acquisitions and mergers com-
pleted from the transition date of 1st 
January 2004 are recalculated in accor-
dance with IFRS 3. The requirements
imposed by IFRS 1 with regards to 
recalculation in respect of certain 
acquisitions prior to this point in time
are not considered to have an impact 
on Boliden’s equity at the time of the 
transition.
–  Boliden has chosen to apply IAS 19
as of the transition date of 1st January
2004, which means, among other
things, that actuarial profits and losses
arising prior to this date are recorded 
in the opening balance of sharehol-
ders’ equity.
– According to IFRS, fixed assets may
not be written up, unless the revalua-
tion method is applied. IFRS 1 does 
however permit that a write-up made 
prior to the transition point can be 
regarded as the acquisition value at 
the time when the write-up was per-
formed. In light of the write-up of 
the Rönnskär plant, which that was 
performed in 2001 with SEK 2,066 
million net of deferred taxes, Boliden 
has chosen to make use of this exemp-
tion. The exemption rule also requires
that the value of the write-up was 
comparable with the market value of 
the asset.
–  Accumulated translation differences 
when translating foreign subsidiaries 
are closed out at the time of transi-
tion.
–  Share-related remunerations are report-
ed in accordance with IFRS 2 for all 
share-related remunerations awarded 
after 7th November 2002 and not

Changes in the market value of other
financial derivative instruments are record-
ed on an ongoing basis in the income
statement.
At the start of 2005, the difference
between market value and the book value
for other shareholdings was SEK 8 million
net of deferred taxes. The effect has been
recorded directly against shareholders’
equity.
The values of embedded derivatives in
contracts currently in force are not regar-
ded as material.
The comparative figures for 2004 will
not be recalculated in accordance with
IAS 39. Instead, the transition effects
will be reported as an adjustment in the
opening balance of 2005.
3. COMPONENT DEPRECIATION
With regard to IAS 16 (Tangible fixed
assets), Boliden will now be applying
component depreciation. The transition
to the application of component depre-
ciation in accordance with IFRS is not
believed to have an material effect on
the opening balance on 1st January 2004
or on the closing balance on 31st Decem-
ber 2004.

has chosen not to apply IFRS 2 retro-
actively prior to this date.
Above is a preliminary summary of the
expected effects the adoption of IFRS will
have on the Group’s shareholders’ equity
at the time of the transition and at the
end of 2004, as well as on the net result
for 2004. It also specifies the effects on
the Group’s shareholders’ equity on 1st
January 2005.
Explanatory notes
1. INTANGIBLE ASSETS  
According to IAS 38, intangible assets
should be classified as assets with a defin-
able period of use or as assets with an
indefinable period of use. According to
Boliden’s current principles, goodwill has
been amortised over a maximum of 20
years. According to IFRS 3, goodwill
should be classified as an asset with an
indefinable lifetime and may no longer
be amortised. Instead, impairment tests
should be performed as soon as there are
indications that there is a need for a write-
down and at least once a year. The tran-
sitional rules in IFRS 1 also require a
write-down test to be performed at the
time of the transition on 1st January 2004.
Boliden has performed write-down tests
that show that there is no need for a write-
down, either at the time of the transition
on 1st January 2004 or at the end of the
financial year ending on 31st December
2004.
In view of the adoption of IFRS as of
1st January 2004, all amortisation accor-
ding to plan performed in 2004 has been
reversed, increasing both the result and
shareholders’ equity at the end of the year
by SEK 165 million.
2. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
According to the version of IAS 39 ap-
proved by the EU, financial instruments
should initially be valued at fair value,
and should be valued on an ongoing basis
at either fair value or their accrued acqui-
sition value, depending on how they are
categorised. Under IAS 39, all financial
derivative instruments should be reported
on an ongoing basis at market value.
Changes in the market value of hedging
instruments, which according to IAS 39
qualify as hedging of future cash flows or
net investment in overseas operations, are
recorded against shareholders’ equity until
the underlying flows are reflected in the
income statement.
Boliden intends to apply hedge accoun-
ting for financial derivatives acquired in
order to hedge part of forecasted currency,
metal and interest flows. At the start of
2005, the market value of these derivatives
was negative SEK 3 million net of deferred
taxes, and has been recorded against share-
holders’ equity.

Staff stock options programme
A staff stock options programme, known as
the Stock Option Plan of Boliden Limited, was
introduced at Boliden Limited in 1997. Based
on this plan, allocations of stock options have
been made, free of charge, to key people dur-
ing the period 1997-2001. No stock options
have been issued since then. Outstanding
stock options, which originally granted entitle-
ment to acquire shares in Boliden Ltd., now
grant entitlement to acquire shares in Boli-
den AB, with 2,000 stock options granting
entitlement to 123 shares (one stock option
= 0.0615 shares). The new number of shares
per stock option was introduced in 2004 due

to the implemented new rights issues for
shareholders. No stock options have been
exercised in 2004. In 2001, the Company
issued convertible debentures, in order,
among other things, to ensure the fulfilment
of the Company’s undertakings with regard
to the stock options issued and to provide a
hedge against any social security contribu-
tions arising from the staff stock options
programme that may have a future impact
on the cash flow. Full exercise of outstanding
stock options is estimated to entail a dilution
of the total number of shares and votes in the
Company of approximately 0.09 percent. The
stock options are non-transferable. If employ-
ment with the Company ceases, the stock
options mature immediately if they cannot be
exercised at the time. Otherwise they mature
after 30 days. Holdings and principal terms
and conditions governing outstanding
options at the beginning of the year are
shown in the table above.
Remunerations to senior executives
Principles
Fees as approved by the Annual General
Meeting are payable to the Chairman of the
Board and to members of the Board. No
separate fee is payable for committee work.
Employee representatives receive no directors’
fees. Remuneration paid to the President and
other senior executives comprises the basic
salary, variable remuneration and other bene-
fits, as well, in some cases, as a pension and,
in a few cases, financial instruments. The
term “other senior executives” refers to the
eight people who, together with the President,
comprise the Group management. The break-
down between basic salary and variable remu-
neration shall be proportional to the executi-
ve’s responsibilities and authority. The variable
remuneration is maximised to 50 percent of
the basic salary for the President, while for
other senior executives, it is maximised to 
30-40 percent of the basic salary. The variable
remuneration is based on result in relation to
the Group’s EBITDA, free cash flow and indi-
vidual goals. Pension benefits and other bene-
fits paid to the President and other senior
executives are part of the total remuneration
package.
Remunerations and other benefits 
during the year
Fees totalling SEK 500,000 have been paid
during the year to the Chairman of the Board,
who is not employed by the Group. Other
Board members not employed by the Group
have received fees totalling SEK 1,500,000.
The President of Boliden AB has received
salary payments, variable remuneration and
other benefits totalling SEK 7,425,071
during the year. The basic salary accounts
for SEK 4,000,000 of this compensation,
while variable remuneration accounts for
SEK 1,300,000, pension benefits account
for SEK 2,010,876 and other benefits 
comprise SEK 114,195. A total of SEK
16,852,556 has been paid to remaining
members of the Group management (eight
people) in salaries, variable remuneration 
and other benefits. Basic salaries account
for SEK 11,062,000 of this compensation,
while variable remuneration accounts for
SEK 2,628,792, pension benefits for SEK
2,540,384 and other benefits for SEK
621,380. The term “variable remuneration” 
refers to all variable remuneration reported
as costs in the 2004 financial year and paid
out in 2005. Other benefits refer primarily
to company cars.
Variable remuneration
The variable remuneration paid to the Presi-
dent in 2004 was based on the Group’s
EBITDA and free cash flow. The variable re-
muneration for 2004 corresponded to 32.5
percent of the basic salary.
For other members of the Group manage-
ment, 80 percent of the variable remunera-
tion for 2004 was based on the Group’s
EBITDA and free cash flow and 20 percent
on their personal sphere of responsibility
and individual goals. The variable remunera-
tion paid to other members of the Group
management in 2004 corresponded to
18.6-28.8 percent of the basic salary.
Financial instruments, etc.
The President has 3,000,000 staff stock
options, entitling him to acquire 184,500
shares. These stock options were allocated
in 2001. The terms and conditions governing
the stock options are specified under the
heading “Staff stock options programme”
above. The other senior executives have no
stock options in the Company.
Pensions
The President is contractually entitled to reti-
re at the age of 60, at which time a pension
comprising 70 percent of his basic salary will
be paid up to the age of 65. From the age of
65, the retirement pension comprises 32.5
percent of the pensionable salary received
from the Company at the age of 60 and ex-
ceeding 20 times the basic amount. The sur-
vivor’s pension comprises approximately 50
percent of the retirement pension.
The retirement age varies between 60 and
65 for other members of the Group manage-
ment. Where relevant, the pension will be
paid between the ages of 60 and 65 at a
rate of 70 percent of the basic salary up to
the age of 65, when the normal retirement
pension will be paid.
Severance pay
The President and the Company shall give
three and six months’ notice of the termina-
tion of his/her position respectively. If notice
is given by the Company, severance pay cor-
responding to 18 months’ salary shall be
paid, over and above the notice period pay.
Other income shall be offset against the
severance pay. No severance pay shall be
payable in the event of notice being given by
the President.
Other members of the Group management
have notice periods of three months if they
give notice themselves. If notice of termina-
tion is given by the Company, the period of
notice is six months. In addition, severance
pay varying between 12 and 18 months’
salary is payable. Other income shall be off-
set against the severance pay. No severance
pay is payable in the event of notice being
given by members of the Group manage-
ment.
Preparatory and decision-making process
The Board’s Salary Committee has discussed
the principles applying to remuneration to
senior executives during the year, including
the proportions between fixed and variable
remuneration, the criteria for severance pay,
the terms and conditions for pensions and
the size of any pay increases.
Remuneration payable to the President for
the 2004 financial year has been determined
by the Salary Committee. Remunerations pay-
able to other senior executives have been de-
termined by the President after consultation
with the Chairman of the Board.
The Salary Committee comprises the Chair-
man of the Board, the Deputy Chairman and
one other member of the Board.
Stock options allocated by Outokumpu
In 2004, Outokumpu has allocated stock
options to four senior executives and a
further eight key staff members at Boliden.
All of these people are former Outokumpu
employees and were included in Outokumpu’s
staff stock options programme in 2003.
They transferred to Boliden in conjunction
with the Outokumpu transaction at the end of
2003 and none of them will be allocated any
further stock options. Each stock option
entitles the holder to subscribe for one share
in Outokumpu during the period from 1st Sep-
tember 2006 to 1st March 2009, both dates
included, at a price of EUR 10.70 per share
(less deductions for dividends paid during the
relevant intervening period). A total of 24,888
stock options were allocated to senior execu-
tives, and 22,628 stock options to other key
staff members.

In September 2004, the EU Commission fined Boliden’s subsi-
diary, Boliden Cuivre et Zinc SA, which has now been sold, for
having conducted cartel activities with regard to sanitary copper
tubing in the European market between 1988 and 2001. The
fine totals EUR 32.6 million (approx. SEK 300 million) and full
provision has been made for it. Boliden has appealed the decision
with regard to the size of the fine. Boliden has undertaken to com-
pensate Outokumpu for all claims arising that can be related to
the period up to the transfer of the companies to Outokumpu.

The Company’s goodwill primarily relates to the synergies arising in conjunction with the structural transaction with Outokumpu at the end
of December 2003.
According to Boliden’s current principles, goodwill has been amortised over a maximum of 20 years. According to IFRS 3, goodwill should
no longer be amortised. Instead, write-downs shall be performed as soon as there are indications of the need for a write-down, and additio-
nally at least once a year. Boliden has performed write-down tests showing that there is no need for a write-down, either at the time of the
transition, 1st January 2004, or at the end of the financial year on 31st December 2004.

Tax losses carried forward
Deferred tax receivables in respect of tax los-
ses carried forward in Sweden have been fully
utilised, since the Company believes that Boli-
den will be in a position to generate sufficient
taxable income in the future to benefit from
these tax losses carried forward. Unutilised
tax losses carried forward for which a defer-
red tax receivable has not been reported total-
led SEK 32 million in Canada and SEK 398
million in Ireland on 31st December 2004.
Other
The Boliden Treasury subsidiary was subject-
ed to a tax audit in 2002 in respect of the
financial years 1998 to 2000. The Company
has received a ruling from the Swedish Nati-
onal Tax Board that calls into question tax
losses carried forward totalling SEK 2,043
million, as well as imposing a tax surcharge
of SEK 29 million. The ruling has been appea-
led and the Company has been granted a
payment respite for charges occasioned by
the ruling. No provisions have been made as
a consequence of the ruling. The questioned
tax losses carried forward are not included in
the compilation above, and are thus not inc-
luded in deferred tax receivables either. The
Norwegian tax authority has asked a number
of questions concerning a reprocessing agree-
ment for zinc concluded by Boliden Odda AS
("BNZ") and Boliden Zink Commercial BV
("BZC"). The initial written exchange between
BNZ and the Norwegian tax authority indica-
tes that the tax authority believes that it has
grounds for assuming that the agreement was
not concluded on market terms. The Com-
pany’s assessment is that the outlook for
showing that the agreement was concluded
on market terms is good. Since the tax aut-
hority’s investigation has not been completed
and no demands have been made concerning
changes/measures, it is currently impossible
to judge whether this issue is likely to form
the object of a dispute.

The Board of Directors of Boliden intends to
propose to the Annual General Meeting that
no dividend be paid for the 2004 financial
year. At the AGM, the Board of Directors will
be presenting Boliden’s new dividend policy.
The Board’s objective is, as of the 2005
financial year, to propose to the AGM that
dividends be paid in accordance with this
new policy.
During 2001, convertible debentures with
a total nominal amount of SEK 18,585 were
issued. They may be converted into a total
of 457,194 shares in Boliden AB (taking
account of the recalculation implemented as
a result of the Company’s new rights issue 
in 2004, which gave preferential rights to
shareholders). On full conversion, this would
correspond to a maximum dilution of the
total number of shares and votes in the
Company of 0.16 percent. The convertible
debentures were issued to ensure the avail-
ability of shares in Boliden AB for the fulfil-
ment of obligations to holders of issued staff
stock options and warrants in Boliden Ltd,
as well as to cover any social security contri-
butions arising from the staff stock options.
Taking account of the fact that staff stock
options have matured since the issue, max-
imum conversion into shares is estimated to
lead to a total of approximately 412,203
shares, corresponding to a dilution of the
total number of shares and votes in the
Company of 0.14 percent.
NOTE 17   PROVISIONS FOR PENSIONS AND SIMILAR UNDERTAKINGS
Boliden has defined benefit pension plans in Sweden, Norway and Ireland that may or may not be placed in funds. Pension undertakings in
Sweden are covered by the Swedish PRI/FPG system and by insurance companies. Pension arrangements outside Sweden are adapted to
local conditions and are a function of the number of years worked and the final salary. They are generally coordinated with national pension
schemes. Defined contribution pension plans exist in Sweden and Finland. Boliden’s provisions for pension undertakings are calculated in
accordance with recommendation RR 29, Remunerations to employees, issued by the Swedish Financial Accounting Standards Council.

NOTE 19   FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Boliden Group is exposed to a number
of financial risks that primarily arise because
the Group is a net borrower and buys and
sells metals priced in foreign currencies.
Changes in metal prices, treatment char-
ges, exchange rates and interest levels affect
the Group’s results and future cash flows.
Boliden is also exposed to refinancing and
liquidity risks, as well as credit and counter-
party risks.
Boliden has a centralised treasury func-
tion primarily tasked with providing support
to the management and operative units in
line with the adopted finance policy. The
treasury function is also responsible for
identifying and efficiently limiting the Group’s
financial risks. This centralisation leads to
healthy internal risk control and expertise,
as well as financial and administrative eco-
nomies of scale. The Group’s finance policy
is adopted every year by the Board of Direc-
tors and regulates the way in which the
financial risks should be managed, as well
as specifying limits and stipulating the finan-
cial instruments that may be used.
Currency risk
Through its international operations, Boli-
den is exposed to currency risks, in that
exchange rate fluctuations affect the Con-
solidated Income Statement and Balance
Sheet. The Group’s currency exposure
covers both transaction exposure and
translation exposure.

Transaction exposure
The Group’s transaction exposure arises
because considerable parts of the commer-
cial payment flow consist of foreign curren-
cies. When exchange rates fluctuate, future
sales and purchases in foreign currencies
are affected and this in turn affects the
Group’s results. The finance policy stipula-
tes that all reported accounts receivable
and accounts payable that are of substanti-
al value must be hedged.
The Group’s costs are mainly denominated
in Swedish kronor, euro and Norwegian kro-
nor, while its income is largely based on the
US dollar. The trend in the exchange rate for
the US dollar therefore has a major impact
on the Group’s results.
Translation exposure
When the net assets (shareholders’ equity
and surplus values allocated Groupwise to
overseas subsidiaries) of foreign Group com-
panies are converted into Swedish kronor,
a translation difference arises in conjunction
with exchange rate fluctuations, and this
has an impact on the Group’s shareholders’
equity. The finance policy stipulates that the
effect of this exposure shall be eliminated
with the aid of currency futures and external
borrowing.
Metal price risk
Metal price risks arise on an ongoing basis
in the Group’s operations, since the smelter
process requires raw materials in the pro-
cess stocks. The risk lies in the fact that
raw materials are purchased from mines at
one point in time and sold in refined form
to customers at another. The finance policy
states that this type of stock-related risk
shall be normalised. Metal price risks also
arise when metals (raw materials) are sold
externally by the Group’s mines.
Interest risk
Interest-bearing borrowing leads to exposure
to interest risks for the Group. The term
“interest risks” refers to the risk of a nega-
tive effect on the Group’s results and cash
flows as a result of fluctuations in the market
interest rate. The speed with which a lasting
change in interest levels impacts on the
Group’s net financial items depends on the
fixed-interest term of the loans. On 31st
December 2004, the Group’s loan portfolio,
including outstanding interest swaps, had a
weighted average fixed interest term of
seven months. On an annual basis, a change
of one percentage point in the market inte-
rest rate entails an effect on the result of
SEK +/- 67 million, when the interest rate
is variable.
Refinancing risk and current liquidity
The term “refinancing and liquidity risk” re-
fers to the risk that Boliden will be unable
to meet its payment undertakings due to
insufficient liquidity or to difficulties in raising
external loans. Boliden limits its refinancing
risk by ensuring that its gross loan liability
78
Notes
has a healthy counterparty spread and
length. Boliden works actively to ensure
satisfactory current liquidity by making app-
ropriate use of unutilised credit facilities.
At the turn of the year, there was SEK
1,070 million in unutilised binding credit
facilities. Boliden has established a cash
pool structure that enables it to maintain
a central overview of liquidity flows and en-
sure efficient management of the Group’s
overall liquidity.
Credit and counterparty risk
The term “credit and counterparty risk” refers
to the risk that a counterparty in a trans-
action may fail to fulfil their obligation, thus
causing the Group to incur a loss. In order
to limit counterparty risk, only highly credit-
worthy counterparties are accepted in accord-
ance with the adopted finance policy, and
wherever possible, the commitment per
counterparty is limited.
Boliden is primarily exposed to counter-
party risk when trading in derivative instru-
ments. In order to limit this exposure, net-
ting agreements have been signed in accord-
ance with the stipulations of the Inter-
national Swaps and Derivatives Association
(ISDA). On 31st December 2004, the total
counterparty exposure in derivative instru-
ments was SEK 87 million (calculated as
the net receivable per counterparty).
Risk Management and insurance
The objective of the Risk Management
function at Boliden is to minimise the total
cost of the Group’s damage and injury risks.
This is achieved both by continuously enhan-
cing the damage and injury prevention and
control work conducted within the oper-
ations, and by introducing and developing
Group-wide insurance solutions.

Since all loans have a fixed interest term of
3-6 months, the actual value corresponds to
the true value.
In October 2004, Boliden successfully con-
cluded an agreement concerning a syndicated
credit facility of EUR 840 million. The new
loan agreement requires no collateral and
entails a substantial improvement in the
terms of the loan. Among other things, it
also enables future dividends to be paid to
shareholders. The syndicated loan runs until
2009 and has a contractually stipulated amor-
tisation plan. The weighted average term of
the interest-bearing gross loan liability at the
turn of the year was 5.2 years.

NOTE 21   FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
Boliden uses financial derivative instruments to manage currency risks, metal price risks (raw materials risks) and interest risks arising within
its operations. Financial derivative instruments used to hedge forecasted cash-flows are reported as hedge accounting, which means that
unrealised results are reported off-balance until such time as the underlying flows are reflected in the Income Statement. The deferred pro-
fit/loss on hedging transactions (including the closed-out hedge totalling SEK 157 million) was SEK 153 million on 31st December 2004.

In addition to the above specifications under the heading of contingent liabilities and the details included in the financial information, it is
possible that the Group may incur environmentally related contingent liabilities attributable to legal proceedings, which cannot currently
be calculated although they may in the future entail costs or investments.
Environmental and reclamation costs
All the Company’s mines are subject to recla-
mation requirements in conjunction with de-
commissioning. The minimum norms for re-
clamation have been set by the authorities
in the various countries in which the Com-
pany operates. Provision is made on an on-
going basis for reclamation costs, based on
the estimated costs of complying with appli-
cable reclamation norms. The Company’s esti-
mate of the total provision requirement for
reclamation costs may be amended as a
result of changes to laws and statutes, inter-
pretations of the same, and amendments to
cost estimates.
Legal proceedings
Overview
The Company conducts extensive domestic
and international operations and is occasio-
nally involved in disputes and legal procee-
dings arising in the course of the operations.
These disputes and legal proceedings are
not expected, either individually or together,
to have any significant negative impact on
Boliden’s operating results, profitability or
financial position, over and above that detail-
ed below.
Disputes
Copper tubing cartel
In September 2004, the European Commis-
sion fined Boliden AB and its two former sub-
sidiaries, Boliden Cuivre et Zinc SA (“BCZ”)
and its parent company, Boliden Fabrication
AB. The fine totalled EUR 32.6 million (approxi-
mately SEK 300 million), and is a result of
the proceedings initiated in August 2003
pursuant to Article 81 in the European Com-
munity treaty and Article 53 in the European
Economic Area agreement. At the same time
seven other companies were fined. Boliden
has made a provision for the fine.
According to the European Commission, BCZ
and the other companies have engaged in
cartel activities in the European market for
sanitary copper tubing over the period from
1988 to 2001. In all significant respects,
Boliden has acknowledged the European Com-
mission’s description of the factual circum-
stances. The Company has appealed the
Commission’s ruling, requesting that the fine
be reduced.
In February 2005, Boliden received a sum-
mons as part of a class action that has been
brought before a court in California following
a procedure whereby three previous class
actions were merged. The suit is based on
the infringements identified in the European
Commission’s ruling and is addressed to all
the companies covered by the European Com-
mission’s ruling. The plaintiffs are persons
who claim to be so-called indirect buyers of
sanitary copper tubing and also claim to re-
present all other such buyers in California.
The plaintiffs are requesting triple damages,
as well as other compensation, the amount
of which remains unspecified. Boliden has
also been informed that another three class
actions have been initiated or are about to
be initiated in the US, but has not received
any official summons yet with regard to these
cases. Boliden cannot exclude the possibility
that other similar cases may be brought with-
in the near future. To the best of Boliden’s
knowledge, neither Boliden nor its two former
subsidiaries sold sanitary copper tubing in
the US during the relevant period. In spite of
this, however, Boliden is at present unable
to judge the outcome of either the class
actions that it knows of, or of potential other
measures taken by individuals or authorities
on the basis of the European Commission’s
ruling and the alleged infringements in ques-
tion. The Company intends to dispute all such
measures vigorously.
As previously stated, BCZ and Boliden Fabri-
cation AB have been transferred to Outo-
kumpu. Boliden has undertaken to indemnify
Outokumpu for any and all claims that may
arise relating to the period up to the trans-
fer of the companies to Outokumpu.
Disputes arising out of the dam breach 
accident in Spain
In April 1998, a dam breach occurred in a
tailings pond at the Los Frailes mine in Spain,
which was then owned by Boliden’s subsidiary,
Boliden Apirsa S.L. (“Apirsa”). Apirsa is cur-
rently in the process of liquidation.
Following the dam breach, criminal proceed-
ings were initiated against Apirsa and its re-
presentatives. In December 2000, the pro-
secutor dropped the case and in November
2001, Apirsa and its representatives were
cleared of all criminal liability for the accident.
The criminal proceedings determined that the
accident was caused by design and construc-
tion errors in the dam, not by Apirsa’s oper-
ations at the mine.
The ”not guilty” ruling in the criminal case
notwithstanding, the Spanish Ministry of the
Environment has declared Apirsa liable to pay
an amount corresponding to approximately
EUR 45 million (approximately SEK 408 mil-
lion) in clean-up costs, damages and fines.
Apirsa’s appeal was rejected by the Spanish
Supreme Court on 26th November 2004.
Apirsa has appealed to the Spanish Consti-
tutional Court. The Spanish Ministry of the
Environment has demanded payment from
Apirsa. This has resulted in Apirsa initiating
so-called insolvency proceedings in January
2005 in order to ensure an orderly closu-
re of the company. Apirsa’s ability to pursue
the proceedings mentioned below against
the companies responsible for the design
and construction of the dam at which the
accident occurred is not considered to be
82

NOTE 24   CONT.
affected by the insolvency proceedings.
As a result of the dam breach, the local
government in the province of Andalusia, the
Junta de Andalucia, sued Apirsa, Boliden BV
and Boliden AB in a civil court for damages
totalling approximately EUR 89 million (ap-
proximately SEK 806 million). The suit was dis-
missed on formal legal grounds. The ruling
was appealed, but the appeal was rejected
by a higher court in the autumn of 2003.
Since the dismissal of the suit in the civil
court, the local government in Andalusia has
initiated administrative proceedings against
Apirsa, Boliden BV and Boliden AB in respect
of the same claim. In these proceedings, the
Junta de Andalucia has itself imposed an
obligation on the three Boliden companies to
pay the amount claimed. Apirsa, Boliden BV
and Boliden AB are currently appealing this
decision and have requested the court to
grant them a stay of enforcement until such
time as the case has been settled. This stay
of enforcement has been granted on condi-
tion that a bond of EUR 108 million (approxi-
mately SEK 978 million) was provided. The
three companies have appealed the decision
concerning the provision of a bond.
Based on the legal advice and opinions
given by the Company’s Spanish legal coun-
sel, Boliden’s overall view is that the Com-
pany will not suffer any substantial financial
damage as a result of the legal proceedings
described.
During 2002, following the final ruling in
the criminal proceedings that the dam
breach was caused by design and construc-
tion errors, Apirsa initiated proceedings in
civil court against the companies respons-
ible for the dam’s design and construction
and against their insurance companies. The
summons application, with its claim for app-
roximately EUR 115 million (approximately
SEK 1,042 million), was submitted in January
2004 and in September 2004, the defend-
ants submitted their responses. The claim
will be increased by any and all amounts
that the Company is ultimately required to
pay as a result of the above proceedings.
Class action in Canada
Two class actions, one in British Columbia
and one in Ontario, both claiming damages,
have been brought by people who acquired
shares in Boliden Ltd. in connection with its
stock market flotation in Toronto. Both cases
are based on claims that the information in
the prospectus issued in conjunction with
the flotation gave an inaccurate picture of
the circumstances surrounding the dam at
the Los Frailes mine in Spain where an acci-
dent occurred in 1998.
The class action in Ontario involves claims
for damages totalling CAD 400 million. No
amount has yet been specified in the class
action in British Columbia. The class actions
are at their initial stages and it is at present
too early for the Company to comment on
Boliden Ltd’s potential liability for the claims
made. If Boliden Ltd should be found liable
for damages, it intends, pursuant to an in-
demnity undertaking by Trelleborg AB con-
cluded at the time of Boliden Ltd’s stock
market flotation, to transfer this liability to
Trelleborg AB. Based on the opinion of its
Canadian legal counsel, Boliden believes that
the indemnity should cover any damages
that may be imposed on Boliden Ltd. Boliden
is of the opinion that Trelleborg AB current-
ly has the financial capacity to fulfil its obli-
gation to indemnify Boliden Ltd. No guaran-
tee can however be given that Boliden Ltd
would be indemnified if damages should
actually be imposed on Boliden Ltd at some
time in the future. Under the terms of an
agreement between Boliden Ltd and Boliden
AB in conjunction with the relocation of
Boliden’s registered office from Canada to
Sweden, Boliden has undertaken to indemni-
fy Boliden Ltd with regard to all disputes and
legal proceedings extant on 5th December
2001 (the date of the relocation of the
Company’s registered office). The only dis-
putes still in progress are the class actions
in British Columbia and Ontario. Boliden AB’s
undertaking is only relevant if Trelleborg AB
is unable to fulfil its undertakings with regard
to Boliden Ltd pursuant to the contingent
liability.
Tax issues
Write-down of receivables
As a result of the 2002 audit of Boliden
Treasury’s tax returns for the 1998-2002
financial years, the Swedish National Tax
Board has disallowed the deductions made
for write-downs of receivables from associ-
ated companies totalling SEK 2,043 million
and has imposed a tax surcharge of SEK 29
million on the Company. The Company has
appealed against the ruling to the county
administrative court and has been granted a
payment respite for the tax surcharge until
such time as the case is settled. The Swe-
dish National Tax Board’s ruling may lead
to a corresponding reduction in the Com-
pany’s tax losses carried forward. The ques-
tioned tax loss carried forward has not been
valued and is not included in deferred tax
receivables. The Company has made no pro-
visions pending a final ruling.
Odda
The Norwegian tax authority has questioned
some of the circumstances surrounding a
zinc reprocessing agreement between Boliden
Odda AS and Boliden Zink Commercial BV.
The initial written exchange between Odda
and the Norwegian tax authority indicates
that the tax authority believes that it has
grounds for asserting that the agreement
was not concluded on market terms. The
Company takes the view that there are no
grounds for the tax authority’s statements.
The tax authority has not informed the Com-
pany as to whether it intends to proceed with
this matter or as to the form of rectification
that may be required.

NOTE 27   TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
No member of the Board or senior executive
at the Company participates or has partici-
pated, either directly or indirectly, in any
business transactions occurring during the
current or previous financial year between
themself and the Company which are or were
unusual by nature in respect of their terms.
Nor has the Group granted loans, issued
guarantees or provided sureties for any of
the members of the Board or senior execu-
tives at the Company.
In conjunction with the transaction in
December 2003, Boliden and Outokumpu
concluded agreements concerning services
and technical exchange between Boliden and
Outokumpu after the completion of the trans-
action. These agreements were concluded 
on a business basis and on market terms.
Some of the agreements were concluded
with a view to simplifying the separation of
the Outokumpu units from the Outokumpu
Group. Within the framework of its operating
activities, Boliden may also, from time to
time, conclude agreements with Outokumpu
on market terms.
NOTE 28   EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR
In January 2005, the sales process relating
to Bergsöe was terminated since the parties
were unable to reach agreement concerning
terms and conditions. The lead smelter is
now being integrated into Boliden’s Produc-
tion Area Copper.
At the beginning of March, Outokumpu re-
duced its holding in Boliden by approximately
30 million shares and following this transac-
tion they hold the equivalent of 16.1 percent
of the shares in Boliden AB.
In March 2005, Boliden sold all of its
2,176,800 shares in Lundin Mining Corp-
oration, corresponding to approximately 6.7
percent of the votes and capital before full
dilution. Pursuant to prevailing regulations
concerning the so-called lock-up period, Boli-
den has sold the shares to an Accredited
Investor. The sale generates a capital gain
for Boliden of approximately SEK 20 million,
which will be reported in net financial items
in the first quarter of 2005.

Audit Report
Audit Report
To the General Meeting of the Shareholders of Boliden AB (publ)
Corporate identity number 556051-4142
We have audited the annual accounts, the
consolidated accounts, the accounting
records and the administration of the
board of directors and the managing
director of Boliden AB for the financial
year 2004. These accounts and the admin-
istration of the company and the appli-
cation of the Annual Accounts Act when
preparing the annual accounts and the
consolidated accounts are the responsi-
bility of the board of directors and the
managing director. Our responsibility 
is to express an opinion on the annual
accounts, the consolidated accounts and
the administration based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards
in Sweden. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance that the annual
accounts and the consolidated accounts
are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the accounts. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting prin-
ciples used and their application by the
board of directors and the managing
director and significant estimates made
by the board of directors and the man-
aging director when preparing the annual
accounts and consolidated accounts as
well as evaluating the overall presentation
of information in the annual accounts
and the consolidated accounts. As 
a basis for our opinion concerning 
discharge from liability, we examined 
significant decisions, actions taken and
circumstances of the company in order
to be able to determine the liability, 
if any, to the company of any board
member or the managing director.
We also examined whether any board
member or the managing director has, 
in any other way, acted in contravention
of the Companies Act, the Annual
Accounts Act or the Articles of
Association.
We believe that our audit provides a rea-
sonable basis for our opinion set out
below.
The annual accounts and the consoli-
dated accounts have been prepared in
accordance with the Annual Accounts
Act and, thereby, give a true and fair
view of the company’s and the group’s
financial position and results of operations
in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in Sweden. The
statutory administration report is consist-
ent with the other parts of the annual
accounts and the consolidated accounts.
We recommend to the general meeting
of shareholders that the income statements
and balance sheets  of the parent com-
pany and the group be adopted, that the
profit of the parent company be dealt
with in accordance with the proposal in
the administration report and that the 
members of the board of directors and
the managing director be discharged from
liability for the financial year.

Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, and
has more than 35 years’ experience in the
mining and minerals industry.
“Tara’s Ore Reserves and Mineral
Resources” have been compiled by John
Ashton, Chief Mine Geologist, Tara Mines
Ltd. John Ashton is a “Qualified Person”
and a member of the Institute of Materi-
als, Minerals and Mining and of the Insti-
tute of Geologists Ireland, and has more
than 25 years’ experience of the mining
and mineral industry.
Ore reserves
Ore reserves are those parts of a mineral
resource that can be mined and process-
ed in accordance with the company’s
demands on profitability. In this context,
the waste rock dilution, pillar offset and
process yields, among other things, are
taken into account. Ore reserves are div-
ided into the following categories:
Probable ore reserve
Those parts of a measured and indicated
mineral resource where mining engineer-
ing and profitability studies show that it
is technically and economically feasible
to mine and process the find.
Proven ore reserve
Those parts of a measured mineral re-
source where mining-engineering and
profitability studies show that it is tech-
nically and economically feasible to mine
and process the find.
The lowest acceptable metal grade is
calculated separately for each deposit
and depends, among other things, on
the properties of the deposit and on the
mining, ore haulage, milling, concen-
trate haulage and administration costs.
The costs are compared with the value of
the product, taking into account treat-
ment charges.

1) Excluding Storliden, which is owned by NAN. The ore is treated in Boliden Area’s concen-
trator. Roundings may occur.
Mineral resources are reported in addition
to ore reserves in Boliden’s financial re-
ports. The ore reserves and mineral re-
sources have been calculated and compiled
in accordance with the Australasian In-
stitute of Mining and Metallurgy’s JORC
code. This is comparable with “CIM
Standards on Mineral Resources and Min-
eral Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines”
adopted by CIM on 20th August 2000,
and which constitutes that part of the
Ontario Securities Commission (OSC)
rules and regulations, National Instrument
43-101, that regulates how ore reserves
and mineral resources should be reported.
Boliden reports in accordance with 
NI 43-101 and the recommentions ac-
cepted by the Swedish Mining Association,
which, wherever applicable, are identical
to the Canadian rules.
Boliden’s mineral resources and ore re-
serves (excluding Tara) have been compil-
ed under the supervision of Mati Sallert,
Ore Reserves and Project Evaluation Man-
ager. Mati Sallert is a “Qualified Person”
according to NI 43-101, a “Qualified
Person” according to the Swedish Mining

Metal price forecast
Long-term metal price forecasts are used
when calculating ore reserves, and are
an expression of the anticipated average 
prices over the forthcoming economic
cycle, which is usually around ten years.
The long-term metal price forecasts are

SEK exchange rate of 8.50, as per table

Mineral resources
A mineral resource is a concentration of
minerals in the bedrock that may become
commercially extractable. Mineral re-
sources are at present condition not feas-
ible to mine. They are divided into the
following categories:
Inferred mineral resource
A mineral resource identified through
drilling, sampling and geo-scientific inter-
pretation with information so sparse that
the geology and grade continuity cannot
be confirmed and where the basic tech-
nical data consists of reasonable assump-
tions. This means that continued investi-
gations will not with any degree of cer-
tainty enable the entire inferred mineral
resource, or parts of it, to be moved to
a higher category.
Indicated mineral resource
A mineral resource identified through
drilling and sampling with an information
density that is too sparse to confirm con-
tinuity, but which, together with geo-
scientific interpretations, nevertheless pro-
vides a reasonable idea of the geology and
grade continuity that is sufficient to en-
able technical and economic calculations 
to be performed to assess the project’s
profitability.
