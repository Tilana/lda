<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its twenty-second session from 4 to 
</p>
<p>15 May 2015. The review of Bulgaria was held at the 8th meeting, on 7 May 2015. The 
</p>
<p>delegation of Bulgaria was headed by the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Katia 
</p>
<p>Todorova. At its 14th meeting, held on 12 May 2015, the Working Group adopted the 
</p>
<p>report on Bulgaria. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Bulgaria: C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Ireland and Pakistan. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following 
</p>
<p>documents were issued for the review of Bulgaria: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report (A/HRC/WG.6/22/BGR/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) (A/HRC/WG.6/22/BGR/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) Summary prepared by OHCHR (A/HRC/WG.6/22/BGR/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, 
</p>
<p>Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Bulgaria through the 
</p>
<p>troika.1 These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b>  A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation stated that the national report had been prepared through a 
</p>
<p>cooperative and transparent process with the participation of relevant State bodies and 
</p>
<p>based on the valuable input of civil society representatives. The draft was published on the 
</p>
<p>official page of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for broad public discussions.  
</p>
<p>6. Since its first universal periodic review, the Government has made efforts to 
</p>
<p>implement the  recommendations of the review and to enhance the capacity of the human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms. Bulgaria submitted a voluntary midterm report in 2013. The delegation 
</p>
<p>highlighted the significant progress achieved in strengthening the institutional and 
</p>
<p>legislative framework for the promotion and protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>7. In 2013, the National Coordination Mechanism on Human Rights<b> </b> was established 
</p>
<p>in order to improve coordination among the relevant authorities and representatives of civil 
</p>
<p>society in implementing the  international human rights obligations of Bulgaria. Bulgaria 
</p>
<p>introduced the practice of establishing working groups in the process of follow-up to the 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review recommendations. The national human rights institutions had 
</p>
<p>served as members of those working groups. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Circulation by the universal periodic review secretariat of the advanced questions submitted by 
</p>
<p>Sweden was delayed owing to technical reasons. </p>


<p>8. In 2011, the Commission for Protection against Discrimination and the Ombudsman 
</p>
<p>were accorded &#8220;B&#8221; status by the International Coordinating Committee of National Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Institutions. The Ombudsman had been acting as a national preventive mechanism 
</p>
<p>after the recent amendments to the Ombudsman Act. 
</p>
<p>9. Since 2011, the National Council for Cooperation on Ethnic and Integration Issues, a 
</p>
<p>government consultative body, has been coordinating and monitoring the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the National Action Plan for the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005&#8211;2015.  
</p>
<p>10. The delegation stated that the recommendations of the Council of Europe and the 
</p>
<p>Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) had been taken into 
</p>
<p>consideration during the drafting of the Electoral Codes, which came into force in 2014.  
</p>
<p>11. The delegation stated that the Government paid special attention to all those 
</p>
<p>recommendations that called for the reform of the judiciary as it considered judicial reform 
</p>
<p>an important area for the protection of human rights. The recommendations of the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers had been taken into consideration 
</p>
<p>during the drafting of the 2012 amendments to the Judicial System Act. The updated 
</p>
<p>strategy for continuing the reform of the judiciary, which was adopted in 2015, set the goal 
</p>
<p>to modernize the judiciary and to complete the reform within the following seven years. 
</p>
<p>The key priority of the reform was to provide full guarantees for the independence of the 
</p>
<p>judiciary and ensure its effective functioning.  
</p>
<p>12. Progress was documented in setting up a mechanism for the compensation of those 
</p>
<p>whose human rights had been violated. The Government had established a procedure for 
</p>
<p>compensating citizens and legal entities for damages resulting from unreasonable delays in 
</p>
<p>civil, administrative and criminal procedures. The National Assembly tasked the 
</p>
<p>Government to submit an annual report on the implementation of the decisions of the 
</p>
<p>European Court on Human Rights against Bulgaria. In 2014, the Government adopted a 
</p>
<p>decision for a one-time payment of compensation to all individual complaints for which 
</p>
<p>damages were recommended by the United Nations human rights treaty bodies. In 2015 the 
</p>
<p>National Coordination Mechanism on Human Rights approved a legal mechanism for 
</p>
<p>financial compensation following the recommendations of the treaty bodies on individual 
</p>
<p>complaints. 
</p>
<p>13. During the reporting period, Bulgaria acceded to a number of international human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments, including the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and 
</p>
<p>Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. 
</p>
<p>The delegation expressed the commitment of Bulgaria to ratifying the Optional Protocol to 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International 
</p>
<p>Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Bulgaria had 
</p>
<p>presented its reports to the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It had also issued a standing invitation to all special 
</p>
<p>procedures mandate holders of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>14. In the reporting period, Bulgaria had achieved progress in enhancing the national 
</p>
<p>capacity for the promotion and protection of human rights. The human rights situation had 
</p>
<p>improved, though certain areas required further efforts. Having that in mind, the National 
</p>
<p>Coordination Mechanism on Human Rights had approved national human rights priorities 
</p>
<p>that included the protection of the rights of the child, persons with disabilities and of 
</p>
<p>migrants and refugees, enhancement of gender equality, the promotion of ethnic and 
</p>
<p>religious tolerance and the effective integration of Roma. 
</p>
<p>15. The delegation expressed its gratitude to all those delegations that had submitted 
</p>
<p>advance questions and provided the responses to those questions. In response to the influx 
</p>
<p>of refugees in 2013, the Government had improved the living conditions of those in need of </p>


<p><b> 5 
</b></p>
<p>international protection and constructed new facilities and infrastructure with a capacity of 
</p>
<p>6,000 people. Progress had also been documented in respect of the registration and the 
</p>
<p>processing of requests for international protection. 
</p>
<p>16. In 2014, the Government had adopted the National Integration Strategy for 
</p>
<p>Individuals Granted International Protection in Bulgaria (2014&#8211;2020), which paid special 
</p>
<p>attention to vulnerable persons with specific needs and to unaccompanied minors. Children 
</p>
<p>were provided with legal aid, health care and guaranteed the right to continue their 
</p>
<p>education. With regard to the appointment of guardians or trustees for unaccompanied 
</p>
<p>minors, a draft law which would allow the Agency for Social Assistance to appoint a 
</p>
<p>representative of the child, was forwarded to the consideration of the National Assembly. 
</p>
<p>17. Concerning the questions regarding hate crime and speech, and intolerance, the 
</p>
<p>delegation stated that its legislation provided for a solid legal framework for combating all 
</p>
<p>cases of hate crime, racism, and xenophobia and the Criminal Code recognized each racial 
</p>
<p>motivation as an aggravating circumstance in criminal offences. Draft amendments to the 
</p>
<p>Code, introducing the criminalization of public incitement to violence or hate on religious 
</p>
<p>grounds were being considered by the National Assembly. 
</p>
<p>18. There was a substantial improvement in the interaction between the Prosecutor&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Office and the investigating authorities in identifying and reporting discriminatory motives 
</p>
<p>at the earliest possible stage of pretrial proceedings. Although sexual orientation and gender 
</p>
<p>identity were not explicitly defined as aggravating circumstances in the Criminal Code, 
</p>
<p>such elements of the crime had been taken into account during the trial and the judgements 
</p>
<p>of courts. In that respect, training was regularly provided to enhance the qualification of 
</p>
<p>prosecutors. Public awareness measures were carried out to promote tolerance and to 
</p>
<p>address hate speech and incitement to racial or ethnic violence in political discourse and in 
</p>
<p>the media. 
</p>
<p>19. The National Roma Integration Strategy (2012&#8211;2020) was to be implemented in two 
</p>
<p>phases: 2012&#8211;2014 and 2014&#8211;2020. Subsequently, 28 regional strategies and 220 municipal 
</p>
<p>action plans for the integration of the Roma were adopted by taking into consideration the 
</p>
<p>needs and specifics of local communities. The Strategy considered education the first 
</p>
<p>priority of the integration policy. Efforts were increased to strengthen the integration of 
</p>
<p>children of Roma origin into the general education system. Some measures were also taken 
</p>
<p>to reduce school dropouts among the Roma children. The Ministry of Education and 
</p>
<p>Science, in cooperation with the Regional Education Inspectorates and the municipalities, 
</p>
<p>carried out monitoring of kindergartens and schools to avoid the formation of special 
</p>
<p>classes for children belonging to ethnic groups. 
</p>
<p>20. Regarding the questions on prison conditions and overcrowding, the delegation 
</p>
<p>stated that two new detention centres had been opened and a project had been implemented 
</p>
<p>to improve the conditions of detention centres and prisons. The authorities had been 
</p>
<p>working together with Norway on a joint project to introduce electronic monitoring of 
</p>
<p>selected categories of offenders in order to reduce the number of prisoners. 
</p>
<p>21. With regard to the questions concerning the support of families with children with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, and the juvenile justice system, the delegation stated that the legislation 
</p>
<p>provided for equal opportunities and social inclusion of children with disabilities and that 
</p>
<p>financial support was provided to families raising children with disabilities. Several 
</p>
<p>measures had been taken to improve the legislation on juvenile justice. 
</p>
<p>22. Bulgaria had also been strengthening its measures to ensure non-discrimination and 
</p>
<p>equal opportunities for people with disabilities, as well as their integration in all areas of 
</p>
<p>public life. </p>


<p>23. Concerning lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons, the authorities have 
</p>
<p>continued to pursue consistent policies aimed at preventing and eliminating any form of 
</p>
<p>discrimination, including against such persons.  
</p>
<p>24. With regard to the question on domestic violence, the delegation stated that the<b> 
</b></p>
<p>Government, in cooperation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), had 
</p>
<p>implemented measures to combat domestic violence. The Alliance for Protection against 
</p>
<p>Domestic Violence provided for monitoring of compliance with international regulations 
</p>
<p>and for ensuring maximum protection for the victims. Regular public campaigns and 
</p>
<p>initiatives were carried out to raise public awareness on domestic violence and to increase 
</p>
<p>knowledge about the existing protection procedures. The delegation also pointed to the 
</p>
<p>social services in place which provided support to victims of domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>25. Regarding the question on the scope of sexual assault offences, the delegation stated 
</p>
<p>that those offences were included in the legislation and that lack of consent was a necessary 
</p>
<p>precondition for fulfilling the corpus delicti and the consent must be given based on the 
</p>
<p>victim&#8217;s free will. 
</p>
<p>26. In response to the questions on human trafficking, the delegation reiterated that the 
</p>
<p>National Commission for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings continued working with 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups, especially the Roma community, women and children. The Government 
</p>
<p>had implemented several measures to prevent human trafficking for the purpose of labour 
</p>
<p>and sexual exploitation, provide assistance to victims of human trafficking, strengthen the 
</p>
<p>prosecution of perpetrators of trafficking in women and children, and improve cooperation 
</p>
<p>with the respective authorities of other countries in investigating transnational forms of 
</p>
<p>trafficking. 
</p>
<p>27. The delegation emphasized that the 2015 Anti-Corruption Strategy established<b> </b>an 
</p>
<p>independent anti-corruption body with guarantees of transparency in the appointment its 
</p>
<p>management and staff.  
</p>
<p>28. Regarding the question on media ownership, the delegation stated that<b> </b>the 
</p>
<p>Government presented its programme in 2015, foreseeing new regulations for the 
</p>
<p>acquisition and merger of the media, aimed at eliminating the possibility of influence on the 
</p>
<p>media environment by a single owner. 
</p>
<p>29. In response to questions, the delegation reported that the issue of the ratification of 
</p>
<p>the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
</p>
<p>Disappearance had been discussed within the National Coordination Mechanism on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights. It was concluded that a review of the national legislation was needed to introduce 
</p>
<p>the definition of forced disappearance and the creation of an effective mechanism for 
</p>
<p>compensation of the victims and their families. In this respect, a working group had been 
</p>
<p>established to work on draft amendments to the legislation. The delegation stated that 
</p>
<p>Bulgaria would consider acceding to the International Convention on the Protection of the 
</p>
<p>Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families when an agreement had 
</p>
<p>been reached within the European Union on that issue. 
</p>
<p>30. Concerning the questions on the implementation of the Rome Statute of the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court and on a possible ratification of the amendments to the crime 
</p>
<p>of aggression, the delegation stated that the legislation was fully in compliance with the 
</p>
<p>Statute in respect of the criminalization of the offences under its scope. Concrete steps for 
</p>
<p>the ratification of the amendments had not yet been taken. 
</p>
<p>31. Regarding the question about the representation of civil society organizations in the 
</p>
<p>work of the National Coordination Mechanism on Human Rights, the delegation explained 
</p>
<p>that there were no requirements for prior registration for the participation in the work of the </p>


<p><b> 7 
</b></p>
<p>Mechanism and all human rights NGOs were encouraged to take part in the meetings based 
</p>
<p>on their areas of interest.
