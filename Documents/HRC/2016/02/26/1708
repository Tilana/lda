<p><b>  25/&#8230;  Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri 
Lanka  
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
<i>Guided </i>by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants 
</p>
<p>on Human Rights and other relevant instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the 
Council, and 5/2, on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders, of 18 
June 2007, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 19/2 of 22 March 2012 and 22/1 
of 21 March 2013 on promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial 
integrity of Sri Lanka, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also</i> that it is the responsibility of each State to ensure the full 
enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms of its entire population, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming further</i> that States must ensure that any measure taken to combat 
terrorism complies with their obligations under international law, in particular international 
human rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law, as 
applicable, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming </i>that all Sri Lankans are entitled to the full enjoyment of their human 
rights regardless of religion, belief or ethnicity, in a peaceful and unified land,  
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming and acknowledging</i> the progress made by the Government of Sri Lanka 
in rebuilding infrastructure, demining and resettling the majority of internally displaced 
persons, while noting nonetheless that considerable work lies ahead in the areas of justice, 
reconciliation, land use and ownership, the resumption of livelihoods and the restoration of 
normality to civilian life, and stressing the importance of the full participation of local 
populations, including representatives of civil society and minorities, in these efforts, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the successful holding of Provincial Council elections on 21 September 
2013 and, in particular, the high turnout and participation in all three provinces, while 
noting with concern reports of election-related violence, as well as of voter and candidate 
intimidation, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing</i> <i>appreciation</i> for the efforts and cooperation of the Government of Sri 
Lanka in facilitating the visit of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
and providing her with open access, and welcoming the visit of the High Commissioner to 
Sri Lanka in August 2013, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing deep concern</i> at reported intimidation and retaliation against civil society 
members who engage with United Nations human rights mechanisms, including those who 
met with the High Commissioner during her visit, 
</p>
<p><i>Expressing serious concern</i> at the continuing reports of violations of human rights in 
Sri Lanka, including sexual and gender-based violence, enforced disappearances, 
extrajudicial killings, torture and violations of the rights to freedom of expression, 
association and peaceful assembly, threats to judicial independence and the rule of law, as 
well as intimidation of and reprisals against human rights defenders, members of civil 
society, lawyers and journalists,  
</p>
<p><i>Alarmed</i> at the significant surge in attacks against members of religious minority 
groups in Sri Lanka, including Hindus, Muslims and Christians, 
</p>
<p><i>Calling upon</i> the Government of Sri Lanka to fulfil its public commitments, 
including on the devolution of political authority, which is integral to reconciliation and the 
full enjoyment of human rights by all members of its population, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission of 
Sri Lanka, its findings and recommendations, and acknowledging its possible contribution 
to the process of meaningful national reconciliation in Sri Lanka, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the constructive recommendations contained in the Commission&#8217;s report, 
including the need to credibly investigate widespread allegations of extrajudicial killings 
and enforced disappearances, demilitarize the north of Sri Lanka, implement impartial land 
dispute resolution mechanisms, re-evaluate detention policies, strengthen formerly 
independent civil institutions, reach a political settlement on the devolution of power to the 
provinces, promote and protect the right of freedom of expression for all persons and enact 
rule of law reforms, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note </i>of the national plan of action to implement the recommendations of the 
Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission of the Government of Sri Lanka and its 
commitments as set forth in response to the findings and recommendations of the 
Commission, </p>


<p><i>Noting</i> that the national plan of action does not adequately address all of the findings 
and constructive recommendations of the Commission, and encouraging the Government of 
Sri Lanka to broaden the scope of the plan to adequately address all elements of the 
Commission&#8217;s report, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> <i>with concern</i> that the national plan of action and the Commission&#8217;s report do 
not adequately address serious allegations of violations of international human rights law 
and international humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> the importance of a comprehensive approach to transitional justice 
incorporating the full range of judicial and non-judicial measures, including, inter alia, 
individual prosecutions, reparations, truth-seeking, institutional reform, vetting of public 
employees and officials, or an appropriately conceived combination thereof, in order to, 
inter alia, ensure accountability, serve justice, provide remedies to victims, promote healing 
and reconciliation, establish independent oversight of the security system, restore 
confidence in the institutions of the State and promote the rule of law in accordance with 
international human rights law, with a view to preventing the recurrence of violations and 
abuses, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> that truth-seeking processes, such as truth and reconciliation 
commissions, that investigate patterns of past human rights violations and their causes and 
consequences are important tools that can complement judicial processes, and that, when 
established, such mechanisms have to be designed within a specific societal context and be 
founded on broad national consultations with the inclusion of victims and civil society, 
including non-governmental organizations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the responsibility of States to comply with their relevant obligations to 
prosecute those responsible for gross violations of human rights and serious violations of 
international humanitarian law constituting crimes under international law, with a view to 
end impunity, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the High Commissioner&#8217;s conclusion that national mechanisms have 
consistently failed to establish the truth and to achieve justice, and her recommendation that 
the Human Rights Council establish an international inquiry mechanism to further 
investigate the alleged violations of international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law and monitor any domestic accountability processes, 
</p>
<p><i>Encouraging</i> the Government of Sri Lanka to increase its dialogue and cooperation 
with the Office of the High Commissioner, including with regard to technical assistance, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the oral update presented by the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-fourth session1 
and the subsequent report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights on promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka2 and the 
recommendations and conclusions contained therein, including on the establishment of a 
truth-seeking mechanism and national reparations policy as an integral part of a more 
comprehensive and inclusive approach to transitional justice; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Calls upon</i> the Government of Sri Lanka to conduct an independent and 
credible investigation into allegations of violations of international human rights law and 
international humanitarian law, as applicable; to hold accountable those responsible for 
such violations; to end continuing incidents of human rights violations and abuses in Sri 
</p>
