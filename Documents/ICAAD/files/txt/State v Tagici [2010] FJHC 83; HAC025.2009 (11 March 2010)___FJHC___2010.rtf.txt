NIONI TAGICI

Mr. T. Qalinauci for the State

SENTENCE

[1]     
Nioni Tagi, you have been found guilty by this Court of the offence of murder, contrary to section 199 of the Penal Code, Cap. 17. You will be sentenced for the offence by section 200 of that Code.

[2]     
It is mandatory for me to sentence you to life imprisonment and that is the sentence I so pass.

[3]     
The evidence before the Court shows that on the 9th February 2009 you callously and cruelly attacked your husband with a heavy metal candleholder. You tried to cover up your act by lying about the whereabouts of your husband. This is a man who had kept you and provided for you for some years and he didnt deserve to die, even if he was being grumpy about his missing keys. You took a life for your own selfish purposes.

[4]     
I order that you serve a minimum term of 12 years in which you are not eligible to be released on parole.

Judge
