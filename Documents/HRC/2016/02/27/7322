<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twenty-first session 
</p>
<p>from 19 to 30 January 2015. The review of Lesotho was held at the 6th meeting on 21 
</p>
<p>January 2015. The delegation of Lesotho was headed by Haae Phoofolo. At its 10th 
</p>
<p>meeting held on 23 January 2015, the Working Group adopted the report on Lesotho. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Lesotho: France, Ghana and Maldives. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
</p>
<p>Lesotho: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation prepared in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/21/LSO/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/21/LSO/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/LSO/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Slovenia, Spain and the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, was transmitted to Lesotho through the 
</p>
<p>troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation expressed its appreciation on behalf of the Kingdom of Lesotho for 
</p>
<p>the opportunity to present the national report. The preparation of the national report was 
</p>
<p>participatory and inclusive, and was deliberated on in an open and free atmosphere.  
</p>
<p>6. In June 2014, His Majesty, King Letsie III, had prorogued Parliament in order to 
</p>
<p>pave the way for the political parties to solve their differences. Since then, tensions had 
</p>
<p>arisen between the coalition partners in the Government and on 30 August 2014 there was 
</p>
<p>an attempted coup. In response to the crisis, the Southern African Development Community 
</p>
<p>(SADC) held a Double Troika Summit of Heads of State and Government on 15 September 
</p>
<p>2014, which led to the Maseru Facilitation Declaration. Pursuant to the Declaration, 
</p>
<p>Parliament was reconvened on 17 October 2014 and dissolved on 5 December 2014. 
</p>
<p>Elections were set for 28 February 2015. Preparations for those elections by the 
</p>
<p>Independent Electoral Commission had commenced. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation recalled that, during the review in 2010, Lesotho had accepted 
</p>
<p>96 recommendations and rejected 22. A workplan was thereafter drawn up to ensure 
</p>
<p>coherent implementation of the recommendations. The workplan was the product of a 
</p>
<p>stakeholders&#8217; consensus and had served as a working tool for stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>8. Since the previous review, Lesotho had ratified the International Convention for the 
</p>
<p>Protection of All Persons From Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED) on 6 December 2013. In 
</p>
<p>2011, the National Disability and Rehabilitation Policy had been adopted, following the 
</p>
<p>ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2008. </p>


<p>The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women 
</p>
<p>and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
</p>
<p>Organized Crime (Protocol on Trafficking in Persons) had been incorporated into the 
</p>
<p>national framework through the enactment of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, 2011. A 
</p>
<p>National Anti-Trafficking in Persons Strategic Framework and Action Plan 2014&#8211;2016 had 
</p>
<p>been officially launched in July 2014. The Children&#8217;s Protection and Welfare Act, enacted 
</p>
<p>in 2011 incorporated both the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the African 
</p>
<p>Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child into the national framework.  
</p>
<p>9. In 2011, Lesotho had presented its report on the implementation of the Convention 
</p>
<p>on All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) to the CEDAW Committee. 
</p>
<p>The report on the Convention on the Rights of the Child had been submitted to the relevant 
</p>
<p>Committee. Draft reports on the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and 
</p>
<p>the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (CAT), 
</p>
<p>were awaiting Cabinet approval. Once approved, the reports would be submitted to the 
</p>
<p>respective treaty monitoring bodies. The draft report on the International Covenant on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination was awaiting validation by stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>10. At the regional level, the report on the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of 
</p>
<p>the Child had been submitted, while the report on the African Charter on Human and 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Rights was awaiting stakeholders&#8217; validation before submission to Cabinet for 
</p>
<p>approval. That was a clear indication that, despite resource constraints, Lesotho was making 
</p>
<p>great  effort to report under the various treaties. 
</p>
<p>11. Plans to set up a Human Rights Commission were under way. In 2011, the 6th 
</p>
<p>Amendment to the Constitution, enshrining the establishment of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission, had been passed by Parliament. A Human Rights Commission Bill was in 
</p>
<p>place and had been awarded a certificate of approval from the Attorney General&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Chambers. The Bill had also been considered by Cabinet and would be presented before the 
</p>
<p>9th Parliament for promulgation into law. The Government would continue to strive 
</p>
<p>towards the operationalization of the Commission. Workshops had been held for the media, 
</p>
<p>members of Parliament, youth, inmates and correctional service staff on the work of the 
</p>
<p>Commission envisaged.  
</p>
<p>12. Workshops had been held for persons with disabilities, teachers, members of 
</p>
<p>Parliament and the judiciary for the purposes of highlighting human rights issues. To mark 
</p>
<p>International Human Rights Day, the Minister had delivered a statement on the theme of the 
</p>
<p>year. Gatherings to discuss various thematic areas of human rights had also been held for 
</p>
<p>the general public.  
</p>
<p>13. The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights had visited Lesotho on a 
</p>
<p>promotional mission in 2012. The mission had comprised the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>Freedom of Expression and Access to Information and the Special Rapporteur on Prisons 
</p>
<p>and Places of Detention in Africa. Their recommendations were presently being 
</p>
<p>implemented by government. 
</p>
<p>14. Poverty was rife, with more than half of the population living below the poverty 
</p>
<p>line. That was mainly to due to land degradation and climate change; particularly persistent 
</p>
<p>drought, flooding and early frost which had caused low agricultural productivity in recent 
</p>
<p>years. The worsening food deficit, as well as the increasing retrenchment of Basotho 
</p>
<p>working abroad contributed to poverty.  
</p>
<p>15. To address the problem of agricultural decline, in the 2013&#8211;14 financial year, the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Agriculture had been allocated a 43 per cent increase in budget, which had 
</p>
<p>enabled the subsidising of agricultural inputs such as seed, fertilizers, herbicides and 
</p>
<p>insecticides. Poverty reduction programmes and policies had been designed, such as the </p>


<p>National Strategic Development Plan, which served as an implementation strategy for the 
</p>
<p>National Vision 2020 for the following five years. The Plan was expected to reduce poverty 
</p>
<p>and promote the achievement of sustainable development.  
</p>
<p>16. Lesotho was on track to achieving the Millennium Development Goals relating to 
</p>
<p>primary education, gender equality and empowerment of women. Efforts would be 
</p>
<p>redoubled in order to achieve the remaining Goals in the post-2015 period. Lesotho would 
</p>
<p>mobilize more development partners and exert decisive leadership to attain the National 
</p>
<p>Vision 2020 as the Goals bore a close relationship to the seven pillars of the National 
</p>
<p>Vision 2020. 
</p>
<p>17. With regard to education, free learning materials were provided, qualified teachers 
</p>
<p>were employed and new schools, accessible to persons with disabilities, were being 
</p>
<p>constructed in remote and rural areas. Additional classrooms in existing schools had also 
</p>
<p>been built. There had been a sharp increase in the number of literate women and the school 
</p>
<p>enrolment and completion rates were higher for girls than boys. 
</p>
<p>18. HIV and AIDS had had a devastating impact on the population and health-care 
</p>
<p>system. Various efforts had been undertaken, including awareness campaigns, testing and 
</p>
<p>treatment, male circumcision and Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT), 
</p>
<p>whereby all HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled for PMTCT services were eligible to 
</p>
<p>receive lifelong antiretroviral therapy. There was also a current national HIV and AIDS 
</p>
<p>Strategic Plan.  
</p>
<p>19. Infant and child mortality had risen in recent years as a result of pneumonia, 
</p>
<p>malnutrition, measles, HIV and AIDS, and diarrhoea. In addition to the subsidized fees and 
</p>
<p>free maternal and health services at health centres, other government interventions included 
</p>
<p>the integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses Strategy, PMTCT programmes, and 
</p>
<p>policies such as the National Health Sector Policy with its Strategic Plan and the Young 
</p>
<p>Child Feeding Policy. Services for women and children had also improved. More than 600 
</p>
<p>village women had been trained and employed to visit pregnant women regularly and to 
</p>
<p>encourage them to visit health centres.  
</p>
<p>20. There had been an increase in human trafficking, whereby women and children fell 
</p>
<p>prey to fictitious promises of employment and other means of earning a living. The 
</p>
<p>Government had taken steps to ensure the protection of those vulnerable groups through the 
</p>
<p>enactment of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, 2011, implemented through the National 
</p>
<p>Anti-Trafficking in Persons Strategic Framework and Action Plan 2014&#8211;16. The Ministry 
</p>
<p>of Home Affairs had spearheaded a multisectoral team on anti-trafficking and there were 
</p>
<p>partnerships with civil society organizations and community networks to address human 
</p>
<p>trafficking through intensive community awareness-raising campaigns. 
</p>
<p>21. Lesotho was dedicated to achieving the principles of gender equality, non-
</p>
<p>discrimination and promotion of women&#8217;s rights, as illustrated by the appointment of 
</p>
<p>women to high decision-making positions, such as that of the Ombudsman and the Chief 
</p>
<p>Justice, and the adoption of a national action plan to end gender-based violence against 
</p>
<p>women. Capacity-building training sessions on gender issues and gender-based violence 
</p>
<p>had been held for the police, judges, magistrates, prosecutors, chiefs, and traditional and 
</p>
<p>religious leaders.  
</p>
<p>22. The best interests of the child remained at the core of the Government&#8217;s agenda. The 
</p>
<p>Children&#8217;s Protection and Welfare Act 2011 provided for the right to education, health and 
</p>
<p>opinion for all children, and protected children against exploitation and child labour. It also 
</p>
<p>made provision for a Children&#8217;s Court, which was now operational. Within the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Social Development, there was a department of children&#8217;s services tasked with the care, 
</p>
<p>protection and development of children.  </p>


<p>23. On the issue of corruption, the Directorate of Corruption and Economic Offences 
</p>
<p>had been established and a National Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan had been 
</p>
<p>designed. There was also the Prevention of Corruption Bill 2013, which sought to 
</p>
<p>strengthen the legislative and institutional framework and elevate the status of the 
</p>
<p>Directorate to that of a Commission.  
</p>
<p>24. Old correctional facilities were being demolished and new ones built. A full-time 
</p>
<p>HIV and AIDS coordinator had been employed and HIV testing, counselling and treatment 
</p>
<p>were provided. Condoms were being provided and all correctional facilities had a nurse and 
</p>
<p>dispensary to attend to minor illnesses. All inmates received free medical care in 
</p>
<p>government hospitals. 
</p>
<p>25. In response to advance questions, the delegation stated that the Children&#8217;s Protection 
</p>
<p>and Welfare Act, 2011, had curbed child labour. Labour Inspectors could now inspect the 
</p>
<p>formal sector to ascertain the existence of child labour and investigate crimes relating to the 
</p>
<p>worst forms of child labour. However, there were no available statistics on reported labour 
</p>
<p>cases in the Children&#8217;s Court. A programme on the elimination of child labour involving 
</p>
<p>various stakeholders was currently being developed. 
</p>
<p>26. Awareness-raising and educational campaigns on gender-based violence continued 
</p>
<p>to be run in an effort to prevent and combat domestic violence. There was a support 
</p>
<p>programme for victims, which included counselling. The 6th Amendment to the 
</p>
<p>Constitution Act of 2011 enhanced the support available to victims. Alleged perpetrators 
</p>
<p>were prosecuted. The Domestic Violence Bill had been referred back for further 
</p>
<p>consultations and research and , with new drafting instructions as a result. 
</p>
<p>27. The reservation to article 2 of CEDAW was partially withdrawn in 2004, and the 
</p>
<p>reservations remained only with regard to succession to the throne and to chieftainship. An 
</p>
<p>elected government had to be considerate to the traditional values of the society that formed 
</p>
<p>its electorate.  
</p>
<p>28. Lesotho retained the death penalty under Statutory Law as a form of deterrence. 
</p>
<p>However, the death penalty had not been carried out since 1995. There were appropriate 
</p>
<p>safeguards in place, such as the Pardons Committee and the prerogative of mercy by His 
</p>
<p>Majesty the King. Nonetheless, the Government took note of the international trend 
</p>
<p>towards abolition of the death penalty.  
</p>
<p>29. With regard to the administration of justice, reforms had been undertaken to mitigate 
</p>
<p>the backlog of cases and to modernize the operations of the judiciary, including the 
</p>
<p>introduction of a case management tool in the High Court and the establishment of a small 
</p>
<p>claims procedure in the magistrate court.  
</p>
<p>30. The Government was continuing to renovate and refurbish correctional facilities 
</p>
<p>throughout the 10 districts, notwithstanding budget limitations. The use of restorative 
</p>
<p>justice and other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms had been scaled up and the 
</p>
<p>courts also imposed non-custodial sentences, including community service sentences, to 
</p>
<p>reduce the overcrowding in correctional facilities. 
</p>
<p>31. Lesotho was committed to preventing illicit trafficking of conventional arms. The 
</p>
<p>International Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons had been ratified and the Arms 
</p>
<p>Trade Treaty had been signed. The Internal Security (Arms and Ammunition) Act of 1966 
</p>
<p>prohibited the possession, sale or transfer of a firearm and/or ammunition without a licence. 
</p>
<p>The Counter Crime Unit had been established in March 2009 and tasked with searching for 
</p>
<p>unlicensed firearms and arresting alleged perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>32. It was the ambition of Lesotho to expeditiously adopt the best human rights 
</p>
<p>practices. The pace at which that ambition would be fulfilled would be determined by the </p>


<p>availability of resources and capacity, as well society&#8217;s receptiveness to those human rights 
</p>
<p>practices. 
</p>
<p>33. Lesotho appreciated the technical and financial support as well as the good 
</p>
<p>cooperation from several United Nations agencies and countries. The delegation also 
</p>
<p>expressed appreciation for the cooperation in the preparation of the National Report and for 
</p>
<p>the advance questions received, and looked forward to a constructive dialogue.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>34. During the interactive dialogue, 64 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
</p>
<p>made during the dialogue can be found in section II of the present report.  
</p>
<p>35. The Democratic Republic of the Congo commended the progress by Lesotho and 
</p>
<p>willingness to improve human rights, despite challenges. It noted the Strategic National 
</p>
<p>Development Plan aimed at reducing poverty, free education, and measures to combat 
</p>
<p>corruption and promote the rights of women, children, elderly and persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>It welcomed international cooperation with Lesotho. 
</p>
<p>36. Denmark noted permission granted to allow bodies such as the International 
</p>
<p>Committee of the Red Cross to visit and inspect correctional institutions and make 
</p>
<p>recommendations, but noted that it had not taken steps towards ratifying the Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
</p>
<p>Treatment (OP&#8211;CAT). It also referred to an initiative by the Committee against Torture 
</p>
<p>which aimed to assist governments to overcome obstacles to ratification and 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Convention, as an avenue to assist Lesotho. 
</p>
<p>37. Djibouti appreciated the efforts by Lesotho to comply with previous 
</p>
<p>recommendations, despite challenges. It congratulated Lesotho on the adoption of the Law 
</p>
<p>for the protection and well-being of children and persons with disabilities. It called on the 
</p>
<p>international community to provide technical assistance to Lesotho. 
</p>
<p>38. Egypt noted the approach taken by Lesotho regarding the promotion of human rights 
</p>
<p>in the country and significant steps taken to establish the Children&#8217;s Court; to enact the 
</p>
<p>Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act (2011), the Children&#8217;s Protection and Welfare Act (2011), 
</p>
<p>and the Education Act (2010), providing for free and compulsory primary education. 
</p>
<p>39. Ethiopia noted the achievements of Lesotho in the areas of peace and political 
</p>
<p>stability, gender equality, dispensation of justice, registration of a high literacy rate, human 
</p>
<p>resource development, and increased coverage of public service provision. It noted with 
</p>
<p>appreciation the emphasis on alleviating poverty, ensuring food security and reducing 
</p>
<p>unemployment.  
</p>
<p>40. France commended progress on stabilizing Lesotho after the political crisis of 2014 
</p>
<p>and expressed its wish that the general elections of 2015 would take place in line with 
</p>
<p>democratic rules and human rights. It congratulated Lesotho on its ratification of ICPPED. 
</p>
<p>41. Gabon noted the ratification of a number of international human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p>the adoption of a law on child welfare, and the adoption of measures for orphans, children 
</p>
<p>and other vulnerable populations to guarantee their rights to education and health. 
</p>
<p>42. Germany welcomed the progress made in the fields of child protection, elimination 
</p>
<p>of discrimination against women and political participation of women since the previous 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review. It remained concerned about the continued high prevalence of 
</p>
<p>violence against women and issues of discrimination and non-equality, as well as child 
</p>
<p>sexual abuse, forced child/early marriage, and child labour. </p>


<p>43. Ghana commended the establishment of a national human rights commission and 
</p>
<p>hoped that it would operate in full compliance with the Paris Principles. It also commended 
</p>
<p>the Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act and the Children&#8217;s Protection and Welfare Act, and 
</p>
<p>shared concerns expressed by CEDAW about the high incidence of trafficking in women 
</p>
<p>and girls. 
</p>
<p>44. Indonesia noted that Lesotho was on track to achieve the Millennium Development 
</p>
<p>Goals on universal primary education and promoting gender equality and empowerment of 
</p>
<p>women. It expressed its appreciation of the draft national policy on social development and 
</p>
<p>hoped that it would be approved and implemented immediately. It further noted that 
</p>
<p>corruption remained one of the prevalent factors hindering development. 
</p>
<p>45. Ireland congratulated Lesotho for the progress achieved towards gender equality, but 
</p>
<p>remained concerned at the level of discrimination that women still encountered in the 
</p>
<p>public and private spheres. It welcomed efforts to tackle the high rates of infant and 
</p>
<p>maternal mortality and noted in particular that child mortality rates remained alarmingly 
</p>
<p>high. 
</p>
<p>46. Italy commended the holding of a de facto moratorium on the death penalty, 
</p>
<p>welcomed the enactment of the Legal Capacity of Married Persons Act of 2006, and 
</p>
<p>commended the adoption of a number of policies to enhance the protection and promotion 
</p>
<p>of the rights of the child.  
</p>
<p>47. Kuwait appreciated efforts to enhance the normative and institutional framework for 
</p>
<p>the promotion and protection of human rights. It also valued the procedural steps towards 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the accepted recommendations of the first review, aimed at 
</p>
<p>additional achievements towards the protection of human rights and freedoms. 
</p>
<p>48. Latvia congratulated Lesotho for the various laws, action plans and campaigns to 
</p>
<p>protect and enhance women&#8217;s rights. It welcomed the adoption of the Children&#8217;s Protection 
</p>
<p>and Welfare Act, 2011, and the national strategic plan on vulnerable children. Latvia 
</p>
<p>recognized efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goal target for universal 
</p>
<p>primary education, but remained concerned that the lack of birth registration resulted in the 
</p>
<p>denial of essential services.  
</p>
<p>49. Libya noted the progress made in promoting and protecting human rights. It 
</p>
<p>commended the ratification of a number of treaties, including CED, CRPD and the Protocol 
</p>
<p>on Trafficking in Persons. 
</p>
<p>50. Mali noted the ratification of several international human rights instruments and the 
</p>
<p>compliance of national laws with international commitments. It also welcomed action to 
</p>
<p>better protect the rights of persons with disabilities and other vulnerable groups, and 
</p>
<p>positive initiatives to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.  
</p>
<p>51. Mauritius commended the implementation of most of the recommendations and the 
</p>
<p>development of various action plans since the previous review. It encouraged Lesotho to 
</p>
<p>pursue the development of its National Human Rights Policy. It welcomed the initiatives to 
</p>
<p>establish a Human Rights Commission and suggested that Lesotho consider availing itself 
</p>
<p>of the experiences of Mauritius. 
</p>
<p>52. Mexico took note of  the ratification of ICPPED, the adoption of the Action Plan 
</p>
<p>against human trafficking and the implementation of the Law for the protection and well-
</p>
<p>being of children. While acknowledging progress and challenges, Mexico raised a concern 
</p>
<p>about overdue reports to treaty bodies. Mexico made its best practices available. 
</p>
<p>53. Montenegro requested information on the activities undertaken to make the national 
</p>
<p>human rights commission operational, the reasons for the lack of cooperation with treaty </p>


<p>bodies, and activities undertaken to incorporate CEDAW into the domestic legal system. It 
</p>
<p>welcomed the ratification of ICPPED. 
</p>
<p>54. Morocco welcomed the ratification of ICPPED and the launch of the action plan 
</p>
<p>against trafficking in persons. It commended Lesotho for its efforts in the area of education. 
</p>

</p>
<p>a barrier to providing essential goods and services.  </p>

</p>
<p>policy. It encouraged ratification of OP-CAT and the United Nations Educational,

</p>
<p>a deterrent and people were very rarely charged under it.  
</p>
<p>109. The Government had continued to implement the gender policy framework and

<p>empower women to contribute to development and poverty reduction. Several social

<p>vulnerable children had also been introduced, with the primary goal of preventing and 
</p>
<p>reducing economic and social vulnerability. Child labour was predominant in the private 
</p>
<p>sector. The Labour Code of 1992 was under review to provide labour inspectors with the 
</p>
<p>authority to review child labour practices in the informal sector. An action plan to eliminate 
</p>
<p>child labour was being developed.

</p>
<p>erosion through water deviation furrows and contour ploughing. The delegation stated that

</p>
<p>111. The delegations stated that Lesotho would agree to issue a standing invitation to all 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council mechanisms; birth registration was free of charge through public 
</p>
<p>gatherings; primary health care services to women and girls were provided for a subsidized 
</p>
<p>fee in all government hospitals and clinics; and clinics for the health care of women and 
</p>
<p>girls were available in all 10 districts.

<p>112. On behalf of Lesotho, the delegation extended its deepest appreciation and thanked 
</p>
<p>all delegations for the questions, comments, recommendations and above all their  
</p>
<p>constructive manner of engagement. Cooperation with the United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms was an issue of high priority on the agenda of the Government. The UPR had 
</p>
<p>been a worthwhile process. It allowed for reflection on priorities and needs and provided 
</p>
<p>for the systematic creation of an enabling environment to enhance the realization of human 
</p>
<p>rights. The delegation affirmed the commitment of the Government to uphold the human 
</p>
<p>rights of all Basotho.  </p>
