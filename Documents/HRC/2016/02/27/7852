<p><b>  Comments of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the report of the 
Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment 
of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health (16-23 May 2012), A/HRC/23/41/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p>1. The expression in Para 4 of the Report &#8220;in a territorial armed conflict&#8221; should read 
&#8220;conflict in and around the Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Republic of Azerbaijan&#8221; in 
accordance with relevant United Nations General Assembly and Security Council 
resolutions.  
</p>
<p>2. The right to the protection of physical and mental health of the citizens of the 
Republic of Azerbaijan as well as foreigners residing in the country is reflected in the 
various legislative acts. The Constitution of Azerbaijan states that citizens have the right to 
the protection of their health and to receive health care services. The major objective as 
outlined in health legislation is to improve the health conditions of the population. The Law 
on Protection of the Health of the Population (1997) as well as the Concept on Health 
Financing Reforms and Introduction of Mandatory Health Insurance (2008) also stresses 
the importance of access to health care for every citizen. All citizens are entitled to receive 
health care, including medicosocial aid in case of sickness, disability and other cases 
according to the Law on the Protection of the Health of the Population. The Health 
Financing Concept reinforces the right of all citizens to a state-guaranteed basic benefit 
package. Recent reform initiatives have been focused more on the issues of quality of 
services and efficiency.  
</p>
<p>3. The Government of Azerbaijan has increased its budget for health significantly and 
per capita government expenditure on health has also risen substantially in recent years. As 
of 1 February 2008, the paid medical service has been cancelled for the welfare of 
population in the prophylactic treatment institutions financing by the state budget. 
</p>
<p>4. The Government of Azerbaijan attaches importance for establishment of mandatory 
health insurance, to this end the Law on Medical Insurance was adopted in 1999 and the 
State Agency on Mandatory Health Insurance was established by the Presidential Decree in 
</p><p>2007. Furthermore, the Concept on Health Financing Reforms and Introduction of 
Mandatory Health Insurance was approved in 2008. With regard to the implementation of 
the Law on Medical Insurance and in order to providing the implementation of mandatory 
medical insurance system, the Coordination Council consisting of senior officials of 
relevant ministries was established by the Order of the Cabinet of Ministers. 
</p>
<p>5. Pharmaceutical field is under specific control of the Government. The most 
important step in this direction is the establishment of Analytical Expertise Centre of Drugs 
within the Ministry of Health. All issues regarding the pharmaceutics &#8211; development of 
pharmaceutical sector, registration of drugs, certification, and control of quality, wholesale 
and retail of drugs- have been assigned to the said entity.  
</p>
<p>6. A number of comprehensive National Programmes have been carried out on the 
fight against communicable diseases which is a priority field of the Ministry of Health of 
the Republic of Azerbaijan. As a result of implementation of these programmes part of the 
communicable diseases were practically removed and others were dynamically decreased. 
</p>
<p>7. In order to ensure durability of these achievements the &#8220;Programme of Actions for 
immunization and prophylactics of communicable diseases&#8221; has been developed and 
adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 
</p>
<p>8. Azerbaijan &#8211; a country which is considered as an endemic for poliomyelitis now was 
turned to a country which is a free from this disease. In order to remain this status, the 
Ministry of Health of the Republic of Azerbaijan constantly carries out prophylactic 
activities. </p>

<p>9. Taking into consideration the high level of suffering from the diseases such as 
manageable diseases which are not within the vaccination calendar, including epidemic 
parotitis and rubella, the negotiations were conducted with the Rostropovich-Vishnevskaya 
Fund. As a result of these negotiations vaccine with three components against measles, 
parotitis and rubella have been included to the prophylactic vaccination calendar instead of 
measles vaccine. 
</p>
<p>10. By joining the Programme of World Health Organization for the Elimination of 
measles and rubella in European region, constantly the Republic of Azerbaijan conducts 
National Immunisation Campaign among the population. Each year the vaccination plan for 
the Republic is being implemented approximately 96-98%.  
</p>
<p>11. Since the beginning of the 2012 the state has started purchase of the second line 
drugs against the tuberculosis. In this regard, necessary financial funds have been fixed 
from state budget for the year of 2013.  
</p>
<p>12. In order to define the percentage of new tuberculosis cases among patients who 
endure to a high amount of drugs, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Azerbaijan 
conducts joint research with the World Health Organization since October 2012. The results 
of this research will be available at the end of the first quarter of this year.  
</p>
<p>13. While the international organizations defined 1 million 3 hundred thousand Manats 
for the purchase of drugs and laboratory reactives, the State defined 5 million Manats just 
only for these purposes. 
</p>
<p>14. Since 2013 financial funds have been fixed from state budget for the purchase of the 
first line drugs against the tuberculosis in penitentiary sector.
