Management Discussion and Analysis
1.  Overview
As announced to ASX on 1 December 2015, the Company entered into binding share sale and purchase 
agreements under which it agreed, subject to shareholder approval and the satisfaction of certain 
other conditions, to acquire all the issued capital of BARD1AG SA, a Swiss public company limited by 
shares.  BARD1AG  has  pioneered,  through  the  development  of  certain  proprietary  intellectual 
property,  a  simple  blood  test  for  screening  and  diagnosing  lung  cancer  at  early  stages  of  disease 
progression.  
 
In addition, the Company undertook a capital raising under a Prospectus to raise $3,000,000 at $0.02 
per share in accordance with the acquisition transaction and to seek re-compliance for listing on the 
ASX. 
 
On 17 June 2016 the acquisition transaction was completed with the following issues effected: 
 
i)
217,003,236  Ordinary  Shares  issued  to  the  BARD1AG  SWAP  Vendors  (or  their  respective 
nominee) in consideration for the acquisition of their respective shares in BARD1AG;
ii)
iii)
217,003,236 Performance Shares issued to the BARD1AG SWAP Vendors (or their respective 
nominee) in consideration for the acquisition of their respective shares in BARD1AG;
12,500,000 Ordinary Shares issued to the Universite de Geneve in full consideration of the 
Change of Control under the UNIGE Licence Agreement; and
150,000,000 Ordinary Shares issued to investors who subscribed in the capital raising
iv) 
 
In  addition  to  the  above  share  issues,  cash  consideration  of  $309,421  was  provided  to  certain 
BARD1AG  vendors.  As  a  result  of  the  deemed  reverse  acquisition  under  accounting  standards  as 
described below, this payment was accounted for as a distribution to owners. 
 
The Company’s Shares re-commenced trading on the ASX on 20 June 2016. 
 
Since re-compliance the Company has commenced   working to achieve the objectives set out in its 
Prospectus lodged on 23 March 2016.
1.  Reverse acquisition
Under Australian Accounting Standards, BARD1AG was deemed to be the accounting acquirer in this 
transaction. The acquisition has been accounted for as a share-based payment by which BARD1AG 
acquired the net assets and listing status of Bard1 Life Sciences Limited.  
 
Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared as a continuation 
of the business and operations of BARD1AG. As the deemed acquirer, BARD1AG has accounted for 
the in-substance acquisition of Bard1 Life Sciences Limited from 17 June 2016.

Preliminary final Report
The financial results of the Group are presented in Australian dollars, unless otherwise referenced. 
The presentation currency of BARD1AG applied in its last set of financial statements was Swiss Francs. 
 
BARD1AG’s previous financial year end was 31 December 2015, while Bard1 Life Science Limited’s 
financial year end was 30 June 2016.  
 
The results for the six months ended 30 June 2016 comprise the results of BARD1AG for the six month 
period and the results of Bard1 Life Sciences Limited subsequent to the completion of the acquisition. 
The  comparative  information  for  the  12 months ended  31 December 2015  is  that  of  BARD1AG  as 
presented in its last set of financial statements, restated for the change in presentation currency as 
noted above.  
 
The difference between the fair value of the deemed consideration paid by BARD1AG and the fair 
value of the identifiable net assets of Bard1 Life Sciences Limited of $2,463,404 was recognised as an 
expense in the current period income statement.
