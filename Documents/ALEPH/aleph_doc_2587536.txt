Our Selling Shareholders plan to sell common shares at such prices as the market
may dictate from time to time.  There is a limited trading market for the common
stock and our pricing is arbitrary with no relation to market value, liquidation
value,  earnings  or  dividends.  The price was  arbitrarily  set.  The  warrant
exercise  price  was  arbitrarily  determined  based  on a  speculative  concept
unsupported  by any other  comparables.  We have set the initial fixed prices as
follows:

ITEM 3. PROSPECTUS  SUMMARY  INFORMATION,  RISK FACTORS AND RATIO OF EARNINGS TO
FIXED CHARGES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OUR COMPANY
Hinto Energy, Inc. ("We," "Us," "Our") was organized under the laws of the State
of Wyoming on February 13, 1997, as Garner Investments, Inc. On August 18, 2011,
we amended our  Articles of  Incorporation  to change our name to Hinto  Energy,
Inc. and to authorize 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock. We were organized to
engage in the acquisition, exploration, and if warranted, development of oil and
gas prospects in the rocky mountain region.
Prior to January 2012,  we had minimal  operations  that were focused  mainly on
administrative  activities  and  the  identification  of  potential  oil and gas
prospects.  On January 23, 2012, we acquired 100% of the issued and  outstanding
common stock of South Uintah Gas Properties,  Inc. ("South Uintah")  pursuant to
the Share  Purchase  and Exchange  Agreement  ("the Share  Exchange  Agreement")
entered  into on July  27,  2011,  at the time  South  Uintah  was our  majority
shareholder, as discussed below.
On July 11, 2011,  prior to entering into the Share  Exchange  Agreement,  South
Uintah had  purchased  3,000,000  shares of the Company  from its then  majority
shareholder  Ms.  Sharon  Fowler.   After  such  purchase,   South  Uintah  held
approximately  70% of the issued and  outstanding  common  stock of the Company.
Prior to closing of the  acquisition of South Uintah,  South Uintah  transferred
300,000  shares to an  unrelated  third party as partial  consideration  for the
acquisition  of the  gas  prospect  in  Utah.  As  part  of the  Share  Exchange
Agreement,  South Uintah had agreed to return the remaining  2,700,000 shares of
common stock to the Company. We have retired such shares to treasury, concurrent
with the transaction.
SHARE ACQUISITION AND EXCHANGE AGREEMENT
On July 27, 2011,  we entered into a Share  Exchange and  Acquisition  Agreement
with South Uintah and the South  Uintah  shareholders.  On January 23, 2012,  we
entered into an Amended Share Exchange and  Acquisition  Agreement ("the Amended
Share Exchange Agreement"). Pursuant to the Amended Share Exchange Agreement, we
agreed to issue shares of our restricted common stock for 100% of the issued and
outstanding  common stock of South  Uintah.  The shares are to be exchanged on a
one for one basis. As a result, South Uintah became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company.
In addition to the exchange of common stock, we exchanged on a one for one basis
the  following  outstanding  equity  documents  with those of our own. The table
below sets forth the equity that was exchanged.
Type of Equity        South Uintah Balance          To Be Issued By Hinto
------------------------ ------------------------ ---- -------------------------
Common Stock                   11,446,931 shares              11,446,931 shares
Warrants (1)                           6,700,000                      6,700,000
Promissory Note (2)                     $375,000                       $375,000
------------------------
     (1)  The  warrants  have  exercise  prices  ranging from $0.50 to $3.00 per
          share and terms ranging from 2 to 5 years.
(2)  The  promissory  note has a provision to convert into shares of common
          stock at $0.20 per share. Such shares are not being registered in this
          Registration Statement.
At the time of the acquisition, George Harris, Gary Herick, Max Sommer and Kevin
Blair,  officers and directors of Hinto,  were and are  officers,  directors and
shareholders of South Uintah.  Mr. David Keller, a director of Hinto, was also a
shareholder of South Uintah.
-3-
<PAGE>
The effective date of the acquisition is December 31, 2011, with Hinto being the
legal acquirer.  However,  since Hinto was a public  company,  which had nominal
activity,  the  acquisition  has been  treated  as a  recapitalization  of South
Uintah.  Though Hinto was the legal acquirer in the merger, South Uintah was the
accounting acquirer since its shareholders gained control of Hinto. Therefore at
the date of the merger  the  historical  financial  statements  of South  Uintah
became those of Hinto. As a result, the historical financial statements of South
Uintah supersede any prior financial statements of Hinto.
SOUTH UINTAH
South  Uintah was  incorporated  in the State of  Colorado  in March 2011 and is
headquartered  in Denver,  Colorado.  South Uintah has  interests in oil and gas
properties.  South Uintah acquired interests in approximately  5,366 gross acres
in the Central part of the Uintah Basin, at Natural Buttes, Utah from a farmout.
The  acreage  is  located  in a  prolific  gas  production  area  from  multiple
hydrocarbon reservoirs such as: Castlegate,  Mancos, Dakota, Buck Tongue, Emery,
Frontier  and Prairie  Canyon.  The upper zones  above 9,800 feet  (approx)  are
precluded  in the farmout and the overall  targets will be zones from 9,800 feet
to 16,000 feet.
The  Company  intends  to  strive  to be a low cost and  effective  producer  of
hydrocarbons and intends to develop the business model and corporate strategy as
discussed herein.
The  Company's  approach to lease  acquisition,  development  and  production is
founded  on  the  discipline  of  ONLY  acquiring  leases  in  areas  of  proven
production.  In most cases the leases that are under  consideration  have at one
time  contained  producing  oil or gas wells and  currently  have  production or
shut-in wells that are viable for work over and or  re-completion.  This managed
risk  approach  greatly  reduces the risk normally  associated  with oil and gas
development. There are hundreds of wells in our area of interest that meet these
criteria. In many instances, the wells were shut-in during a period of declining
oil and gas  prices  and in most  cases are ideal for our  business  model.  Our
business model is simple;  strict adherence to lease  acquisition  surrounded by
proven  production,  offering well  workovers,  re-completion,  and enhanced oil
recovery  opportunities  in the  known  producing  formations,  with  long  term
production potential at a low cost of development,  maintenance,  and operation.
The Company is NOT an exploration  company,  per se, rather it seeks leases with
discovered oil and gas with current or prior production.
One strategy that is quickly growing in prominence and application  with respect
to  petroleum  is  to  use a  development  program  approach.  We  describe  our
development  plan  approach as a set of  techniques  utilizing  the injection of
specific fluids such as: water,  steam,  natural gas, carbon dioxide,  nitrogen,
and various  chemicals  and  surfactants  intended to increase the amount of oil
that can ultimately be extracted from any oil field.  Many oil  exploration  and
production  companies are using development  program  approaches to maximize the
potential of old oil fields.
Our  business  operations  are in the  development,  production,  and  low  risk
exploration  of oil and gas including  unconventional  natural gas, in the Rocky
Mountain region of the  continental  United States;  specifically,  in the Rocky
Mountain area of Utah, Colorado, Montana and Wyoming.
RECENT PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS
PRIDE VENTURES, LLC AND JAMES WOOLSEY
-------------------------------------
On June 4, 2013, the Company and Pride Ventures, LLC ("Pride") and James Woolsey
("Woolsey")  entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement ("the Pride Purchase and
Sale Agreement."). As part of the Pride Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Company
acquired all right and title to certain mineral  estates in Grand County,  Utah.
The transaction had a closing date of June 17, 2013.
The  mineral  estates  include  4,435  acres,  9 well  bores  and space to drill
additional  wells.  In  addition,  the  Company  acquired  Pride's  natural  gas
gathering system,  which  interconnects  with the Company's  existing  gathering
system,  thereby  reducing new pipe  gathering  system  construction  by several
miles. The Company has acquired 100% of the working interests in the estates.

<PAGE>
In  exchange  for such  mineral  estates,  the  Company  plans to pay a total of
$100,000 in a combination of cash and stock, as follows:
o    $75,000.00 in cash; and
o    $25,000.00 in the form of 50,000  shares of the  Company's  restricted
          common stock.
The  properties  are located in Grand County,  Utah in the Greater Cisco area of
the Uintah  Basin and are  located in the  vicinity  of the  Company's  existing
properties in the Greater Cisco area.
S&L ENERGY, INC.
----------------
On June 14,  2013,  the Company  and S&L Energy,  Inc.  ("S&L")  entered  into a
Purchase and Sale  Agreement  ("S&L  Purchase  Agreement.").  As part of the S&L
Purchase  Agreement,  the  Company  acquired  all right and title to oil and gas
leases for a total of 722 gross acres in the Musselshell County, Montana.
The property  includes 120 acres for all zones other than the 1st Cat Creek. The
1st Cat Creek formation on the 120 acres was previously  acquired from Jake Oil,
LLC.
In exchange for such oil and gas leases,  the Company plans to pay $101,100 in a
combination of cash and stock, as follows:
o    $65,000.00 in cash; and
o    $36,100.00  payable in  restricted  common  stock  valued at $0.58 per
          share (2/3 of the June 4, 2013 closing  price of $0.87) for a total of
          62,242 shares.
In addition,  the Company has a thirty day option to purchase  other oil and gas
leases in the Musselshell Field from S&L Energy for a price of $60 per acre.
The  properties  are  located in the Mason Lake field in Central  Montana in the
Amsden  (Alaska  Bench)   Formation  which  is  late   Mississippian   to  Early
Pennsylvanian in age. The Amsden  formation is a series of sandstone,  shale and
limestone, which was deposited under marine conditions in the Paleozoic Era. The
Amsden  Formation  overlays  the  Tensleep  Formation  and is  above  the  Heath
Formation, traditionally known as the Pennsylvanian Tyler Sand Play area.
JAKE OIL, LLC
-------------
On June 14, 2013, the Company and Jake Oil, LLC ("Jake") entered into a Purchase
and  Sale  Agreement  ("the  Jake  Oil  Agreement").  As  part of the  Jake  Oil
Agreement,  the Company acquired all right and title to oil and gas leases for a
total of 559  gross  acres in the Unit for the 1st Cat  Creek  formation  in the
Musselshell County, Montana.
The  property  includes  6 wells in a field to be water  flooded  that needs the
wells to be re-worked.  Additional drilling may be performed to maximize the oil
recovery from the formation.  The Company plans to begin production in the third
quarter of 2013.
In exchange for such oil and gas leases,  the Company plans to pay approximately
$25,000 in cash and a 5 percent working interest.
The  properties  are  located in the Mason Lake field in Central  Montana in the
Amsden  (Alaska  Bench)   Formation  which  is  late   Mississippian   to  Early
Pennsylvanian  in age. The 1st Cat Creek is at about 4,200 feet and is above the
Amsden formation.

THE OFFERING
We are  registering  4,290,710  shares  listed  for sale on  behalf  of  selling
shareholders and 1,604,000 shares of common stock underlying our $0.50 Warrants.
A total  of  $802,000  may be  raised  by us if all of the  $0.50  Warrants  are
exercised.  We will NOT  receive  any  proceeds  from sales of shares by selling
shareholders.  Furthermore,  given that we have  limited  operating  history and
minimal  revenues,  it is highly unlikely that our warrants will be exercised at
$0.50 in the foreseeable future.
Each $0.50 Warrant  entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at
$0.50  during the  two-year  period of July 1, 2011  through  July 8, 2013.  Our
common stock,  only, will be transferable  immediately after the closing of this
offering.  We will undertake to keep the registration  statement,  of which this
Prospectus is a part, current during the term of the warrants. (See "Description
of Securities")

GLOSSARY
The following are definitions of terms used in this Memorandum:
BBL. An  abbreviation  for the term "barrel" which is a unit of measurement
of volume of oil or related  petroleum  products.  One  barrel  (one bbl) is the
equivalent of 42 U.S. gallons or approximately 159 liters.
BONUS  PAYMENT.  Usually  a one time  payment  made to a  mineral  owner as
consideration for the execution of an oil and gas lease.
CASING  POINT.  That point in time  during the  drilling  of an oil well at
which a decision is made to install  well casing and to attempt to complete  the
well as an oil producer.
COMPLETION.  The  procedure  used in finishing  and equipping an oil or gas
well for production.
DELAY RENTAL.  Payment made to the lessor under a nonproducing  oil and gas
lease at the end of each year to continue  the lease in force for  another  year
during its primary term.
DEVELOPMENT  WELL.  A well  drilled  to a known  producing  formation  in a
previously  discovered field, usually offsetting a producing well on the same or
an adjacent oil and gas lease.
EXPLORATORY  WELL. A well drilled  either (a) in search of a new and as yet
undiscovered pool of oil or gas or (b) with the hope of significantly  extending
the limits of a pool already developed (also known as a "wildcat well").
FARMIN.  An agreement  which allows a party earn a full or partial  working
interest (also known as an "earned working interest") in an oil and gas lease in
return for providing exploration or development funds.
FARMOUT.  An  agreement  whereby  the  owner of the  leasehold  or  working
interest  agrees to assign a portion of his interest in certain  acreage subject
to the  drilling  of one or more  specific  wells  or other  performance  by the
assignee as a condition  of the  assignment.  Under a farmout,  the owner of the
leasehold or working  interest may retain some  interest  such as an  overriding
royalty  interest,  an oil and gas  payment,  offset  acreage  or other  type of
interest.
GROSS ACRE.  An acre in which a working  interest  is owned.  The number of
gross acres is the total number of acres in which an interest is owned (see "Net
Acre" below).
GROSS  WELL.  A well in which a working  interest  is owned.  The number of
gross wells is the total number of wells in which a working interest is owned.
LANDOWNER  ROYALTY.  That  interest  retained  by the  holder  of a mineral
interest upon the  execution of an oil and gas lease which  usually  ranges from
1/8 to 1/4 of all gross revenues from oil and gas production  unencumbered  with
an expenses of operation, development or maintenance.
LEASES. Full or partial interests in oil or gas properties  authorizing the
owner of the lease to drill for,  produce  and sell oil and gas upon  payment of
rental,  bonus,  royalty or any of them.  Leases  generally  are  acquired  from
private  landowners  (fee  leases)  and from  federal and state  governments  on
acreage held by them.
LEASE  PLAY.  A term  used to  describe  lease  acquisition  activity  in a
prospect or geologically defined area.
-7-
<PAGE>
MCF. An abbreviation for "1,000 cubic feet," which is a unit of measurement
of volume for natural gas.
NET WELL OR ACRE. A net well or acre exists when the sum of the  fractional
ownership  working  interests  in gross wells or acres equals one. The number of
net wells or acres is the sum of the factional  working interests owned in gross
wells or acres expressed as whole number and fractions thereof.
NET REVENUE INTEREST.  The fractional  undivided interest in the oil or gas
or in the  revenues  from the sale of oil or gas  attributable  to a  particular
working  interest  after  reduction  for a  proportionate  share of  landowner's
royalty interest and overriding royalty interest.
OVERRIDING  ROYALTY.  An interest in the gross revenues or production  over
and above the  landowner's  royalty carved out of the working  interest and also
unencumbered with any expenses of operation, development or maintenance.
PAYOUT.  The point in time when the  cumulative  total of gross income from
the  production of oil and gas from a given well (and any proceeds from the sale
of such  well)  equals the  cumulative  total cost and  expenses  of  acquiring,

drilling and completion costs.
PROSPECT. A geological area which is believed to have the potential for oil
or gas production.
PROVED  DEVELOPED  RESERVES.  The  reserves  which  can be  expected  to be
recovered through existing wells with existing  equipment and operating methods.
Such  reserves  include the reserves  which are expected to be produced from the
existing completion interval(s) now open for production in existing wells and in
addition  to those  reserves  which exist  behind the casing  (pipe) of existing
wells,  or at minor  depths  below the present  bottom of such wells,  which are
expected to be produced through these wells in the predictable  future where the
cost of making such oil and gas  available for  production  is relatively  small
compared to the cost of drilling a new well.
PROVED  UNDEVELOPED  RESERVES.  Proved  reserves  which are  expected to be
recovered  from new wells on undrilled  acreage,  or from existing wells where a
relatively  major  expenditure  is  required  for a  recompletion.  Reserves  on
undrilled  acreage are limited to those drilling  tracts  offsetting  productive
units which are reasonable  certain of production when drilled.  Proved reserves
for other undrilled  tracts are claimed only where it can be  demonstrated  with
certainty  that there is continuity of production  from the existing  productive
formation.
REVERSIONARY  INTEREST.  The portion of the working  interest in an oil and
gas lease which will be returned to its former owner when payout occurs or after
a predetermined amount of production and income has been produced.
UNDEVELOPED LEASEHOLD ACREAGE.  Leased acreage on which wells have not been
drilled or completed to a point that would permit the  production  of commercial
quantities of oil and gas.
WORKING INTEREST.  An interest in an oil and gas lease entitling the holder
at its  expense to conduct  drilling  and  production  operations  on the leased
property and to receive the net revenues  attributable  to such interest,  after
deducting the landowner's royalty, any overriding  royalties,  production costs,
taxes and other costs.
RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR COMPANY
Our  securities,  as  offered  hereby,  are  highly  speculative  and  should be
purchased only by persons who can afford to lose their entire  investment in us.
Each prospective  investor should carefully consider the following risk factors,
as well as all other information set forth elsewhere in this prospectus,  before
purchasing any of the shares of our common stock.
-8-
<PAGE>
OUR BUSINESS HAS AN OPERATING  HISTORY OF ONLY A YEAR AND A HALF AND IS UNPROVEN
AND THEREFORE RISKY.
We have only very recently  begun  operations  under the business plan discussed
herein.  Potential  investors  should be made aware of the risk and difficulties
encountered by a new enterprise in the oil and gas industry,  especially in view
of the intense competition from existing businesses in the industry.
WE HAVE A LACK OF REVENUE HISTORY AND INVESTORS CANNOT VIEW OUR PAST PERFORMANCE
SINCE WE ARE A START-UP COMPANY.
We were  formed on  February  13, 1997 for the purpose of engaging in any lawful
business and have adopted a plan to engage the acquisition,  exploration, and if
warranted,  development of natural resource properties.  Prior to the year ended
December  31, 2012,  we had no revenues in the last five years.  During the year
ended  December  31,  2012,  we did  recognize  revenues of $29,908.  We are not
profitable and the business  effort is considered to be in an early  development
stage.  We must be  regarded  as a new or  development  venture  with all of the
unforeseen  costs,  expenses,  problems,  risks and  difficulties  to which such
ventures are subject.
WE ARE NOT DIVERSIFIED AND WE WILL BE DEPENDENT ON ONLY ONE BUSINESS.
Because of the limited financial  resources that we have, it is unlikely that we
will be able to diversify our  operations.  Our probable  inability to diversify
our activities into more than one area will subject us to economic  fluctuations
within the energy industry and therefore  increase the risks associated with our
operations due to lack of diversification.
WE CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCE OF SUCCESS OR PROFITABILITY TO OUR INVESTORS.
There  is no  assurance  that we  will  ever  operate  profitably.  There  is no
assurance that we will generate revenues or profits, or that the market price of
our common stock will be increased thereby.
WE MAY HAVE A SHORTAGE OF WORKING  CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE WHICH COULD  JEOPARDIZE
OUR ABILITY TO CARRY OUT OUR BUSINESS PLAN.
Our  capital  needs  consist   primarily  of  expenses   related  to  geological
evaluation,  general and administrative and potential exploration  participation
and  could  exceed  $750,000  in the next  twelve  months.  Such  funds  are not
currently committed,  and we have cash of approximately  $250,000 as of the date
of this Registration Statement on Form S-1.
We will not receive any proceeds  from the sale of the common shares held by the
Selling  Shareholders.  We are registering a total of 1,604,000 shares of common
stock underlying Warrants exercisable at $0.50 per share, which if exercised; we
would  receive  proceeds  totaling  $802,000  from  the  exercise  of the  $0.50
Warrants.  We cannot provide any assurances that such warrants will be exercised
or when they would be exercised.
If we find oil and gas reserves to exist on a prospect, we will need substantial
additional  financing to fund the necessary  exploration and  development  work.
Furthermore,  if the  results  of that  exploration  and  development  work  are
successful, we will need substantial additional funds for continued development.
We will not  receive  proceeds  from this  offering  to  conduct  such work and,
therefore,  we will need to obtain the  necessary  funds either  through debt or
equity financing, some form of cost-sharing arrangement with others, or the sale
of all or part of the property. There is no assurance that we will be successful
in obtaining any financing.  These various financing alternatives may dilute the
interest of our shareholders and/or reduce our interest in the properties.  (See
"Use of Proceeds" and "Our Business")
WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING FOR WHICH WE HAVE NO COMMITMENTS, AND THIS MAY
JEOPARDIZE EXECUTION OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN.
We have  limited  funds,  and such funds may not be  adequate  to  carryout  the
business plan in the oil and gas industry. Our ultimate success depends upon our
ability to raise additional  capital. We have not investigated the availability,
-9-
<PAGE>
source,  or terms that might govern the  acquisition  of additional  capital and
will not do so until it determines a need for additional  financing.  If we need
additional  capital,  we have no assurance that funds will be available from any
source or, if available, that they can be obtained on terms acceptable to us. If
not available, our operations will be limited to those that can be financed with
our modest capital.
WE MAY IN THE FUTURE  ISSUE MORE  SHARES  WHICH COULD CAUSE A LOSS OF CONTROL BY
OUR PRESENT MANAGEMENT AND CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS.
We may issue further shares as consideration  for the cash or assets or services
out of our  authorized  but  unissued  common stock that would,  upon  issuance,
represent a majority of the voting power and equity of our  Company.  The result
of such an issuance would be those new stockholders and management would control
our Company, and persons unknown could replace our management at this time. Such
an occurrence  would result in a greatly reduced  percentage of ownership of our
Company by our current  shareholders,  which could present  significant risks to
investors.
WE HAVE  CONVERTIBLE  DEBT WHICH IS  CONVERTIBLE  INTO SHARES OF OUR  RESTRICTED
COMMON STOCK. A CONVERSION OF SUCH DEBT COULD HAVE A DILUTIVE EFFECT TO EXISTING
SHAREHOLDERS.
At July 1, 2013, we have outstanding convertible notes payable of $575,000. Such
notes are due one to three years from the date of issuance  and are  convertible
into shares of our  restricted  common stock in whole or in part at a conversion
price of $1.00 per share.  In addition,  $75,000 of our  convertible  promissory
notes provide that for every $5.00 principal converted,  the holder will receive
a warrant to purchase 1 share of common stock at a price of $2.00 per share. The
conversion of the convertible  promissory  notes into shares of our common stock
could have a dilutive effect to the holdings of our existing shareholders.
WE HAVE WARRANTS  ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING  WHICH ARE CONVERTIBLE  INTO OUR COMMON
STOCK. A CONVERSION OF SUCH EQUITY  INSTRUMENTS  COULD HAVE A DILUTIVE EFFECT TO
EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS.
At  July,  2013,  we have  warrants  issued  and  outstanding  exercisable  into
7,104,000 shares of our common stock at ranges from $0.25 to $3.00 per share. We
are  registering  1,604,000  shares  underlying our $0.50  Warrants.  We are not
registering  warrants  held by our  officers  and  directors.  The  warrants are
exercisable  in whole or in part. The 1,604,000  shares  underlying our warrants
being registered, upon the effectiveness of this registration statement, will be
free trading  shares and available for immediate  transfer.  The exercise of the
warrants  into shares of our common  stock  could have a dilutive  effect to the
holdings of our existing shareholders.
WE WILL  DEPEND  UPON  MANAGEMENT  BUT WE WILL  HAVE  LIMITED  PARTICIPATION  OF
MANAGEMENT.
Our directors are also acting as our officers. We will be heavily dependent upon
their skills,  talents, and abilities,  as well as several consultants to us, to
implement our business plan, and may, from time to time, find that the inability
of the officers,  directors and consultants to devote their full-time  attention
to our business results in a delay in progress toward  implementing our business
plan.  Consultants  may be employed on a part-time  basis under a contract to be
determined.
Our directors and officers are, or may become,  in their individual  capacities,
officers,  directors,  controlling shareholder and/or partners of other entities
engaged in a variety of  businesses.  Thus,  our officers and directors may have
potential  conflicts  including their time and efforts involved in participation
with other  business  entities.  Each  officer and  director of our  business is
engaged in business  activities outside of our business,  and the amount of time
they devote as Officers and  Directors,  with the  exception  of George  Harris,
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,  to our business will be up
to 25 hours  per  week.  Mr.  Harris  devotes  up to 40  hours  per  week.  (See
"Executive  Team")  Because  investors  will not be able to manage our business,
they should critically assess all of the information concerning our officers and
directors.
We do not know of any reason other than outside  business  interests  that would
prevent  them from  devoting  full-time  to our  Company,  when the business may
demand such full-time participation.
-10-
<PAGE>
OUR  OFFICERS  AND  DIRECTORS  MAY HAVE  CONFLICTS  OF INTERESTS AS TO CORPORATE
OPPORTUNITIES WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE OR ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN.
Presently  there is no requirement  contained in our Articles of  Incorporation,
Bylaws,  or minutes  which  requires  officers and  directors of our business to
disclose  to us  business  opportunities  which  come to  their  attention.  Our
officers and directors do,  however,  have a fiduciary  duty of loyalty to us to
disclose to us any  business  opportunities  which come to their  attention,  in
their  capacity as an officer and/or  director or otherwise.  Excluded from this
duty  would  be  opportunities   which  the  person  learns  about  through  his
involvement as an officer and director of another company.  We have no intention
of merging with or acquiring business  opportunity from any affiliate or officer
or director. (See "Conflicts of Interest" at page 47)
WE HAVE AGREED TO  INDEMNIFICATION  OF OFFICERS AND  DIRECTORS AS IS PROVIDED BY
WYOMING STATUTE.
Wyoming Statutes  provide for the  indemnification  of our directors,  officers,
employees, and agents, under certain circumstances,  against attorney's fees and
other  expenses  incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party
arising from their  association with or activities our behalf. We will also bear
the expenses of such litigation for any of our directors,  officers,  employees,
or agents,  upon such person's promise to repay us therefore if it is ultimately
determined that any such person shall not have been entitled to indemnification.
This indemnification policy could result in substantial  expenditures by us that
we will be unable to recoup.
OUR DIRECTORS' LIABILITY TO US AND SHAREHOLDERS IS LIMITED
Wyoming Revised  Statutes  exclude  personal  liability of our directors and our
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty except in certain
specified circumstances.  Accordingly, we will have a much more limited right of
action against our directors that  otherwise  would be the case.  This provision
does not affect the liability of any director under federal or applicable  state
securities laws.
RISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS
Any person or entity  contemplating  an  investment  in the  securities  offered
hereby  should be aware of the high  risks  involved  and the  hazards  inherent
therein. Specifically, the investor should consider, among others, the following
risks:
OUR BUSINESS,  THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS HAS NUMEROUS RISKS WHICH COULD RENDER US
UNSUCCESSFUL.
The  search for new oil and gas  reserves  frequently  results  in  unprofitable
efforts,  not only from dry holes, but also from wells which, though productive,
will not produce oil or gas in  sufficient  quantities to return a profit on the
costs  incurred.  There is no  assurance we will find or produce oil or gas from
any of the undeveloped  acreage farmed out to us or which may be acquired by us,
nor are there any  assurances  that if we ever obtain any  production it will be
profitable. (See "Business and Properties")
WE HAVE  SUBSTANTIAL  COMPETITORS WHO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER US IN RESOURCES AND
MANAGEMENT.
We are and will continue to be an  insignificant  participant in the oil and gas
business.   Most  of  our  competitors  have  significantly   greater  financial
resources,   technical  expertise  and  managerial  capabilities  than  us  and,
consequently,  we will  be at a  competitive  disadvantage  in  identifying  and
developing  or  exploring  suitable  prospects.   Competitor's  resources  could
overwhelm  our  restricted  efforts to acquire and explore oil and gas prospects
and cause failure of our business plan.
WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE MARKET FORCES IN THE ENERGY  BUSINESS,  MANY OF
WHICH COULD POSE A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO OUR OPERATIONS.
The marketing of natural gas and oil which may be produced by our prospects will
be affected by a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include the
extent  of  the  supply  of  oil or gas  in  the  market,  the  availability  of
competitive fuels, crude oil imports, the world-wide political situation,  price
regulation,  and other  factors.  Current  economic and market  conditions  have
-11-
<PAGE>
created  dramatic  fluctuations in oil prices.  Any significant  decrease in the
market prices of oil and gas could  materially  affect our  profitability of oil
and gas activities.
There  generally are only a limited  number of gas  transmission  companies with
existing  pipelines  in the  vicinity of a gas well or wells.  In the event that
producing gas properties are not subject to purchase  contracts or that any such
contracts terminate and other parties do not purchase our gas production,  there
is  assurance  that we will be able to enter into  purchase  contracts  with any
transmission  companies or other  purchasers  of natural gas and there can be no
assurance  regarding the price which such purchasers would be willing to pay for
such gas. There may, on occasion,  be an oversupply of gas in the marketplace or
in  pipelines;  the  extent  and  duration  may affect  prices  adversely.  Such
oversupply may result in reductions of purchases and prices paid to producers by
principal gas pipeline purchasers. (See "Our Business and Competition,  Markets,
Regulation and Taxation.")
WE BELIEVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSIDER CERTAIN NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF OUR OPERATIONS.
DRY HOLES:  We may  expend  substantial  funds  acquiring  and  potentially
participating  in  exploring  properties  which  we  later  determine  not to be
productive. All funds so expended will be a total loss to us.
TECHNICAL  ASSISTANCE:  We  will  find it  necessary  to  employ  technical
assistance in the operation of our business.  As of the date of this Prospectus,
we have  not  contracted  for  any  technical  assistance.  When we need it such
assistance is likely to be available at compensation  levels we would be able to
pay.
UNCERTAINTY  OF TITLE:  We will  attempt to acquire  leases or interests in
leases by option,  lease,  farmout or by purchase.  The validity of title to oil
and gas property depends upon numerous  circumstances  and factual matters (many
of which are not discoverable of record or by other readily available means) and
is subject to many uncertainties of existing law and our application.  We intend
to  obtain  an oil  and  gas  attorney's  opinion  of  valid  title  before  any
significant expenditure upon a lease.
GOVERNMENT  REGULATIONS:  The area of exploration of natural  resources has
become significantly  regulated by state and federal governmental  agencies, and
such regulation could have an adverse effect on our operations.  Compliance with
statutes and regulations  governing the oil and gas industry could significantly
increase the capital expenditures necessary to develop our prospects.
NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS:  Our business is highly  speculative,  involves the
commitment  of  high-risk  capital,  and exposes us to  potentially  substantial
losses. In addition,  we will be in direct competition with other  organizations
which are significantly better financed and staffed than we are.
GENERAL  ECONOMIC  AND OTHER  CONDITIONS:  Our  business  may be  adversely
affected  from time to time by such  matters as  changes  in  general  economic,
industrial and  international  conditions;  changes in taxes; oil and gas prices
and costs; excess supplies and other factors of a general nature.
OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT WEATHER INTERRUPTIONS.
Our  activities  may  be  subject  to  periodic  interruptions  due  to  weather
conditions.  Weather-imposed  restrictions  during  certain times of the year on
roads accessing  properties  could adversely  affect our ability to benefit from
production on such  properties or could increase the costs of drilling new wells
because of delays.
WE ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT OPERATING HAZARDS AND UNINSURED RISK IN THE ENERGY
INDUSTRY.
Our  proposed  operations  will be subject to all of the  operating  hazards and
risks  normally  incident to exploring,  drilling for and producing oil and gas,
such as encountering unusual or unexpected  formations and pressures,  blowouts,
environmental  pollution and personal injury. We will maintain general liability
insurance but we have not obtained insurance against such things as blowouts and
pollution  risks  because  of the  prohibitive  expense.  Should we  sustain  an
uninsured loss or liability,  or a loss in excess of policy limits,  our ability
to operate may be materially adversely affected.
-12-
<PAGE>
WE ARE  SUBJECT  TO FEDERAL  INCOME TAX LAWS AND  CHANGES  THEREIN  WHICH  COULD
ADVERSELY IMPACT US.
Federal  income  tax  laws  are of  particular  significance  to the oil and gas
industry in which we engage.  Legislation has eroded various benefits of oil and
gas producers and subsequent  legislation could continue this trend. Congress is
continually  considering proposals with respect to Federal income taxation which
could have a material adverse effect on our future operations and on our ability
to obtain risk  capital  which our  industry has  traditionally  attracted  from
taxpayers in high tax brackets.
WE ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION IN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY WHICH
COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT US.
The  production  and sale of oil and gas are subject to  regulation by state and
federal authorities, the spacing of wells and the prevention of waste. There are
both  federal  and  state  laws  regarding   environmental  controls  which  may
necessitate   significant   capital  outlays,   resulting  in  extended  delays,
materially  affect our earnings  potential and cause material  changes in the in
our proposed business. We cannot predict what legislation, if any, may be passed
by  Congress  or  state  legislatures  in the  future,  or the  effect  of  such
legislation,  if any, on us. Such  regulations may have a significant  affect on
our operating results.
RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR STOCK
THE REGULATION OF PENNY STOCKS BY SEC AND FINRA MAY  DISCOURAGE THE  TRADABILITY
OF OUR SECURITIES.
We are a "penny stock"  company.  Our securities are subject to a Securities and
Exchange  Commission rule that imposes special sales practice  requirements upon
broker-dealers  who sell such  securities  to  persons  other  than  established
customers  or  accredited  investors.  For  purposes  of the  rule,  the  phrase
"accredited  investors"  means,  in general terms,  institutions  with assets in
excess of $5,000,000,  or individuals having a net worth in excess of $1,000,000
or having an annual income that exceeds  $200,000 (or that, when combined with a
spouse's income,  exceeds $300,000).  For transactions  covered by the rule, the
broker-dealer  must make a special  suitability  determination for the purchaser
and receive the purchaser's  written  agreement to the transaction  prior to the
sale.  Effectively,  this  discourages  broker-dealers  from executing trades in
penny  stocks.  Consequently,  the rule will affect the ability of purchasers in
this  offering  to sell  their  securities  in any  market  that  might  develop
therefore  because  it imposes  additional  regulatory  burdens  on penny  stock
transactions.
In addition,  the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  has adopted a number of
rules to regulate "penny stocks". Such rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2,
15g-3,  15g-4,  15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. Because our securities constitute "penny stocks" within
the meaning of the rules, the rules would apply to us and to our securities. The
rules will further affect the ability of owners of shares to sell our securities
in any  market  that  might  develop  for them  because  it  imposes  additional
regulatory burdens on penny stock transactions.
Shareholders  should  be  aware  that,  according  to  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission,  the  market  for penny  stocks has  suffered  in recent  years from
patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for
the  security  by one or a few  broker-dealers  that are  often  related  to the
promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged  matching of
purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) "boiler room"
practices   involving   high-pressure   sales  tactics  and  unrealistic   price
projections  by  inexperienced  sales persons;  (iv)  excessive and  undisclosed
bid-ask  differentials  and  markups  by  selling  broker-dealers;  and  (v) the
wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and  broker-dealers  after
prices  have been  manipulated  to a desired  consequent  investor  losses.  Our
management is aware of the abuses that have occurred  historically  in the penny
stock  market.  Although  we do not  expect to be in a position  to dictate  the
behavior  of the market or of  broker-dealers  who  participate  in the  market,
management  will strive within the confines of practical  limitations to prevent
the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities.
WE WILL PAY NO FORESEEABLE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE.
We have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not ever anticipate paying
such dividends in the foreseeable future.

RULE 144 SALES IN THE FUTURE MAY HAVE A DEPRESSIVE EFFECT ON OUR STOCK PRICE.
All of the  outstanding  shares of common  stock held by our  present  officers,
directors,  and affiliate  stockholders are "restricted  securities"  within the
meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  As restricted
Shares,  these shares may be resold only  pursuant to an effective  registration
statement or under the requirements of Rule 144 or other  applicable  exemptions
from  registration  under  the  Act  and  as  required  under  applicable  state
securities  laws. We are registering all of our outstanding  shares so officers,
directors and affiliates will be able to sell their shares if this  Registration
Statement becomes effective.  Rule 144 provides in essence that a person who has
held restricted securities for six months, under certain conditions,  sell every
three months, in brokerage transactions, a number of shares that does not exceed
the  greater of 1.0% of a  company's  outstanding  common  stock or the  average
weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to the sale. There is
no  limit  on  the  amount  of  restricted  securities  that  may be  sold  by a
nonaffiliate after the owner has held the restricted  securities for a period of
six month.  A sale under Rule 144 or under any other  exemption from the Act, if
available,  or pursuant to subsequent  registration of shares of common stock of
present stockholders,  may have a depressive effect upon the price of the common
stock in any market that may develop.
OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE VOLATILE,  WHICH  SUBSTANTIALLY  INCREASES THE RISK THAT
YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR  SHARES AT OR ABOVE THE PRICE  THAT YOU MAY PAY
FOR THE SHARES.
Because of the limited  trading  market for our common  stock and because of the
possible  price  volatility,  you may not be able to sell your  shares of common
stock when you desire to do so. The  inability  to sell your shares in a rapidly
declining  market may  substantially  increase your risk of loss because of such
illiquidity and because the price for our Securities may suffer greater declines
because of our price volatility.
The price of our  common  stock  that will  prevail  in the  market  after  this
offering  may be higher or lower  than the price you may pay.  Certain  factors,
some of which  are  beyond  our  control,  that may  cause  our  share  price to
fluctuate significantly include, but are not limited to the following:
o    Variations in our quarterly operating results;
     o    Loss  of  a  key  relationship  or  failure  to  complete  significant
          transactions;
     o    Additions or departures of key personnel; and
     o    Fluctuations in stock market price and volume.
Additionally,   in  recent   years  the  stock   market  in  general,   and  the
over-the-counter  markets in  particular,  have  experienced  extreme  price and
volume  fluctuations.  In  some  cases,  these  fluctuations  are  unrelated  or
disproportionate to the operating  performance of the underlying company.  These
market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect our stock price,
regardless of our operating  performance.  In the past, class action  litigation
often has been brought against companies  following periods of volatility in the
market price of those companies common stock. If we become involved in this type
of litigation in the future,  it could result in substantial costs and diversion
of  management  attention  and  resources,  which could have a further  negative
effect on your investment in our stock.
ANY SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, IF IN SIGNIFICANT  AMOUNTS, ARE LIKELY TO DEPRESS
THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES.
Assuming all of the shares of common stock,  under this  Registration  Statement
are sold and all of the  shares of common  stock  held by the  selling  security
holders  registered  hereby are sold, we would have 5,742,780 shares  (7,346,780
shares,  if all of the $0.50 Warrants were exercised) that are freely  tradable.
Even our officers and  directors  are  registering a portion of their shares for
sale under this prospectus.
Unrestricted  sales of  4,290,710  shares of stock by our  selling  stockholders
(5,894,710  shares,  if all of the $0.50 Warrants were  exercised)  could have a
huge negative impact on our share price, and the market for our shares.

<PAGE>
ANY NEW POTENTIAL  INVESTORS WILL SUFFER A DISPROPORTIONATE  RISK AND THERE WILL
BE IMMEDIATE DILUTION OF EXISTING INVESTOR'S INVESTMENTS.
Our present  shareholders have acquired their securities at a cost significantly
less than that which the  investors  purchasing  pursuant to shares will pay for
their  stock  holdings  or at which  future  purchasers  in the  market may pay.
Therefore, any new potential investors will bear most of the risk of loss.
THE OFFERING  PRICE OF THE SHARES HAS BEEN  DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT  AND IS NOT
INDICATIVE OF THE POTENTIAL RESALE PRICE OF THE SHARES.
We have arbitrarily  determined the offering price of the shares of common stock
we are offering on behalf of our Selling  Shareholders and the shares underlying
our $0.50  Warrants.  Such price does not bear any  relationship  to our assets,
income or net worth, nor any market value.
The offering price should NOT be considered an indication of the actual value of
the shares or  securities.  Any market price is subject to change as a result of
market  conditions  and other  factors,  and no assurance  can be given that the
shares can ever be resold at the offering price or any market price, if at all.
ITEM 4. USE OF PROCEEDS
-----------------------
In the event  purchasers  in this  offering  elect to exercise  any of the $0.50
Warrants at the exercise  prices set forth in this  Prospectus,  we will realize
proceeds of $802,000.  The proceeds from the exercise of $0.50  Warrants will be
contributed  to our  working  capital  and  used to  build  our  business.  (See
"Proposed Business - Plan of Operation")
A total of $802,000 may be raised by us if all the $0.50 Warrants are exercised.
We will NOT receive any proceeds  from sales of shares by selling  shareholders.
Furthermore,  given that we have limited operating history and minimal revenues,
it is unlikely that our warrants will be exercised at the $0.50 per share in the
foreseeable future.
We anticipate  using the funds received from the exercise of the warrants toward
our oil and gas acquisition activities and development  activities.  Although we
have identified specific  applications for the funds anticipated to be generated
from the  exercise  of the  warrants  and we will  apply the  proceeds  from the
exercise  of the  warrants  to general  corporate  funds.  Management  will have
complete  discretionary  control over the actual  utilization  of said funds and
there can be no  assurance  as to the manner or time in which said funds will be
utilized.  We have set budget  categories  as shown in the table  below and will
prioritize  as shown in such  tables by the  categories  under  each  respective
percentage.
We make no assurance  that all the warrants  will be exercised  and that we will
receive any of the $802,000 as anticipated.
We have not included  any funds from the sale of warrants in our 2013  operating
plan and budget.  If any warrants are exercised in 2013, the funds received from
such  exercised  warrants  would be used as working  capital and for oil and gas
acquisition and development.
The  monies  we  have  raised  thus  far  from  selling  stock  to  our  current
Shareholders  is  anticipated  to be  sufficient  to pay  all  expenses  of this
registration  statement,  which is estimated to be $25,000.  The total amount of
the money raised from the sale of the Shares underlying Warrants we are offering
will be used for the purpose of furthering  our plan of  operation,  as detailed
under the heading "PLAN OF OPERATION" below.
The  registration  of our  Warrants  is  intended to and will permit our warrant
holders to potentially capitalize,  at a profit, on any rise in the market price
of our common stock.  In the event that the shares  underlying  the warrants are
sold by the Selling warrant holders,  we will receive none of the proceeds there
from.

ITEM 5. DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE
---------------------------------------
The Common Stock is presently  thinly traded on the  over-the-counter  market on
the OTC Bulletin Board maintained by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(the  "FINRA").  The OTCBB symbol for the Common Stock is "HENI." The  Company's
stock began trading on the OTC Bulletin Board on December 31, 2010.
The  offering  price of the  Common  Stock  being  registered  on behalf of the
selling  shareholders was determined using a 5-day average of the closing market
price at the time of the original registration in July 2012. We will not receive
any proceeds from the sale of our stock by our selling shareholders.
------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------
                      TITLE                              PER SECURITY
------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------
                  Common Stock                              $0.65
------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------
     Common Stock underlying $0.50 Warrants                 $0.50
------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------
We have  arbitrarily  determined  our offering  price for shares  underlying the
$0.50  Warrants  to be sold  pursuant  to this  offering  at $0.50.  The Warrant
exercise prices or the convertible  promissory notes  conversion  prices bear no
relationship to any criteria of goodwill value,  lock value or any other measure
of  value  and were  arbitrarily  determined  in the  judgment  of the  Board of
Directors.
ITEM 6. DILUTION

The following table sets forth with respect to existing shareholders, the number
of our shares of common stock purchased the percentage ownership of such shares,
the total consideration paid, the percentage of total consideration paid and the
average price per share.  All  percentages  are computed  based upon  cumulative
shares  and  consideration  assuming  sale of all  shares  in the  line  item as

"Net tangible book value" is the amount that results from  subtracting the total
liabilities and intangible  assets from the total assets of an entity.  Dilution
occurs  because we  determined  the offering  price based on factors  other than
those used in computing  book value of our stock.  Dilution  exists  because the
book value of shares held by existing  stockholders  is lower than the  offering
price offered to new investors.
(1)  2,000,000  shares  of  common  shares  are  issued  upon  exercise  of
          warrants.
(2)  Percentage  relates  to total  percentage  of  shares  sold up to such
          increment.
(3)  Percentage  relates to total  percentage of capital  raised up to such
          increment.

Following is a table  detailing  dilution to investors if 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%
of the shares underlying the warrants in the offering are exercised.

(1)  Computation  of Net  Tangible  Book  Value  per  share  after  Warrant
          exercise assumes proceeds from the exercise of the 1,604,000  warrants
          at $0.50.
As at March 31, 2013,  the net tangible  book value of our stock was $0.0001 per
share.  If we are  successful  in  achieving  exercise  of the  warrants  at the
exercise price, that would represent an immediate  increase in net tangible book
value per share and per share dilution to new investors as shown in chart above,
assuming the warrants are exercised at a price of $0.50 for 1,604,000 shares.
If all of the  $0.50  warrants  are  fully  exercised,  the  new  total  capital
contributed  will be $802,000.  The existing  stockholders  will then hold, as a
percentage,  92.03% of our issued and outstanding shares,  while the new warrant
holders will hold, as a percentage, 7.97%.
The  exercise of the warrants by the holders  thereof  could result in a further
dilution of the book value of our Common Stock. Furthermore,  the holders of the
warrants  might be  expected to  exercise  them at a time when we would,  in all
likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital by a new offering of securities
on terms more favorable than those provided for by the warrants.
ITEM 7. SELLING SECURITY HOLDERS

ITEM 8. PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
----------------------------
Upon  effectiveness  of this amendment to the registration  statement,  of which
this  prospectus is a part,  our existing  selling  shareholders  may sell their
securities   at  market   prices  or  at  any  price  in  privately   negotiated
transactions.
Our selling shareholders may be deemed underwriters in this offering.
The selling shareholders are not paying any of the offering expenses and we will
not  receive  any of the  proceeds  from the sale of the  shares by the  selling
shareholders.
ITEM 9. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES
---------------------------------
The securities  being  registered  and/or offered by this  Prospectus are common
shares.
COMMON STOCK
We are presently  authorized to issue fifty million  (50,000,000)  shares of our
common  stock.  A total  of  Eighteen  Million,  Five  Hundred  and  Twenty-Nine
Thousand, Seven Hundred and Sixty-Nine (18,529,769) common shares are issued and
outstanding.
COMMON SHARES
All  shares are equal to each other  with  respect to voting,  liquidation,  and
dividend rights. Special shareholders' meetings may be called by the officers or
director,  or upon the request of holders of at least one-tenth  (1/10th) of the
outstanding  shares.  Holders  of  shares  are  entitled  to  one  vote  at  any
shareholders' meeting for each share they own as of the record date fixed by the
board of directors.  There is no quorum requirement for shareholders'  meetings.
Therefore,  a vote of the majority of the shares  represented  at a meeting will
govern  even  if  this is  substantially  less  than a  majority  of the  shares
outstanding.  Holders of shares are entitled to receive such dividends as may be
declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefore, and
upon  liquidation  are entitled to  participate  pro rata in a  distribution  of
assets  available  for  such  a  distribution  to  shareholders.  There  are  no
conversion,  pre-emptive or other subscription rights or privileges with respect
to any  shares.  Reference  is made to our  Articles  of  Incorporation  and our
By-Laws as well as to the applicable statutes of the State of Wyoming for a more
complete  description  of the rights and  liabilities  of holders of shares.  It
should be noted that the board of directors  without notice to the  shareholders
may amend the By-Laws.  Our shares do not have cumulative  voting rights,  which
means that the holders of more than fifty percent (50%) of the shares voting for
election of  directors  may elect all the  directors if they choose to do so. In
such event,  the holders of the  remaining  shares  aggregating  less than fifty
percent  (50%) of the shares voting for election of directors may not be able to
elect any director.

ITEM 11. INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE REGISTRANT
---------------------------------------------------
a. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
--------------------------
Hinto Energy, Inc. ("We," "Us," "Our") was organized under the laws of the State
of Wyoming on February 13, 1997, as Garner Investments, Inc. On August 18, 2012,
we amended our  Articles of  Incorporation  to change our name to Hinto  Energy,
Inc. and to authorize 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock. We were organized to
engage in the acquisition, exploration, and if warranted, development of oil and
gas prospects in the rocky mountain region.
Prior to January 2012,  we had minimal  operations  that were focused  mainly on
administrative  activities  and  the  identification  of  potential  oil and gas
prospects.  On January 23, 2012, we acquired 100% of the issued and  outstanding
common stock of South Uintah Gas Properties,  Inc. ("South Uintah")  pursuant to
the Share  Purchase  and Exchange  Agreement  ("the Share  Exchange  Agreement")
entered  into on July  27,  2011,  at the time  South  Uintah  was our  majority
shareholder, as discussed below.
On July 11, 2011,  prior to entering into the Share  Exchange  Agreement,  South
Uintah had  purchased  3,000,000  shares of the Company  from its then  majority
shareholder  Ms.  Sharon  Fowler.   After  such  purchase,   South  Uintah  held
approximately  70% of the issued and  outstanding  common  stock of the Company.
Prior to closing of the  acquisition of South Uintah,  South Uintah  transferred
300,000  shares to an  unrelated  third party as partial  consideration  for the
acquisition  of the  gas  prospect  in  Utah.  As  part  of the  Share  Exchange
Agreement,  South Uintah has agreed to return the remaining  2,700,000 shares of
common stock to the Company. We have retired such shares to treasury, concurrent
with the transaction.
COMPANY OVERVIEW
SHARE ACQUISITION AND EXCHANGE AGREEMENT
On July 27, 2011,  we entered into a Share  Exchange and  Acquisition  Agreement
with South Uintah and the South  Uintah  shareholders.  On January 23, 2012,  we
entered into an Amended Share Exchange and  Acquisition  Agreement ("the Amended
Share Exchange Agreement"). Pursuant to the Amended Share Exchange Agreement, we
agreed to issue shares of our restricted common stock for 100% of the issued and
outstanding  common stock of South  Uintah.  The shares are to be exchanged on a
one for one basis. As a result, South Uintah became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company.
In addition to the exchange of common stock, we exchanged on a one for one basis
the  following  outstanding  equity  documents  with those of our own. The table
below sets forth the equity that was exchanged.
Type of Equity        South Uintah Balance             Issued By Hinto
---------------------- ------------------------ ---- -------------------------
Common Stock                 11,446,931 shares              11,446,931 shares
Warrants (1)                         6,700,000                      6,700,000
Promissory Note (2)                   $375,000                       $375,000
----------------------
     (1)  The  warrants  have  exercise  prices  ranging from $0.50 to $3.00 per
          share and terms ranging from 2 to 5 years.
(2)  The  promissory  note has a provision to convert into shares of common
          stock at $0.20 per share. Such shares are not being registered in this
          Registration Statement.
At the time of the acquisition, George Harris, Gary Herick, Max Sommer and Kevin
Blair,  officers and directors of Hinto,  were and are  officers,  directors and
shareholders of South Uintah.  Mr. David Keller, a director of Hinto, was also a
shareholder of South Uintah.
-22-
<PAGE>
The effective date of the  acquisition  was December 31, 2011,  with Hinto being
the legal acquirer.  However, since Hinto is a public company, which had nominal
activity,  the  acquisition was treated as a  recapitalization  of South Uintah.
Though  Hinto  was the  legal  acquirer  in the  merger,  South  Uintah  was the
accounting acquirer since its shareholders gained control of Hinto. Therefore at
the date of the merger  the  historical  financial  statements  of South  Uintah
became those of Hinto. As a result, the historical financial statements of South
Uintah supersede any prior financial statements of Hinto.
SOUTH UINTAH
South  Uintah was  incorporated  in the State of  Colorado  in March 2011 and is
headquartered  in Denver,  Colorado.  South Uintah has  interests in oil and gas
properties.  South Uintah acquired interests in approximately  5,366 gross acres
in the Central part of the Uintah Basin, at Natural Buttes, Utah from a farmout.
The  acreage  is  located  in a  prolific  gas  production  area  from  multiple
hydrocarbon reservoirs such as: Castlegate,  Mancos, Dakota, Buck Tongue, Emery,
Frontier  and Prairie  Canyon.  The upper zones  above 9,800 feet  (approx)  are
precluded  in the farmout and the overall  targets will be zones from 9,800 feet
to 16,000 feet.
The  Company  intends  to  strive  to be a low cost and  effective  producer  of
hydrocarbons and intends to develop the business model and corporate strategy as
discussed herein.
The  Company's  approach to lease  acquisition,  development  and  production is
founded  on  the  discipline  of  ONLY  acquiring  leases  in  areas  of  proven
production.  In most cases the leases that are under  consideration  have at one
time  contained  producing  oil or gas wells and  currently  have  production or
shut-in wells that are viable for work over and or  re-completion.  This managed
risk  approach  greatly  reduces the risk normally  associated  with oil and gas
development. There are hundreds of wells in our area of interest that meet these
criteria. In many instances, the wells were shut-in during a period of declining
oil and gas  prices  and in most  cases are ideal for our  business  model.  Our
business model is simple;  strict adherence to lease  acquisition  surrounded by
proven  production,  offering well  workovers,  re-completion,  and enhanced oil
recovery  opportunities  in the  known  producing  formations,  with  long  term
production potential at a low cost of development,  maintenance,  and operation.
The Company is NOT an exploration  company,  per se, rather it seeks leases with
discovered oil and gas with current or prior production.
One strategy that is quickly growing in prominence and application  with respect
to  petroleum  is  to  use a  development  program  approach.  We  describe  our
development  plan  approach as a set of  techniques  utilizing  the injection of
specific fluids such as: water,  steam,  natural gas, carbon dioxide,  nitrogen,
and various  chemicals  and  surfactants  intended to increase the amount of oil
that can ultimately be extracted from any oil field.  Many oil  exploration  and
production  companies are using development  program  approaches to maximize the
potential of old oil fields.
Our  business  operations  are in the  development,  production,  and  low  risk
exploration  of oil and gas including  unconventional  natural gas, in the Rocky
Mountain region of the  continental  United States;  specifically,  in the Rocky
Mountain area of Utah, Colorado, Montana and Wyoming.
CORPORATE STRATEGY
Our corporate  strategy in developing our  operations  and evaluating  potential
acquisitions is as follows.
PURSUE CONCURRENT DEVELOPMENT OF OUR CORE AREA OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.
We  plan  to  spend  up  to  $10,000,000  on   acquisition,   drilling,
         re-completion, and development programs which were started in late 2011
         and will  continue  in 2013.  We plan to raise  these  funds in Private
         Placements of Common Stock,  Preferred Stock and/or  convertible  debt.
         All drilling capital  expenditures in 2012 were incurred in Utah and we
         expect that to continue throughout 2013. Many of our targeted prospects
         are  in  reservoirs  that  have   demonstrated   predictable   geologic
         attributes and consistent  reservoir  characteristics,  which typically
         lead to more repeatable  drilling and re-completion  results than those
         achieved through wildcats.
-23-
<PAGE>
ACHIEVE CONSISTENT RESERVE GROWTH THROUGH REPEATABLE DEVELOPMENT
We intend to achieve consistent reserve growth over the next four years
         through a combination of acquisitions and drilling. In 2012, we focused
our efforts achieving  production  increases as a result of our re-work
         and re-completion activities on our Natural Buttes project. In 2013, we
         intend to continue to focus on our acquisition, drilling, re-completion
         and  development  programs.  We anticipate  that the majority of future
         reserve and  production  growth will come  through the  acquisition  of
         production,  the execution of our drilling and  re-completion  program,
         and on development activities on prospects of which we are aware, which
         include  proved and  unproved  locations.  Our targets  generally  will
         consist of  locations in fields that  demonstrate  low variance in well
         performance,   which  leads  to  predictable   and   repeatable   field
         development.
Our reserve estimates, if any, may change continuously and we intend to
         evaluate  such  reserve  estimates  internally  on a frequent  basis --
         quarterly if warranted -- with independent engineering evaluation on an
         annual  basis.  Deviations  in the market  prices of both crude oil and
         natural gas and the effects of acquisitions,  dispositions, development
         and any successful exploration activities may have a significant effect
         on the quantities and future values of our reserves, if any.
MAINTAIN HIGH PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP AND OPERATIONAL CONTROL OVER OUR ASSET BASE
We intend to retain a high degree of operational control over our asset
         base, through a high average Working Interest or acting as the operator
         in our areas of  significant  activity.  This is designed to provide us
         with  controlling  interests  in a  multi-year  inventory  of  drilling
         locations, positioning us for reserve and production growth through our
         drilling  operations.   We  plan  to  control  the  timing,  level  and
         allocation of our drilling capital  expenditures and the technology and
         methods  utilized in the planning,  drilling and completion  process on
         related  targets.  We believe  this  flexibility  to  opportunistically
         pursue  low risk  exploration  and  development  projects  relating  to
         selected  prospects  may  provide  us  with  a  meaningful  competitive
         advantage.
ACQUIRE AND MAINTAIN ACREAGE POSITIONS IN HIGH POTENTIAL RESOURCE PLAYS
We believe  that our  intended  acquisition  and  development  in known
         production  prospects  in  the  Rockies  should  be  supplemented  with
         exploratory  efforts that may lead to new discoveries in the future. We
         intend to continually  evaluate our  opportunities and pursue potential
         opportunities  that take advantage of our  strengths.  We are examining
         potential  prospects in such areas as Utah, Wyoming and Montana,  which
         have gained substantial  interest within the exploration and production
         sector due to their relatively  under-explored nature and the potential
         for  meaningful  hydrocarbon  recoveries.  There are other mid-size and
         large  independent  exploration  and  production  companies  conducting
         drilling activities in these plays.
PURSUE A DISCIPLINED ACQUISITION STRATEGY IN OUR CORE AREAS OF OPERATION
We intend  to also  focus on  growing  through  targeted  acquisitions.
         Although drilling prospects may provide us with the opportunity to grow
         reserves and production without  acquisitions,  we continue to evaluate
         acquisition opportunities, primarily in our core areas of operation.
EXPERIENCED  MANAGEMENT  AND  OPERATIONAL  TEAM WITH  ADVANCED  EXPLORATION  AND
DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGY
Our senior  management  team has over 75 years of experience in the oil
         and gas industry,  and has a proven track record of creating value both
         organically and through strategic acquisitions.  Our management intends
         to  utilize  the  best   available  and   fit-for-purpose   technology,
         sophisticated geologic and 3-D seismic models to enhance predictability
and reproducibility  over significantly  larger areas than historically
         possible.  We also  intend to utilize  state-of-the  art  drilling  and
         completion  technology,  as well as multi-zone,  multi-stage artificial
         stimulation  ("frac")  technology in completing  wells to substantially
         increase near-term production,  resulting in faster payback periods and
         higher rates of return and present  values.  Our team has  successfully
         applied these techniques,  normally  associated with completions in the
         most  advanced  Rocky  Mountain  crude oil and natural  gas fields,  to

improve  initial  and  ultimate   production  and  returns,   in  other
         companies.
RECENT PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS
PRIDE VENTURES, LLC AND JAMES WOOLSEY
-------------------------------------
On June 4, 2013, the Company and Pride Ventures, LLC ("Pride") and James Woolsey
("Woolsey")  entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement ("the Pride Purchase and
Sale Agreement."). As part of the Pride Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Company
acquired all right and title to certain mineral  estates in Grand County,  Utah.
The transaction had a closing date of June 17, 2013.
The  mineral  estates  include  4,435  acres,  9 well  bores  and space to drill
additional  wells.  In  addition,  the  Company  acquired  Pride's  natural  gas
gathering system,  which  interconnects  with the Company's  existing  gathering
system,  thereby  reducing new pipe  gathering  system  construction  by several
miles. The Company has acquired 100% of the working interests in the estates.
In  exchange  for such  mineral  estates,  the  Company  plans to pay a total of
$100,000 in a combination of cash and stock, as follows:
o    $75,000.00 in cash; and
o    $25,000.00 in the form of 50,000  shares of the  Company's  restricted
          common stock.
The  properties  are located in Grand County,  Utah in the Greater Cisco area of
the Uintah  Basin and are  located in the  vicinity  of the  Company's  existing
properties in the Greater Cisco area.
S&L ENERGY, INC.
----------------
On June 14,  2013,  the Company  and S&L Energy,  Inc.  ("S&L")  entered  into a
Purchase and Sale  Agreement  ("S&L  Purchase  Agreement.").  As part of the S&L
Purchase  Agreement,  the  Company  acquired  all right and title to oil and gas
leases for a total of 722 gross acres in the Musselshell County, Montana.
The property  includes 120 acres for all zones other than the 1st Cat Creek. The
1st Cat Creek formation on the 120 acres was previously  acquired from Jake Oil,
LLC.
In exchange for such oil and gas leases,  the Company plans to pay $101,100 in a
combination of cash and stock, as follows:
o    $65,000.00 in cash; and
o    $36,100.00  payable in  restricted  common  stock  valued at $0.58 per
          share (2/3 of the June 4, 2013 closing  price of $0.87) for a total of
          62,242 shares.
In addition,  the Company has a thirty day option to purchase  other oil and gas
leases in the Musselshell Field from S&L Energy for a price of $60 per acre.
The  properties  are  located in the Mason Lake field in Central  Montana in the
Amsden  (Alaska  Bench)   Formation  which  is  late   Mississippian   to  Early
Pennsylvanian in age. The Amsden  formation is a series of sandstone,  shale and
limestone, which was deposited under marine conditions in the Paleozoic Era. The
Amsden  Formation  overlays  the  Tensleep  Formation  and is  above  the  Heath
Formation, traditionally known as the Pennsylvanian Tyler Sand Play area.

<PAGE>
JAKE OIL, LLC
-------------
On June 14, 2013, the Company and Jake Oil, LLC ("Jake") entered into a Purchase
and  Sale  Agreement  ("the  Jake  Oil  Agreement").  As  part of the  Jake  Oil
Agreement,  the Company acquired all right and title to oil and gas leases for a
total of 559  gross  acres in the Unit for the 1st Cat  Creek  formation  in the
Musselshell County, Montana.
The  property  includes  6 wells in a field to be water  flooded  that needs the
wells to be re-worked.  Additional drilling may be performed to maximize the oil
recovery from the formation.  The Company plans to begin production in the third
quarter of 2013.
In exchange for such oil and gas leases,  the Company plans to pay approximately
$25,000 in cash and a 5 percent working interest.
The  properties  are  located in the Mason Lake field in Central  Montana in the
Amsden  (Alaska  Bench)   Formation  which  is  late   Mississippian   to  Early
Pennsylvanian  in age. The 1st Cat Creek is at about 4,200 feet and is above the
Amsden formation.
OIL AND GAS PROJECTS
Our initial  projects are centered on the Uintah Basin of Utah. The Uintah Basin
has long been known to contain  petroleum  and natural  gas and has  established
itself as a petroleum  production hub in the United States. The Utah Division of
Oil, Gas, and Mining have recently  approved a significant  density increase for
the Altamont Bluebell Cedar Rim Oil Field, opening up expanded opportunities for
development  drilling.  This  recent  increased  density  allotment,  may  allow
extended access to some of the richest petroleum  reserves in the United States,
that until now have remained unavailable for drilling.
Ever since the discoveries of large reserves in the late 1940s, the Uintah Basin
has proven to be a rich  petroleum  area for  companies.  From the time that the
initial boom of the region commenced, it has been in a state of growth. From the
late 1960's through the mid 1980's  companies  such as Exxon,  Chevron Gulf, and
Shell  Oil  achieved   remarkable   success  in  the  basin  by  drilling   into
over-pressurized geological formations. Historically, these deep pay zones known
as the Wasatch and Wasatch  Transition  Formations  have led to some of the most
productive onshore "flowing" oil wells in the continental U.S.
NATURAL BUTTES
South  Uintah,  in July 2011,  acquired  deep  rights  interests  via farmout in
approximately  5,366 gross and 4,887 net acres  within the  Central  part of the
Uintah Basin,  at Natural  Buttes,  a prolific gas production area from multiple
hydrocarbon reservoirs such as: Castlegate,  Mancos, Dakota, Buck Tongue, Emery,
Frontier and Prairie Canyon. The agreement was subsequently  amended on December
31, 2011.  The purchase price of the farmout  interest was $478,200,  made up of
$303,000 in cash,  $175,000 in notes  payable and $200 in common  stock of South
Uintah.
The upper zones above  approximately 9,800 feet are precluded in the farmout and
the overall targets will be zones from 9,800 feet to 16,000 feet.
In 2012,  we began the re-work of Federal  Conoco 22-1, a well which was drilled
in 1972 to a depth  of  20,053  feet.  We  believe  that  the  well was shut in,
primarily due to low gas prices at the time,  mechanical production issues and a
lack of proximity to a gas pipe line. We completed a lateral pipeline connection
that is approximately 2,000 foot long to the Anadarko pipeline in late 2011, the
early part of 2012.
We have reviewed the drilling,  geological and engineering  files for the Conoco
Federal No. 22-1 Well.  Our evaluation  indicates that the well has  significant
hydrocarbon potential in both the Frontier and the Upper Mancos Formations,  and
that  by  utilizing  best  available  completion  and  stimulation   techniques,
commercial production, may be possible.

WELL HISTORY:  This well was drilled in 1972 to a total depth of 20,053,  tested
in the  Frontier  Formation  from  14,666  to  14,803  at a rate of  1.15  MMCFD
declining in 8 hours to 0.250 MMCFD,  and  temporarily  abandoned.  The well was
re-entered  by Gilman  A. Hill in 1980.  In a WELL  COMPLETION  OR  RECOMPLETION
REPORT  filed  with  the USGS in 1981,  the well had been  cleaned  out from the
original  plug back depth of 14,108 feet to a new  plugged  back depth of 14,750
feet.  It had been  perforated  from 14, 580 feet to 14,800 feet and tested at a
rate  estimated to be 500 MCFD.  In a SUNDRY  NOTICES AND REPORTS ON WELLS filed
with the State of Utah,  Department of Natural Resources,  Division of Oil, Gas,
and Mining in 1985,  it was reported that the well had been placed in indefinite
suspended activity.
PLANNED  RE-WORKING:  Our review of the available  data  indicates that with the
application of best available  completion and  stimulation  practices,  the well
could  contain  commercial  reserves  in both  the  Frontier  and  Upper  Mancos
Formations.  We plan to re-work the well and individually test these formations,
when gas prices justify the expense.
Generally,  adjacent to the farmout acreage that includes the Conoco Federal No.
22-1 Well is our adjacent acreage,  which contains approximately 5,336 gross and
4,887 net acres.  If we drill this acreage on 160 acre spacing - a maximum of 27
wells -- and if consistent and similar results are obtained, we believe there is
potential  for  significant  gas  resources.  No results  can be  guaranteed  or
assured,  and the  financing  is not in place  for a  drilling  program  of this
magnitude.
AVAILABLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND MULTI-WELL DRILL SITES: The 22-1 well location is a
flat  developed  drill site with close highway  access and an access road.  This
infrastructure  provides the Company  with the ability to develop a  significant
portion  of its  acreage  from  one  drill  site  through  slant  drilling  with
accompanying  laterals.  A pipeline connection has been installed at the time of
this filing. This  environmentally  responsible  development plan is designed to
minimize  surface  impacts and is designed to provide a core  platform for up to
twelve wells without additional roads,  pipelines,  rights of way, etc. Assuming
any initial success,  the Company plans to drill continuously from this concrete
pad,  using  drilling  technology  developed and proved on Alaska's  North Slope
which utilizes a moveable drilling rig, allowing efficient and low cost movement
of the rig for a short distance to subsequent wells, without dismantling the rig
and incurring all the downtime and mobilization costs.
Total Field  Development  Costs are  estimated  to be $150  million to drill and
complete  up to 27  wells  over a 7.5  year  development  period.  None  of this
financing  for  drilling has been  obtained and there is no assurance  that such
financing could be obtained.
CISCO SPRING FIELD PROPERTIES
On May 9, 2012, the Company and Pacific  Energy and Mining  Company  ("Pacific")
entered into an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement ("The Pacific Agreement."). On
June 7,  2012,  the  Company  closed  the  transaction.  As part of the  Pacific
Agreement,  the Company acquired certain oil and gas wells and related assets in
the Greater  Cisco area of the Uintah  Basin in Grand  County,  Utah.  The Cisco
Springs Field is known to produce from the channel  sands in the Mancos,  Dakota
and Morrison formations,  with natural gas production from the Mancos and Dakota
formations.
The assets acquired include 4,783 gross acres in the Cisco Spring Fields with an
80% Net Revenue Interest (NRI) and  approximately  3,827 net acres. The property
includes 27 wells that need to be  re-worked,  connected to a gas  pipeline,  or
offset drilled.
In exchange  for such oil and gas wells and  related  assets,  the Company  paid
$325,000 in a combination of cash and a convertible promissory note, as follows:
-    $175,000 cash; and
-    a $150,000  convertible  promissory  note. The convertible  promissory
          note  has  an  interest  rate  of 8%  and is due  May  30,  2013.  The
          convertible promissory note and accrued interest may be converted into
          shares of the Company's restricted common stock. In May 2013, the note
          was paid in full.

INDIAN NATIONS
In November 2011, the Company,  Mr. Richard Gouin and Advanced Petroleum Lifting
Systems,  LLC  entered  into a  Purchase  and Sale  Agreement  ("Indian  Nations
Purchase  Agreement"),  which  provides  for the Company to acquire a 5% working
interest in certain wells in Pittsburgh  County,  Oklahoma,  knows as the Indian
Nations Wells, subject to the resolution of litigation.
The Indian Nations Purchase  Agreement was amended in April 2012, to provide for
the Company to assign the 5% working  interests in Indian Nations Wells 2-30 and
3-30 to the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary,  South Uintah in exchange for the
issuance  of 30,000  shares of the  Company's  restricted  common  stock and the
continued  payment of litigation  expenses being  incurred in connection  with a
legal dispute with the operator of the wells.
At the time of this filing,  the Company has not  recognized any income from the
working interest and have assigned their rights to a third party.
COMPETITION, MARKETS, REGULATION AND TAXATION
COMPETITION.
There are a large number of companies and individuals engaged in the exploration
for minerals and oil and gas; accordingly, there is a high degree of competition
for desirable properties. Almost all of the companies and individuals so engaged
have substantially greater technical and financial resources than we do.
MARKETS.
The  availability  of a ready market for oil and gas  discovered,  if any,  will
depend on numerous  factors  beyond our control,  including  the  proximity  and
capacity  of  refineries,  pipelines,  and the  effect  of state  regulation  of
production and of federal  regulations of products sold in interstate  commerce,
and recent  intrastate  sales.  The market price of oil and gas are volatile and
beyond our control. The market for natural gas is also unsettled, and gas prices
have increased dramatically in the past four years with substantial fluctuation,
seasonally and annually.
There  generally are only a limited  number of gas  transmission  companies with
existing  pipelines  in the  vicinity of a gas well or wells.  In the event that
producing gas properties are not subject to purchase  contracts or that any such
contracts terminate and other parties do not purchase our gas production,  there
is no assurance  that we will be able to enter into purchase  contracts with any
transmission  companies or other  purchasers  of natural gas and there can be no
assurance  regarding the price which such purchasers would be willing to pay for
such gas.  There  presently  exists an oversupply of gas in the certain areas of
the  marketplace due to pipeline  capacity,  the extent and duration of which is
not known.  Such oversupply may result in restrictions of purchases by principal
gas pipeline purchasers.
EFFECT OF CHANGING INDUSTRY CONDITIONS ON DRILLING ACTIVITY.
Lower oil and gas prices have caused a decline in drilling  activity in the U.S.
from time to time. However, such reduced activity has also resulted in a decline
in  drilling  costs,  lease  acquisition  costs  and  equipment  costs,  and  an
improvement in the terms under which drilling prospects are generally available.
We cannot  predict what oil and gas prices will be in the future and what effect
those  prices may have on drilling  activity  in  general,  or on our ability to
generate economic drilling prospects and to raise the necessary funds with which
to drill them.
FEDERAL REGULATIONS.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATION.
Oil and Gas:  The oil and gas  business  in the  United  States  is  subject  to
regulation by both federal and state  authorities,  particularly with respect to
pricing, allowable rates of production, marketing and environmental matters.
-28-
<PAGE>
The  production of crude oil and gas has, in recent  years,  been the subject of
increasing  state and federal  controls.  No  assurance  can be given that newly
imposed or changed federal laws will not adversely affect the economic viability
of any oil and gas  properties we may acquire in the future.  Federal income and
"windfall profit" taxes have in the past affected the economic viability of such
properties.
The above  paragraphs  only give a brief overview of potential state and federal
regulations.  Because we have only acquired specific properties,  and because of
the wide range of  activities in which we may  participate,  it is impossible to
set forth in detail the potential impact federal and state  regulations may have
on us.
COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
Our  operations  are subject to local,  state and federal  laws and  regulations
governing  environmental  quality and pollution control.  To date our compliance
with these  regulations has had no material  effect on our operations,  capital,
earnings, or competitive position,  and the cost of such compliance has not been
material. We are unable to assess or predict at this time what effect additional
regulations or legislation could have on our activities.
THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY.
The Department of Energy  Organization  Act (Pub. L. No. 95-91) became effective
October 1, 1977. Under this Act various  agencies,  including the Federal Energy
Administration   (FEA)  and  the  Federal  Power  Commission  (FPC),  have  been
consolidated  to constitute the  cabinet-level  Department of Energy (DOE).  The
Economic  Regulatory  Administration  (ERA), a  semi-independent  administration
within the DOE, now administers most of the regulatory programs formerly managed
by the FEA, including oil pricing and allocation.  The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission  (FERC), an independent  agency within the DOE, has assumed the FPC's
responsibility for natural gas regulation.
REGULATION AND PRICING OF NATURAL GAS.
Our  operations  may be  subject  to the  jurisdiction  of  the  Federal  Energy
Regulatory  Commission (FERC) with respect to the sale of natural gas for resale
in interstate and intrastate commerce. State regulatory agencies may exercise or
attempt to exercise  similar  powers with  respect to  intrastate  sales of gas.
Because  of  its  complexity  and  broad  scope,  the  price  impact  of  future
legislation on the operation of us cannot be determined at this time.
CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS PRICE AND ALLOCATION REGULATION.
Pursuant to Executive  Order Number 12287,  issued  January 28, 1981,  President
Reagan lifted all existing  federal price and allocation  controls over the sale
and  distribution  of crude oil and natural gas liquids.  Executive Order Number
12287 was made  effective as of January 28,  1981,  and  consequently,  sales of
crude oil and natural gas liquids  after  January 27, 1981 are free from federal
regulation.  The price for such  sales and the  supplier-purchaser  relationship
will be determined by private contract and prevailing  market  conditions.  As a
result of this action,  oil which may be sold by us will be sold at  deregulated
or free market  prices.  At various  times,  certain  groups have  advocated the
reestablishment of regulations and control on the sale of domestic oil and gas.
STATE REGULATIONS.
Our  production  of oil and gas, if any,  will be subject to regulation by state
regulatory  authorities  in the states in which we may  produce  oil and gas. In
general,  these  regulatory  authorities  are  empowered  to  make  and  enforce
regulations  to prevent waste of oil and gas and to protect  correlative  rights
and  opportunities  to  produce  oil  and  gas as  between  owners  of a  common
reservoir.  Some regulatory  authorities may also regulate the amount of oil and
gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production.
PROPOSED LEGISLATION.
A number of  legislative  proposals  have been and probably  will continue to be
introduced in Congress and in the  legislatures  of various  states,  which,  if
enacted, would significantly affect the petroleum industries. Such proposals and
-29-
<PAGE>
executive  actions  involve,  among other  things,  the  imposition  of land use
controls such as prohibiting  drilling  activities on certain  federal and state
lands in roadless wilderness areas. At present, it is impossible to predict what
proposals,  if any,  will  actually be enacted by Congress or the various  state
legislatures  and what  effect,  if any,  such  proposals  will  have.  However,
President  Clinton's  establishment of numerous National  Monuments by executive
order has had the effect of precluding  drilling  across vast areas of the Rocky
Mountain West.
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.
Oil and gas exploration and  development  are  specifically  subject to existing
federal  and state laws and  regulations  governing  environmental  quality  and
pollution  control.  Such laws and  regulations may  substantially  increase the
costs of exploring for, developing,  or producing oil and gas and may prevent or
delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation.
All of our  operations  involving the  exploration  for or the production of any
minerals are subject to existing laws and  regulations  relating to  exploration
procedures,  safety  precautions,   employee  health  and  safety,  air  quality
standards,  pollution of stream and fresh water sources,  odor, noise, dust, and
other  environmental  protection  controls  adopted by federal,  state and local
governmental  authorities as well as the right of adjoining  property owners. We
may be required to prepare  and present to federal,  state or local  authorities
data  pertaining  to the effect or impact that any proposed  exploration  for or
production of minerals may have upon the environment.  All requirements  imposed
by  any  such  authorities  may  be  costly,  time  consuming,   and  may  delay
commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations.
It may be anticipated that future legislation will  significantly  emphasize the
protection of the environment, and that, as a consequence, our activities may be
more closely  regulated to further the cause of environmental  protection.  Such
legislation,  as well as future  interpretation  of existing  laws,  may require
substantial  increases  in  equipment  and  operating  costs  to us and  delays,
interruptions, or a termination of operations, the extent to which cannot now be
predicted.
TITLE TO PROPERTIES.
We are not the record owner of our interest in our  properties  and rely instead
on  contracts  with the owner or  operator of the  property,  pursuant to which,
among other things,  we have the right to have our interest placed of record. As
is customary in the oil and gas industry,  a preliminary  title examination will
be conducted at the time  unproved  properties  or interests are acquired by us.
Prior to  commencement  of drilling  operations on such acreage and prior to the
acquisition  of  proved  properties,  we will  conduct a title  examination  and
attempt  to  remedy  extremely   significant   defects  before  proceeding  with
operations or the acquisition of proved properties, as we may deem appropriate.
Our properties are subject to royalty,  overriding  royalty and other  interests
customary in the industry, liens incident to agreements, current taxes and other
burdens,  minor  encumbrances,  easements and restrictions.  Although we are not
aware of any material title defects or disputes with respect to its  undeveloped
acreage,  to the extent such  defects or disputes  exist,  we would suffer title
failures.
BACKLOG OF ORDERS.
We currently have no orders for sales at this time.
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.
We have no government contracts.
COMPANY SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.
We are not conducting any research.

NUMBER OF PERSONS EMPLOYED.
As of July 1,  2013,  Hinto had no  full-time  employees.  George  Harris,  Gary
Herick,  David  Keller,  Kevin Blair and Max Sommer,  officers and  directors of
Hinto, have Consulting  and/or Corporate Advisor  Agreements with our subsidiary
South Uintah, which are on a month-to-month  basis. George Harris works up to 40
hours per week  pursuant to his  Consulting  Agreement.  The other  Officers and
Directors work on an as needed part-time basis up to 25 hours per week.
PLAN OF OPERATIONS
We only began to recognize  minimal revenues from our operations during the last
half of 2012. We have minimal  capital,  moderate cash. We are illiquid and need
cash infusions from investors or shareholders to provide capital,  or loans from
any sources, none of which have been arranged nor assured.
During the first  quarter  of 2013,  we  continued  our  re-work  efforts on our
properties  in the Cisco  Springs oil and gas field in the Uintah Basin of Grand
County, Utah;  performance of geological analysis of existing properties and the
identification of potential  properties for acquisition.  Re-work efforts in the
Cisco  Springs  field focused on the Company's 5A well and the well is now being
tested and results of the testing are being evaluated.
During the first  quarter of 2013,  we raised  $175,000 from the sale of 350,000
shares of our  restricted  common  stock.  We raised an  additional  $90,000  in
subscription  receivables  for 180,000  shares of our  restricted  common stock.
These shares were issued subsequent to March 31, 2013.
We will need substantial additional capital to support our existing and proposed
future energy operations. We have ONLY RECOGNIZED MINIMAL AND SPORADIC revenues.
We have NO committed source for any funds as of date here. No  representation is
made that any funds will be available when needed.  In the event funds cannot be
raised when needed, we may not be able to carry out our business plan, may never
achieve sales or royalty income, and could fail in business as a result of these
uncertainties.
Decisions  regarding future  participation  in exploration  wells or geophysical
studies or other activities will be made on a case-by-case basis. We may, in any
particular   case,   decide  to   participate  or  decline   participation.   If
participating,  we may pay our  proportionate  share of costs  to  maintain  our
proportionate  interest  through  cash  flow  or debt or  equity  financing.  If
participation  is  declined,  we may  elect  to  farmout,  non-consent,  sell or
otherwise  negotiate  a  method  of cost  sharing  in  order  to  maintain  some
continuing interest in the prospect.

                                                     TOTAL   $5,000,000
The Company may change any or all of the budget  categories  in the execution of
its  business  model.  None of the  line  items  are to be  considered  fixed or
unchangeable. The Company may need substantial additional capital to support its
budget. The Company has minimal revenues to date in the oil and gas exploration,
development and production business.
-31-
<PAGE>
We have conducted a Private  Offering of shares of our  restricted  Common Stock
for capital.  We intend to raise up to $5,000,000 in the next twelve months with
a structure not yet determined in debt or equity.  We cannot give any assurances
that we will be able to raise the full  $5,000,000 to fund the budget.  Further,
we will need to raise  additional funds to support not only our expected budget,
but our continued operations. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able
to raise  such  funds or whether we would be able to raise such funds with terms
that are favorable to us.
A total of $802,000 may be raised by us if all the $0.50 Warrants are exercised.
We will NOT receive any proceeds  from sales of shares by selling  shareholders.
Furthermore,  given that we have limited operating history and minimal revenues,
it is unlikely that our warrants will be exercised at the $0.50 per share in the
foreseeable future.
We make no assurance  that all the warrants  will be exercised  and that we will
receive any of the $802,000 as anticipated.  We have not included any funds from
the sale of warrants in our 2012 operating plan and budget.  If any warrants are
exercised in 2013, the funds received from such exercised warrants would be used
as working capital and for oil and gas acquisition and development.
Our plan of operations is as follows:

As is customary  in the oil and natural gas  industry,  we  generally  conduct a
preliminary  title  examination  prior  to  the  acquisition  of  properties  or
leasehold  interests.  Prior to  commencement  of operations on such acreage,  a
thorough title examination will usually be conducted and any significant defects
will be remedied before proceeding with operations.  We believe the title to our
leasehold properties is good, defensible and customary with practices in the oil
and  natural gas  industry,  subject to such  exceptions  that we believe do not
materially  detract  from  the  use of  such  properties.  With  respect  to our
properties  of which we are not the record  owner,  we rely instead on contracts
with the owner or operator of the property or assignment of leases,  pursuant to
which,  among other  things,  we  generally  have the right to have our interest
placed on record.
Our properties are generally  subject to royalty,  overriding  royalty and other
interests customary in the industry, liens incident to agreements, current taxes
and other burdens,  minor  encumbrances,  easements and restrictions.  We do not
believe any of these  burdens will  materially  interfere  with our use of these
properties.
SUMMARY OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES

Estimates of proved developed and undeveloped  reserves are inherently imprecise
and are continually subject to revision based on production history,  results of
additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. See "--
Qualifications   of  Technical  Persons  and  Internal  Controls  Over  Reserves
Estimation Process."
PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES
Our proved  undeveloped  reserves at December 31, 2012 were 267 MBbls of oil and
147 MMScf of natural gas.
QUALIFICATIONS   OF  TECHNICAL  PERSONS  AND  INTERNAL  CONTROLS  OVER  RESERVES
ESTIMATION PROCESS
Our reserve  report was prepared by Tariq Ahmed,  PE, an  independent  petroleum
engineer ("Ahmed").  Ahmed estimated,  in accordance with petroleum  engineering
and  evaluation  principles  set  forth  in  the  Standards  Pertaining  to  the
Estimating  and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserve  Information  promulgated by the
Society of Petroleum  Engineers ("SPE Standards") and definitions and guidelines
established by the SEC, 100% of the proved reserve  information  for our onshore
properties as of December 31, 2012.
The technical persons responsible for preparing the reserves estimates presented
herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity
and confidentiality set forth in the Standards  Pertaining to the Estimating and
Auditing of Oil and Natural Gas Reserves Information  promulgated by the Society
of Petroleum Engineers.
We have an internal staff of geoscience  professionals who work closely with our
independent petroleum engineer to ensure the integrity,  accuracy and timeliness
of data furnished to them in their reserves  estimation  process.  Our technical
team consults  regularly with Mr. Ahmed.  We review with them our properties and
discuss methods and assumptions used in their preparation of our fiscal year-end
reserves estimates. While we have no formal committee specifically designated to
-33-
<PAGE>
review reserves reporting and the reserves estimation process, a copy of each of
the Ahmed  reserve  report is  reviewed  with  representatives  of Ahmed and our
internal   technical  staff  before  we  disseminate  any  of  the  information.
Additionally,  our senior  management  reviews and  approves  the Ahmed  reserve
report and any internally  estimated  significant changes to our proved reserves
on an annual basis.
Estimates  of oil and natural gas reserves  are  projections  based on a process
involving  an  independent  third party  engineering  firm's  collection  of all
required geologic,  geophysical,  engineering and economic data, and such firm's
complete external  preparation of all required estimates and are forward-looking
in nature.  These reports rely upon various assumptions,  including  assumptions
required  by the SEC,  such as constant  oil and  natural gas prices,  operating
expenses  and future  capital  costs.  The  process  also  requires  assumptions
relating  to  availability  of funds and  timing  of  capital  expenditures  for
development  of our proved  undeveloped  reserves.  These reports  should not be
construed as the current market value of our reserves. The process of estimating
oil and natural gas reserves is also  dependent on geological,  engineering  and
economic data for each reservoir.  Because of the uncertainties  inherent in the
interpretation  of this  data,  we  cannot be  certain  that the  reserves  will
ultimately be realized. Our actual results could differ materially. See "Note 13
-- Supplemental Information Relating to Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities
(Unaudited)"  to our audited  consolidated  financial  statements for additional
information regarding our oil and natural gas reserves.
Under SEC rules,  proved  reserves are those  quantities of oil and natural gas,
which,  by analysis of geoscience  and  engineering  data, can be estimated with
reasonable  certainty to be  economically  producible from a given date forward,
from  known  reservoirs,  and  under  existing  economic  conditions,  operating
methods, and government  regulations.  The term "reasonable certainty" implies a
high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually
recovered will equal or exceed the estimate.  To achieve  reasonable  certainty,
Garb and Lee  Engineering  employ  technologies  consistent  with the  standards
established by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The technologies and economic
data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include,  but are not limited
to, well logs, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic
data and well test data.

D.  MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
------------------------------------------------------------
MARKET INFORMATION
Our Common Stock is presently traded on the  over-the-counter  market on the OTC
Bulletin  Board  maintained  by  the  Financial  Industry  Regulatory  Authority
("FINRA").  On December 31,  2010,  we began  trading on the OTC Bulletin  Board
under the symbol "HENI",  prior to the Company's name change in August 2011, the
Company's trading symbol was "GVTS."
The  offering of the shares  registered  hereby  could have a material  negative
effect on the market price for the stock.
RULES GOVERNING  LOW-PRICE STOCKS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR  SHAREHOLDERS'  ABILITY TO
RESELL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK
Our stock is currently traded on the OTC Bulletin Board.
Quotations on the OTC/BB reflect  inter-dealer  prices,  without retail mark-up,
markdown or commission and may not reflect actual transactions. Our common stock
will be subject to certain rules adopted by the SEC that regulate  broker-dealer
practices  in  connection  with  transactions  in "penny  stocks."  Penny stocks
generally are securities with a price of less than $5.00,  other than securities
registered  on  certain  national  exchanges  or  quoted on the  Nasdaq  system,
provided  that  the  exchange  or  system  provides  current  price  and  volume
information with respect to transaction in such securities. The additional sales
practice and disclosure  requirements  imposed upon  broker-dealers  are and may
discourage  broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our shares which could
severely limit the market  liquidity of the shares and impede the sale of shares
in the secondary market.
The penny stock rules require broker-dealers,  prior to a transaction in a penny
stock  not  otherwise  exempt  from the  rules,  to make a  special  suitability
determination  for the purchaser to receive the  purchaser's  written consent to
the transaction prior to sale, to deliver standardized risk disclosure documents
prepared by the SEC that provides  information about penny stocks and the nature
and  level of risks in the  penny  stock  market.  The  broker-dealer  must also
provide the customer with current bid and offer  quotations for the penny stock.
In addition,  the penny stock regulations  require the broker-dealer to deliver,
prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared
by the SEC relating to the penny stock market,  unless the  broker-dealer or the
transaction is otherwise  exempt.  A broker-dealer  is also required to disclose
commissions  payable to the broker-dealer and the registered  representative and
current  quotations for the securities.  Finally, a broker-dealer is required to
send monthly statements  disclosing recent price information with respect to the
penny stock held in a  customer's  account and  information  with respect to the
limited market in penny stocks.
HOLDERS
As of the filing of this  prospectus,  we have 137 shareholders of record of our
common stock. Sales under Rule 144 are also subject to manner of sale provisions
and notice  requirements and to the  availability of current public  information
about us. Under Rule 144(k),  a person who has not been one of our affiliates at
any time  during the three  months  preceding a sale,  and who has  beneficially
owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least 6 months,  is entitled to sell
shares without  complying with the manner of sale,  volume  limitation or notice
provisions of Rule 144.
-38-
<PAGE>
As of the date of this  prospectus,  our  selling  shareholders  hold  5,108,976
Shares,  all of  which  may be sold  pursuant  to this  Registration  Statement,
including  those of affiliates  who own 150,000 and  officers/directors  who own
500,000 in the aggregate.
DIVIDENDS
As of the  filing  of this  prospectus,  we  have  not  paid  any  dividends  to
shareholders.  There are no  restrictions  which  would limit our ability to pay
dividends  on common  equity  or that are  likely  to do so in the  future.  The
Wyoming  Revised  Statutes,  however,  do prohibit us from  declaring  dividends
where, after giving effect to the distribution of the dividend;  we would not be
able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or our
total assets would be less than the sum of the total liabilities plus the amount
that would be needed to satisfy the rights of shareholders who have preferential
rights superior to those receiving the distribution.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF HINTO ENERGY, INC.:
We have audited the  accompanying  balance  sheets of Hinto Energy,  Inc.  ("the
Company")  as of  December  31,  2012 and 2011,  and the  related  statement  of
operations,  stockholders'  equity  (deficit)  and cash  flow for the year  then
ended.  These  financial  statements  are the  responsibility  of the  Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audit.
We  conducted  our audit in  accordance  with  standards  of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements,  assessing the accounting  principles used and significant estimates
made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audit  provides a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the  financial  position of Hinto  Energy,  Inc., as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011,  and the results of its operations and its cash flow
for the year then  ended,  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted  accounting
principles in the United States of America.
The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration
of internal  control over  financial  reporting as a basis for  designing  audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing  an  opinion  on  the  Company's   internal  control  over  financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been  prepared  assuming that the
Company  will  continue  as a  going  concern.  As  discussed  in  Note 3 to the
financial   statements,   the  Company's   significant  operating  losses  raise
substantial  doubt  about  its  ability  to  continue  as a going  concern.  The
financial  statements do not include any adjustments  that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty.

HINTO ENERGY, INC.
                 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
                    For the Year Ended December 31, 2012 and
       The Period from March 8, 2011 (Inception) through December 31, 2011
NOTE 1 - BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUSINESS
Hinto Energy,  Inc. ("the Company") was incorporated in February 13, 1997 in the
state of Wyoming.  The Company was  originally  incorporated  for the purpose of
general investing.  Due to an inability to raise adequate financing, the Company
was forced to cease operations in 2001.
The  Company's  fiscal  year  end is  December  31st.  The  Company's  financial
statements  are  presented  on the  accrual  basis  of  accounting,  under  GAAP
(Generally Accepted Accounting Principles).
SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT
On July 27,  2011,  the Company  entered into a Share  Exchange and  Acquisition
Agreement with South Uintah Gas Properties,  Inc. ("South Uintah") and the South
Uintah  shareholders.  Pursuant to the Share Exchange and Acquisition  Agreement
("the  Agreement"),  the Company agreed to issue shares of its restricted common
stock for 100% of the issued and outstanding  common stock of South Uintah.  The
shares were exchanged on a one for one basis.
Prior to the signing of the  Agreement,  South  Uintah had  purchased  3,000,000
shares of the  Company's  common stock from its then majority  shareholder,  Ms.
Sharon Fowler.  After such purchase,  South Uintah held approximately 70% of the
issued and  outstanding  common stock of the Company.  As part of the Agreement,
South  Uintah  agreed  to return  the  3,000,000  shares of common  stock to the
Company. On December 22, 2011 the Company and South Uintah modified the purchase
agreement  and reduced  the number of shares to be  returned by South  Uintah by
300,000 shares to 2,700,000 shares.
On January 23, 2012, the Company  completed the Share  Exchange and  Acquisition
Agreement  ("the  Agreement")  and the  shareholders  of South Uintah became the
majority  shareholders of Hinto Energy,  Inc. Hinto issued  11,446,931 shares of
its common  stock in a one for one share  exchange,  assumed  $175,000  in notes
payable and issued  6,700,000  warrants in a one for one warrant  exchange  with
South Uintah warrant  holders.  South Uintah returned  2,700,000 shares of Hinto
common stock to the Company and such stock was cancelled.  The Company accounted
for the Share Exchange and Acquisition as a reverse  capitalization,  with South
Uintah being the accounting  acquirer.  As a result,  the historical  comparison
information presented is that of South Uintah as the accounting acquirer.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying audited consolidated  financial statements include the accounts
of Hinto  Energy,  Inc.  and its  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  South  Uintah  Gas
Properties,  Inc.  (collectively the "Company").  All intercompany  balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

DEVELOPMENT STAGE
During the 4th quarter of the year ended  December 31, 2012, we emerged from the
Development Stage, due to returning to operations and realizing revenue.
NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
----------------------------------------
USE OF ESTIMATES
The  preparation  of the  financial  statements in  conformity  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and  liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial  statements  and the reported  amounts of revenues and
expenses  during the reporting  periods.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less and money market instruments to be cash equivalents.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and  equipment  are stated at cost less  accumulated  depreciation  and
amortization.  Depreciation is computed  principally on the straight-line method
over the  estimated  useful life of each type of asset which ranges from five to
seven  years.  Maintenance  and  repairs  are  charged to  expense as  incurred;
improvements  and betterments are  capitalized.  Upon retirement or disposition,
the related costs and  accumulated  depreciation  are removed from the accounts,
and any resulting gains or losses are credited or charged to income.

                               ============ ================== =================
In November  2012,  the Company  purchased a used  backhoe,  the Company has not
accumulated any  depreciation  on this piece of machinery  during the year ended
December 31, 2012,  due to the fact the machinery was not put into service until
the very end of the year due to weather conditions.
OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES, FULL COST METHOD
The Company uses the full cost method of  accounting  for oil and gas  producing
activities.  Costs to acquire mineral  interests in oil and gas  properties,  to
drill and equip exploratory wells used to find proved reserves, and to drill and
equip  development  wells including  directly related overhead costs and related
asset retirement costs are capitalized.

                               HINTO ENERGY, INC.
                 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
                    For the Year Ended December 31, 2012 and
       The Period from March 8, 2011 (Inception) through December 31, 2011
Under this method,  all costs,  including  internal  costs  directly  related to
acquisition,  exploration and development  activities are capitalized as oil and
gas  property  costs.   Properties  not  subject  to  amortization   consist  of
exploration and development costs which are evaluated on a  property-by-property
basis.  Amortization of these unproved property costs begins when the properties
become  proved  or their  values  become  impaired.  The  Company  assesses  the
realization  of unproved  properties,  taken as a whole,  if any, on at least an
annual basis or when there has been an indication  that  impairment in value may
have  occurred.   Impairment  of  unproved   properties  is  assessed  based  on
management's  intention  with regard to future  exploration  and  development of
individually  significant  properties  and the  ability of the Company to obtain
funds  to  finance  such  exploration  and  development.  If the  results  of an
assessment  indicate  that  the  properties  are  impaired,  the  amount  of the
impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized.
Costs of oil and gas properties  will be amortized using the units of production
method.
In applying the full cost method,  the Company will perform an  impairment  test
(ceiling  test) at each reporting  date,  whereby the carrying value of property
and  equipment  is  compared  to the  "estimated  present  value," of its proved
reserves discounted at a 10-percent interest rate of future net revenues,  based
on current  economic and operating  conditions,  plus the cost of properties not
being  amortized,  plus the  lower  of cost or fair  market  value  of  unproved
properties  included  in costs  being  amortized,  less the income  tax  effects
related to book and tax basis  differences  of the  properties.  If  capitalized
costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged as an impairment expense.
IMPAIRMENT
The Company  reviews  long-lived  assets held for use,  principally  oil and gas
leases, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying
value may not be  recoverable.  Impairment  exists if the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset is not recoverable  from the  undiscounted  cash flows expected
from its use and eventual disposition. We determine the amount of the impairment
loss by comparing the carrying  value of the  long-lived  asset to its estimated
fair value. In the absence of quoted market prices, we determine  estimated fair
value generally based on the present value of future  probability  weighted cash
flows expected from the continued use and value at sale of the long-lived asset.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company  recognizes  revenue when it is earned and  expenses are  recognized
when they occur.
NET LOSS PER SHARE
Basic  net  loss  per  common  share  is  calculated  by  dividing  the net loss
applicable to common shares by the weighted  average number of common and common
equivalent shares  outstanding  during the period.  For the years ended December
31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, there were no potential common equivalent shares
used in the  calculation of weighted  average  common shares  outstanding as the
effect would be anti-dilutive because of the net loss.

using an estimate of value in accordance  with the fair value method.  Under the
fair value recognition  provisions of this statement,  stock-based  compensation
cost is  measured  at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is
recognized  as  expense on a  straight-line  basis  over the  requisite  service
period,  which  generally  is  the  vesting  period.  The  Company  elected  the
modified-prospective  method,  under  which  prior  periods  are not revised for
comparative  purposes.  The valuation method applies to new grants and to grants
that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The  Company's  financial  instruments,  including  cash and  cash  equivalents,
accounts  receivable,  accounts payable,  and notes payable are carried at cost,
which  approximates  fair  value  due  to  the  short-term   maturity  of  these
instruments.
OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
The Company has no material components of other comprehensive  income (loss) and
accordingly, net loss is equal to comprehensive loss in all periods.
INCOME TAXES
Provision for income taxes represents actual or estimated amounts payable on tax
return filings each year.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities are recorded for
the estimated future tax effects of temporary  differences between the tax basis
of assets and  liabilities  and  amounts  reported in the  accompanying  balance
sheets,  and for  operating  loss and tax credit carry  forwards.  The change in
deferred  tax assets and  liabilities  for the period  measures the deferred tax
provision  or benefit for the period.  Effects of changes in enacted tax laws on
deferred  tax assets and  liabilities  are  reflected as  adjustment  to the tax
provision or benefit in the period of enactment.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
There were accounting standards and interpretations issued during the year ended
December 31, 2012,  none of which are expected to have a material  impact on the
Company's financial position, operations or cash flows.
NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENTS' PLAN

                 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
                    For the Year Ended December 31, 2012 and
       The Period from March 8, 2011 (Inception) through December 31, 2011
The  future  success  of the  Company  is  dependent  on its  ability to attract
additional  capital,  or to find an  acquisition  to add  value  to its  present
shareholders  and  ultimately,  upon its  ability to develop  future  profitable
operations.  There can be no assurance  that the Company will be  successful  in
obtaining  such  financing,  or that it will  attain  positive  cash  flow  from
operations. Management believes that actions presently being taken to revise the
Company's operating and financial  requirements  provide the opportunity for the
Company to continue as a going concern.

NOTE 9 - COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES
------------------------------------
GENERAL
There have been significant changes in the U.S. economy,  oil and gas prices and
the finance industry which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely
affect the  Company  in its  attempt to obtain  financing  or in its  process to
produce commercially feasible oil and gas production.
Federal,  state and local  authorities  regulate  the oil and gas  industry.  In
particular,  gas and oil  production  operations  and  economics are affected by
environmental  protection statutes,  tax statutes and other laws and regulations
relating to the petroleum  industry,  as well as changes in such laws,  changing
administrative regulations and the interpretations and application of such laws,
rules  and  regulations.  The  Company  believes  it is in  compliance  with all
federal, state and local laws, regulations, and orders applicable to the Company
and its properties and operations,  the violation of which would have a material
adverse effect on the Company or its financial condition.

                 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
                    For the Year Ended December 31, 2012 and
       The Period from March 8, 2011 (Inception) through December 31, 2011
OPERATING HAZARDS AND INSURANCE
The gas and oil business  involves a variety of operating  risks,  including the
risk  of  fire,  explosions,   blow-outs,  pipe  failure,  abnormally  pressured
formation,  and environmental hazards such as oil spills, gas leaks, ruptures or
discharges  of toxic  gases,  the  occurrence  of any of which  could  result in
substantial  losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life,  severe damage
to or destruction  of property,  natural  resources and equipment,  pollution or
other environmental damage, cleanup  responsibilities,  regulatory investigation
and penalties and suspension of operations.
The  Company  to date  has not  acquired  its own  insurance  coverage  over its
interests in the  properties,  instead the Company has relied on the third party
operators  for its  properties  to maintain  insurance to cover its  operations;
however, the Company may purchase additional insurance coverage when necessary.
There can be no assurance that insurance,  if any, will be adequate to cover any
losses or exposure to liability. Although the Company believes that the policies
obtained by the third party operators  provide  coverage in scope and in amounts
customary in the industry,  they do not provide  complete  coverage  against all
operating  risks. An uninsured or partially  insured claim, if successful and of
significant  magnitude,  could have a material adverse effect on the Company and
its financial condition via its contractual liability to the prospect.
TITLE TO PROPERTIES
The Company's  practice has been to acquire ownership or leasehold rights to oil
and natural gas  properties  from third parties.  Most of the Company's  current
operations are conducted on properties acquired from third parties. Our existing
rights are dependent on those previous third parties having obtained valid title
to the properties. Prior to the commencement of gas drilling operations on those
properties,  the third  parties  customarily  conduct a title  examination.  The
Company generally does not conduct  examinations of title prior to obtaining its
interests in its operations,  but rely on representations from the third parties
that they have good, valid and enforceable  title to the oil and gas properties.
Based upon the  foregoing,  we believe  that we have  satisfactory  title to our
producing properties in accordance with customary practices in the gas industry.
The  Company  is not  aware of any  title  deficiencies  as of the date of these
financial statements.
NOTE 10 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

shares of Preferred  Shares to be  designated  in any series or classes and with
those rights,  privileges and  preferences to be determined at the discretion of
the Company's  Board of Directors.  At this time, the Company has not designated
any series of preferred stock or issued any shares of preferred stock.
STOCK OPTION PLAN
On August 17, 2011, the Company's  shareholders  approved the 2011 Hinto Energy,
Inc. Stock Option and Award  Incentive Plan ("Plan").  The Plan provides for the
grant of stock  options to  directors,  officers,  employees,  consultants,  and
advisors of the Company.  The Plan is administered by a committee  consisting of
members of the Board of  Directors  (the "Stock  Option  Committee"),  or in its
absence, the Board of Directors.
The Plan provides for a total of 2,000,000 shares of common stock to be reserved
for issuance  subject to options.  During the years ended  December 31, 2012 and
2011,  the Board did not approve the grant of any options to purchase  shares of
common stock, nor the conditions, performance or vesting requirements.

prices as set forth below:

NUMBER OF SHARES             EXERCISE PRICE
     ----------------             --------------
          200,000                     $0.25
          200,000                     $0.50
          200,000                     $1.00
          200,000                     $1.50
The total fair value of the  options at the date of grant was  $134,800  and was
recorded as a litigation  settlement  expense.  The Company  used the  following
assumptions to determine the fair value of warrant grant on December 17, 2012:
Expected life                    1 year
     Volatility                        103%
     Risk-free interest rate          3.125%
     Dividend yield                      0
The expected term of the warrants  represents  the period of time that the stock
options  granted are expected to be  outstanding  based on  historical  exercise
trends.  The expected  volatility is based on the historical price volatility of
the Company's  common stock.  The risk-free  interest rate  represents  the U.S.
Treasury bill rate for the expected life of the related  warrants.  The dividend
yield  represents  our  anticipated  cash dividend over the expected life of the
warrants.
WARRANT ISSUANCE - YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011
During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company issued 3,000,000  warrants,
in  connection  with  consulting  services of officers  and  directors,  vest at
various dates from July 2012 through July 2014 and expires at various dates from
June 2014  through  June  2016.  In  addition,  these  individuals  were  issued
1,700,000  warrants,  issued  in  connection  with  consulting  services  of the
Company,  are fully  vested and expire at various  dates from June 2014  through
November 2014, with 1,100,000 warrants being exercisable at $1 and 600,000 being
exercisable at $3.
During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company issued  2,000,000  warrants
to the  shareholders  of South Uintah in exchange for warrants issued to them in
connection  with  convertible  notes payable.  The warrants expire in July 2013.
These 2,000,000  warrants are callable at the option of the Company in the first
year from the grant dates of May through July 2011 at the  exercise  price under
various  conditions,  generally if the Company  completes a  $4,500,000  private
placement of common stock.
No expense was recorded by the Company on the  issuance of any of the  6,700,000
warrants  issued  during  the year  ended  December  31,  2012 and 2011,  as the
Company's common stock did not have a trading market at the time of issuance and
no material common stock cash sales had been made, and thus none of the warrants
were in the money.

NOTE 11 - LEGAL MATTERS
-----------------------
In March  2012,  a note  holder of South  Uintah Gas  Properties,  Inc.  ("South
Uintah"),  Bridge  Industries,  LLC  ("Bridge")  filed a  complaint  against the
Company  in the  Circuit  Court of the  Eighteenth  Judicial  Circuit,  Seminole
County,  Florida,  alleging in general  breach of contract and seeking return of
all monies lent to South  Uintah of $400,000,  the value of 1,000,000  shares of
the Company's common stock and other equity  appreciation,  and compensation for
services  and costs.  The Company had return  $200,000 of the  $400,000  lent in
2011, leaving a balance of $200,000 as of December 31, 2011.
In June 2011,  Bridge entered into a  subscription  agreement with South Uintah,
the now  wholly-owned  subsidiary of Hinto Energy,  Inc.  ("the  Company").  The
Subscription  Agreement  provided  for the  purchase  of a  Secured  Convertible
Promissory  Note in the amount of $500,000,  1,000,000  shares of South Uintah's
restricted  common stock and warrants  exercisable for 2,000,000 shares of South
Uintah's common stock.
On December 18, 2012,  the Company  entered  into a  Settlement  Agreement  with
Bridge that provided for the dismissal of the lawsuit and terms of final payment
of the outstanding amounts owed to Bridge. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement,
the Company has agreed to the following:
1.   A $100,000  cash  payment to Bridge in two  traunches of $50,000 to be
paid on or before March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2013.
2.   The issuance of 1,400,000 shares of the Company's common stock,  which
          are to be registered in a Registration Statement on Form S-1.
3.   The issuance of warrants  exercisable for a total of 800,000 shares of
          the Company's  common stock.  The warrants have a term of 5 years from
          December 18, 2012 and have a callable provision.

                 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
                    For the Year Ended December 31, 2012 and
       The Period from March 8, 2011 (Inception) through December 31, 2011
As a result of the settlement,  the Company has recognized a one-time litigation
settlement  expense  of  $704,247  in  connection  with  the  settlement  of the
litigation.  The  1,400,000  shares of common  stock  were  assigned  a value of
$700,000 and the warrants were determined to have a value of $134,800,  see Note
10. Of the $704,247 of settlement expense, $634,800 was the result of the change
in value of the Company's stock from the date of the original Bridge  Industries
investment  of June 2011 and  December  18,  2012.  The Company  issued the same
number of common  shares and  warrants as would have been issued if the original
Bridge  Industries  investment  had gone forward on a pro-rata basis of $200,000
versus  $500,000,  plus an additional  $100,000 cash payment from the Company to
Bridge  Industries,  less  accrued  interest  owed on  funds  loaned  by  Bridge
Industries of $30,447.
NOTE 13 - INCOME TAXES
----------------------
The  Company is subject to domestic  income  taxes.  The Company has  recognized
minimal  income during the year ended  December 31, 2012, and therefore has paid
no income tax.
Deferred income taxes arise from temporary timing differences in the recognition
of income and expenses for financial  reporting and tax purposes.  The Company's
deferred  tax assets  consist  entirely of the benefit from net  operating  loss
(NOL)  carry-forwards.  The NOL carry  forwards  expire in various years through
2031. The Company's deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation  allowance due
to  the  uncertainty  of  the  realization  of  the  NOL   carry-forwards.   NOL
carry-forwards may be further limited by a change in company ownership and other
provisions of the tax laws.
The Company's deferred tax assets,  valuation allowance, and change in valuation
allowance are as follows:
Estimated NOL        Valuation    Net Tax
                                 Carry-forward benefit    Allowance    Benefit
                               =================================================

NOTE 14 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
---------------------------
On June 14, 2013, the Company acquired all right and title to oil and gas leases
for a total of 559 gross  acres in the Unit for the 1st Cat Creek  formation  in
the Musselshell County,  Montana. The property includes 6 wells in a field to be
water  flooded that needs the wells to be re-worked.  The Company  acquires such
leases in exchange for $25,000 cash and a 5% working interest.
On June 14, 2013, the Company acquired all right and title to oil and gas leases
for a total of 722 gross acres in the Musselshell  County,  Montana. In exchange
for such oil and gas leases,  the Company paid $101,100 in a combination of cash
and  stock,  as  follows:  (a)  $65,000  in cash;  and (b)  $36,100  payable  in
restricted  common  stock  valued at $0.58  per  share  (2/3 of the June 4, 2013
closing price of $0.87) for a total of 62,242 shares.

In addition,  the Company has a thirty day option to purchase  other oil and gas
leases in the Musselshell Field from S & L Energy for a price of $60 per acre.
On June 17, 2012, the Company  closed on the  acquisition of all right and title
to certain  mineral  estates in Grand County,  Utah. The mineral estates include
4,435 acres, 9 well bores and space to drill additional wells. In addition,  the
Company acquired the owner's natural gas gathering system,  which  interconnects
with  the  Company's  existing  gathering  system,  thereby  reducing  new  pipe
gathering system construction by several miles. The Company has acquired 100% of
the working interests in the estates.
In exchange for such mineral estates,  the Company paid a total of $100,000 in a
combination of cash and stock,  (a) $75,000 in cash; and (b) $25,000 in the form
of 50,000 shares of the Company's restricted common stock.
The  properties  are located in Grand County,  Utah in the Greater Cisco area of
the Uintah  Basin and are  located in the  vicinity  of the  Company's  existing
properties in the Greater Cisco area.
The Company has  evaluated it activities  subsequent to the year ended  December
31,  2012,  through the  issuance  of  financial  statements  and found no other
reportable subsequent events.
NOTE 15 - SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURE (UNAUDITED)
---------------------------------------------------------
ESTIMATED NET QUANTITIES OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES (UNAUDITED)
Users of this  information  should  be  aware  that the  process  of  estimating
quantities of "proved" and "proved developed" natural gas and crude oil reserves
is very complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of
all available geological,  engineering and economic data for each reservoir. The
data for a given reservoir may also change  substantially  over time as a result
of  numerous  factors  including,  but not limited  to,  additional  development
activity,   evolving  production  history  and  continual  reassessment  of  the
viability  of  production  under  varying  economic  conditions.   Consequently,
material  revisions  to  existing  reserve  estimates  occur  from time to time.
Although  every  reasonable  effort is made to  ensure  that  reserve  estimates
reported represent the most accurate assessments  possible,  the significance of
the  subjective  decisions  required and variances in available data for various
reservoirs  make these  estimates  generally  less precise than other  estimates
presented in connection with financial statements.
Proved  reserves  are  estimated  quantities  of  natural  gas,  crude  oil  and
condensate  that geological and engineering  data  demonstrate,  with reasonable
certainty,  to be recovered in future years from known  reservoirs with existing
equipment under existing economic and operating conditions.
Proved  developed  reserves  are  proved  reserves  that can be  expected  to be
recovered  through  existing  wells with existing  equipment and under  existing
economic and operating conditions.

NOTE 1 - BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUSINESS
Hinto Energy,  Inc. ("the Company") was incorporated in February 13, 1997 in the
state of Wyoming. The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary,  South Uintah Gas
Properties,  Inc. are involved in the acquisition and development of oil and gas
prospects  in the rocky  mountain  region.  The  Company has oil and gas leases,
wells and new drilling prospects in both Utah and Montana.
The  Company's  fiscal  year  end is  December  31st.  The  Company's  financial
statements  are  presented  on  the  accrual  basis  of  accounting  under  GAAP
(Generally Accepted Accounting Principles).
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying audited consolidated  financial statements include the accounts
of Hinto  Energy,  Inc.  and its  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  South  Uintah  Gas
Properties,  Inc.  (collectively the "Company").  All intercompany  balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
----------------------------------------
USE OF ESTIMATES
The  preparation  of the  financial  statements in  conformity  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and  liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial  statements  and the reported  amounts of revenues and
expenses  during the reporting  periods.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less and money market instruments to be cash equivalents.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and  equipment  are stated at cost less  accumulated  depreciation  and
amortization.  Depreciation is computed  principally on the straight-line method
over the  estimated  useful life of each type of asset which ranges from five to
seven  years.  Maintenance  and  repairs  are  charged to  expense as  incurred;
improvements  and betterments are  capitalized.  Upon retirement or disposition,
the related costs and  accumulated  depreciation  are removed from the accounts,
and any resulting gains or losses are credited or charged to income.

                                  ============ ============== =================
OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES, FULL COST METHOD
The Company uses the full cost method of  accounting  for oil and gas  producing
activities.  Costs to acquire mineral  interests in oil and gas  properties,  to
drill and equip exploratory wells used to find proved reserves, and to drill and
equip  development  wells including  directly related overhead costs and related
asset retirement costs are capitalized.
Under this method,  all costs,  including  internal  costs  directly  related to
acquisition,  exploration and development  activities are capitalized as oil and
gas  property  costs.   Properties  not  subject  to  amortization   consist  of
exploration and development costs which are evaluated on a  property-by-property
basis.  Amortization of these unproved property costs begins when the properties
become  proved  or their  values  become  impaired.  The  Company  assesses  the
realization  of unproved  properties,  taken as a whole,  if any, on at least an
annual basis or when there has been an indication  that  impairment in value may
have  occurred.   Impairment  of  unproved   properties  is  assessed  based  on
management's  intention  with regard to future  exploration  and  development of
individually  significant  properties  and the  ability of the Company to obtain
funds  to  finance  such  exploration  and  development.  If the  results  of an
assessment  indicate  that  the  properties  are  impaired,  the  amount  of the
impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized.
Costs of oil and gas properties  will be amortized using the units of production
method.
In applying the full cost method,  the Company will perform an  impairment  test
(ceiling  test) at each reporting  date,  whereby the carrying value of property
and  equipment  is  compared  to the  "estimated  present  value," of its proved
reserves discounted at a 10-percent interest rate of future net revenues,  based
on current  economic and operating  conditions,  plus the cost of properties not
being  amortized,  plus the  lower  of cost or fair  market  value  of  unproved
properties  included  in costs  being  amortized,  less the income  tax  effects
related to book and tax basis  differences  of the  properties.  If  capitalized
costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged as an impairment expense.
IMPAIRMENT
The Company  reviews  long-lived  assets held for use,  principally  oil and gas
leases, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying
value may not be  recoverable.  Impairment  exists if the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset is not recoverable  from the  undiscounted  cash flows expected
from its use and eventual disposition. We determine the amount of the impairment
loss by comparing the carrying  value of the  long-lived  asset to its estimated
fair value. In the absence of quoted market prices, we determine  estimated fair

               For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 and 2012

value generally based on the present value of future  probability  weighted cash
flows expected from the continued use and value at sale of the long-lived asset.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company  recognizes  revenue when it is earned and  expenses are  recognized
when they occur.
NET LOSS PER SHARE
Basic  net  loss  per  common  share  is  calculated  by  dividing  the net loss
applicable to common shares by the weighted  average number of common and common
equivalent  shares  outstanding  during the period.  For the three  months ended
March 31, 2013 and 2012, there were no potential common  equivalent  shares used
in the calculation of weighted  average common shares  outstanding as the effect
would be anti-dilutive because of the net loss.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company adopted the provisions of and accounts for stock-based  compensation
using an estimate of value in accordance  with the fair value method.  Under the
fair value recognition  provisions of this statement,  stock-based  compensation
cost is  measured  at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is
recognized  as  expense on a  straight-line  basis  over the  requisite  service
period,  which  generally  is  the  vesting  period.  The  Company  elected  the
modified-prospective  method,  under  which  prior  periods  are not revised for
comparative  purposes.  The valuation method applies to new grants and to grants
that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The  Company's  financial  instruments,  including  cash and  cash  equivalents,
accounts  receivable,  accounts payable,  and notes payable are carried at cost,
which  approximates  fair  value  due  to  the  short-term   maturity  of  these
instruments.
OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
The Company has no material components of other comprehensive  income (loss) and
accordingly, net loss is equal to comprehensive loss in all periods.
INCOME TAXES
Provision for income taxes represents actual or estimated amounts payable on tax
return filings each year.  Deferred tax assets and  liabilities are recorded for
the estimated future tax effects of temporary  differences between the tax basis
of assets and  liabilities  and  amounts  reported in the  accompanying  balance
sheets,  and for  operating  loss and tax credit carry  forwards.  The change in
deferred  tax assets and  liabilities  for the period  measures the deferred tax
provision  or benefit for the period.  Effects of changes in enacted tax laws on
deferred  tax assets and  liabilities  are  reflected as  adjustment  to the tax
provision or benefit in the period of enactment.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
There were  accounting  standards  and  interpretations  issued during the three
months  ended  March 31,  2013,  none of which are  expected  to have a material
impact on the Company's financial position, operations or cash flows.
NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENTS' PLAN
--------------------------------------------
The Company's financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and
2012 have  been  prepared  on a going  concern  basis,  which  contemplates  the
realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities  and  commitments in the
normal course of business.  The Company  reported a net loss of $180,164 for the
three months ended March 31, 2013, and an  accumulated  deficit of $2,783,986 as
of March 31, 2013. At March 31, 2013, the Company had a working  capital deficit
of $474,482.
The  future  success  of the  Company  is  dependent  on its  ability to attract
additional  capital,  or to find an  acquisition  to add  value  to its  present
shareholders  and  ultimately,  upon its  ability to develop  future  profitable
operations.  There can be no assurance  that the Company will be  successful  in
obtaining  such  financing,  or that it will  attain  positive  cash  flow  from
operations. Management believes that actions presently being taken to revise the
Company's operating and financial  requirements  provide the opportunity for the
Company to continue as a going concern.

in exchange for $5,000 principal  payment on the note. As a result,  the Company
re-issued  the note for a principal  of $70,000,  a new due date of July 5, 2013
and for payments of $5,000 to be made on a monthly basis.  As of March 31, 2013,
the Company had made total payments principal payments of $25,000 and still owed
$45,000 on the note.
As part of the  Settlement  with Bridge  Industries,  discussed  in Note 11, the
Company has agreed to pay Bridge  Industries a total of $100,000 in two tranches
of $50,000  due on March 31,  2013 and June 30,  2013.  On March 31,  2013,  the

NOTE 8 - LONG TERM NOTE PAYABLE
-------------------------------
In December 2011, the Company, in exchange for cash, issued a $500,000,  secured
three-year note payable,  convertible at a $1 per share and bearing  interest at

gas leases held by South  Uintah in the  Natural  Buttes  area.  In June 2012 an
interest  payment of $12,500 was made in cash.  At March 31, 2012,  the note had

restricted  common stock valued at $0.50 per share.  At March 31, 2013, the note
was still outstanding.
NOTE 9 - COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES
------------------------------------
GENERAL
There have been significant changes in the U.S. economy,  oil and gas prices and
the finance industry which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely
affect the  Company  in its  attempt to obtain  financing  or in its  process to
produce commercially feasible oil and gas production.
Federal,  state and local  authorities  regulate  the oil and gas  industry.  In
particular,  gas and oil  production  operations  and  economics are affected by
environmental  protection statutes,  tax statutes and other laws and regulations
relating to the petroleum  industry,  as well as changes in such laws,  changing
administrative regulations and the interpretations and application of such laws,
rules  and  regulations.  The  Company  believes  it is in  compliance  with all
federal, state and local laws, regulations, and orders applicable to the Company
and its properties and operations,  the violation of which would have a material
adverse effect on the Company or its financial condition.
OPERATING HAZARDS AND INSURANCE
The gas and oil business  involves a variety of operating  risks,  including the
risk  of  fire,  explosions,   blow-outs,  pipe  failure,  abnormally  pressured
formation,  and environmental hazards such as oil spills, gas leaks, ruptures or
discharges  of toxic  gases,  the  occurrence  of any of which  could  result in
substantial  losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life,  severe damage
to or destruction  of property,  natural  resources and equipment,  pollution or
other environmental damage, cleanup  responsibilities,  regulatory investigation
and penalties and suspension of operations.

                 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
               For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 and 2012
                                   (Unaudited)
The  Company  to date  has not  acquired  its own  insurance  coverage  over its
interests in the  properties,  instead the Company has relied on the third party
operators  for its  properties  to maintain  insurance to cover its  operations;
however, the Company may purchase additional insurance coverage when necessary.
There can be no assurance that insurance,  if any, will be adequate to cover any
losses or exposure to liability. Although the Company believes that the policies
obtained by the third party operators  provide  coverage in scope and in amounts
customary in the industry,  they do not provide  complete  coverage  against all
operating  risks. An uninsured or partially  insured claim, if successful and of
significant  magnitude,  could have a material adverse effect on the Company and
its financial condition via its contractual liability to the prospect.
TITLE TO PROPERTIES
The Company's  practice has been to acquire ownership or leasehold rights to oil
and natural gas  properties  from third parties.  Most of the Company's  current
operations are conducted on properties acquired from third parties. Our existing
rights are dependent on those previous third parties having obtained valid title
to the properties. Prior to the commencement of gas drilling operations on those
properties,  the third  parties  customarily  conduct a title  examination.  The
Company generally does not conduct  examinations of title prior to obtaining its
interests in its operations,  but rely on representations from the third parties
that they have good, valid and enforceable  title to the oil and gas properties.
Based upon the  foregoing,  we believe  that we have  satisfactory  title to our
producing properties in accordance with customary practices in the gas industry.
The  Company  is not  aware of any  title  deficiencies  as of the date of these
financial statements.

the Company's  Board of Directors.  At this time, the Company has not designated
any series of preferred stock or issued any shares of preferred stock.
STOCK OPTION PLAN
On August 17, 2011, the Company's  shareholders  approved the 2011 Hinto Energy,
Inc. Stock Option and Award  Incentive Plan ("Plan").  The Plan provides for the
grant of stock  options to  directors,  officers,  employees,  consultants,  and
advisors of the Company.  The Plan is administered by a committee  consisting of
members of the Board of  Directors  (the "Stock  Option  Committee"),  or in its
absence, the Board of Directors.
The Plan provides for a total of 2,000,000 shares of common stock to be reserved
for issuance  subject to options.  During the years ended  December 31, 2012 and
2011,  the Board did not approve the grant of any options to purchase  shares of
common stock, nor the conditions, performance or vesting requirements.
WARRANTS
During the three  months  ended  March 31,  2013,  the Company did not issue any
warrants for its common stock.
A summary of warrant  activity  for the three  months  ended  March 31,  2013 is

NOTE 11 - INCOME TAXES
----------------------
The  Company is subject to domestic  income  taxes.  The Company has  recognized
minimal  income during the three months ended March 31, 2013,  and therefore has
paid no income tax.
Deferred income taxes arise from temporary timing differences in the recognition
of income and expenses for financial  reporting and tax purposes.  The Company's
deferred  tax assets  consist  entirely of the benefit from net  operating  loss
(NOL)  carry-forwards.  The NOL carry  forwards  expire in various years through
2031. The Company's deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation  allowance due
to  the  uncertainty  of  the  realization  of  the  NOL   carry-forwards.   NOL
carry-forwards may be further limited by a change in company ownership and other
provisions of the tax laws.

PLAN OF OPERATIONS
We only began to recognize  minimal revenues from our operations during the last
half of 2012. We have minimal  capital,  moderate cash. We are illiquid and need
cash infusions from investors or shareholders to provide capital,  or loans from
any sources, none of which have been arranged nor assured.
During the first  quarter  of 2013,  we  continued  our  re-work  efforts on our
properties  in the Cisco  Springs oil and gas field in the Uintah Basin of Grand
County, Utah;  performance of geological analysis of existing properties and the
identification of potential  properties for acquisition.  Re-work efforts in the
Cisco  Springs  field focused on the Company's 5A well and the well is now being
tested and results of the testing are being evaluated.
During the first  quarter of 2013,  we raised  $175,000 from the sale of 350,000
shares of our  restricted  common  stock.  We raised an  additional  $90,000  in
subscription  receivables  for 180,000  shares of our  restricted  common stock.
These shares were issued subsequent to March 31, 2013.
We will need substantial additional capital to support our existing and proposed
future energy operations. We have only recognized minimal and sporadic revenues.
We have no committed source for any funds as of date here. No  representation is
made that any funds will be available when needed.  In the event funds cannot be
raised when needed, we may not be able to carry out our business plan, may never
achieve sales or royalty income, and could fail in business as a result of these
uncertainties.
Decisions  regarding future  participation  in exploration  wells or geophysical
studies or other activities will be made on a case-by-case basis. We may, in any
particular   case,   decide  to   participate  or  decline   participation.   If
participating,  we may pay our  proportionate  share of costs  to  maintain  our
proportionate  interest  through  cash  flow  or debt or  equity  financing.  If
participation  is  declined,  we may  elect  to  farmout,  non-consent,  sell or
otherwise  negotiate  a  method  of cost  sharing  in  order  to  maintain  some
continuing interest in the prospect.

of $810,836  compared to $793,720 during the period of inception (March 8, 2011)

During the three  months  ended March 31,  2013,  the Company  made  payments of
$52,500 on outstanding notes payable.
SHORT TERM
On a short-term basis, we have not generated any revenue or revenues  sufficient
to  cover  operations.  Based  on  prior  history,  we  will  continue  to  have
insufficient revenue to satisfy current and recurring liabilities as the Company
continues exploration activities.
CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company has only common stock as its capital resource.
We have no material  commitments for capital  expenditures within the next year,
however if operations are commenced,  substantial  capital will be needed to pay
for participation, investigation, exploration, acquisition and working capital.
-43-
<PAGE>
NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCING
We do not have capital  sufficient to meet its cash needs. The Company will have
to seek loans or equity  placements to cover such cash needs.  Once  exploration
commences,   its  needs  for   additional   financing   is  likely  to  increase
substantially.
No  commitments  to provide  additional  funds  have been made by the  Company's
management or other  stockholders.  Accordingly,  there can be no assurance that
any additional  funds will be available to us to allow us to cover the Company's
expenses as they may be incurred.
The Company  will need  substantial  additional  capital to support its proposed
future energy operations. We have MINIMAL revenues. The Company has NO committed
source for any funds as of the date hereof.  No  representation is made that any
funds will be available  when  needed.  In the event funds cannot be raised when
needed,  we may not be able to carry out our business  plan,  may never  achieve
sales or  royalty  income,  and  could  fail in  business  as a result  of these
uncertainties.
Decisions  regarding future  participation  in exploration  wells or geophysical
studies or other  activities will be made on a case-by-case  basis.  The Company
may, in any particular case, decide to participate or decline participation.  If
participating,  we may pay its  proportionate  share of costs  to  maintain  the
Company's  proportionate interest through cash flow or debt or equity financing.
If  participation  is declined,  the Company may elect to farmout,  non-consent,
sell or otherwise  negotiate a method of cost sharing in order to maintain  some
continuing interest in the prospect.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less and money market instruments to be cash equivalents.
OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES, FULL COST METHOD
The Company uses the full cost method of  accounting  for oil and gas  producing
activities.  Costs to acquire mineral  interests in oil and gas  properties,  to
drill and equip exploratory wells used to find proved reserves, and to drill and
equip  development  wells including  directly related overhead costs and related
asset retirement costs are capitalized.
Under this method,  all costs,  including  internal  costs  directly  related to
acquisition,  exploration and development  activities are capitalized as oil and
gas  property  costs.   Properties  not  subject  to  amortization   consist  of
exploration and development costs which are evaluated on a  property-by-property
basis.  Amortization of these unproved property costs begins when the properties
become  proved  or their  values  become  impaired.  The  Company  assesses  the
realization  of unproved  properties,  taken as a whole,  if any, on at least an
annual basis or when there has been an indication  that  impairment in value may
have  occurred.   Impairment  of  unproved   properties  is  assessed  based  on
management's  intention  with regard to future  exploration  and  development of
individually  significant  properties  and the  ability of the Company to obtain
funds  to  finance  such  exploration  and  development.  If the  results  of an
assessment  indicate  that  the  properties  are  impaired,  the  amount  of the
impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized.
Costs of oil and gas properties  will be amortized using the units of production
method.
In applying the full cost method,  the Company will perform an  impairment  test
(ceiling  test) at each reporting  date,  whereby the carrying value of property
and  equipment  is  compared  to the  "estimated  present  value," of its proved
reserves discounted at a 10-percent interest rate of future net revenues,  based
on current  economic and operating  conditions,  plus the cost of properties not
being  amortized,  plus the  lower  of cost or fair  market  value  of  unproved
properties  included  in costs  being  amortized,  less the income  tax  effects
related to book and tax basis  differences  of the  properties.  If  capitalized
costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged as an impairment expense.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company  recognizes  revenue when it is earned and  expenses are  recognized
when they occur.

business  to  disclose  to  Hinto  business  opportunities  which  come to their
attention.  The Company's  officers and directors do, however,  have a fiduciary
duty of loyalty to Hinto to disclose to it any business opportunities which come
to  their  attention,  in  their  capacity  as an  officer  and/or  director  or

such person.
PROJECTED STAFF

ITEM 12A.  DISCLOSURE OF COMMISSION  POSITION OF INDEMNIFICATION  FOR SECURITIES
ACT LIABILITIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Wyoming  Business  Corporation  Act  requires us to  indemnify  officers and
directors  for any  expenses  incurred by any officer or director in  connection
with any actions or proceedings,  whether civil,  criminal,  administrative,  or
investigative,  brought  against such officer or director  because of his or her
status as an officer or director, to the extent that the director or officer has
been  successful  on the  merits  or  otherwise  in  defense  of the  action  or
proceeding.  The  Wyoming  Business  Corporation  Act permits a  corporation  to
indemnify an officer or director,  even in the absence of an agreement to do so,
for  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with any action or  proceeding  if such
officer  or  director  acted in good  faith  and in a manner  in which he or she
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of us and such
indemnification is authorized by the stockholders,  by a quorum of disinterested
directors,  by independent  legal counsel in a written  opinion  authorized by a
majority vote of a quorum of directors consisting of disinterested directors, or
by independent  legal counsel in a written opinion if a quorum of  disinterested
directors cannot be obtained.
The Wyoming Business Corporation Act prohibits  indemnification of a director or
officer if a final  adjudication  establishes  that the  officer's or director's
acts or omissions involved intentional misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation
of the law and were  material  to the cause of  action.  Despite  the  foregoing
limitations on indemnification,  the Wyoming Business Corporation Act may permit
an officer or  director to apply to the court for  approval  of  indemnification
even if the  officer or  director  is  adjudged  to have  committed  intentional
misconduct, fraud, or a knowing violation of the law.
The Wyoming  Business  Corporation  Act also  provides that  indemnification  of
directors is not permitted for the unlawful payment of distributions, except for
those directors registering their dissent to the payment of the distribution.
According to our bylaws,  we are  authorized  to indemnify  our directors to the
fullest  extent  authorized  under  Wyoming  Law  subject to  certain  specified
limitations.
Insofar as indemnification  for liabilities  arising under the Securities Act of
1933 (the "Act") may be permitted to directors, officers and persons controlling
us pursuant to the foregoing  provisions  or otherwise,  we are advised that, in
the opinion of the Securities and Exchange  Commission,  such indemnification is
against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
