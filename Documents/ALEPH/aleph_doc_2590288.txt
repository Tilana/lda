CONTINENTAL RESOURCES REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2016 RESULTS
Outstanding STACK Well Results Increase 2016 Production Guidance to 210,000 to
220,000 Boe per Day; Capital Budget Remains Unchanged
Production Expense Outlook Reduced $0.50 per Barrel of Oil Equivalent (Boe)
New STACK Completions Extend Oil Window West:
Madeline 1-9-4XH Flows at 3,538 Boe per Day (71% Oil);
Frankie Jo 1-25-24XH Flows at 2,627 Boe per Day (56% Oil)
Enhanced Completions in SCOOP Woodford Oil Window Increase Estimated Ultimate
Recovery (EUR) by ~30% to 1.3 Million Boe per Well (62% Oil) for 2-Mile Laterals
Company Agrees to Sell Non-Strategic SCOOP Leasehold for $281 Million, with Proceeds
to Be Applied to Debt Reduction
Oklahoma City, August 3, 2016 – Continental Resources, Inc. (NYSE: CLR) (the “Company”)
today reported a net loss of $119.4 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June
30, 2016.
The Company’s net loss includes certain items typically excluded by the investment community
in published estimates, the result of which is often referred to as “adjusted net loss.” In second
quarter 2016, these typically excluded items in aggregate represented $53.5 million, or $0.14 per
diluted share, of Continental’s reported net loss.
EBITDAX for second quarter 2016 was $528.1 million. The Company has defined and reconciled
adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per diluted share and EBITDAX to the most directly
comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures in
supporting tables at the conclusion of this press release under the header Non-GAAP Financial
Measures.
“Continental once again outperformed production guidance in the second quarter thanks to the
exceptional quality and performance of our Bakken, SCOOP and STACK assets, as well as
exceptional execution by our teams,” commented Harold Hamm, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer. “We are also on track to reduce long-term debt with our agreement to sell a second non-
strategic asset for $281 million.”
Updated 2016 Guidance Reflects Strong Performance
Based on strong operating results in first half 2016, the Company now expects production for the
year will be in a range of 210,000 and 220,000 Boe per day, an increase of 5,000 Boe per day
from previous guidance. Continental expects to exit the year with production between 195,000
and 205,000 Boe per day, also reflecting a 5,000 Boe per day increase.
Continental also reduced 2016 guidance for production expense per Boe and cash general and
administrative (G&A) expense per Boe. Production expense is now expected to be in a range of
$3.75 to $4.25 per Boe for the year, down approximately 11% ($0.50 per Boe) from the previous
range. Efficiencies contributing to the lower guidance include reducing produced water expense
and increasing artificial lift efficiency in the Bakken and reducing compression, saltwater disposal
and chemical costs in Oklahoma.
Total G&A expense, including cash and non-cash G&A expense, is expected to be in a reduced
range of $1.85 to $2.45 per Boe for 2016. Of this total, cash G&A expense is expected to be in a
range of $1.20 to $1.60 per Boe for 2016, a reduction from the previous range of $1.25 to $1.75
per Boe.
Finally, the Company improved its outlook for oil price differential, reflecting increased crude oil
production in Oklahoma, where it has lower transportation costs, and reduced transportation
costs from the Bakken. Average crude oil price differential for 2016 is expected to be in a range of
$7.00 to $8.00 per barrel of oil (Bo), compared with the previous range of $7.00 to $9.00.

The Company’s full 2016 guidance is stated in a table at the conclusion of this release.
“Over the last 18 months, Continental has achieved a step-change improvement in capital
efficiency,” said Jack Stark, President and Chief Operating Officer. “Barrels of oil found per dollar
invested have more than doubled, while production expense per Boe and G&A expense per Boe
have decreased by a combined 36% since 2014. We believe the majority of these capital
efficiencies are structural and sustainable, further strengthening CLR’s performance going
forward.”
SCOOP Non-Strategic Asset Sale for $281 Million
Continental announced today it has signed a definitive purchase and sale agreement with an
undisclosed buyer to sell approximately 29,500 net acres of non-strategic leasehold in the
SCOOP play in Oklahoma for $281 million. The agreement provides for customary closing
conditions and adjustments. Located primarily on the eastern side of SCOOP, the leasehold
represents approximately 550 Boe per day of net production. After this transaction, the Company
will retain approximately 384,000 net acres of leasehold in SCOOP.
“Proceeds from this sale and the previous sale of Wyoming assets will total nearly $400 million,”
said Mr. Stark. In May 2016, the Company announced the sale of approximately 132,000 net
acres of leasehold in the Washakie Basin in Wyoming for $110 million.

“We have additional opportunities to sell non-strategic assets for continued debt reduction,” he
said.
Production Results
Second quarter 2016 net production totaled approximately 20.0 million Boe (MMBoe), or 219,300
Boe per day, down 5% from first quarter 2016 and 3% lower than second quarter 2015. The
second quarter 2016 production decline, as expected, was concentrated in the Bakken play,
where the Company continues to increase its drilled but uncompleted (DUC) well inventory.
Total net production for second quarter 2016 included approximately 133,000 Bo per day (61% of
total production) and approximately 518 million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas per day (39% of
total production).

STACK / Northwest Cana Joint Development Agreement (JDA) Area, Oklahoma
STACK/Northwest Cana production increased 31% to 14,610 Boe per day in second quarter
2016, compared to first quarter 2016.
The Company reported five new Meramec completions in Blaine County. Initial 24-hour
production test rates and flowing casing pressures (in pounds per square inch, or psi) for these
wells were as follows:
•  Madeline 1-9-4XH flowed 2,513 Bo and 6.1 MMcf of natural gas (3,538 Boe) per day at
4,500 psi flowing casing pressure;
•  Frankie Jo 1-25-24XH flowed 1,484 Bo and 6.9 MMcf of natural gas (2,627 Boe) per day
at 4,320 psi;
•  Gillilan 1-35-26XH flowed 1,703 Bo and 4.4 MMcf of natural gas (2,439 Boe) per day at
2,030 psi;
•  Oppel 1-25-26XH flowed 998 Bo and 1.9 MMcf of natural gas (1,308 Boe) per day at
1,670 psi; and
•  Yocum 1-35-26XH flowed 14.0 MMcf of natural gas and 17 Bo (2,355 Boe) per day at
4,810 psi.
3
All five new wells were drilled with extended laterals, ranging from approximately 7,100 to 9,900
feet.
“Results of the Madeline and Frankie Jo wells are outstanding,” said Mr. Stark. “These two wells
extend the known productive footprint of the over-pressured Meramec oil window 17 miles west
of the Verona well we reported in May. The Madeline actually set a new record for Continental
operated wells in STACK, flowing at an initial 24-hour rate of 3,538 Boe per day, with 71% of
production being crude oil.”
The Yocum is a strong gas producer and Continental’s first completion in the over-pressured gas
window of STACK. The Yocum was designed to test the productivity of the Meramec on the
down-thrown side of a significant north-south trending fault that separates the Yocum from the
Company’s previously announced Boden 1-15-10XH well, which is located just over a mile to the
northwest.
“The separating fault has up to 525 feet of vertical displacement, and the Yocum is clearly in the
gas window on the down-thrown side of the fault,” said Glen Brown, Senior Vice President of
Exploration. “In contrast, the Boden is located in the condensate window on the fault’s up-thrown
side, and it has steadily produced 27% crude oil since December 2015. The Yocum’s results
place an additional 2% of Continental’s STACK acreage in the gas window.”
Continental finished drilling and is now completing its first STACK density pilot in the Ludwig
unit, which is located in the over-pressured oil window of STACK. The Ludwig is testing four
wells per zone in the Upper and Middle Meramec zones, with one well in the Woodford. Average
lateral length for the Ludwig wells is approximately 9,500 feet. Multi-well pad development
reduced drilling times for the Ludwig density wells to an average 25 days, down 44%, compared
to the Company’s average for STACK wells drilled in 2015. Average drilling cost for the Ludwig
density wells is estimated at $3.2 million per well, 28% below the Ludwig legacy well drilled in
June of 2015.
The Company has commenced drilling its second and third STACK density pilots in the over-
pressured oil window at the Bernhardt and Blurton units in Blaine County. The Bernhardt density
pilot is testing a five-well per zone pattern in the Lower Meramec, with targeted lateral lengths of
4,950 feet. The Blurton density pilot is testing three to five wells per zone in the Upper and Lower
Meramec, with average lateral lengths of 10,300 feet.
Continental is now targeting an average completed well cost of $9.0 million per operated well for
extended-lateral wells in the over-pressured oil window of STACK. This is $500,000 per well
below the previous year-end 2016 target. At this targeted cost, Continental estimates a well in the
over-pressured oil window should deliver more than an 85% rate of return at $45 per barrel WTI
and $2.50 per Mcf of gas, based on an EUR of 1.7 MMBoe per well.
Continental increased its STACK leasehold by approximately 12,000 net acres in second quarter
2016 to approximately 183,000 net acres, located primarily in Blaine, Dewey and Custer
counties. Since year-end 2015, the Company has added approximately 27,000 net acres of
leasehold in STACK. The Company estimates 95% of its STACK leasehold is in the over-
pressured window, of which 40% is in the oil window, 40% is in the condensate window and 20%
is in the gas window. The Company has 11 operated rigs in STACK, with six targeting the
Meramec formation in Blaine County and five targeting the Woodford formation in the Northwest
Cana JDA area.
4
A notable second quarter 2016 well completion in the Northwest Cana JDA area was the
Lacretia 1-29-20XH, which had initial 24-hour production of 17.6 MMcf per day (100% natural
gas) with approximately a 7,500-foot lateral at 5,500 psi flowing casing pressure. Since inception
in early April, the Lacretia has flowed a cumulative 1.7 Bcf of gas, and it is currently flowing
approximately 11.8 MMcf per day at 3,250 psi flowing casing pressure.
SCOOP Play, Oklahoma: Woodford Oil Window EUR Increased to 1.3 MMBoe per Well
In second quarter 2016, total SCOOP net production averaged 64,669 Boe per day, slightly
above first quarter 2016 and 3% higher than second quarter 2015. SCOOP production
represented 29% of the Company’s total production in second quarter 2016.
SCOOP Woodford net production averaged 56,511 Boe per day in second quarter 2016,
compared with SCOOP Springer net production of 8,158 Boe per day.
The Company announced it has increased the EUR for 2-mile wells drilled in the SCOOP
Woodford oil window by approximately 30% to 1.3 MMBoe per well, with 62% of production
being crude oil. The increase in EUR was based on the results of 22 enhanced completions
conducted over the past two years in the SCOOP Woodford oil window and assumes an average
9,800-foot lateral per well. Results show that 180-day production rates are on average 25%-to-
30% higher than offsetting legacy wells. At a targeted completed well cost of $9.8 million per
well, a 1.3 MMBoe EUR SCOOP Woodford oil well should yield a 32% rate of return at $45 per
barrel WTI and $2.50 per Mcf of gas.
The most recent enhanced completion well in the SCOOP Woodford oil window was the RK
Morris 1-29-17XH in eastern Grady County, which had an initial 24-hour production test rate of
1,003 Bo and 1.8 MMcf (1,297 Boe) from an 11,500-foot lateral, with flowing casing pressure of
690 psi. Along with solid initial production, the well is exhibiting a low decline rate, with an
average 30-day production of 903 Bo and 1.6 MMcf per day at 560 psi.
Gary Gould, Senior Vice President of Production and Resource Development, said, “Enhanced
completions once again are having a profound impact on production rates and EURs, this time in
the oil window of SCOOP Woodford, just as we’ve experienced in the SCOOP condensate
window. We estimate that at least 50,000 net acres in our Woodford oil window leasehold can be
upgraded to the new 1.3 MMBoe EUR type curve, so the new approach obviously increases the
value of this asset in a significant way.” He added that enhanced completion designs will be
applied in all future oil window wells in SCOOP Woodford, starting with the completion of the
new wells in the May density pilot in Grady County.
Continental completed 6 net (24 gross) operated and non-operated wells in SCOOP in second
quarter 2016, while operating an average of four rigs in the play. This includes 5.4 net (23 gross)
wells targeting the Woodford formation and 0.3 net (1 gross) wells targeting the Springer
formation.
Bakken Play, North Dakota
Continental’s Bakken production averaged 125,028 Boe per day in second quarter 2016, a
decrease of 10% from first quarter 2016. Continental completed 3 net (25 gross) operated and
non-operated wells in Bakken in second quarter 2016, while operating an average of four drilling
rigs in the play.
5
The Company recently elected to complete eight additional operated Bakken wells in the second
half of 2016 to further test enhanced completion concepts including stage spacing, proppant
volumes per stage, proppant size and diverter technology. Two stimulation crews were recently
deployed in the field to execute these plans, and the Company anticipates first production for
new wells in this program during third and fourth quarters 2016. This testing program is designed
to provide additional data to help Continental optimize future development of its DUC inventory.
Continental’s current Bakken DUC inventory has grown to approximately 165 gross operated
DUCs, with expectations to end 2016 with approximately 190 gross operated DUCs. This
represents a high-graded inventory with an average EUR of approximately 850,000 Boe per
DUC well. The Company estimates a current average cost of between $3.0 million to $3.5 million
per well to complete these wells. At $45 per barrel WTI and $2.50 per Mcf of gas, the cost-forward
rate of return on this incremental capital expenditure is over 100%. “Our DUCs represent an
exceptional value that we can capitalize on as markets recover,” Mr. Gould said.
The Company’s total completed well cost for a 2-mile lateral Bakken well is approximately $6.2
million, down from $6.8 million at year-end 2015. Continental expects to achieve an operated
completed well cost of $6.0 million by year-end 2016.
Financial Update
“Continental’s second quarter results clearly reflect continued discipline in terms of operating
costs and capital expenditures,” said John Hart, Chief Financial Officer. “We are currently cash
flow positive and expect to remain so in the second half of the year, especially under our
assumption that commodity prices will strengthen. Our credit metrics are improving and are
expected to further improve as we apply asset divestiture proceeds to further reduce debt.”
In second quarter 2016, Continental’s average realized sales price, excluding the effects of
derivative positions, was $38.38 per Bo and $1.31 per Mcf of gas, or $26.36 per Boe. Based on
realizations without the effect of derivatives, the Company’s second quarter 2016 oil differential
was $7.21 per barrel below the NYMEX daily average for the period. The second quarter 2016
realized wellhead natural gas price, without the effect of derivatives, was on average $0.65 per
Mcf below the average NYMEX Henry Hub benchmark price.
Production expense per Boe was $3.72 for second quarter 2016, a decrease of $0.67 per Boe
from second quarter 2015. Other select operating costs and expenses for second quarter 2016
included production taxes of 7.4% of oil and natural gas sales; DD&A of $22.15 per Boe; and
G&A (cash and non-cash) of $1.82 per Boe.
As of June 30, 2016, Continental’s balance sheet included $16.6 million in cash and cash
equivalents and $885 million of borrowings against the Company’s revolving credit facility,
compared to the balance of $940 million at March 31, 2016. As of July 31, 2016, borrowings
against the revolving credit facility had declined to $820 million. Continental had approximately
$1.86 billion in available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2016,
and approximately $1.93 billion was available as of July 31, 2016.
6
Capital expenditures for second quarter 2016 were $219.3 million, including $9.9 million for
acquisitions. Non-acquisition capital expenditures for second quarter 2016 included $179.6
million in exploration and development drilling, $18.8 million in leasehold and seismic, and $11.0
million in workovers, recompletions and other. Year-to-date non-acquisition capital expenditures
were consistent with the Company’s spending plan under its budget of $920 million for 2016.
The following table provides the Company’s production results, average sales prices, per-unit
operating costs, results of operations, and certain non-GAAP financial measures for the periods
presented. Average sales prices exclude any effect of derivative transactions. Per-unit expenses

other reserves-based measures; declines in the values of our crude oil and natural gas properties
resulting in impairment charges; our ability to replace proved reserves and sustain production;
the availability or cost of equipment and oilfield services; leasehold terms expiring on
undeveloped acreage before production can be established; our ability to project future
production, achieve targeted results in drilling and well operations and predict the amount and
timing of development expenditures; the availability and cost of transportation, processing and
refining facilities; legislative and regulatory changes adversely affecting our industry and our
business, including initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing; increased market and industry
competition, including from alternative fuels and other energy sources; and the other risks
described under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in the Company’s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, registration statements and other reports filed
from time to time with the SEC, and other announcements the Company makes from time to time.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date on which such statement is made. Should one or more of the risks or
uncertainties described in this press release occur, or should underlying assumptions prove
incorrect, the Company’s actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in
any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their
entirety by this cautionary statement. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the
Company undertakes no obligation to publicly correct or update any forward-looking statement
whether as a result of new information, future events or circumstances after the date of this report,
or otherwise.
Readers are cautioned that initial production rates are subject to decline over time and should
not be regarded as reflective of sustained production levels. In particular, production from
horizontal drilling in shale oil and natural gas resource plays and tight natural gas plays that are
stimulated with extensive pressure fracturing are typically characterized by significant early
declines in production rates.

We use the term “EUR” or “estimated ultimate recovery” to describe potentially recoverable oil
and natural gas hydrocarbon quantities. We include these estimates to demonstrate what we
believe to be the potential for future drilling and production on our properties. These estimates
are by their nature much more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and require
substantial capital spending to implement recovery. Actual locations drilled and quantities that
may be ultimately recovered from our properties will differ substantially. EUR data included
herein remain subject to change as more well data is analyzed.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
EBITDAX
We use a variety of financial and operational measures to assess our performance. Among these
measures is EBITDAX. We define EBITDAX as earnings before interest expense, income taxes,
depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion, property impairments, exploration expenses,
non-cash gains and losses resulting from the requirements of accounting for derivatives, and
non-cash equity compensation expense. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or net cash
provided by operating activities as determined by U.S. GAAP.
Management believes EBITDAX is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our
operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without
regard to our financing methods or capital structure. Further, we believe EBITDAX is a widely
followed measure of operating performance and may also be used by investors to measure our
ability to meet future debt service requirements, if any. We exclude the items listed above from
net income (loss) and net cash provided by operating activities in arriving at EBITDAX because
these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending
upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which
the assets were acquired.
EBITDAX should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income
(loss) or net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP
or as an indicator of a company’s operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from
EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial
performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs
of depreciable assets, none of which are components of EBITDAX. Our computations of
EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
The following table provides a reconciliation of our net income (loss) to EBITDAX for the periods
presented.

Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share
Our presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the effect of
certain items are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per
share represent earnings and diluted earnings per share determined under U.S. GAAP without
regard to non-cash gains and losses on derivative instruments, property impairments and gains
and losses on asset sales. Management believes these measures provide useful information to
analysts and investors for analysis of our operating results. In addition, management believes
these measures are used by analysts and others in valuation, comparison and investment
recommendations of companies in the oil and gas industry to allow for analysis without regard to
an entity’s specific derivative portfolio, impairment methodologies, and property dispositions.
Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share should not be considered in isolation or as a
substitute for earnings or diluted earnings per share as determined in accordance with U.S.
GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The
following tables reconcile earnings and diluted earnings per share as determined under U.S.
GAAP to adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the periods presented.

Cash general and administrative expenses per Boe
Our presentation of cash general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses per Boe is a non-GAAP
measure. We define cash G&A per Boe as total G&A determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP
less non-cash equity compensation expenses, expressed on a per-Boe basis. We report and
provide guidance on cash G&A per Boe because we believe this measure is commonly used by
management, analysts and investors as an indicator of cost management and operating
efficiency on a comparable basis from period to period. In addition, management believes cash
G&A per Boe is used by analysts and others in valuation, comparison and investment
recommendations of companies in the oil and gas industry to allow for analysis of G&A spend
without regard to stock-based compensation programs which can vary substantially from
company to company. Cash G&A per Boe should not be considered as an alternative to, or more
meaningful than, total G&A per Boe as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not
be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
