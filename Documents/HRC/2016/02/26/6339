<p><b>Human Rights Council 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Resolution 7/28.   Missing persons 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the purposes, principles and provisions of the Charter of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations,  
</p>
<p><i> Guided</i> <i>also</i> by the principles and norms of international humanitarian law, in 
</p>
<p>particular the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols 
</p>
<p>thereto of 1977, as well as international standards of human rights, in particular the 
</p>
<p>Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Vienna Declaration and Programme 
</p>
<p>of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> all previous resolutions on missing persons adopted by the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly, as well as the resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights,  
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that the problem of missing persons raises questions of both 
</p>
<p>international human rights law and, as applicable, international humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with deep concern</i> that armed conflicts are continuing in various parts 
</p>
<p>of the world, often resulting in serious violations of international humanitarian law 
</p>
<p>and human rights law,  
</p>
<p><i> Convinced</i> that States hold the primary responsibility for countering the 
</p>
<p>phenomenon of missing persons and determining the fate of missing persons and that 
</p>
<p>they must recognize their accountability for implementing the relevant mechanisms, 
</p>
<p>policies and laws,  
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> the effective search for and identification of missing persons 
</p>
<p>through traditional forensic methods, and recognizing that great technological </p>

<p>progress has been achieved in the field of DNA forensic sciences, which could 
</p>
<p>significantly assist efforts to identify missing persons,  
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> that the issue of persons reported missing in connection with 
</p>
<p>international armed conflicts, in particular those who are victims of serious violations 
</p>
<p>of international humanitarian law and human rights law, continues to have a negative 
</p>
<p>impact on efforts to put an end to those conflicts and causes suffering to the families 
</p>
<p>of missing persons, and stressing in this regard the need to address the issue from a 
</p>
<p>humanitarian perspective, among others,  
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the conclusions of the International Conference of Governmental 
</p>
<p>and Non-Governmental Experts convened by the International Committee of the Red 
</p>
<p>Cross in Geneva from 19 to 21 February 2003 on &#8220;The missing: action to resolve the 
</p>
<p>problem of people unaccounted for as a result of armed conflict or internal violence 
</p>
<p>and to assist their families&#8221; and its recommendations to address the problems of 
</p>
<p>missing persons and their families,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Agenda for Humanitarian Action, in particular its general 
</p>
<p>objective 1, to &#8220;respect and restore the dignity of persons missing as a result of armed 
</p>
<p>conflicts or other situations of armed violence and of their families&#8221;, adopted at the 
</p>
<p>Twenty-eighth International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, held in 
</p>
<p>Geneva from 2 to 6 December 2003, and resolution 3 on the reaffirmation and 
</p>
<p>implementation of international humanitarian law entitled &#8220;Preserving human life and 
</p>
<p>dignity in armed conflict&#8221;, adopted at the Thirtieth International Conference of the 
</p>
<p>Red Cross and Red Crescent, held in Geneva from 26 to 30 November 2007,  
</p>

</p>
<p>by the Inter-Parliamentary Union at its 115th Assembly,
