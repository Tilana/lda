<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In 2010, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances 
commemorated its 30th anniversary. During its thirty years of existence, the Working 
Group has fulfilled its humanitarian mandate to assist families to ascertain the fate and 
whereabouts of their disappeared family members. Nevertheless, it deplores the fact that 
enforced disappearances continue to occur all over the world and that tens of thousands of 
cases remain unclarified in the records of the Working Group, many going back decades.  
</p>
<p>2. The Working Group was the first United Nations human rights thematic mechanism 
to be established with a universal mandate. The original mandate derives from Commission 
on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 February 1980. This resolution followed 
General Assembly resolution 33/173 of 20 December 1978, in which the Assembly 
expressed concern at reports from various parts of the world relating to enforced 
disappearances and requested the Commission on Human Rights to consider the question of 
missing or disappeared persons. The mandate was most recently extended by Human Rights 
Council resolution 7/12 of 27 March 2008. 
</p>
<p>3. The primary task of the Working Group is to assist families in determining the fate 
or whereabouts of their family members who are reportedly disappeared. In this 
humanitarian capacity, the Working Group serves as a channel of communication between 
family members of victims of disappearance and Governments.  
</p>
<p>4. Following the adoption of General Assembly resolution 47/133 on 18 December 
1992 and of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, 
the Working Group was entrusted to monitor the progress of States in fulfilling their 
obligations derived from the Declaration. Human Rights Council resolution 7/12 
encouraged the Working Group to provide assistance in the implementation by States of the 
Declaration. 
</p>
<p>5. This report reflects communications and cases examined by the Working Group 
during its three sessions in 2010, covering the period 14 November 2009 to 12 November 
</p><p>2010. 
</p>
<p>6. A summary of activities during the reporting period is presented in a table for each 
country, with a detailed text description of the areas of activity. Where there has been no 
information from the Government or the sources, notwithstanding the annual reminder sent 
by the Working Group concerning outstanding cases, only the table is provided and a 
reference is made to the previous report dealing with those cases.  
</p>
<p>7. For States where the number of newly reported cases is less than 10, the names of 
the persons appear in that State&#8217;s section. If the number of newly reported cases is greater 
than 10, the list of names appears in annex V. For urgent actions, the names of all persons, 
regardless of the number, appear in the relevant State&#8217;s section. 
</p>
<p>8. The total number of cases transmitted by the Working Group to Governments since 
its inception is 53,337. The number of cases under active consideration that have not yet 
been clarified, closed or discontinued stands at 42,633 in a total of 83 States. The Working 
Group has been able to clarify 1,814 cases over the past five years. 
</p>
<p>9. The Working Group regrets the lack of adequate support given to the mandate, 
which has led to a backlog of more than 400 cases. The Working Group also notes that 
many communications are not translated in time, thus delaying their consideration by the 
Working Group. </p>


<p>10. At the present time, the Working Group&#8217;s website remains inadequate. The majority 
of the content is in English only. The Working Group calls on the United Nations to 
provide adequate resources to make it more accessible. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances: 14 November 2009 to 12 November 2010 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Activities 
</b></p>
<p>11. During the period under review, the Working Group held three sessions: 
the ninetieth from 15 to 19 March 2010 in Geneva, the ninety-first from 22 to 25 June 2010, 
in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the ninety-second from 3 to 12 November 2010, 
in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>12. As from 1 August 2009, the Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group is Mr. Jeremy 
Sarkin. The other members are Mr. Ariel Dulitzky, Ms. Jasminka Dzumhur, Mr. Osman El-
Hajj&#233; and Mr. Olivier de Frouville.  
</p>
<p>13. On 8 March 2010, the Chair-Rapporteur presented the Working Group&#8217;s 2009 
annual report to the tenth session of the Human Rights Council and participated in the 
interactive dialogue with Member States. During the reporting period, the Chair-Rapporteur 
presented 15 conference papers including a paper on Enhancing Cooperation between UN 
Special Procedures and Regional Human Rights Systems to the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights Workshop on Enhancing cooperation between regional 
and international mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights - A 
consultation for Africa, in Addis Abba, Ethiopia in November 2009. He also gave 
presentations at Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan in January; at a seminar in Windhoek, 
Namibia, in February; and at various side events at the Human Rights Council in March. He 
presented a paper on &#8220;Information sharing between existing regional human rights 
mechanisms and the international human rights system&#8221; to the United Nations Human 
Rights Council Workshop &#8220;Enhancing cooperation between the International Human Rights 
System and Regional Human Rights Mechanisms&#8221;, at the United Nations Office at Geneva 
in May. He gave a number of presentations in Jakarta, Indonesia, in May and was the 
keynote speaker at the Aim for Human Rights Conference on Disappearances in Africa, in 
Geneva, in June. He also presented a number of training sessions throughout the year. 
</p>
<p>14. On 10 March 2010, Mr. Olivier de Frouville delivered a presentation during a panel 
discussion on the right to truth organized by the Human Rights Council at its thirteenth 
session. On 3 August 2010, he addressed the Advisory Committee of the Human Rights 
Council on the issue of missing persons and enforced disappearances.  
</p>
<p>15. On 26 January 2010, Mr. Osman El-Hajj&#233; addressed the Advisory Committee on the 
Human Rights Council on the issue of missing persons and enforced disappearances. From 
16 to 18 April 2010, he organized and coordinated a seminar on Human Rights 
International Mechanisms at the Centre for Human Rights in the University of Jinane, 
Lebanon. In September 2010, he participated in a round table on the issue of enforced 
disappearances at the International Institute of Humanitarian Law in San Remo, Italy. 
</p>
<p>16. On 18 March 2010, the Working Group hosted a side event at the 13th session of the 
Human Rights Council on &#8220;Thirty years between hope and despair: the experience of the 
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances.&#8221; Members of the Working 
Group as well as representatives of Member States, civil society and relatives of 
disappeared persons participated in this side event. </p>


<p>17. On 5 November 2010, all members of the Working Group participated in a 
commemorative event on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the 
Working Group mandated by Human Rights Council resolution 14/10. Twelve experts on 
enforced disappearances, together with representatives of Member States, national human 
rights institutions, civil society and relatives of disappeared persons participated in the 
event1.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Meetings 
</b></p>
<p>18. During the period under review, representatives of the Governments of Angola, 
Chad, Iraq, Japan, Morocco, Nepal, Rwanda and Sri Lanka attended the sessions of the 
Working Group. A number of other bilateral meetings were held with various States during 
the year. The Working Group also met with the Committee against Torture, representatives 
of international governmental organizations, human rights non-governmental organizations 
and associations of relatives of disappeared persons and families of victims of enforced 
disappearances or witnesses thereto. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>19. During the reporting period, the Working Group transmitted 105 new cases of 
enforced disappearance to 22 Governments. 
</p>
<p>20. The Working Group transmitted 50 of these cases under the urgent action procedure 
to the Governments of Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Iraq, Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya, Mexico, the Kingdom of Morocco, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, 
Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand and Yemen. Of the newly reported cases, three allegedly 
occurred during the reporting period and relate to the United Arab Emirates. 
</p>
<p>21. During the same period, the Working Group clarified 70 cases in the following 
States: Cameroon, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, India, Iraq, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the 
Kingdom of Morocco, Myanmar, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Syrian Arab 
Republic, Turkey, Uruguay and Yemen. Of those, 23 cases were clarified based on 
information provided by the Government and 47 cases were clarified based on information 
provided by sources. 
</p>
<p>22. During the reporting period, the Working Group transmitted seven prompt 
intervention communications addressing harassment of, and threats to, human rights 
defenders and relatives of disappeared persons in Algeria, Colombia, India, Mexico and 
Turkey. Six of these were sent as joint communications with other special procedures 
mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>23. The Working Group sent 13 urgent appeals concerning persons who had been 
arrested, detained, abducted or otherwise deprived of their liberty or who had been forcibly 
disappeared or were at risk of being disappeared in Bahrain, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, 
Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Uzbekistan and the 
Palestinian Authority. All these communications were sent jointly with other special 
procedures mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>24. Following its eighty-ninth session in 2009 and its first two sessions in 2010, the 
Working Group sent two general allegations to the Governments of China and Nepal 
</p>
<p>

<p>inviting them to comment thereon. Summaries of three additional general allegations 
considered during the ninety-second session, including government responses, if any, will 
be included in the 2011 annual report. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>25. At the invitation of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. de Frouville 
and Mr. Sarkin visited the country from 14 to 21 June 2010, assisted by the Secretariat. The 
purpose of the mission was to learn about the country&#8217;s efforts in addressing cases of past 
enforced disappearances, the fight against impunity and other issues including matters 
concerning truth, justice and reparations for victims. The report on the visit to Bosnia and 
Herzegovina is contained in A/HRC/16/48/Add.1.  
</p>
<p>26. During the reporting period, the Working Group requested visits to Chile, India, 
Mexico, the Republic of Congo and Pakistan. 
</p>
<p>27. The Governments of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Chile, Mexico and Timor-Leste 
invited the Working Group to visit their countries. 
</p>
<p>28. The Working Group recalls the fact that the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran agreed to a visit by the Working Group in 2005, which was delayed at the request of 
the Government. The Working Group recalls the pending invitation and requests that the 
invitation be extended. 
</p>
<p>29. In 2010, the Working Groups sent reminders to the Governments of Algeria, 
Nicaragua, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, the Philippines, Russian Federation, Sudan 
and Zimbabwe. 
</p>
<p>30. The Working Group invites all the Governments that received a request by the 
Working Group to respond to the request by the Working Group for a visit. 
</p>
<p><b> E.  Reports 
</b></p>
<p>31. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 14/10, the Working Group 
prepared a report on the best practices on enforced disappearances in domestic criminal 
legislation. The report is contained in addendum 3 (A/HRC/16/48/Add.3) and contains 
factual examples, legal analysis and recommendations to assist States in enhancing existing, 
and developing new, legislation on enforced disappearance.  
</p>
<p>32. During the reporting period, the Working Group also prepared follow-up reports on 
the implementation of the recommendations it made following its country visits to 
Guatemala and Honduras. These follow-up reports are contained in addendum 2 
(A/HRC/16/48/Add.2).

<p>33. On 26 February 2010, the Working Group issued a press release on the 30th 
anniversary of its establishment on 29 February 1980, stressing the fact that enforced 
disappearance remains a current practice affecting all continents of the world. It noted with 
concern the widespread impunity for this crime as well as ongoing harassment of the 
relatives of victims.  
</p>
<p>34. On 5 March 2010, the Working Group joined the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, and 26 other United Nations independent 
experts in a press release calling for a new vision of women&#8217;s rights informed by the </p>


<p>lessons learned from the 15-year review of the implementation of the Beijing Platform for 
Action. 
</p>
<p>35. On 25 May 2010, the Working Group issued a press release noting with concern the 
suspension of Judge Baltasar Garz&#243;n of Spain by the General Council of the Judiciary for 
having admitted and investigated a series of complaints submitted in 2006 regarding more 
than 100,000 cases of enforced disappearances which occurred during the Spanish Civil 
War and the Franco regime. 
</p>
<p>36. On 12 July 2010, the Working Group issued a press release on the passing of 
Patricio Rice, Coordinator of ICAED (International Coalition against Enforced 
Disappearances), and co-founder and former Executive Secretary of FEDEFAM (Latin 
American Federation of Associations of Families of Disappeared Detainees), himself a 
survivor of enforced disappearance.  
</p>
<p>37. On 22 July 2010, the Working Group issued a press release on the adoption of the 
general comment on the right to the truth in relation to enforced disappearances. It did so to 
focus the attention of States on the relevant obligations deriving from the Declaration on 
the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance that flow from the right to the 
truth.  
</p>
<p>38. To commemorate the International Day of the Disappeared, the Working Group 
issued a press release on 30 August 2010, expressing its wish that the United Nations 
include it among the official observed days. The experts reiterated their solidarity with 
victims, their families and others who work on the issue and called upon States to define 
enforced disappearance as an autonomous criminal offence in their domestic legislation. 
The Working Group also called upon States to take measures to promote truth and 
reconciliation, which ought not to be used as a substitute for bringing perpetrators to 
justice. The Working Group called upon Governments to sign and ratify the International 
Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance and accept the 
competence of the Committee-to-be under articles 31and 32 of the Convention. It noted that 
only one more ratification or accession by a State Party was required for its entry into force. 
</p>
<p><b> G.  General comments  
</b></p>
<p>39. In 2010, the Working Group adopted two general comments: on enforced 
disappearance as a continuous crime and on the Right to the Truth in relation to enforced 
disappearance. 
</p>
<p><b>  General comment on enforced disappearance as a continuous crime 
</b></p>
<p><i>   Preamble 
</i></p>
<p> &#8220;With a view to focusing the attention of States more effectively on the 
relevant obligations deriving from the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced Disappearance, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances decided to adopt general comments on those provisions of the 
Declaration that might need further explanation. 
</p>
<p> The following general comment complements its previous general comment 
on article 17 of the Declaration regarding the interpretation of the continuous nature 
of the crime of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p> Under international law, &#8220;<i>The breach of an international obligation by an act 
of a State having a continuing character extends over the entire period during which 
the act continues and remains not in conformity with the international obligation</i>&#8221; </p>


<p>(Articles on Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, General 
Assembly resolution 56/83, Article 14 &#167; 2) 
</p>
<p> Various international treaties, and international, regional and domestic 
tribunals have recognized that enforced disappearances are continuing acts and 
continuing crimes.  
</p>
<p> Article 17 &#167; 1 of the United Nations Declaration on the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance provides: 
</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Acts constituting enforced disappearance shall be considered a continuing 
offence as long as perpetrators continue to conceal the fate and whereabouts 
of persons who have disappeared.&#8221; 
</i></p>
<p> This continuous nature of enforced disappearances has consequences with 
regards to the application of the principle of non retroactivity, both in treaty law and 
criminal law. 
</p>
<p> Article 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969 provides 
that: 
</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise 
established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact 
which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the 
entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party.&#8221; 
</i></p>
<p> It is also a practice of some States, when ratifying a convention, to issue a 
reservation providing that the treaty shall not apply to acts that occurred before the 
entry into force of the treaty for this State. 
</p>
<p> Equally, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides in its article 
11 &#167; 2: 
</p>
<p><i>&#8220;No one shall be held guilty of any penal offence on account of any act or 
omission which did not constitute a penal offence, under national or 
international law, at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier 
penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the penal 
offence was committed.&#8221; 
</i></p>
<p> Based on the foregoing, the Working Group has decided to issue this general 
comment in the following terms: 
</p>
<p><i>   General comment 
</i></p>
<p>1. Enforced disappearances are prototypical continuous acts. The act begins at 
the time of the abduction and extends for the whole period of time that the crime is 
not complete, that is to say until the State acknowledges the detention or releases 
information pertaining to the fate or whereabouts of the individual. 
</p>
<p>2. Even though the conduct violates several rights, including the right to 
recognition as a person before the law, the right to liberty and security of the person 
and the right not to be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment and also violates or constitutes a grave threat to the right to 
life, the Working Group considers that an enforced disappearance is a unique and 
consolidated act, and not a combination of acts. Even if some aspects of the 
violation may have been completed before the entry into force of the relevant 
national or international instrument, if other parts of the violation are still 
continuing, until such time as the victim&#8217;s fate or whereabouts are established, the 
matter should be heard, and the act should not be fragmented. </p>


<p>3. Thus, when an enforced disappearance began before the entry into force of an 
instrument or before the specific State accepted the jurisdiction of the competent 
body, the fact that the disappearance continues after the entry into force or the 
acceptance of the jurisdiction gives the institution the competence and jurisdiction to 
consider the act of enforced disappearance as a whole, and not only acts or 
omissions imputable to the State that followed the entry into force of the relevant 
legal instrument or the acceptance of the jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group considers, for instance, that when a State is recognized 
as responsible for having committed an enforced disappearance that began before 
the entry into force of the relevant legal instrument and which continued after its 
entry into force, the State should be held responsible for all violations that result 
from the enforced disappearance, and not only for violations that occurred after the 
entry into force of the instrument. 
</p>
<p>5. Similarly, in criminal law, the Working Group is of the opinion that one 
consequence of the continuing character of enforced disappearance is that it is 
possible to convict someone for enforced disappearance on the basis of a legal 
instrument that was enacted after the enforced disappearance began, notwithstanding 
the fundamental principle of non retroactivity. The crime cannot be separated and 
the conviction should cover the enforced disappearance as a whole.  
</p>
<p>6. As far as possible, tribunals and other institutions ought to give effect to 
enforced disappearance as a continuing crime or human right violation for as long as 
all elements of the crime or the violation are not complete.  
</p>
<p>7. Where a statute or rule of procedure seems to negatively affect the 
continuous violation doctrine, the competent body ought to construe such a 
provision as narrowly as possible so that a remedy is provided or persons prosecuted 
for the perpetration of the disappearance.  
</p>
<p>8. In the same spirit, reservations that exclude the competence of such a body 
for acts or omissions that occurred before the entry into force of the relevant legal 
instrument or the acceptance of the institution&#8217;s competence should be interpreted so 
not to create an obstacle to hold a State responsible for an enforced disappearance 
that continues after this.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>   General comment on the right to the truth in relation to enforced disappearance  
</b></p>
<p><i>   Preamble 
</i></p>
<p> &#8220;The right to the truth &#8211; sometimes called the right to know the truth &#8211; in 
relation to human rights violations is now widely recognized in international law. 
This is witnessed by the numerous acknowledgements of its existence as an 
autonomous right at the international level, and through State practice at the national 
level. The right to the truth is applicable not only to enforced disappearances. 
However, this general comment is concerned solely with enforced disappearances in 
the context of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance<b>. 
</b></p>
<p> At the international level, the right to the truth relating to enforced 
disappearances or missing persons is recognized in a number of instruments. Article 
32 of Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions establishes &#8220;the right of families to 
know the fate of their [disappeared] relative&#8221;. Article 24 of the 2006 International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance states: </p>


<p>&#8220;Each victim has the right to know the truth regarding the circumstances of 
the enforced disappearance, the progress and results of the investigation and 
the fate of the disappeared person. Each State Party shall take appropriate 
measures in this regard.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> The existence of the right to the truth as an autonomous right was 
acknowledged by the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances 
(WGEID) in its very first report (E/CN.4/1435, 22 January 1981, &#167; 187). It has also 
been recognized by various other international bodies at the universal and regional 
levels (for relevant case law, see in particular the &#8220;Study on the right to the truth&#8221;, 
report of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
E/CN.4/2006/91, 8 February 2006); by intergovernmental bodies, including the 
Human Rights Commission and now the Human Rights Council (see resolutions 
2005/66 of 20 April 2005 of the Commission; decision 2/105, 27 November 2006; 
resolution 9/11, 18 September 2008; and 12/12, 1 October 2009 of the Council).  
</p>
<p> The existence of the right to the truth in international law is accepted by State 
practice consisting in both jurisprudential precedent and by the establishment of 
various truth seeking mechanisms in the period following serious human rights 
crises, dictatorships or armed conflicts (see the &#8220;Study on the right to the truth&#8221;, op. 
cit.). Those mechanisms include the launching of criminal investigations and the 
creation of &#8220;truth commissions&#8221; designed to shed light on past violations and, 
generally, to facilitate reconciliation between different groups. 
</p>
<p> The right to the truth is both a collective and an individual right. Each victim 
has the right to know the truth about violations that affected him or her, but the truth 
also has to be told at the level of society as a &#8220;vital safeguard against the recurrence 
of violations&#8221;, as stated in Principle 2 of the <i>Set of principles for the protection and 
promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity</i> 
(E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1) 
</p>
<p> Principle 3 of this document specifies that the State has a correlative &#8220;duty to 
preserve memory&#8221;: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;A people&#8217;s knowledge of the history of its oppression is part of its heritage 
and, as such, must be ensured by appropriate measures in fulfilment of the 
State&#8217;s duty to preserve archives and other evidence concerning violations of 
human rights and humanitarian law and to facilitate knowledge of those 
violations. Such measures shall be aimed at preserving the collective memory 
from extinction and, in particular, at guarding against the development of 
revisionist and negationist arguments.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> Principle 4 establishes the &#8220;victim&#8217;s right to know&#8221; as an individual right: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Irrespective of any legal proceedings, victims and their families have the 
imprescriptible right to know the truth about the circumstances in which 
violations took place and, in the event of death or disappearance, the victims&#8217; 
fate.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> The Working Group has often recommended that States adopt measures to 
promote truth, reparations for victims and reconciliation in their societies, as a 
means of implementing the right to the truth and the right to integral reparation for 
victims of enforced disappearances. Based on its experience, the Working Group has 
acknowledged that such processes are often crucial to ensure non-repetition of 
enforced disappearances as well as to clarify cases, by uncovering the truth of the 
fate or the whereabouts of disappeared persons. However, the Working Group has </p>


<p>also underlined that reconciliation between the State and the victims of enforced 
disappearance cannot happen without the clarification of each individual case. 
</p>
<p> The 1992 Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance enumerates a number of obligations that flow from the right to the 
truth. 
</p>
<p> Based on the foregoing, the Working Group has decided to adopt this general 
comment in the following terms: 
</p>
<p><i>   General comment 
</i></p>
<p>1. The right to the truth in relation to enforced disappearances means the right to 
know about the progress and results of an investigation, the fate or the whereabouts 
of the disappeared persons, and the circumstances of the disappearances, and the 
identity of the perpetrator(s). 
</p>
<p>2.  The right to the truth in relation to enforced disappearances should be clearly 
distinguished from the right to information, and in particular the right of the relatives 
or other persons with a legitimate interest, their representatives or their legal 
counsel, to obtain information on a person who is deprived of his liberty. The right 
to information on the person detained, together with the non-derogable right of 
<i>habeas corpus</i>, should be considered central tools to prevent the occurrence of 
enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>3. Article 13 of the Declaration recognizes the obligation of the State to 
investigate cases of enforced disappearances. Paragraph 4 of Article 13 specifies that 
&#8220;the findings of such an investigation shall be made available upon request to all 
interested persons, unless doing so would jeopardize an ongoing criminal 
investigation.&#8221; In light of the developments that happened since 1992, the Working 
Group deems that the restriction in the last part of this paragraph should be 
interpreted narrowly. Indeed, the relatives of the victims should be closely 
associated with an investigation into a case of enforced disappearance. The refusal to 
provide information is a limitation on the right to the truth. Such a limitation must be 
strictly proportionate to the only legitimate aim: to avoid jeopardizing an ongoing 
criminal investigation. A refusal to provide any information, or to communicate with 
the relatives at all, in other words a blanket refusal, is a violation of the right to the 
truth. Providing general information on procedural matters, such<b> </b>as the fact that the 
matter has been given to a judge for examination, is insufficient and should be 
considered a violation of the right to the truth. The State has the obligation to let any 
interested person know the concrete steps taken to clarify the fate and the 
whereabouts of the person. Such information must include the steps taken on the 
basis of the evidence provided by the relatives or other witnesses. While the 
necessities of a criminal investigation may justify restricting the transmission of 
certain information, there must be recourse in the national legislation to review such 
a refusal to provide the information to all interested persons. This review should be 
available at the time of the initial refusal to provide information, and then on a 
regular basis to ensure that the reason for the necessity that was invoked by the 
public authority to refuse to communicate, remains present. 
</p>
<p>4.  Paragraph 6 of Article 13 provides that: &#8220;An investigation, in accordance 
with the procedures described above, should be able to be conducted for as long as 
the fate of the victim of enforced disappearance remains unclarified.&#8221; The obligation 
to continue the investigation for as long as the fate and the whereabouts of the 
disappeared remains unclarified is a consequence of the continuing nature of 
enforced disappearances (see the Working Group&#8217;s general comment on article 17 </p>


<p>and its general comment on enforced disappearance as a continuous human rights 
violation and continuous crime).  
</p>
<p> It also makes it clear that the right of the relatives to know the truth of the 
fate and whereabouts of the disappeared persons is an absolute right, not subject to 
any limitation or derogation. No legitimate aim, or exceptional circumstances, may 
be invoked by the State to restrict this right. This absolute character also results from 
the fact that the enforced disappearance causes &#8220;anguish and sorrow&#8221; (5th 
preambular paragraph of the Declaration) to the family, a suffering that reaches the 
threshold of torture, as it also results from article 1&#167;2 of the same Declaration that 
provides: &#8220;Any act of enforced disappearance (&#8230;) constitutes a violation of the rules 
of international law guaranteeing, (&#8230;) the right not to be subjected to torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&#8221; In this regard, the State 
cannot restrict the right to know the truth about the fate and the whereabouts of the 
disappeared as such restriction only adds to, and prolongs, the continuous torture 
inflicted upon the relatives. 
</p>
<p>5.  The State&#8217;s main obligations under the right to the truth are mainly 
procedural and include: the obligation to investigate until the fate and the 
whereabouts of the person have been clarified; the obligation to have the results of 
these investigations communicated to the interested parties under the conditions 
specified in paragraph 3 of this general comment; the obligation to provide full 
access to archives; and the obligation to provide full protection to witnesses, 
relatives, judges and other participants in any investigation. There is an absolute 
obligation to take all the necessary steps to find the person, but there is no absolute 
obligation of result. Indeed, in certain cases, clarification is difficult or impossible to 
attain, for instance when the body, for various reasons, cannot be found. A person 
may have been summarily executed, but the remains cannot be found because the 
person who buried the body is no longer alive, and nobody else has information on 
the person&#8217;s fate. The State still has an obligation to investigate until it can 
determine by presumption the fate or whereabouts of the person. 
</p>
<p> In its general comment on article 19 (the right to compensation), the Working 
Group made it clear that: &#8220;As a general principle, no victim of enforced 
disappearance shall be presumed dead over the objections of the family.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>6.  The right to know the truth about the fate and the whereabouts includes, 
when the disappeared person is found to be dead, the right of the family to have the 
remains of their loved one returned to them, and to dispose of those remains 
according to their own tradition, religion or culture. The remains of the person 
should be clearly and indisputably identified, including through DNA analysis. The 
State, or any other authority, should not undertake the process of identification of the 
remains, and should not dispose of those remains, without the full participation of 
the family and without fully informing the general public of such measures. States 
ought to take the necessary steps to use forensic expertise and scientific methods of 
identification to the maximum of its available resources, including through 
international assistance and cooperation. 
</p>
<p>7.  The right to know the truth about the fate and the whereabouts also applies to 
the cases of children who were born during their mothers&#8217; enforced disappearances, 
and who were thereafter illegally adopted. Article 20 of the Declaration provides 
that such acts of abduction, as well as the act of altering or suppressing documents 
attesting to their true identity, shall constitute an extremely serious offence, which 
shall be punished as such&#8221;. The same provision also provides that States &#8220;shall 
devote their efforts to the search for and identification of such children and to the 
restitution of the children to their families of origin&#8221;. That is to say that the falsity of </p>


<p>the adoption should be uncovered. Both the families of the disappeared and the child 
have an absolute right to know the truth about the child&#8217;s whereabouts. However, 
paragraph 2 of the same article tries to ensure a balance when it comes to the issue 
of whether the adoption should be revisited. This balance, taking into consideration 
the best interest of the child, does not prejudice the right to know the truth of the 
family of origin or the child&#8217;s whereabouts.  
</p>
<p>8.  The right to know the truth about the circumstances of the disappearance, in 
contrast, is not absolute. State practice indicates that, in some cases, hiding parts of 
the truth has been chosen to facilitate reconciliation. In particular, the issue whether 
the names of the perpetrators should be released as a consequence of the right to 
know the truth is still controversial. It has been argued that it is inappropriate to 
release the names of the perpetrators in processes such as &#8220;truth commissions&#8221;, 
when perpetrators do not benefit from the legal guarantees normally granted to 
persons in criminal processes, in particular the right to be presumed innocent. 
Regardless, under article 14 of the Declaration, the State has an obligation to bring 
any person alleged to have perpetrated an enforced disappearance &#8220;before the 
competent civil authorities of that State for the purpose of prosecution and trial 
unless he has been extradited to another State wishing to exercise jurisdiction in 
accordance with the relevant international agreements in force.&#8221;  
</p>
<p> However, in its general comment on article 18 of the Declaration, the 
Working Group noted that the prohibition of amnesty provided for by article 18 
allowed &#8220;limited and exceptional measures that directly lead to the prevention and 
termination of disappearances, as provided for in article 3 of the Declaration, even 
if, prima facie, these measures could appear to have the effect of an amnesty law or 
similar measure that might result in impunity.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> The Working Group continued: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, in States where systematic or massive violations of human rights 
have occurred as a result of internal armed conflict or political repression, 
legislative measures that could lead to finding the truth and reconciliation 
through pardon might be the only option to terminate or prevent 
disappearances.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> In other words, restrictions on the right to the truth do not affect the right to 
justice of the victims, i.e. the decision not to release the names of the perpetrators in 
a truth process does not prevent a prosecution from occurring. In the meantime, the 
realization of the right to the truth may in exceptional circumstances result in 
limiting the right to justice, within the strict limits contained in paragraphs 6 and 8 
of the Working Group&#8217;s general comment on article 18 and taking account 
paragraph 3-b of the same general comment. The Working Group in particular 
recalls that: &#8220;Pardon should only be granted after a genuine peace process or bona 
fide negotiations with the victims have been carried out, resulting in apologies and 
expressions of regret from the State or the perpetrators, and guarantees to prevent 
disappearances in the future&#8221; (general comment on article 18, &#167; 8-b). In addition, the 
Working Group is of the opinion that no such limitation may occur when the 
enforced disappearance amounts to a crime against humanity (on the definition of 
enforced disappearances as a crime against humanity, see the WGEID&#8217;s general 
comment on this issue). 
</p>
<p>9.  The right to the truth implies that the State has an obligation to give full 
access to information available, allowing the tracing of disappeared persons. 
Paragraph 2 of Article 13 of the Declaration states that the &#8220;competent authority [to 
investigate] shall have the necessary powers and resources to conduct the </p>


<p>investigation effectively, including powers to compel attendance of witnesses and 
production of relevant documents and to make immediate on-site visits&#8221;. This 
authority should also have the power to have full access to the archives of the State. 
After the investigations have been completed, the archives of the said authority 
should be preserved and made fully accessible to the public. 
</p>
<p>10.  Finally, the right to the truth also ensures that the State has an obligation to 
provide the necessary protection and assistance to victims, witnesses and other 
interested persons. The search for truth often provokes perpetrators and others, who 
may attempt to prevent the truth from being discovered by threatening or even 
attacking persons participating in an investigation. Thus, the State has an obligation 
to provide for effective protection of interested parties. Paragraph 3 of Article 13 is 
very clear when it states that &#8220;[s]teps shall be taken to ensure that all involved in the 
investigation, including the complainant, counsel, witnesses and those conducting 
the investigation, are protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal.&#8221; In 
particular, the State may set up a witness protection programme through an 
independent institution.&#8221;

<p>44. The Working Group transmitted 11 newly reported cases to the Government. The 
majority concerned persons who allegedly disappeared between 1994 and 1995, in El 
Aouna and Jijel. Most disappearances are attributed to the National Gendarmerie. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Government transmitted five communications dated 14 and 25 May 2010, 8 and 
10 June, and 12 November 2010. The first includes replies to prompt intervention letters 
sent on 29 September 2009 and 5 January 2010. The second includes a reply to a prompt 
intervention letter sent by the Working Group on 19 April 2010. The third concerned 
timelines for the submission of information. In the fourth communication, the Government 
informed the Working Group that the request for additional information and documentation 
by the Working Group on outstanding cases had been forwarded to the authorities in charge 
of the civil registry. In the fifth communication, the Government informed the Working 
Group that it would not be in a position to forward all supporting documents which were 
requested concerning outstanding cases; however, the Government proposed that the 
Working Group could travel to Algiers to consult the above-mentioned documents and 
meet with the families of those allegedly disappeared but found alive. 
</p>
<p><b>  Prompt intervention  
</b></p>
<p>46. On 5 January 2010, the Working Group sent a prompt intervention letter to the 
Government regarding the alleged harassment suffered by relatives of a disappeared person 
to accept a presumption of death certificate.  
</p>
<p>47. On 19 April 2010, the Working Group, together with two other Special Procedures 
mechanisms, sent a second prompt intervention letter to the Government concerning the 
alleged dispersion, by the use of force, of a group of relatives of disappeared people who 
were peacefully demonstrating in front of the Ministry of Justice on 11 April 2010. On 24 
August 2010, the Working Group, together with three other Special Procedures 
mechanisms, sent a new communication to the Government concerning a prohibition 
imposed on mothers of disappeared persons to assemble peacefully on 4, 11 and 18 August 
2010, and the repression suffered by the mothers and others demonstrating on 11 August 
</p><p>2010. 
</p>
<p>48. On 14 May 2010, the Government replied to a prompt intervention letter sent on 29 
September 2009, regarding the alleged harassment of families of victims of enforced 
</p>
<p>  
 2 See para. 51. 
 3 See annex V for the list of names of the newly reported cases of disappeared persons. </p>


<p>disappearances who were allegedly forced to request a presumption of death certificate, 
stating that it considered this communication an urgent appeal and a repetition of vague 
allegations and general accusations from a politically motivated source. Therefore, the 
Government did not deem it appropriate to reply. 
</p>
<p>49. In the same communication, the Government also replied to the prompt intervention 
letter sent on 5 January 2010. It stated that, following receipt of the communication, the 
competent authorities had gathered additional information from the subject of the 
communication, who made a statement to the national gendarmerie reiterating his position 
on refusing compensation and restating his request that an investigation be opened to 
determine the circumstances of the disappeared person or to find incontrovertible evidence 
of his death. In the absence of such evidence, he maintained his refusal to follow any 
judicial procedure to obtain a legal declaration of death. The Government stressed that the 
subject of the communication had at no point stated that he had been the victim of 
harassment or reprisals on the part of any authority. The Government also noted the general 
framework for handling the issue of disappeared persons in Algeria in accordance with the 
Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation adopted by referendum in 2005. It stated that 
the procedure has been accepted by a majority of the families concerned and that families 
are informed of their rights by the competent administrative and judicial authorities. In 
addition, it stated that in full conformity with this approach, the opinions, positions and 
choices expressed by those families who refuse the approach were fully respected. 
</p>
<p>50. On 25 May 2010, the Government replied to the prompt intervention letter sent on 
19 April 2010 stating that, during the morning of 11 April 2010, officers in charge of public 
order dispersed a group of people in front of the Ministry of Justice who were 
demonstrating and thereby creating traffic problems. The majority of those demonstrating 
agreed to leave except for a small group. Contrary to what was alleged, the persons were 
never subjected to ill-treatment by public order agents who, at first, simply invited them to 
disperse and, when they refused, proceeded to disperse them. None has submitted a 
complaint to the authorities and for this reason no investigation has been opened. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>51. On 25 August 2000, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
mission to Algeria. A reminder was sent on 21 October 2010. On 12 November 2010, the 
Government informed the Working Group that it would not be in a position to forward all 
supporting documents which were requested concerning outstanding cases; however, the 
Government proposed that the Working Group could travel to Algiers to consult the above-
mentioned documents and meet with the families of those allegedly disappeared but found 
alive. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>52. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 2,950 cases to the 
Government; of those, 18 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 9 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 2,923 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>53. It is gratifying that after a long period of lack of engagement the Government of 
Algeria continues to be involved in a process of dialogue and cooperation with the Working 
Group.  
</p>
<p>54. The Working Group notes that about 200 cases of its present backlog concern 
Algeria. It will deal with them at its ninety-third session. </p>


<p>55. While welcoming the cooperation with the Government of Algeria, the Working 
Group remains concerned about allegations regarding the prohibition imposed on the 
mothers of disappeared persons to assemble peacefully and the repression they have 
suffered while demonstrating. 
</p>
<p>56. The Working Group notes the observations made in 2007, 2008 and 2009 regarding 
the Government&#8217;s obligations under article 13 of the Declaration to take steps to ensure that 
all involved in the investigations are protected against ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal. 
</p>
<p>57. The Working Group notes that the Government has signed the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and calls upon 
the Government to ratify the Convention and accept the competence of the Committee 
under articles 31 and 32.

taken to an undisclosed place of detention.  
</p>
<p>69. On 12 October 2010, the Government replied to the urgent appeal. It stated that the 
four persons had been arrested in light of the existence of confirmed information, 
investigations and evidence that they were part of a structured terrorism network and that, 
given the nature of their suspected crimes, their arrests were carried out under Law No.

</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>116. The Government transmitted a communication on 4 September 2009, which could 
not be translated in time for inclusion in report A/HRC/13/31 and in this report. During the 
reporting period, the Government transmitted four communications dated 12 and 25 </p>


<p>February, 22 April and 5 July 2010, which could not be translated in time for inclusion in 
the present report. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from sources 
</b></p>
<p>117. Information was received from sources concerning two outstanding cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p>118. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles encountered in the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance. This information was transmitted to the Government on 6 August 2010, 
after the Working Group&#8217;s ninety-first session. 
</p>
<p>119. The source informed the Working Group that, following the July 2009 unrest in 
Urumqi, Xinjiang, hundreds of Uighur young men were reportedly detained on suspicion of 
having participated in the unrest and some of them were also subjected to enforced 
disappearance. 
</p>
<p>120. According to the source, immediately after the July 2009 unrests, Chinese security 
forces allegedly conducted several detentions in two areas of Urumqi with a high Uighur 
population, namely Erdaoqiao and Saimachang, which continued, on a lesser scale, until at 
least mid-August 2009. Reportedly, most of the victims were young Uighur men. It was 
alleged that Uighur people were arrested at their homes, hospitals, places of work and 
streets, questioned about their participation in the July protests and, then taken away in 
trucks. It was further alleged that when some of the families requested information to 
determine the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared people, the relevant law enforcement 
authorities denied the arrests or just sent the families away. 
</p>
<p>121. As a result, according to the source, following the July 2009 unrests and until 18 
August 2009, at least 43 cases of enforced disappearances of Uighur young men were 
documented in the Uighur areas of Urumqi. However, the source alleges that the real 
number of enforced disappearances in these areas might be much higher. It was further 
alleged that some Han Chinese people might also have been subjected to enforced 
disappearance. 
</p>
<p>122. No response was received from the Government regarding this general allegation.  
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding

</i></p>
<p>138. On 13 July 2009, the Government replied to a general allegation, sent by the 
Working Group on 15 May 2009, concerning the approval by the First Commission of the 
Colombian Chamber of Representatives of bill number 044/08, known as the &#8220;Victims 
Law&#8221;, which established measures for reparations and protection of victims of the 
Colombian armed conflict. In its reply, the Government stated that the bill had been shelved 
by the Congress in July 2008 because of the discrepancies between the texts approved by 
each of its chambers and the implications of the approved text for the conciliation that took 
place before the bill was shelved. One of the factors that led to the shelving of the bill was 
that the combined text produced by the two chambers, which was to be considered by the 
Chamber of Representatives, was not financially viable.  
</p>
<p>139. The Government stressed that the reparations included in the law would have been 
solely administrative and in no way would have conflicted with, or restricted a victim&#8217;s 
right to take the perpetrator of the acts to court to obtain redress. 
</p>
<p>140. The Government informed the Working Group that the administrative reparation 
system that would have been established through the bill would have complemented the 
existing reparation provided for by the State for human rights violations, committed either 
by individuals or by the State officials, in order to achieve a full reparation programme.    
</p>
<p>141. The Government also stressed that any legislation adopted in favour of the victims 
must contain provisions that can be implemented, recognizing that victims cannot be 
granted relief by a bill that cannot be put into effect and that it was not logical or respectful </p>


<p>towards the victims to give them false hopes of receiving financial compensation that the 
country cannot offer. 
</p>
<p>142. The Government referred to several measures currently undertaken to bring to 
justice those responsible for enforced disappearances, such as the nationwide urgent search 
mechanism; the establishment of technical legal committees; better investigative strategies; 
the provision of support for the families of victims; the request to prosecutors who refuse to 
reopen cases of disappearances to provide a statement justifying the grounds for the refusal; 
and the creation of Prosecution Services for Humanitarian Affairs.  
</p>
<p>143. On 22 September 2009, the Government replied to a General Allegation sent by the 
Working Group on 22 July 2009, concerning the alleged impossibility of verifying whether 
there are bodies buried on the farm &#8220;La Alemania&#8221;, in Sucre, known to contain the graves 
of peasant farmers allegedly murdered in 1997 by paramilitaries, and, if there are, to 
identify them. The Government informed the Working Group that the National Prosecution 
Service of the Office of the Attorney-General is currently running an investigation through 
the Office of Special Prosecutor No. 2 in Santiago. The punishable offences being 
investigated under this file include conspiracy, enforced displacement, interruption of 
possession and threats. The Government informed the Working Group that an individual 
has been arrested and is being prosecuted in connection to this case and that a final 
judgment is awaited.  
</p>
<p>144. The Government also stated that the National Justice and Peace Unit of the Office of 
the Attorney-General sent a judicial police team to the farm &#8220;La Alemania&#8221; on 18 
September 2009 to investigate the alleged events, and that results of these investigations 
will be provided by the Government at a future date.  
</p>
<p>145. In reference to the disposal of the remains of the unidentified individuals, the 
Government informed the Working Group of its adopted procedure in this regard. 
Unidentified individual remains are received by an office of the National Institute of Legal 
Medicine and Forensic Sciences, where they are examined for evidence and information on 
identification, physical, morphological, genetic and biometric properties. This information 
becomes part of the autopsy documentation which is afterwards entered into the Missing 
Persons and Corpses Network Information System (SIRDEC). This database allows 
officials of the National Institute of Legal Medicine to cross-reference and correlate 
information on cases on a national level. The remains are thereafter buried in a tomb or 
grave provided by the local authorities in public cemeteries, together with metal 
identification tags. The cemetery administration is required to provide information on the 
exact location of the remains and is responsible for marking the grave and ensuring 
reasonable upkeep. 
</p>
<p>146. The Government made reference to its institutional protection facilities for persons 
exposed to human rights violations, including the cases of enforced disappearance. Victims 
and witnesses are subject to certain requirements regarding their status, which is 
investigated by the Office of the Attorney-General, upon the notification of the police chief 
of the area. Persons at risk involved in proceedings have the option of personal protection 
under the auspices of various protection programmes, which are conducted by the Ministry 
of Interior and Justice.   
</p>
<p>147. The Government also informed the Working Group of the progress made in relation 
to the prevention and the investigation of enforced disappearance, noting the launch of the 
National Register of Missing Persons and Unidentified Corpses, the National Plan for the 
Search for Missing Persons and the regulation and support of the Emergency Search 
Mechanism, by the Commission on the Search for Missing Persons (CBPD), in addition to 
the already established Single Virtual Identification Centre (CUVI). Moreover, it is noted 
that the National Register of Missing Persons (RND) is used for storing all data relating to </p>


<p>the identification of missing persons and to the burial and exhumation of unidentified 
bodies, and that it is used by various entities involved in search, investigation and 
identification procedures.

The first communication included information on the activities undertaken in follow-up to 
the recommendations made by the Working Group following its visit to the country in 
</p><p>2006.  
</p>
<p>203. In the second communication, the Government of Guatemala stated its difficulties in 
informing the Working Group on the 2,899 outstanding cases that occurred during the 
period of the 36-year internal armed conflict. It reaffirmed that establishing the 
whereabouts or fate of disappeared persons and redressing the wrongs done to the victims </p>


<p>and their families are two specific aims of the transitional justice system. A further aim is to 
use the administration of justice to punish those responsible for the disappearances. The 
State has launched numerous initiatives to this end, some of them supported by civil society 
human rights organizations. Investigating all the human rights violations that occurred 
during the internal armed conflict is a complex task that requires time, perseverance and 
unflagging political will. It should not be forgotten that a large number &#8212; hundreds if not 
thousands &#8212; of Government officials agents who initiated, supported or tolerated those 
human rights violations continue to work in the State&#8217;s administrative bodies, including the 
security forces. It further informed the Working Group on the activities of the Guatemalan 
Forensic Anthropology Foundation and of the Guatemalan Commission for the Promotion 
of International Humanitarian Law. It also noted the progress in the declassification of the 
Military Archive.

</p>
<p><b>  Prompt intervention  
</b></p>
<p>231. On 29 July 2010, the Working Group, jointly with three other special procedures 
mechanisms, sent a prompt intervention letter to the Government regarding the arrests and 
detentions of Mr. <b>Ghulam Nabi Shaheen</b> and Mr. <b>Mian Abdul Qayoom</b> reportedly based 
on, inter alia, their work on alleged human rights violations including enforced 
disappearances in Kashmir.  
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Reply from the Government 
</i></p>
<p>232. On 28 December 2009, the Government replied to a general allegation sent on 22 
July 2009 (A/HRC/13/31, paras. 267-268) concerning the alleged failure by the 
Government of India to address instances of enforced disappearances in the region of 
Kashmir, stating that it has examined the communication and found the allegation 
contained therein to be inaccurate. 
</p>
<p>233. The Government further indicated that despite continuing cross-border terrorism in 
which hundreds of innocent people in Jammu and Kashmir have been killed and maimed, 
and despite continuing provocations, the security forces continue to exercise their utmost 
restraint because of the Government&#8217;s emphasis on human rights protection and the adverse 
impact that human rights violations by security forces can have on the work being done by 
them in countering terrorism in the State. The Government noted that, at the administrative 
level, there are institutional mechanisms at the national and State levels to safeguard the 
fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution as well as statutory bodies at various levels 
to address allegations of human rights violations. In addition, the Government stated that 
there are extensive sensitization programmes for the security forces deployed in the State 
and that it has a memorandum of understanding with the International Committee of the 
Red Cross to visit detainees arrested in connection with terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. 
The Government further stated that, at the judicial level, the independent judiciary acts as a 
check on the Executive Power and has the power to order investigations. As an indicator of 
the Government&#8217;s commitment to human rights and its measures to check cases of 
delinquency and dereliction of duty, 220 police, army and special forces personnel have 
been punished to date. 
</p>
<p>234. The Government also noted that a large number of disappearances have been 
perpetrated by terrorists who have, while masquerading as security personnel, abducted 
individuals to settle personal scores or force them to join their ranks. The latter are often </p>


<p>across the border for training and later either die in terrorist acts or are never heard of again. 
However, whenever there is prima facie information about individuals having disappeared 
involuntarily after being picked up by security forces, a case is duly registered and an 
inquiry is ordered. To date, 110 incidents of involuntary disappearances have been noted 
and 98 of these have been registered at different police stations. Investigations in many of 
these cases have been completed and charge sheets filed against erring police-special forces 
personnel.  
</p>
<p>235. The Government also expressed reservations at the manner in which the Working 
Group prejudged the allegation by deeming the sources as credible before sending the 
allegation to the Government.  
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>236. On 16 August 2010, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
mission to the country. On 18 August 2010, the Government acknowledged receipt of the 
request but a reply has not been received. 
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>237. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted 431 cases to the 
Government; of those, 11 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by 
the source, 52 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the 
Government, and 368 remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>238. The Working Group would like to thank the Government of India for the several 
communications transmitted and looks forward to also receiving a reply to the general 
allegation sent by the Working Group on 16 January 2009, concerning legal provisions in 
India that may hamper the right to a prompt and effective remedy. 
</p>
<p>239. The Working Group would like to stress that it does not prejudge the information it 
receives. According to its methods of work (para. 28), the Working Group transmits 
allegations received from credible sources concerning obstacles encountered in the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearances to Governments concerned so that they can comment on them within 60 
days from the date when the letter was sent. 
</p>
<p>240. The Working Group notes that the Government has signed the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and calls upon 
the Government to ratify it and accept the competence of the Committee under articles 31 
and 32.

</b>241. All outstanding cases were retransmitted and, regrettably, no response was received 
from the Government. A summary of the situation in the country appears in document 
A/HRC/4/41. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>242. ON 5 March 2010 the Government transmitted a communication dated 4 May 2009, 
which was not recorded in report A/HRC/13/31, replying to a general allegation sent in 
2009 and regarding the investigations on Mr. Munir Said Thalib&#8217;s murder. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p>243. On 5 March 2010, a communication dated 4 May 2009 was received from the 
Government providing further clarification on the general allegation concerning Mr. <b>Munir 
Said Thalib</b> (A/HRC/13/31, paras. 275-278). 
</p>
<p>244. The Government states that the President established groups mandated to investigate 
exclusively this case, report to him and issue a public report. The findings of these 
investigations have been presented to several Special Rapporteurs and to the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Government believes that the circumstances 
surrounding the death were dealt with in a thorough and impartial manner by the authorities 
mandated to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators.  
</p>
<p>245. The Government reaffirmed that Munir Sahid Thalib was not travelling to Geneva to 
participate in the Intersessional Working Group on the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance but that he was en route to the 
Netherlands, via Singapore. His death does not fall under the mandate of enforced 
disappearances although it is recognized that he was an activist on this issue and the 
President of the Asian Federation Against Involuntary Disappearance. 
</p>
<p>246. The Government informed the Working Group that under civil remedies Mr. Munir 
Said Thalib&#8217;s wife received an indemnity and that it is not aware of any incidents of 
intimidation or reprisal against the victim&#8217;s family. If these acts were to be reported, they 
would be investigated and the perpetrators prosecuted accordingly as impunity is not 
tolerated in the country.  
</p>
<p>247. It further informed the Working Group that in August 2008, Mr. Muchdi 
Purwopranjono, the former deputy head of the National Intelligence Agency (BIN), was 
arrested for his involvement in the murder, and was tried and sentenced to 15 years&#8217; 
imprisonment. He was however acquitted by the South Jakarta District Court on 31 
December 2008. </p>


<p>248. This decision was not considered in many quarters to be an encouraging 
development in the efforts to resolve the case. It must nevertheless be understood that the 
legal and decision-making procedures of the Judiciary are exempt from interference by the 
Executive branch of Government.  
</p>
<p>249. The Government informed the Working Group that, according to the legal process in 
Indonesia, individuals can contest a court decision and appeal by submitting a cassation to 
the Supreme Court that will decide on matters of law, including the issue of whether the 
lower courts have properly applied the law to the case being adjudicated. This is in line 
with the principle of &#8220;ne bis in idem&#8221; which states that no legal action can be instituted 
twice for the same cause of action which is also provided in Article 14 (7) of the ICCPR. In 
this case, as there was no such request made, there was no re-investigation into the case. In 
this regard, the Attorney-General, on behalf of the Government, was tasked to reassess this 
ruling by issuing a memorandum of cassation addressed to the Supreme Court which was 
done on 16 January 2009. The Supreme Court process takes a significant amount of time 
before a final and binding decision is issued.  
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>250. On 12 December 2006, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
mission to Indonesia. The Government responded that it would not be possible to receive 
the Working Group during 2007 and that greater benefit would be derived from a visit at a 
later date. A reminder letter was sent on 16 August 2010; the Government has not yet 
responded. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>251. The Working Group reminds the Government of its mandate to draw the attention of 
Governments and non-governmental organizations to different aspects of the Declaration 
and to recommend ways of overcoming obstacles to the realization of its provisions. 
</p>
<p>252. The Working Group considers that the right to obtain redress (art. 19) cannot be 
satisfied unless judicial decisions are properly implemented. In this sense it recalls that 
effective decisions constitute an instrument through which States comply with their 
obligation under the Declaration, &quot;to contribute by all means to the prevention and 
eradication of enforced disappearance&quot; (art. 2). The Working Group further recalls that 
enforced disappearances render their perpetrators and the State or State authorities which 
organize, acquiesce in or tolerate such disappearances liable under civil law, without 
prejudice to the international responsibility of the State concerned (art. 5). 
</p>
<p>253. The Working Group reminds the Government of its request for a visit; it would 
appreciate receiving proposed dates as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>254. The Working Group notes that the Government has signed the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and calls upon 
the Government to ratify it and accept the competence of the Committee under articles 31 
and 32.

<p><b>  Urgent Appeals 
</b></p>
<p>256. The Working Group sent two communications under its urgent appeal procedure to 
the Government. The first communication was sent on 24 November 2009, jointly with 
another special procedures mechanism, and concerned the disappearance of Mr. <b>Abbas 
Hakimzadeh, </b>allegedly arrested by agents from the Ministry of Intelligence on 19 
November 2009. The second communication was sent on 27 January 2010, jointly with four 
other special procedures mechanisms, and concerned the disappearances of Mr. <b>Behrang 
Tonekaboni</b>, Mr. <b>Kaycan Farzin</b>, Mr. <b>Azad Lotpoury</b> and Ms. <b>Lily Farhadpour</b>, 
allegedly arrested between 5 and 14 January 2010. It was alleged that these arrests were 
related to the ongoing protests against the Government. 
</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>257. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran agreed to a visit by the Working 
Group in 2004, which was delayed at the request of the Government. Reminder letters were 
sent on 20 July 2009 and 16 August 2010, asking the Government to set a date for the 
proposed visit. The Government has not yet set a new date for the visit despite the fact that 
six years have elapsed.

Mansoura district, Baghdad.   
</p>
<p><b>  Urgent Appeals 
</b></p>
<p>261. On 11 May 2010, the Working Group, jointly with three other special procedures 
mechanisms, sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the alleged arrest of a

transfer and abusive treatment in a secret detention facility near Baghdad.  According to the 
information received, while 431 of these persons were reportedly found at the Al Rusafa 
detention center, the fate and whereabouts of around 200 remain unknown. 
</p>
<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>262. The Government of Iraq transmitted two communications to the Working Group,

<p><b>  Information from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>347. The Government transmitted one communication to the Working Group dated 26 
October 2010. In this communication, the Government replied to the General Allegation 
sent by the Working Group on 6 August 2010, as reported below. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegation 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Summary of the general allegation  
</i></p>
<p>348. Information was submitted by sources concerning obstacles encountered in the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance. This information was transmitted to the Government on 6 August 2010, 
after the Working Group&#8217;s ninety-first session. 
</p>
<p>349. It was reported that impunity continues for the case of enforced disappearance, rape, 
torture and killing of fifteen-year-old student Maina Sunuwar in February 2004, by 
members of the then Royal Nepalese Army. It was alleged that those responsible for these 
crimes were (then Lt. Colonel) Colonel Bobby Khatri, Captain Sunil Adhikari, Captain 
Amit Pun and (then Captain) Major Niranjan Basnet.  
</p>
<p>350. It was also reported that, following the recommendation of a military court of 
inquiry, Colonel Bobby Khatri, Captain Sunil Adhikari and Captain Amit Pun were brought 
to trial before a court martial.  On 8 September 2005, the court martial reportedly found 
these three officers guilty of negligence for not having observed proper procedures and 
sentenced them to six months&#8217; detention, imposed a total fine of 100,000 rupees and 
declared them ineligible for promotion for one or two years. Allegedly, the three officers 
were immediately released following the court martial decision because of the time they 
had already been confined to military barracks while awaiting trial. However, they were 
eventually promoted. 
</p>
<p>351. The source further indicated that the family of Ms. Maina Sunuwar challenged the 
decision of the court martial and pursued the case in civil court, accusing also Major 
Niranjan Basnet. Following a decision of the Supreme Court, a case was filed before the 
District Court of Kavre which, in January 2008, issued arrest warrants for the four army 
officers. Furthermore, in September 2009, the District Court reportedly ordered the 
Nepalese Army to submit the files containing the statements of the people interviewed by 
the Military Court of Inquiry. It was alleged that, to date, these warrants had not been 
executed nor the statements submitted to the District Court of Kavre. Despite the warrants, 
Major Basnet was sent to Chad on a United Nations peacekeeping mission. However, he 
was repatriated by the United Nations after his involvement in the case of Ms. Maina 
Sunuwar was revealed. The source indicated that, upon his arrival in Nepal on 12 
December 2009, Major Basnet was arrested by the military police and, although he was due 
in court the following day, he was taken to his house where he still remains under house 
arrest. It is alleged that the case in the civil court is being delayed due to the fact that the 
Nepalese Army refused to hand over any of the four officers and submit the files containing 
the statements of the people interviewed by the Military Court of Inquiry as requested.  </p>


<p>352. It was further alleged that the Government promoted to second-in-command of the 
Nepal Army General Toran Bahdur Singh, who was commander of the 10th Brigade, whose 
officers were responsible for at least 49 cases of enforced disappearance and torture which 
occurred at the then Royal Nepal Army Maharajguni barracks between 2003 and 2004. The 
promotion was granted in the absence of any investigation of the facts and notwithstanding 
that the Supreme Court ordered a stay. It is alleged that the promotion of General Toran 
Bahdur Singh indicates institutionalized impunity and is a direct threat to the families of the 
victims.  
</p>
<p><b>  Reply from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>353. The Government replied to the General Allegation on 26 October 2010. Concerning 
the death of Maina Sunuwar, the Government informed the Working Group that the 
Nepalese Army established an independent high level court of inquiry board to investigate 
the case and that the court decided to punish the perpetrators and compensate the victim. It 
was indicated that the decision has been executed and that the penal sanctions faced by the 
officers that were held accountable were: for Colonel Bobby Khatri: (a) Six months in 
military custody; (b) Ineligible for promotion for 2 years; (c) A fine of Nepalese rupees 
(Nr.) 50,000/- as reparation for the family; and for Capt. Sunil Prasad Adhikari and Capt. 
Amit Pun: (a) Six months in military custody; (b) Ineligible for promotion for 1 year; (c) A 
fine of Nr. 25,000/- as reparation for the family. 
</p>
<p>354. The Government also noted that, to ensure the correct implementation of the 
compensation to the family, it had written to the District Administration Office, Kavre, to 
ensure the receipt of the total compensation amount (Nr. 100,000/); sent a letter from the 
Ministry of Defence (MOD) to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) requesting 
legitimate reimbursement provisions; and, in accordance with the recommendation of the 
National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to pay Nr. 300 000/- in compensation to the 
victim&#8217;s family, the amount was transferred. However, the victim&#8217;s family has not accepted 
the compensation to date. 
</p>
<p>355. Regarding the delay of the submissions of the files containing statements of the 
people interviewed by the Military Court of inquiry to the District Court of Kavre in the 
case of Ms. Maina Sunuwar, the Government responded that, as requested by the District 
Police Office, Kavre, a copy of the Court Martial was submitted to the Office with an 
official letter and that, by order of the Supreme Court, the original verdict of the Court 
Martial was submitted to the Court and remains there. In addition, it stated that a copy of 
the verdict was sent to OHCHR-Nepal; and lastly that, likewise, the statements of the 
people interviewed by the Military Court Martial have already been sent to the District 
Court of Kavre at various times. Regarding the factors that are delaying the handing over of 
Colonel Bobby Khatri, Captain Sunil Adhikari, Captain Amit Pun and Major Niranjan 
Basnet to the District Court of Kavre, the Government responded that the resignations 
submitted by the latter two Captains were approved and officially sanctioned and that Col 
Bobby Khatri&#8217;s terms of service were not extended by the Government. Therefore, they are 
no longer in military service or under military jurisdiction. Concerning the case of Major 
Niranjan Basnet, the Government noted that he was found not to be involved in the death of 
Maina Sunuwar at all and that his patrol was tasked to arrest her, which he performed, and 
then, after he handed over the detainee to his supervisor, he was relieved from his duty.  
</p>
<p>356. In relation to the allegations concerning the then Major General Toran Jung Bahadur 
Singh&#8217;s knowledge of the actions by the Tenth Brigade, the Government responded that of 
all the investigations separately carried out by three high-level task forces, none had 
outlined the credibility of the allegations against him, or made any allegations against him 
for any violation of human rights. In addition, the Government indicated that, after the 
submission of the Ministry of Defence&#8217;s report to the Parliamentary Human Rights </p>


<p>Committee, it was clear that the allegations did not support the admissibility of credible 
evidence against the aforementioned person and thus he was considered for, and 
subsequently promoted to, the rank of Major General. The Government also noted that no 
case was filed against this person in any court of Nepal in connection with his so-called 
involvement in the case of the 49 alleged disappeared persons and that, in the absence of 
credible evidence, the Nepalese Army (NA) recommended the then Major General for 
promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General. The Government further stated that when &#8220;the 
allegation against the NA itself is unproven and contradictory, it would be against the 
principle of natural justice to withhold the promotion of a person until proven guilty.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>357. Regarding the cases of enforced disappearances reportedly perpetrated at the then 
Royal Nepal Army Maharajgunj barracks between 2003 and 2004, the Government 
indicated that, in light of the information from national and international human rights 
organizations, as well as media sources, a high-level task force was formed on 19 June 
2005 to investigate the allegations of the whereabouts of the missing persons within the 
Katmandu valley. As a separate list on the case of the 49 persons allegedly disappeared at 
Maharajgunj barracks was not available at the time, the task force carried out an inclusive 
investigation.  The Government further noted that a second high-level task force was 
formed on 27 January 2006, to investigate additional cases of alleged disappearances within 
the Katmandu valley. The separate list of the 49 cases was not available for this 
investigation either; however, the media, special rapporteurs and human rights 
organizations had suspicions about a large number of people detained at the Maharajgunj 
Barracks. The first and second task forces submitted their findings to the Baman 
Committee, which was established by the Government on 1 June 2006 to investigate the 
whereabouts of the missing persons. Subsequently, the Government formed the Malego 
Committee to investigate the whereabouts of those allegedly disappeared by the State. 
Further to the OHCHR 2006 Report of Investigation into arbitrary detention, torture and 
disappearances at Maharajgunj Nepal Army Barracks in 2003-2004, the Ministry of 
Defence was ordered to form a high-level Task Force to investigate the alleged cases and 
accordingly this was set up. The Government stipulated that in order to fulfil a thorough 
investigation procedure, the Task Force made repeated requests to the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights in Nepal for the acquisition of relevant information on the 
allegedly missing 49 persons and regretted that it had made no efforts to furnish any 
information on the subject.  The Task Force submitted findings about the whereabouts of 12 
missing persons to the Ministry of Defence on 31 October 2006.  Subsequently, the 
Government indicated that the Task Force recommended the establishment of a Truth 
Commission as a more suitable and practical approach to investigate further into the alleged 
disappearances. The findings of the Task Force were presented to the Foreign Affairs and 
Human Rights Committee of the Parliament on 16 October 2006.  
</p>
<p>358. At the request of NHRC, the NA assisted in the exhumation of the suspicious 
remains recovered in the jungles of Shivapuri on 19 December 2007. The NHRC report of 
December 2008 concluded that the forensic evidence produced by national/international 
forensic experts had no relevance to the allegations on the disappearance of 49 persons at 
Maharajgunj Barracks. The Government noted that similar cooperation was extended to the 
team led by NHRC with the support of OHCHR in the exhumation in the Dhanusha District 
at the suspected burial site of some students. Moreover, as stipulated in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 21 November 2006, a high-level Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission was agreed on. In this regard, the Government of Nepal tabled a bill in the 
Parliament. Concerning a National Disappearance Committee, the Supreme Court of Nepal 
has already submitted a bill to the Parliament to form such a body and it is under 
consideration. The Government also noted that the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction

</b></p>
<p>397. The Government transmitted one communication to the Working Group, dated 24 
February 2010 replying to a general allegation sent on 15 May 2009, concerning the alleged 
involvement of the Government of Romania in a practice of renditions and secret detention 
(A/HRC/13/31). 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Reply from the Government 
</i></p>
<p>398. On 24 February 2010, the Government of Romania replied to the general allegation 
reiterating that it had no information on Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) secret detention 
centres existing on Romanian territory or that the Romanian airports had been used by the 
CIA for the transport or detention of suspected terrorists. It stated that there is no proof of 
cases in which individuals or foreign intelligence personnel have been involved, on 
Romanian territory, in actions involving the deprivation of liberty or illegal transport of 
detainees. 
</p>
<p>399. The Government noted that it had already replied to the allegations following the 
investigation initiated by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, in accordance 
with Article 52 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>400. Verifications by the Romanian authorities showed that a number of aircraft that 
proved to have been rented by the CIA had made stopovers at Romanian airports. The 
national investigations concluded that the stopovers were merely for technical purposes and 
there was no proof that detainees were on board the aircraft. 
</p>
<p>401. Regarding the guarantee of an effective judicial remedy to people deprived of their 
liberty, the Government replied that those provisions are included in the Romanian 
Constitution (arts. 21, 23 and 52) as well as in the Criminal Procedure Code (art. 5). </p>


<p>According to those articles no person can be retained, arrested or deprived of liberty or 
submitted to any form of restraint of his/her individual freedom except according to the 
cases and conditions stipulated by the law; if a person subject to confinement measures, to a 
decision of hospitalization or any other measure aimed at restraining the individual freedom 
considers that the measure is illegal, he/she has the right, during the entire proceedings of 
the criminal trial, to address the competent instance, according to the law; any person, who 
during a criminal trial, has been illegally or unjustly deprived of his/her freedom or whose 
freedom has been restrained, has the right to effective remedy, as stipulated by the law. 
</p>
<p>402. Any person who was deprived of liberty, during or following a criminal trial, or 
whose liberty was restrained, illegally or unjustly, is entitled to reparation of the damages, 
under the conditions stipulated by the law. The victim may decide to request financial 
compensation and medical or social assistance borne by the State. The civil cause may 
develop in parallel with the criminal trial.  
</p>
<p>403. Regarding the access to detention places by public authorities, the Government 
stated that, according to national legislation pre-trial detention during the criminal 
procedure is under the authority of the Ministry of Administration and Interior (MAI), 
while during the proceedings before the court and after a final decision has been established 
by the court, the detainees are in the custody of the National Administration of 
Penitentiaries, under the authority of the Ministry of Justice and Freedoms (MJLC).    
</p>
<p><b>  Observations  
</b></p>
<p>404. The Working Group notes that the Government has signed the International

</b></p>
<p>432. The Government transmitted six communications dated 10 and 11 February, 19 and 
25 May, 3 June and 28 October 2010.  </p>


<p>433. The first and the second communications concerned one outstanding case. The 
information included was considered insufficient to clarify it. In the third communication, 
the Government recalled its previous communications on all outstanding cases.  
</p>
<p>434. The fourth communication concerned three outstanding cases; the information 
included was considered insufficient to clarify them. In the same communication, the 
Government provided information on the actions taken by the Government in connection 
with the disappearances that occurred in Spain during and after the civil war. In particular, 
the Government referred to the measures that have been taken to implement Act 52/2007, 
whereby rights are recognized and enhanced and measures are introduced on behalf of 
those who suffered persecution or violence during the civil war, including, inter alia, the 
establishment of the Office for Victims of the Civil War and the Dictatorship. 
</p>
<p>435. The fifth communication concerned all outstanding cases. Following this 
information, the Working Group decided, at its ninety-second session, to apply the six-
month rule on one case. For the other cases, the information was considered insufficient to 
clarify them. 
</p>
<p>436. With the sixth communication, the Government retransmitted documentation 
concerning one outstanding case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Press Release 
</b></p>
<p>437. On 25 May 2010, the Working Group issued a press release in which it noted with 
concern the suspension of Judge Baltasar Garz&#243;n by the General Council of the Judiciary7.  
</p>
<p><b>  Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>438. Since its establishment, the Working Group has transmitted four cases to the 
Government; all remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations   
</b></p>
<p>439. The Working Group recalls its general comment on Enforced Disappearance as a 
Continuous Crime, according to which &#8220;Enforced disappearances are prototypical 
continuous acts. The act begins at the time of the abduction and extends for the whole 
period of time that the crime is not complete, that is to say until the State acknowledges the 
detention or releases information pertaining to the fate or whereabouts of the individual.&#8221; 
The general comment also notes that: &#8220;As far as possible, tribunals and other institutions 
ought to give effect to enforced disappearance as a continuing crime or human right 
violation for as long as all elements of the crime or the violation are not complete.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>440. The Working Group congratulates the Government for ratifying the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. It calls upon 
the Government to accept the competence of the Committee under articles 31 and 32.

</p>
<p>  
 8 Two cases were found to be duplicated cases and were therefore deleted. </p>

</p>
<p><b>  Request for a visit 
</b></p>
<p>447. On 16 October 2006, the Working Group requested an invitation to undertake a 
mission from the Government of Sri Lanka. The Government replied that it would not be 
possible to schedule a visit on the proposed dates, and that the interest of the Working 
Group would be given due consideration. Reminder letters were sent on 20 July 2009 and 
16 August 2010. No reply from the Government has been received to date. 
</p>

Somchai Neelapaijit, reportedly missing since 11 March 2004, and of his wife, Mrs. 
Angkhana Neelpaijit, on 7 and 9 June 2009 respectively.  In this respect, the Government 
reported that both incidents were promptly investigated by police officers and found to be 
cases of theft committed by a person who was subsequently arrested in late June 2009. The 
Government reported that this person, confessed to having stolen property from the cars on 
the above-mentioned dates and expressed that he did not have the intention of intimidating 
Mrs. Neelapaijit or her family. Therefore the Government concluded that the outcome made 
clear that the incidents did not represent a threat to Mrs. Neelapaijit or her family. </p>


<p>486. In the second communication, the Government replied to the prompt intervention 
letters sent on 19 February and 31 March 2009, which concerned the intimidation suffered 
by a human rights organization due to its activities related to the investigation of enforced 
disappearances. In this communication, the Government reaffirmed that the search of the 
office of the organization was carried out in strict accordance with the law and respect for 
human rights, in a non-discriminatory manner, as a preventive measure to ensure peace and 
security of life and property of the local population in the area. It also reported that there 
was no intention of intimidating any member of the human rights organization. In addition, 
the Government informed the Working Group about the visits of military officers to the 
organization&#8217;s office, including the visit carried out on 29 March 2009 by officials of 
Special Task Force 23, which was made to introduce themselves, enhance relationships,

Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and accept the 
competence of the Committee under articles 31 and 32.

<p>556. All outstanding cases were retransmitted and regrettably no response was received

</p>
<p><b>  Urgent Appeals 
</b></p>
<p>557. On 14 May 2010, the Working Group sent an urgent appeal, jointly with three other 
special procedures mechanisms, concerning Mr. <b>Mohanad Salahat, </b>allegedly arrested by 
Palestinian Intelligence agents after he presented himself at the Intelligence Department in 
Nablus on 1 May 2010. No response was received from the Palestinian Authority. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>558. <b>In 2010, the Working Group transmitted 105 newly reported cases of 
disappearance to 22 Governments, 53 of which allegedly occurred during the 
reporting period. The Working Group used the urgent action procedure in 50 of these 
cases, which allegedly occurred within the three months preceding the receipt of the 
report by the Working Group. During the reporting period, the Working Group was 
able to clarify 70 cases of enforced disappearance.  
</b></p>
<p>559. <b>Tens of thousands of cases on the books of the Working Group still remain 
unclarified, many going back decades. In the 30th year since the establishment of the 
Working Group, much more needs to be done to ensure that the fate or whereabouts 
of the persons who have disappeared are resolved.  
</b></p>
<p>560. <b>In spite of the fact that over 50,000 cases of enforced disappearances have been 
registered with the Working group, underreporting remains a major problem. It 
occurs for various reasons, including poverty, illiteracy, fear of reprisals, weak 
administration of justice, ineffectual reporting channels, institutionalized systems of 
impunity, a practice of silence and restrictions on the work of civil society. Much more 
needs to be done to facilitate the reporting of cases to the Working Group and 
assistance should be provided to family members and members of civil society to do 
so.  
</b></p>
<p>561. <b>The Working Group is grateful for the cooperation received from a number of 
States: it is indispensable for discovering the fate or whereabouts of disappeared 
persons around the globe. Nevertheless, it remains concerned that of the 83 States 
with outstanding cases, some States have never replied to the Working Group&#8217;s 
communications and some States provide responses that do not contain relevant 
information. The Working Group urges those States to fulfil their obligations under 
the Declaration and the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Human Rights 
Council. 
</b></p>
<p>562. <b>The Working Group acknowledges the efforts of States, many human rights 
defenders, non-governmental organizations, lawyers and others who untiringly work 
to know the fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons in very adverse 
circumstances in all parts of the world and reiterates its solidarity with the victims of 
enforced disappearance and their families.  </b></p>


<p>563. <b>The Working Group considers the role of victims&#8217; associations as crucial in the 
process of clarification of the fate and whereabouts of those who have disappeared. 
Therefore, the Working Group urges States to strengthen cooperation with NGOs and 
also provide support for their functioning. 
</b></p>
<p>564. <b>The Working Group calls upon States to take specific legislative, 
administrative, judicial or other measures, including the establishment of specific 
investigating bodies, to prevent and eradicate enforced disappearances. 
</b></p>
<p>565. <b>The Working Group reminds States that enforced disappearance is a 
continuing offence for as long as the fate or whereabouts of the victim remains 
unclarified. In the general comment that it adopted during the reporting period, the 
Working Group recognized that &#8220;one consequence of the continuing character of 
enforced disappearance is that it is possible to convict someone for enforced 
disappearance on the basis of a legal instrument that was enacted after the enforced 
disappearance began, notwithstanding the fundamental principle of non retroactivity. 
The crime cannot be separated and the conviction should cover the enforced 
disappearance as a whole.&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p>566. <b>States should also take specific measures under their criminal law to define 
enforced disappearances as an autonomous criminal offence and to bring their 
existing legislation in line with the Declaration.  The Working Group remains 
committed to assisting States in ensuring that their legislation and other measures are 
in conformity with the Declaration, by providing their expertise in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>567. <b>States are encouraged to take all possible measures to prevent enforced 
disappearances. These include: accessible and updated registries of detainees at all 
places of detention and confinement; guaranteed access to appropriate information 
and to all such places for relatives as well as lawyers; bringing arrested persons 
promptly before a judicial authority; and strengthening civil society organizations 
that deal with the issue of enforced disappearance. 
</b></p>
<p>568. <b>The Working Group reminds States of their obligations under the Declaration 
to ensure that cases of enforced disappearance are promptly investigated and persons 
accused of having committed these violations are arrested and prosecuted. Trials 
should only be carried out in competent civilian courts and punishments should be 
commensurate with the gravity of the crime.  
</b></p>
<p>569. <b>The Working Group also reminds States that they have an obligation to ensure 
that every person having knowledge of, or a legitimate interest in, an enforced 
disappearance has the right to complain to a competent and independent authority to 
have their complaint promptly, thoroughly and impartially investigated.  
</b></p>
<p>570. <b>The Working Group reminds States that, since its first report in 1981, the 
Working Group has acknowledged the right to the truth as an autonomous right. 
During the reporting period, the Working Group issued a general comment on the 
right to the truth in relation to enforced disappearance, in line with the Declaration 
(art. 13). 
</b></p>
<p>571. <b>The right to the truth is both an individual and a collective right: each victim 
has the right to know the truth about violations that have affected him or her, but the 
truth also has to be told at the level of society to ensure against the recurrence of such 
violations.  
</b></p>
<p>572. <b>The Working Group would like to emphasize that the right to the truth about 
the fate and the whereabouts includes, when the disappeared person is found to be 
dead, the right of the family to have the remains of their loved one returned to them. 
The remains of the person should be clearly and indisputably identified, including </b></p>


<p><b>through DNA analysis. States should take the necessary steps to use forensic expertise 
and scientific methods of identification to the maximum of its available resources, 
including through international assistance and cooperation. 
</b></p>
<p>573. <b>The Working Group reminds States of article 18 of the Declaration, as well as 
of its general comment thereon, according to which persons who have or who are 
alleged to have committed acts of enforced disappearance shall not benefit from any 
special amnesty law or similar measures that might have the effect of exempting them 
from any criminal proceedings or sanction.  
</b></p>
<p>574. <b>The Working Group encourages States to apply the most comprehensive 
definition of &#8220;victim&#8221;, with no distinction between direct and indirect victims. Indeed, 
any act of enforced disappearance affects and disrupts many lives, well beyond the 
person who is actually disappeared.  
</b></p>
<p>575. <b>The Working Group notes a pattern of threats, intimidation and reprisals 
against victims of enforced disappearances, including family members, witnesses and 
human rights defenders working on such cases. 
</b></p>
<p>576. <b>The Working Group calls upon States to take specific measures to prevent such 
acts; provide assistance to the victims, including legal assistance, psychological and 
medical support. The Working Group calls on States to punish the perpetrators and 
protect those working on enforced disappearances.  
</b></p>
<p>577. <b>The Working Group recognizes that the victims of acts of enforced 
disappearance and their families shall obtain redress and shall have the right to 
integral reparations, including the means for as complete a rehabilitation as possible, 
and recalls its general comment on article 19 of the Declaration on this matter. In the 
event of the death of the victim as a result of an act of enforced disappearance, their 
dependents shall also be entitled to reparation. Reparations should be integral and 
proportionate to the gravity of the human rights violation and the suffering of the 
disappeared person and his/her family.  
</b></p>
<p>578. <b>The Working Group is encouraged by the initiatives taken by several States to 
make integral reparations for victims of enforced disappearances. For those States 
that have not done so, the Working Group recommends the adoption of legislative and 
other measures to enable victims to claim reparations.  
</b></p>
<p>579. <b>The Working Group notes the importance of reconciliation. This process must 
benefit from the participation of the whole of civil society. The Working Group 
emphasizes that every process of reconciliation needs to be based on the right to the 
truth and cannot be achieved at the expense of the right of victims of enforced 
disappearances to justice and reparation. 
</b></p>
<p>580. <b>The question of disappearance has a special resonance with women. The serious 
economic hardships which usually accompany a disappearance are most often borne 
by them. When women are the victims of disappearance, they become particularly 
vulnerable to sexual and other forms of violence. In addition, it is they who are most 
often at the forefront of the struggle to resolve the disappearances of members of their 
family, making them susceptible to intimidation, persecution and reprisals. 
</b></p>
<p>581. <b>The Working Group notes that children are also victims of disappearances. The 
disappearance of a child, his/her wrongful removal, and the loss of a parent through 
disappearance are serious violations of children's rights.  
</b></p>
<p>582. <b>Country visits are an integral part of the fulfilment of the Working Group&#8217;s 
mandate. They allow the Working Group to highlight country practices in addressing 
enforced disappearances, assist States in reducing obstacles to implementation of the </b></p>


<p><b>Declaration, and ensure access to those family members who might not be able to 
attend the Working Group&#8217;s sessions in Geneva. There are however a number of 
States from which the Working Group has requested invitations to visit and which 
have not been forthcoming. There are others which have informally invited and/or 
confirmed invitations but for which specific dates to visit have not been agreed. The 
Working Group therefore requests all States with pending requests for visits and 
those that have agreed to visits to respond as soon as possible with specific dates. 
</b></p>
<p>583. <b>The Working Group notes that a few States have requested additional 
information with regard to some cases. In this connection, the Working Group would 
like to recall its methods of work, according to which a series of minimum elements 
are required for a case to be admissible. Paragraph 10 of the Working Group&#8217;s 
methods of work states:  &#8220;In order to enable Governments to carry out meaningful 
investigations, the Working Group provides them with information containing at least 
a minimum of basic data. In addition, the WGEID constantly urges the senders of 
reports to furnish as many details as possible concerning the identity of the 
disappeared person and the circumstances of the disappearance&#8221;.  
</b></p>
<p>584. <b>The Working Group notes with satisfaction that, as of 1 December 2010, 87 
States have signed and 21 States have ratified the International Convention for the 
Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance. The Convention, which will 
enter into force on 23 December 2010, will help strengthen the capacities of States to 
reduce the number of disappearances and will bolster the hopes and the demands for 
justice and truth by victims and their families. The Working Group once again calls 
upon Governments that have not signed and/or ratified the Convention to do so as 
soon as possible so that the Convention can enter into force in the near future. It also 
calls upon States, when ratifying the Convention, to accept the competence of the 
Committee to receive individual cases, under article 31, and inter-State complaints 
under article 32 of the Convention. 
</b></p>
<p>585. <b>The Working Group again reminds States that it has insufficient resources to 
effectively exercise its mandate, particularly in relation to human resources, where 
there is an acute need. During the reporting period, the Working Group had two staff 
members supported by the regular budget, which is insufficient given the workload. 
Previously this has been enhanced through additional resources (an extra two or three 
staff members) provided through extrabudgetary funding, but this has been 
unsustainable.  The Working Group would like to be able to provide more assistance 
to States but this requires additional human resources.   
</b></p>
<p>586. <b>The Working Group is gratified that to further combat the practice of enforced 
disappearances in its 30th anniversary year, and at its request, the United Nations is 
taking steps to declare 30 August, the day already commemorated by civil society 
around the world, as International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances. 
</b></p>
<p>587. <b>Noting that 2012 marks the 20th anniversary of the adoption by the General 
Assembly of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearances, the Working Group encourages all States to translate it with no 
distinction between languages and dialects since all serve the purpose of assisting in its 
global dissemination and the ultimate goal of prevention of enforced disappearances.  </b></p>


<p><b>Annex I 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Methods of work of the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances as adopted on 
14 November 2009 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  The mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Legal basis for the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances&#8217; methods of work 
are based on its mandate as stipulated originally in Commission on Human Rights 
resolution 20 (XXXVI) and as developed by the Commission and its successor the Human 
Rights Council in numerous further resolutions. The parameters of its work are laid down in 
the Charter of the United Nations, the International Bill of Human Rights, Economic and 
Social Council resolution 1235 (XLI) and the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons 
from Enforced or Involuntary Disappearance, adopted by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992 (hereinafter referred to as &#8220;the Declaration&#8221;). 
</p>
<p><b>  Humanitarian mandate 
</b></p>
<p>2. The basic mandate of the Working Group (WGEID) is humanitarian in nature, 
aimed at assisting families in determining the fate and whereabouts of their disappeared 
relatives who are placed outside the protection of the law. To this end, the WGEID 
endeavours to establish a channel of communication between the families and the 
Governments concerned, with a view to ensuring that sufficiently documented and clearly 
identified individual cases which families, directly or indirectly, have brought to the 
Group&#8217;s attention are investigated with a view to clarifying the fate or whereabouts of the 
disappeared persons. In transmitting cases of disappearance, the WGEID deals exclusively 
with Governments, basing itself on the principle that Governments must assume 
responsibility for any violation of human rights on their territory. 
</p>
<p><b>  Monitoring mandate 
</b></p>
<p>3. In addition to its original mandate, WGEID has been entrusted by the General 
Assembly, the former Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council with 
various tasks. In particular, WGEID is to monitor States&#8217; compliance with their obligations 
deriving from the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance and to provide to Governments with assistance in its implementation. 
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group reminds the Governments of their obligations not only in the 
context of clarifying individual cases but also that of taking action of a more general nature. 
It draws the attention of Governments and non-governmental organizations to general or 
specific aspects of the Declaration, it recommends ways of overcoming obstacles to the 
realization of the Declaration, it discusses with representatives of Governments and 
nongovernmental organizations how to solve specific problems in the light of the 
Declaration, it assists Governments by carrying out on-the-spot visits, organizing seminars 
and providing similar advisory services. WGEID also makes observations on the 
implementation of the Declaration when the concerned Government has not fulfilled its 
obligations related to the rights to truth, justice and reparation. The WGEID adopts general 
comments whenever it considers that a provision of the Declaration requires further 
clarification or interpretation. </p>


<p><b>  Definition of enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>5. As defined in the preamble of the Declaration, enforced disappearances occur when 
persons are arrested, detained or abducted against their will or otherwise deprived of their 
liberty by officials of different branches or levels of Government or by organized groups or 
private individuals acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or 
acquiescence of the Government, followed by a refusal to disclose the fate or whereabouts 
of the persons concerned or a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of their liberty, which 
places such persons outside the protection of the law. 
</p>
<p><b>  Definition of perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Working Group operates for purposes of its work on the basis that, in 
accordance with the definition contained in the Preamble of the Declaration, enforced 
disappearances are only considered as such when the act in question is perpetrated by State 
actors or by private individuals or organized groups (e.g. paramilitary groups) acting on 
behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or acquiescence of the 
Government. Based on the above, WGEID does not admit cases when they are attributed to 
persons or groups not acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or 
acquiescence of the Government, such as terrorist or insurgent movements fighting the 
Government in its own territory. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Handling of cases 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent procedures 
</b></p>
<p>7. Cases of enforced disappearances that occurred within the three months preceding 
receipt of the report by the Working Group are transmitted to the Minister for Foreign 
Affairs of the country concerned by the most direct and rapid means. Their transmission 
can be authorized by the Chairperson on the basis of a specific delegation of power given to 
him by the Working Group. Cases which occurred prior to the three-month limit, but not 
more than one year before the date of their receipt by the Secretariat, provided that they had 
some connection with a case which occurred within the three-month period, can be 
transmitted between sessions by letter, upon authorization by the Chairperson. WGEID 
notifies sources that an urgent action has been sent to the concerned Government, thus 
helping it to enter into communication with the authorities about the specific case. 
</p>
<p><b>  Standard procedures 
</b></p>
<p>8. Cases of enforced disappearances that are reported after three months are placed 
before WGEID for detailed examination during its sessions. Those which fulfil the 
requirements outlined above are transmitted, upon the Working Group&#8217;s specific 
authorization, to the Governments concerned with the request that they carry out 
investigations in order to clarify the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, and 
inform the Working Group of the results. These cases are communicated by letter from the 
Group&#8217;s Chairperson to the Government concerned through the Permanent Representative 
to the United Nations Office at Geneva. 
</p>
<p>9. Any substantive additional information which the sources submit on an outstanding 
case is placed before the Working Group and, following its approval, transmitted to the 
Government concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>  Admissibility of cases of enforced or involuntary disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>10. Reports of disappearances are considered admissible by the Working Group when 
they originate from the family or friends of the disappeared person. Such reports may, </p>


<p>however, be channelled to WGEID through representatives of the family, Governments, 
intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations and other reliable 
sources. They must be submitted in writing with a clear indication of the identity of the 
sender; if the source is other than a family member, it must have direct consent of the 
family to submit the case on its behalf, and it must also be in a position to follow up with 
the relatives of the disappeared person concerning his or her fate.  
</p>
<p>11. The Working Group does not deal with situations of international armed conflict. 
</p>
<p><b>  Elements for admissibility 
</b></p>
<p>12. In order to enable Governments to carry out meaningful investigations, the Working 
Group provides them with information containing at least a minimum of basic data. In 
addition, WGEID constantly urges the senders of reports to furnish as many details as 
possible concerning the identity of the disappeared person and the circumstances of the 
disappearance. The Working Group requires the following minimum elements: 
</p>
<p>(a)  Full name of the disappeared person and, if possible, age, gender, nationality, 
and occupation or profession; 
</p>
<p>(b) Date of disappearance, i.e. day, month and year of arrest or abduction, or day, 
month and year when the disappeared person was last seen. When the disappeared person 
was last seen in a detention centre, an approximate indication is sufficient (for example, 
March or spring 1990); 
</p>
<p>(c) Place of arrest or abduction, or where the disappeared person was last seen 
(indication of town or village, at least); 
</p>
<p>(d) Parties, acting on behalf of, or with the support, direct or indirect, consent or 
acquiescence of the Government, presumed to have carried out the arrest or abduction or to 
be holding the disappeared person in unacknowledged detention;  
</p>
<p>(e) Steps taken by the family to determine the fate or whereabouts of the 
disappeared person, or at least an indication that efforts to resort to domestic remedies were 
frustrated or have otherwise been inconclusive; 
</p>
<p>(f) A case should be submitted to the Working Group by a reliable source, 
which, if other than a family member, must indicate whether the reported victim&#8217;s family 
has given their direct consent that this case be submitted to WGEID on their behalf.  
</p>
<p>13.  If a case is not admitted, the Working Group sends a response to the source 
indicating that the information received did not fulfil the established requirements, in order 
to permit the source to provide all relevant information.  
</p>
<p><b>  Situations of vulnerability 
</b></p>
<p>14.  With respect to reported cases of disappearances, the Working Group highlights the 
condition of people in situations of vulnerability, including women, children, the elderly, 
persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups.  
</p>
<p><b>  Pregnancy 
</b></p>
<p>15. In the case of the disappearance of a pregnant woman, the child presumed to have 
been born during the mother&#8217;s captivity should be mentioned in the description of the case 
of the mother. The child would be treated as a separate case when witnesses reported that 
the mother had actually given birth to a child during detention. </p>


<p><b>  Cases concerning two or more countries 
</b></p>
<p>16.  Reports on a disappearance indicating that officials from one country are directly 
responsible for or involved in a disappearance in another country, or in cases where 
officials from more than one country were directly responsible for or involved in the 
disappearance would be communicated to all Governments concerned. However, the case 
would only be counted in the statistics of the country in which the person was reportedly 
arrested, detained, abducted or last seen. The same principles are applied with respect to the 
transmission of urgent appeals, general allegations and prompt interventions. 
</p>
<p><b>  Outstanding cases 
</b></p>
<p>17.  The WGEID considers cases as outstanding for as long as they have not been 
clarified, closed or discontinued in accordance with the methods of work. This principle is 
not affected by changes of Government in a given country nor in the event of State 
succession. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reminders 
</b></p>
<p>18.  The WGEID reminds every Government concerned once a year of the cases which 
have not yet been clarified and three times a year of all urgent action cases transmitted 
since the previous session. On request, the WGEID provides to the Government concerned 
or the source, to the extent possible, updated information on specific cases.  
</p>
<p><b>  Government replies  
</b></p>
<p>19.  All replies received from Governments concerning reports of disappearances are 
examined by the WGEID and summarized in the Group&#8217;s annual report to the Human 
Rights Council. Any information given on specific cases is forwarded to the sources of 
those reports, who are invited to make observations thereon or to provide additional details 
on the cases. 
</p>
<p><b>  The six-month rule 
</b></p>
<p>20.  Any reply of the Government containing detailed information on the fate or 
whereabouts of the disappeared person is transmitted to the source. If the source does not 
respond within six months of the date on which the Government&#8217;s reply was communicated 
to it, or if it contests the Government&#8217;s information on grounds which are considered 
unreasonable by the WGEID, the case is considered clarified and is accordingly listed 
under the heading &#8220;Cases clarified by the Government&#8217;s response&#8221; in the statistical 
summary of the annual report. If the source contests the Government&#8217;s information on 
reasonable grounds, the Government is so informed and invited to comment. 
</p>
<p><b>  Clarification 
</b></p>
<p>21.  Clarification occurs when the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared persons are 
clearly established as a result of investigations by the Government, inquiries by 
nongovernmental organizations, fact-finding missions by the WGEID or by human rights 
personnel from the United Nations or from any other international organization operating in 
the field, or by the search of the family, irrespective of whether the person is alive or dead. 
</p>
<p><b>  Closed cases 
</b></p>
<p>22.  The Working Group may decide to stop pursuing a case when the competent 
authority specified in the relevant national law issues a declaration of absence as a result of 
enforced disappearance or, alternatively, a declaration of presumption of death, and the 
relatives or other interested parties have manifested, freely and indisputably, their desire not </p>


<p>to pursue the case any further. These conditions should at all times respect the right to 
integral reparation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Discontinuation of cases 
</b></p>
<p>23.  In exceptional circumstances, the WGEID may decide to discontinue the 
consideration of cases where the families have manifested, freely and indisputably, their 
desire not to pursue the case any further, or when the source is no longer in existence or is 
unable to follow up the case and steps taken by the WGEID to establish communication 
with other sources have proven unsuccessful. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reopening of cases 
</b></p>
<p>24.  If sources provide well-documented information that a case has been considered 
clarified, closed or discontinued erroneously, because the Government&#8217;s reply referred to a 
different person, does not correspond to the reported situation or has not reached the source 
within the six-month period referred to above, the WGEID transmits the case to the 
Government anew, requesting it to comment. In such instances, the case in question is again 
listed among the outstanding cases and a specific explanation is given in the Group&#8217;s report 
to the Human Rights Council, describing the above-mentioned errors or discrepancies. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Other protection mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Urgent appeals 
</b></p>
<p>25.  When credible allegations are received that a person has been arrested, detained, 
abducted, or otherwise deprived of his liberty and has been enforcedly disappeared or is at 
risk of being disappeared, the Working Group will transmit those allegations to the Minister 
for Foreign Affairs of the Government concerned by the most direct and rapid means 
requesting said Government to carry out investigations to clarify the fate or whereabouts of 
the person(s) concerned and to inform the Working Group about the results. The 
transmission of urgent appeals is authorized by the Chairperson on the basis of a specific 
delegation of power given to him by the Group. 
</p>
<p>26.  Urgent appeals will be reflected in the annual report of the Working Group, but will 
not be counted in the statistics of the Government concerned. However, should the 
information contained therein be provided in accordance with the requirements listed under 
&#8220;Admissibility of cases of enforced or involuntary disappearances&#8221; and &#8220;Elements for 
admissibility&#8221;, the urgent appeal will become a standard or urgent case as appropriate in 
which case the Government concerned will be informed by separate communication. 
</p>
<p><b>  Prompt interventions 
</b></p>
<p>27.  Cases of intimidation, persecution or reprisal against relatives of disappeared 
persons, witnesses to disappearances or their families, members of organizations of 
relatives and other non-governmental organizations, human rights defenders or individuals 
concerned with disappearances are transmitted to the pertinent Governments, with the 
appeal that they take steps to protect all the fundamental rights of the persons affected. 
Cases of that nature, which require prompt intervention, are transmitted directly to the 
Ministers for Foreign Affairs by the most direct and rapid means. To that end, the WGEID 
has authorized its Chairperson to transmit such cases between sessions. 
</p>
<p><b>  General allegations 
</b></p>
<p>28.  The WGEID regularly transmits to the Governments concerned a summary of 
allegations received from relatives of disappeared persons and non-governmental </p>


<p>organizations with regard to obstacles encountered in the implementation of the Declaration 
in their respective countries, inviting them to comment thereon if they so wish. 
</p>
<p><b>  Cooperation with other mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>29.  If a case or allegation contains information relevant to other thematic mechanisms of 
the Human Rights Council, the information is transmitted to the mechanism concerned.  
</p>
<p>30.  Where appropriate, the WGEID may join other mechanisms in the actions they take 
within the scope of their respective mandates. 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Activities of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Country missions 
</b></p>
<p>31.  The WGEID carries out visits to countries on invitation, but also takes the initiative 
of approaching Governments with a view to carrying out visits to countries, when 
considered appropriate. Such visits are intended to enhance the dialogue between the 
authorities most directly concerned, the families or their representatives and the WGEID, 
and to assist in the clarification of the reported disappearances. The WGEID also 
undertakes visits to examine the practices carried out by Governments to clarify cases of 
enforced disappearances, as well as the programmes and measures adopted to implement 
the Declaration and to guarantee the rights of the victims, including the right to integral 
reparation. The WGEID reports to the Council on its country visits in an addendum to its 
annual report. 
</p>
<p><b>  Follow-up 
</b></p>
<p>32.  With regard to countries in which visits have been carried out, the WGEID 
periodically reminds the Governments concerned of the observations and recommendations 
formulated in the respective reports, requesting information on the consideration given to 
them, and the steps taken for their implementation or the constraints which might have 
prevented their implementation. The WGEID may also take the initiative to carry out 
follow-up visits. 
</p>
<p><b>  Sessions 
</b></p>
<p>33.  The WGEID meets three times a year to consider the information brought to its 
attention since its previous session. Its sessions are held in private. However, the WGEID 
works intersessionally and regularly meets with representatives of Governments, 
nongovernmental organizations, family members and witnesses. 
</p>
<p><b>  Reports 
</b></p>
<p>34.  The WGEID reports annually to the Human Rights Council on the activities which it 
has carried out from the end of Council&#8217;s previous session up until the last day of the 
WGEID&#8217;s third annual session. It informs the Council of its communications with 
Governments and non-governmental organizations, its meetings and missions. Reports on 
missions are contained as addenda to the main report. The WGEID reports on all cases of 
disappearance received by the Group during the year, on a country-by-country basis, and on 
the decision it has taken thereon. It provides the Council with a statistical summary for each 
country of cases transmitted to the Government, clarifications, and the status of the person 
concerned on the date of clarification. It includes graphs showing the development of 
disappearances in countries with more than 100 transmitted cases as of the date of the 
adoption by the WGEID of its annual report. The WGEID includes conclusions and 
recommendations in its report and makes observations on the situation of disappearances in </p>


<p>individual countries. The WGEID further reports on the implementation of the Declaration 
and the obstacles encountered therein, and periodically reports on broader issues 
surrounding the phenomenon of enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p><b>  Participation of experts 
</b></p>
<p>35.  When the information under consideration concerns a country to which one of the 
members of the WGEID is a national, that member does not participate in the discussion.
