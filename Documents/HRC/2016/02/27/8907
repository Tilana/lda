<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
of indigenous people, S. James Anaya, presents his observations on the situation of the 
indigenous peoples of the Amazon region, particularly in relation to the clashes that 
occurred on 5 June 2009 and the events of the days immediately following in the provinces 
of Bagua and Utcubamba, Amazonas department which resulted in a number of deaths and 
injuries. These observations are the result of an exchange of information with the 
Government of Peru and other interested parties and of his visit to Peru from 17 to 19 June 
2009. The purpose of the visit was to observe, understand and analyse the situation that had 
arisen in the area round the city of Bagua and in Bagua and Utcubamba provinces, and the 
events that led to this situation. The Special Rapporteur considers the Peruvian 
Government&#8217;s invitation to visit the country and the cooperation that he received in the 
course of his visit to have been a mark of goodwill and openness. 
</p>
<p> During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was able to extend his knowledge of the 
situation and engage in a constructive dialogue with Government representatives, with 
members of indigenous organizations and peoples and with civil society in the Bagua

<p>region and elsewhere, and following his visit he continued to receive extensive information 
from various sources on developments following the events of 5 June. The Special 
Rapporteur sets out a number of conclusions and recommendations concerning the 
measures that could contribute to the search for constructive solutions in the framework of 
international standards on the rights of indigenous peoples. He recommends that a special, 
independent commission should be established to shed light on the events of 5 June 2009 
and the following days, to be made up of various institutions that enjoy credibility with all 
the parties involved and of indigenous representatives. He further recommends that 
members of the international community should participate in the work of the special 
commission. The Special Rapporteur also makes specific recommendations with regard to 
conducting a proper consultation process and reviewing the criminal charges against 
indigenous leaders. One of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s general comments is the absence of an 
adequate mechanism to address the legitimate right of indigenous peoples to be consulted 
and to protect their rights over their lands and territories, which has been a factor in the 
feeling among the indigenous peoples that they lack adequate options to defend their rights.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report presents the observations of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, Professor S. James Anaya, 
on the situation of the indigenous peoples of the Amazon region, particularly in relation to 
the clashes of 5 June 2009 and the events of the days immediately following in Bagua and 
Utcubamba provinces, Amazonas department, which led to a number of deaths and injuries. 
These observations are based on an exchange of information with the Government of Peru 
and other interested parties and on a visit to Peru from 17 to 19 June 2009. The purpose of 
the visit was to observe, understand and analyse the situation that had arisen in the area 
round the city of Bagua and in Bagua and Utcubamba provinces and the events that gave 
rise to this situation. 
</p>
<p>2. On 10 June 2009, the Special Rapporteur issued a press release in response to the 
fighting that occurred on 5 June and the following days, expressing his condolences to the 
victims and their families and making an &#8220;urgent appeal to all concerned to avoid further 
violence&#8221;. The Special Rapporteur also urged the State authorities &#8220;to implement measures 
already in place, as well as adopt all additional measures necessary, in accordance with 
international human rights norms, to protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
the affected indigenous peoples&#8221;. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur stressed to the 
&#8220;indigenous individuals and peoples involved that their claims and protests should always 
be carried out in a peaceful manner and with respect for the human rights of others&#8221;. Lastly, 
the Special Rapporteur expressed &#8220;his willingness to visit the country to review the 
situation and contribute to the search for a solution to the conflicts in the region, within the 
terms of his mandate by the United Nations Human Rights Council, to promote respect for 
the human rights of indigenous peoples&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>3. In a note verbale dated 12 June 2009, the Government of Peru extended an invitation 
to the Special Rapporteur to visit the country and analyse the situation facing it. The 
Special Rapporteur also received requests for him to visit the country from indigenous 
groups and the Special Multi-Party Committee set up by Congress to consider the problems 
of indigenous peoples and recommend a solution (&#8220;the Multi-Party Committee&#8221;). The 
Multi-Party Committee decided on 9 June 2009 to invite the Special Rapporteur &#8220;in order 
that he may contribute to the search for a solution to the conflicts ... with the indigenous 
people of the Peruvian Amazon region&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>4. During his visit, from 17 to 19 June, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with, 
among others, the Vice-President of Congress, members of the Multi-Party Committee, 
members of the Constitutional Committee of Congress, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the 
Minister of Justice, the Minister of International Trade and Tourism, the Minister of the 
Interior, the Minister of Defence, the Prime Minister, the Attorney General and officials 
attached to those ministries. The Special Rapporteur also held a meeting with the 
Ombudswoman (Defensora del Pueblo) and officials from her Office; he also met members 
of indigenous organizations and peoples and civil society in the region of Bagua, where he 
was able to interview a number of people who were present at the clashes on 5 June. The

</b></p>
<p>Special Rapporteur received, and continues to receive, extensive information from various 
sources about the events that occurred. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the invitation and the support of the 
Government of Peru and for the cooperation he received in carrying out his visit, which he 
considers a gesture of goodwill and openness on the part of the Peruvian Government. He 
also expresses his sincere gratitude to all the organizations and individuals for information 
provided on this delicate and sensitive situation. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to Peru 
forms an important part of his mandate, established by the Human Rights Council, to 
receive and exchange &#8220;information and communications from all relevant sources, 
including Governments, indigenous people and their communities and organizations, on 
alleged violations of their human rights and fundamental freedoms&#8221;, and to &#8220;formulate 
recommendations and proposals on appropriate measures and activities to prevent and 
remedy violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people&#8221;.1 
</p>
<p>6. The following observations and recommendations by the Special Rapporteur have 
the aim of contributing to finding constructive solutions to the current situation, in the light 
of the relevant international standards. 
</p>
<p>7. In a note dated 14 July 2009, the Special Rapporteur submitted a first version of 
these observations on the situation to the Government, which issued comments on his 
observations in a note dated 16 July 2009. The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude 
to the Government for having provided additional information and comments, which have 
been taken into account for the definitive version of the observations set out in this 
document. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>8. The events that occurred in Bagua and Utcubamba provinces in June 2009 took 
place in the context of growing tensions, which largely centred on the enactment by the 
Executive of various legislative decrees called into question by indigenous organizations 
and representatives. Between March and June 2008, the Government enacted 101 
legislative decrees on the basis of Congressional Act No. 29157, which delegated 
legislative faculties to the Executive for the adoption of measures relating to the 
Government&#8217;s development policy and the implementation of the Trade Promotion 
Agreement (known as the Free Trade Agreement) between Peru and the United States of 
America. Indigenous organizations, particularly the Interethnic Association of Peruvian 
Amazonia (AIDESEP) objected to 38 of these legislative decrees, and subsequently to 11, 
both because of their content and because there had been no direct consultations with the 
indigenous peoples before the legislation was enacted. 
</p>
<p>9. The 11 decrees to which the indigenous organizations objected were the following: 
No. 994 (promotion of private investment in irrigation projects to extend the area of 
agricultural land); No. 995 (amendments to the Agricultural Bank (Relaunch) Act); No. 
1015 (integration of the administrative procedures for peasant and indigenous communities 
in mountain and forest areas with those of the coastal regions in order to improve their 
commercial production and agricultural competitiveness); No. 1020 (promotion of 
agricultural products and consolidation of land ownership for credit); No. 1060 (regulation 
of the National Agricultural Innovation System); No. 1064 (establishment of a legal regime 
for agricultural land use); No. 1080 (amending the General Seed Act); No. 1081 
(establishment of the national water resource system); No. 1083 (promotion of the use and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 Human Rights Council resolution 6/12 of 28 September 2007, para. 1 (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/34/Add.8

</p>
<p>conservation of water resources); No. 1089 (establishment of the extraordinary temporary 
regime for the formalization of ownership of rural plots of land); and No. 1090 (adoption of 
the Forest and Forest Wildlife Act). Legislative Decrees Nos. 1081 and 1083 were 
superseded by the Water Resources Act No. 29338, of 31 March 2009, but the others 
remain in force. It was claimed that the 11 decrees were facilitating increasing commercial 
activity and the privatization and exploitation of lands and natural resources that threatened 
the rights of indigenous people over their own lands and resources. 
</p>
<p>10. Moreover, the constitutionality of some of the decrees and/or their compatibility 
with the International Labour Organization (ILO) Indigenous and Tribal Peoples 
Convention, 1989 (No. 169), which has been ratified by Peru, has been called into question 
by various parties, including the Office of the Ombudswoman,2 the Multi-Party 
Committee,3 the sub-working group of the Congressional Agriculture Committee set up to 
consider legislative decrees relating to the agricultural sector,4 Constitutional Committee of 
Congress5 and a number of non-governmental organizations.6 The decree that came in for 
the most criticism was No. 1015, amended by No. 1073, which, it was claimed, facilitated 
the sale of indigenous communal lands by reducing the quorum required for agreement on 
the expropriation of land from two thirds to half the votes of community members meeting 
collectively. Particular concern was also expressed about Legislative Decrees Nos. 1064 
and 1090, which, it was claimed, facilitated changes in the use of land. 
</p>
<p>11. In August 2008, a number of indigenous groups, under the leadership of AIDESEP, 
embarked on direct action, blocking main roads and taking over oil installations in protest 
against the legislative decrees referred to above. They demanded the repeal of the decrees, 
compliance with ILO Convention No. 169 and action on their other demands. 
</p>
<p>12. On 20 August 2008, the President of Congress, together with a number of members 
of Congress, signed an Act of Agreement with representatives of the indigenous 
Amazonian peoples, under which it was agreed to recall the full Congress in order to debate 
the repeal of Legislative Decrees Nos. 1015 and 1073 and to establish a multi-party 
committee &#8220;to consider the problems of the indigenous peoples and recommend a solution, 
with the participation of their representatives&#8221; (art. 2). The Agreement also undertook to

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 On 13 May 2008, the Office of the Ombudswoman instituted proceedings before the Constitutional 
</p>
<p>Court on the grounds that Decree No. 1015 was unconstitutional. The Office also brought an action of 
unconstitutionality before the Constitutional Court on 4 June 2009 against Legislative Decree No. 
1064, claiming a breach of the Constitution of the Republic and of ILO Convention No. 169. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 On 19 December 2008, the Multi-Party Committee issued a report on legislative decrees 
</p>
<p>recommending that &#8220;Legislative Decrees Nos. 994, 1064, 1020, 1080, 1081, 1089, 1090, 1083, 1060 
and 995 should be repealed as being contrary to the constitutional rights of the peasant and indigenous 
communities [as in the Constitution and Peru&#8217;s commitments under ILO Convention No. 169].&#8221; It 
also recommended that the Council of Ministers should &#8220;engage in prior, free and informed 
consultation, as provided for in [ILO Convention No. 169]&#8221;. Report on legislative decrees relating to 
indigenous peoples adopted by the Executive on the basis of Act No. 21957, Recommendations 1.1 
and 2.5. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 In December 2008, the sub-working group of the Congressional Agriculture Committee set up to 
</p>
<p>consider legislative decrees relating to the agricultural sector issued a report concluding that 
Legislative Decrees Nos. 1064 and 1090, among others, were unconstitutional. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5
 The Constitutional Committee of Congress declared Legislative Decrees Nos. 1090 and 994 to be 
</p>
<p>unconstitutional on 19 May 2009.

 See for example, the legal report and analysis commissioned by Oxfam on the constitutional validity

August 2008), and &#8220;Legislative decrees that violate the rights of indigenous peoples: implementation

<p>&#8220;promote a bill to amend congressional rules in order to incorporate the consultation 
procedure set out in International Labour Organization Convention No. 169&#8221; (art. 3). On 21 
September 2008, Congress issued Act No. 29261 repealing Legislative Decrees Nos. 1015 
and 1073. On 26 September 2008, the Multi-Party Committee was formally established, 
chaired by Congresswoman Gloria Deniz Ramos Prudencio. 
</p>
<p>13. In February and March 2009, AIDESEP and other indigenous groups sent letters to 
the Executive and Congress expressing their concern at the failure to repeal the other 
legislative degrees and at the perceived failure of political will at several levels of 
Government to address the demands of the Amazonian peoples. On 23 March 2009, the 
President signed a Supreme Decree establishing the Standing Committee for Dialogue 
between the State and the indigenous peoples of Amazonia. AIDESEP, however, rejected 
the establishment of this committee, believing that it did not guarantee legitimate and 
adequate participation for the indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>14. On 8 April 2009, the leaders of about 1,350 Amazonian communities announced 
that, from 9 April, they would start an indefinite strike throughout Peruvian Amazonia, in 
protest at the alleged lack of commitment on the part of the State to address their 
complaints. Beginning on that date, indigenous groups travelled to various places, blocking 
main roads and occupying oil installations. Tensions rose and, on 9 May 2009, the 
Government declared a state of emergency in various districts of Cuzco, Ucayali, Loreto 
and Amazonas departments,7 which involved the suspension of various freedoms, such as 
freedom of movement and freedom of assembly. On 26 April, hundreds of indigenous 
Aguaruna and Wampis occupied the North Peruvian oil pipeline installation known as 
&#8220;Station 6&#8221;, belonging to the Petroperu State Oil Company, in Bagua province, Amazonas. 
</p>
<p>15. While the indigenous action was taking place, in April and May, AIDESEP and the 
Government, represented by the President of the Council of Ministers, exchanged a series 
of communications with a view to re-establishing dialogue. On 20 May 2009, a 
multisectoral committee, also known as a &#8220;dialogue round table&#8221;, was set up, consisting of 
the Office of the President of the Council of Ministers and nine other ministries and seven 
AIDESEP delegates.8 After two meetings, however, AIDESEP decided to suspend its 
participation in the dialogue, because, according to the indigenous leaders, the Government 
representatives defended the legality of the legislative decrees at the meetings. The police 
presence in Amazonas department was subsequently stepped up, especially at the protest 
sites and the road blockades. 
</p>
<p>16. On 22 May 2009, the Minister of Justice confirmed that she had instructed the 
procurator attached to the Office of the President of the Council of Ministers to initiate 
criminal proceedings with the public prosecutor&#8217;s office against the President of AIDESEP, 
Alberto Pizango, for allegedly encouraging rebellion, sedition and conspiracy. The charge 
was laid in response to a public statement by Mr. Pizango on 15 May 2009, in which he 
said that the peoples represented by AIDESEP were entering into a state of &#8220;insurgency&#8221; 
against the Government. On 16 May 2009, Mr. Pizango made a statement before the Office 
of the Ombudswoman, in which he undertook to &#8220;withdraw the reference to the right to 
insurgency&#8221; and to &#8220;maintain and develop the protest within the law&#8221;. The charge against 
Mr. Pizango stood, despite what he had said in his formal statement. Then, on 2 June 2009, 
the Special Prosecutor for Public Order Affairs of the Ministry of the Interior filed a 
criminal charge against Mr. Pizango for the offences of obstruction of transport, 
communication and other public services (Endangering public safety and obstructing the 
functioning of public services) and breaches of the peace (Unlawful association). The

<p>prosecutors attached to the Ministries of the Interior and of Energy and Mines subsequently 
charged other indigenous leaders, including Marcial Mudarra Taki, Saul Puerta Pe&#241;a, 
Servando Puerta Pe&#241;a, Daniel Marzano Campos and Teresita Antaza Lopez with alleged 
offences committed in connection with their participation in the action. 
</p>
<p>17. On 4 June 2009, Congress decided to suspend the debate listed on the agenda on the 
repeal of Legislative Decrees Nos. 1064 and 1090. The reason given for the suspension of 
the debate was that Congress should wait for the results of the dialogue process within the 
Multisectoral Committee, even though the Committee had already ceased to function owing 
to the non-participation of AIDESEP.  
</p>
<p>18. The next day, 5 June 2009, the police were mobilized to remove the indigenous 
demonstrators who were occupying and blocking Fernando Bela&#250;nde Terry Road in an area 
of Utcubamba province near the city and province of Bagua. Inhabitants of various 
indigenous communities of the Amazonas region had held several kilometres of this road 
and other strategic points for seven weeks, as part of the stoppage called by AIDESEP, 
obstructing traffic and hindering the delivery of food and fuel to the nearby towns and 
villages. In the morning of 5 June, the police started to remove the hundreds of people 
concentrated in the part of the road known as Curva del Diablo (Devil&#8217;s Curve), between 
two houses called Siempre Viva and El Reposo. Violence broke out during the removal 
process and a number of people were killed or injured, both police and demonstrators. 
Clashes between the police and indigenous persons and other civilians continued in the city 
of Bagua and adjoining areas the same day. Hours after the start of the fighting at Curva del 
Diablo, it became known that a number of police officers had been killed in another place 
that had been occupied by indigenous demonstrators, at Station 6 of the North Peruvian oil 
pipeline, under circumstances that have still not been fully clarified. Also on 5 June, the 
Office of the President of the Council of Ministers extended the state of emergency to cover 
the whole of the Amazonas department, Datem de Mara&#241;&#243;n province in Loreto department 
and Ja&#233;n and San Ignacio provinces in Cajamarca department.9 
</p><p>19. On 10 June 2009, Congress adopted Act No. 29376, which suspended Legislative 
Decrees Nos. 1090 and 1064 indefinitely. On 11 June 2009, a number of members of 
Congress held a vigil in protest against the political management of the legislative decrees 
in question and the events in Bagua. Their aim was the full repeal of these legislative 
decrees, since, in their view, the legal concept of &#8220;suspension&#8221; did not exist in Peru&#8217;s 
constitutional framework. On 11 June 2009, the full Congress decided to sanction seven 
members of Congress &#8212; the coordinator of the Indigenous Parliamentary Group and six of 
its members &#8212; for 120 days for disrupting meetings of Congress. 
</p>
<p>20. During the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to Peru, on 19 June 2009, Congress, meeting 
in plenary, voted in favour of the definitive repeal of Legislative Decrees Nos. 1090 and 
</p><p>1064. This action was acknowledged and commended by the Special Rapporteur in a press 
release at the conclusion of his visit as a decisive step on the road to resolving through 
dialogue the basic problems afflicting the indigenous peoples of Peru. The related events 
that occurred subsequently to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit are discussed in paragraphs 33 
to 41 below.

</b></p>
<p><b> III. Comments by the Special Rapporteur on information 
received concerning the events in Bagua 
</b></p>
<p>21. On 19 June 2009, the Special Rapporteur held a meeting with the Ombudswoman 
and received information on the investigations being conducted into the persons affected by 
the fighting of 5 June and the related events. The information provided at this meeting 
tallied with that contained in a report published by the Office of the Ombudswoman at the 
beginning of July 2009.10 This report confirms that 33 persons died, including 10 civilians 
and 23 police officers, and that 200 people were injured, including 82 civilians wounded by 
gunfire. The report also states that a police officer, Major Felipe Baz&#243;n Soles, has 
disappeared. According to the report, 83 civilians were initially detained by the State 
authorities in connection with the direct action and the events of 5 June, but a number of 
these were released without charge. The report states that criminal proceedings have been 
instituted against those who remained in detention and also against a large number of 
people &#8212; 84 in all &#8212; charged with offences allegedly relating to the demonstrations and 
the violent clashes. 
</p>
<p>22. Apart from the number of confirmed dead or wounded, the Special Rapporteur was 
given a number of different, and often contradictory, accounts during his visit of the events 
of 5 June and the succeeding days, including differing versions of specific actions by the 
police and the demonstrators. Although the Special Rapporteur understands that these 
events are under investigation, particular mention should be made of the detailed 
descriptions given by a number of persons present at the clashes on 5 June of serious abuses 
committed by the police, including the excessive use of force and firearms. Police officers 
responsible for the operation to remove demonstrators from the road, when questioned by 
the Special Rapporteur, denied the possibility that there might have been excessive or 
disproportionate use of force by the police. It is not for the Special Rapporteur, in these 
comments, to catalogue the abuses of which he was told, nor to resolve the contradictory 
accounts. What the Special Rapporteur aims to do is rather to point out that the numerous 
statements detailing specific acts of police abuse cannot be dismissed, just as evidence that 
acts of violence were perpetrated by civilians in the course of these events can also not be 
dismissed. In that connection, the available information on the manner in which police 
officers in Station 6 were seized and ultimately killed by indigenous demonstrators 
occupying the location should also be addressed.

<p>23. With regard to the detention of a number of indigenous persons, the information 
provided by various State officials who were interviewed was that the conditions of 
detention were kept under constant review by prosecutors and public defenders, who 
provided legal assistance to the detainees and who noted no irregularities of any kind. The 
Special Rapporteur received information from other sources, however, alleging 
irregularities in detention, including failure to notify detainees of the reasons for their arrest 
and restrictions on the legal defence provided. Additional information received gave details 
and examples of a climate of persecution directed against the indigenous communities in 
the days following the clashes of 5 June, including searches conducted without a warrant 
and claims and allegations against indigenous leaders.  
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur also received varying accounts of the Government&#8217;s 
response and the investigations launched in the days following the events of 5 June. For

 Office of the Ombudswoman, Republic of Peru &#8220;Humanitarian action taken by the Office of the 
</p>
<p>Ombudswoman with regard to the events of 5 June 2009 in Utcubamba and Bagua provinces, 
Amazonas region, in the context of the Amazonian direct action&#8221;, Report No. 006-2009-DP/ADHPD 
(2009). </p>

</p>
<p>example, the Special Rapporteur received information alleging that, over the following five 
days, the police barred access to the scene of events at the Curva de Diablo and the army 
base at El Milagro, which was used as a detention centre, although other sources stated that 
there had been free access to these sites throughout this period. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur was not, however, given any firm evidence or specific 
testimony on any deaths beyond those already confirmed. Nor has he received firm 
evidence of the existence of mass graves, as has been publicly claimed.  
</p>
<p>26. With regard to the concerns expressed by various parties about the location of 
indigenous persons who participated in the direct action, the Office of the Ombudswoman 
states that the presence of 1,244 indigenous persons was registered in the places where they 
stayed in the days following the events of 5 June before returning to their communities.11 
Moreover, according to the report, the Office of the Ombudswoman carried out missions to 
39 indigenous communities on 11, 12 and 22 to 27 June and conducted interviews with the 
leaders of 16 other communities, from which it concluded that, &#8220;in all cases, the authorities 
reported the return of the indigenous inhabitants, with the exception of those who were 
hospitalized or interned in Chachapoyas Prison.&#8221;12 The report states that the 39 
communities visited are located in the provinces of Bagua and Condorcanqui, from which 
persons involved in the protests originated, and that these provinces contained a total of 181 
indigenous communities. The Office of the Ombudswoman says that &#8220;the selection of 
indigenous communities visited during these touring missions was made on the basis of 
their location and their population density. Particular attention was also paid to the 
communities in which the public complaints originated&#8221;.13 In the report, the Office of the 
Ombudswoman does not present specific conclusions on communities that were outside the 
scope of its investigation and states &#8220;any claim that is made by any person whose 
whereabouts is unknown by their families will receive attention.&#8221;14  
</p>
<p>27. There remains a concern on the part of indigenous and non-governmental 
organizations that there may still be a number of indigenous persons whose present 
circumstances are unknown. Indeed, following the publication of the report by the Office of 
the Ombudswoman, the disappearance of Nelvin Waum Kasem, an indigenous man from 
the area, was reported by his son to the Office of the Ombudswoman, which has opened an 
investigation into the case. Shortly after this complaint was lodged, the non-governmental 
organization Asociaci&#243;n Pro Derechos Humanos (APRODEH) also submitted to the Office 
of the Ombudswoman a list of 16 persons alleged to have disappeared, 10 of whom were 
located by the Office. In its comment on this to the Special Rapporteur, the Government 
maintains that APRODEH has not provided enough information to make it possible to 
initiate an inquiry in the six remaining cases. The Government also says that, despite its 
statements on possible disappearances, AIDESEP has not put forward any specific claims. 
The Special Rapporteur recalls, however, that it is the duty of the State to investigate 
alleged disappearances and that investigations should be carried out as a matter of course. 
</p>
<p>28. In any case, despite the information that it has been possible to confirm the present 
circumstances of those who were present at the events of 5 June, there remains considerable 
uncertainty as to what led up to those events. The very fact that the events of 5 June 
resulted in a number of deaths and injuries, that there has been no explanation of the causes 
of these casualties and that it has not been possible to resolve fully the question of the 
whereabouts of all those present at the clashes has been a cause of the deepest concern for

<p>the Special Rapporteur. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur notes that, during his visit, the 
accounts he had from the relevant Government authorities that he interviewed were 
contradictory and lacking in consistency as to who had responsibility for the police 
operations instituted in the neighbourhood of Bagua on 5 June. This also needs to be 
clarified. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that, during his visit, a number of 
Government representatives, including members of the public prosecutor&#8217;s office and the 
Ministry of the Interior, indicated that the investigations in progress were focused primarily 
&#8212; and more or less exclusively &#8212; on possible offences by the indigenous demonstrators 
and not on any possible irregularities on the part of the police and other parties during the 
events of 5 June and the following days. The Office of the Ombudswoman, for its part, has 
done no more than investigate and deal with humanitarian questions relating to the present 
circumstances of persons affected by the events, leaving to other State institutions the 
investigation into the events themselves, as stated in its report and as related to the Special 
Rapporteur. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the recent information provided by the 
Government that the public prosecutor&#8217;s office would initiate &#8220;a criminal investigation into 
murders and injuries of civilians by officers of the national police&#8221;. 
</p><p>30. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the need for full and objective clarification and 
investigation of the facts, so that all the parties, and the public at large, may gain a clear 
understanding of what happened and the Government&#8217;s response in the days prior to, during 
and following the clashes. The Special Rapporteur also notes that a clarification of the facts 
is essential for the establishment of a climate of trust that will enable the search for 
solutions to proceed with the participation of all parties. In that connection, the Special 
Rapporteur would point out that it will be very difficult to establish such a climate of trust 
unless the State first adopts conciliatory measures to overcome existing tensions. 
</p>
<p>31. As for the problems that led to the clashes, the Special Rapporteur recognizes that 
the Government has taken significant steps to set up a dialogue with the affected indigenous 
peoples, including dialogue round tables held in the course of 2008 and 2009. The Special 
Rapporteur sees a need, however, to deepen this consultation process and put it on a regular 
footing. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur notes that various institutions, particularly

without further delay, with the participation of the indigenous people, to establish appropriate 
consultation and participation mechanisms and to consult the indigenous peoples before the adoption 
of the measures referred to in articles 6 and 17 (2) of the Convention, and to provide information in 
this respect&#8221;. CEACR Individual Observation, doc. No. 062009PER169 (February 2009).

 In May 2009, the Office of the Ombudswoman published a report recommending that Congress 
</p>
<p>should &#8220;adopt a framework law on the right to consultation, which would set out the essential nature 
of the right, its guiding principles, its procedural stages and its guarantees in order to ensure that this 
right is properly implemented by the public sector whenever there are plans to adopt legislative and/or 
administrative measures that may directly affect the indigenous peoples, in accordance with

 In May 2009, the Multi-Party Committee issued a report on prior consultation, in which it recognized

</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> GE.09-15032 
</p>
<p>indigenous organizations and civil society,18 have recommended on a number of occasions 
that a process of consultation with the indigenous peoples affected should be set in motion, 
some of their recommendations being on specific measures to be adopted. The Special 
Rapporteur notes that these recommendations may constitute an important reference point 
in the development of a consultation process in conformity with international standards. 
The Special Rapporteur considers that, owing to the complexity of the basic issues and the 
divergence of views between the Government and the indigenous peoples affected, the 
consultation process would benefit from the participation of international technical advisers 
with experience in this field. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>32. On concluding his visit to Peru on 19 June 2009, the Special Rapporteur shared with 
Government representatives and the general public the following recommendations, which 
he would like to repeat in this report: 
</p>
<p><b> A. An independent commission to carry out an exhaustive, objective and 
impartial investigation 
</b></p>
<p>33. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that a special, independent commission 
should be set up to clarify the events of 5 June 2009 and the following days, composed 
of various institutions that enjoy the confidence of all the parties involved and 
including indigenous representatives. He also recommends that representatives of the 
international community should participate in the work of this special commission. 
</b></p>
<p>34. <b>The Special Rapporteur recognizes the decisive steps taken by the Government 
in the interests of resolving the basic problems of the indigenous peoples of Peru by 
adopting the path of dialogue and repealing Legislative Decree Nos. 1090 and 1064. 
He notes, however, that there remain challenges to face with regard to clarifying the 
circumstances that led up to the tragic events in Bagua on 5 June 2009 and seeking 
ways to find a peaceful solution to the underlying problems.  
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>&#8220;the importance of prior consultation for the indigenous peoples, as well as constituting an obligation 
by the Peruvian State&#8221;; and, in that context, the report &#8220;aims to strengthen the basis of prior 
consultation from the perspective of ILO Convention No. 169, which is endorsed by the political 
constitution, and using as a basis the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
and national and international instruments referring to prior consultation&#8221;. <i>Prior consultation: a 
fundamental right of the indigenous peoples and mechanism of State management for the

Resources (DAR), the Racimos de Ungurahui Working Group, Instituto del Bien Com&#250;n (Oxfam 
America) and Services in Intercultural Communication (SERVINDI) petitioned the Peruvian State to 
&#8220;adopt, in consultation with the indigenous peoples, a framework participation and consultation law 
that will be clear and in harmony with international norms, and an indigenous peoples&#8217; framework 
law that will incorporate the definition of indigenous peoples used at the multisectoral committee&#8221;.

<p>35. <b>It should be stressed that the proposed special commission</b> <b>should, without 
prejudice to any investigation that should be carried out by institutions of the 
administration of justice, determine, in an objective, exhaustive and impartial 
manner, where civil, administrative and criminal responsibility lies. The Special 
Rapporteur accordingly urges the various bodies that administer justice to conduct 
their work in line with international standards on the administration of justice in a 
State governed by the rule of law, especially the guarantees of independence, 
promptness and impartiality.  
</b></p>
<p>36. <b>In this connection, it is important that all the parties should be clear as to what 
charges have been brought, the locations in which the persons concerned are held and 
the jurisdiction under which the trials are held. The Special Rapporteur also 
emphasizes how important it is that the accused should fully enjoy all the guarantees 
of due process, especially the guarantees of appropriate and effective legal defence, 
and that they should be provided with adequate conditions of detention.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Review of charges against indigenous leaders 
</b></p>
<p>37. <b>In order to generate trust between the parties in the interests of advancing the 
process of dialogue, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the competent 
authorities should review the legal charges and judicial proceedings against 
indigenous leaders and authorities, whose participation in the dialogue is 
indispensable. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Appropriate consultation 
</b></p>
<p>38. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the existing dialogue process should 
be intensified. He emphasizes the need for the State of Peru to implement effectively 
an appropriate consultation procedure with the indigenous peoples that will be 
compatible with the relevant international standards, including ILO Convention No. 
169 and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This 
process should be set in motion with the participation of the country&#8217;s indigenous 
peoples and should guide the State in the development of future projects affecting the 
indigenous peoples. 
</b></p>
<p>39.<b> All the relevant parties should be represented in the process of dialogue, 
particularly the indigenous peoples, through representatives freely elected by 
themselves. Favourable conditions should be created for a consensus on objectives, 
procedures and timetables and on a mechanism for the practical implementation of 
agreements reached and the resolution of any questions that may arise during the 
process.  
</b></p>
<p>40. <b>The substantive aspects of the dialogue should include the other legislative 
decrees that have been a cause of concern to the indigenous peoples and that could 
affect them, as well as other basic issues that the indigenous peoples have raised to 
date in various forums, including those relating to their rights to lands and territories 
and projects for the exploitation of natural resources. 
</b>41. <b>The proceedings, and any agreements that are reached, must be compatible 
with international standards on the rights of indigenous peoples, including those 
contained in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and 
the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169), which has been 
ratified by Peru. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/12/34/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.09-15032 
</p>
<p><b>Government should apply for technical assistance from ILO and other international 
organizations. 
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Additional comments in the light of events subsequent to the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit 
</b>42. The Special Rapporteur cannot end this report without taking note of some 
important events that occurred during the weeks following his visit. In particular, the 
Special Rapporteur recognizes the importance of the agreement of 22 June 2009 on the 
establishment of the National Coordinating Group for the Development of the Amazonian 
Peoples, comprising 4 representatives of the Executive; the Presidents of the Regional 
Governments of Loreto, Ucayali, Amazonas, San Martin and Madre de Dios; and 10 
representatives of the indigenous Amazonian communities, including representatives of 
AIDESEP.19 The National Coordinating Group has adopted important measures that are in 
line with the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations, including the proposal to set up four 
working groups to investigate the events in Bagua on 5 June, analyse the legislative decrees 
of concern to the indigenous communities and propose new legislation, develop a 
consultation mechanism and propose a plan of Amazonian development that would include 
consideration of indigenous lands and territories.20 
</p>
<p>43. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government of Peru and other 
interested parties to step up action on clarifying the events in Bagua by setting up an 
independent commission, as recommended in paragraphs 33 to 36 above. The Special 
Rapporteur reiterates the importance of engaging the participation both of indigenous 
peoples and of international representatives in this process and calls on the State and the 
relevant international organizations to seek to establish and consolidate a mechanism for 
technical assistance and international monitoring of the process. The Special Rapporteur 
will continue to monitor progress in the investigation process. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur notes that Congress has prepared a bill on the regularization 
of the consultation process.21 He considers that the bill which should be in conformity with 
the relevant international standards, should be discussed with the indigenous peoples. The 
Special Rapporteur appreciates the contribution made in this connection by the Office of 
the Ombudswoman in its report on the indigenous peoples&#8217; right to consultation.22 The

integrity; (b) discussion and proposals on a solution concerning the decrees of concern to the 
Amazonian indigenous populations and agreed proposals on new laws to be submitted to the 
Government, with particular emphasis on the existing Forest and Forest Wildlife Act; (c) prior 
consultation with the indigenous Amazonian peoples on defining the consultation mechanisms for the

<p><b>A/HRC/12/34/Add.8 
</b></p>
<p>GE.09-15032 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>Special Rapporteur urges the Government to act in accordance with ILO Convention No. 
169 and assume &#8220;responsibility for developing, with the participation of the peoples 
concerned, coordinated and systematic action to protect the rights of these peoples and to 
guarantee respect for their integrity&#8221; (art. 2, para. 1). The Special Rapporteur also recalls 
that, in accordance with article 19 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, consultations with the indigenous peoples must be held in good faith, 
through their own representative institutions, in order to obtain their free, prior and 
informed consent.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur also recognizes that the Government has adopted measures 
aimed at reconciliation and the establishment of a climate of trust between the parties, 
including the repeal of Legislative Decrees Nos. 1090 and 1064 on 19 June 2009 and the 
lifting of the state of emergency in the Amazonian provinces of Amazonas, Ucayali, Loreto 
and Cuzco on 23 June 2009.23 In that connection, the Special Rapporteur calls on all parties 
to maintain their efforts to achieve reconciliation and mutual understanding and to avoid 
discrediting, minimizing or dismissing the legitimate concerns of the interested parties. The 
Special Rapporteur considers that the measures to adopt in the interests of reconciliation 
should include public expressions of condolence and sympathy to the families of all the 
victims, both by indigenous peoples and organizations and by the relevant State institutions.  
</p>
<p>46. With regard to the review of the charges against indigenous leaders as a preliminary 
measure to establish trust, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that, on 26 June 2009, 
the judge of Lima Criminal Court No. 27 referred back to the public prosecutor&#8217;s office the 
charges against the President of AIDESEP, Alberto Pizango, and four other AIDESEP 
leaders, because it did not specify the offence with which each of them was charged. He is, 
however, concerned that, according to the information he has received, the police entered 
the headquarters of the Regional Organization of the Indigenous Peoples of the North of 
Peru (ORPIAN), which forms part of AIDESEP, on 23 June, looking for leaders of the 
organization and arresting one person. The Special Rapporteur also notes with concern that 
criminal charges seemingly continue to be laid against indigenous leaders for alleged 
offences relating to their participation in the protests of indigenous peoples, as evidenced 
by the detention orders for a number of indigenous leaders issued in the week of 6 July. 
These orders clearly threaten the process of dialogue initiated in accordance with the 
agreement of 22 June 2009 mentioned above. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur repeats his recommendation that criminal charges against 
indigenous persons and leaders should be reviewed and urges the Government to take great 
care in justifying the criminal charges that it lays in the future, in view of the special 
circumstances in which the alleged offences occurred and the need to establish proper 
conditions for dialogue.  
</p>
<p>48. In that connection, the Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that, although he 
recognizes the need to maintain public order and investigate and punish those responsible 
for offences and/or human rights violations, resorting to the use of the criminal courts 
should not be the normal approach to dealing with social conflict and protest, unless it is the 
last available resource (<i>ultima ratio</i>) and should be strictly restricted to the principle of &#8220;an 
imperative public interest that is necessary for the functioning of a democratic society&#8221;.24 
At the same time, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that indigenous persons and peoples

</p>
<p>should always ensure that their statements and demonstrations always take a peaceful form 
and respect the human rights of others. 
</p>
<p>49. Such considerations may be of particular importance in situations involving protests 
by indigenous peoples, in view of the fact that traditional channels for complaint, through 
the representative democratic process, do not always adequately address the concerns of 
indigenous peoples or take account of their frequent marginalization from the political 
scene in the country at large. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur notes generally that the lack of a mechanism for indigenous 
peoples to claim their legitimate rights to be consulted or to protect their land and territorial 
rights could contribute to a feeling on the part of the indigenous peoples that they have no 
adequate means to defend their rights and, as a result, opt for social protest, which, in some 
cases, may result in actions that are against the law. He also notes that one side effect of the 
criminalization of protest, in cases where it is not justified, is the creation of a dynamic that 
could generate a lack of trust between the indigenous peoples and the State authorities, to 
the detriment of coexistence and democratic legitimacy. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Concluding observations 
</b>51. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the process of 
resolving this situation is conducted within the framework of full respect for human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, in a manner that will contribute to strengthening government by 
the rule of law and democracy in Peru. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the legitimate 
aim of the State to promote sustainable development for the benefit of society in general but 
stresses the need to reconcile that aim with full respect for the rights of indigenous peoples, 
in accordance with the State&#8217;s commitments under international law and its own 
constitutional framework. In addition to ratifying ILO Convention No. 169, Peru played a 
leading role in drawing up and promoting the adoption by the General Assembly of the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>52. In cooperation with the country&#8217;s indigenous peoples, Peru has an excellent 
opportunity to establish good practices on the international scale by translating its clear will 
to comply with its international commitments into the domestic application of the criteria 
and principles enshrined in international instruments, most particularly with regard to prior 
and informed consultation with indigenous peoples through their representative institutions 
on any measure that such peoples consider may affect their rights. 
</p>
<p>53. The indigenous peoples of Peru, for their part, have an opportunity to show their 
openness to promoting a dialogue in good faith to facilitate coexistence with other sectors 
of the country and the establishment of rules that will be helpful in advancing the common 
good. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur also notes that a clear strategic engagement is required on 
permanent mechanisms for dialogue and conflict resolution, which would include, among 
others, mechanisms relating to territorial rights and other outstanding claims, in the 
interests of preventing acts of violence and avoiding any repetition of the unfortunate 
events that occurred in Bagua. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur offers these observations and recommendations in the hope 
that they may serve to promote a rapprochement between the parties, mutual understanding 
and a resolution of the situation. He also confirms his availability to continue working with 
all parties, within the framework of his mandate to promote full respect and protection for 
the human rights of indigenous people. </p>

situation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the indigenous peoples of Peru,
