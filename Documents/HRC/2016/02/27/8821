</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This is the final report of Walter K&#228;lin, who in 2010 ends his second term as 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced 
persons. He expresses his appreciation to the Human Rights Council, its members and 
observers for the trust and cooperation extended to him.  
</p>
<p>2. The mandate, established in 2004 by the Commission on Human Rights and 
extended in 2007 by the Human Rights Council in resolution 6/32, has provided a good 
basis for the Representative to build on the excellent work of his predecessor, Francis 
Deng. The nature of his mandate has allowed the Representative to benefit from privileged 
access, broad support and partnerships with United Nations institutions, member States, 
civil society and other stakeholders.1 It has been critical that the Representative has 
succeeded in linking the mandate to a broader international context inclusive of peace 
processes, humanitarian assistance and development, natural disasters and climate change.  
</p>
<p>3. The many activities the Representative has been requested to carry out include 
engaging in dialogues with governments, mainstreaming the human rights of internally 
displaced persons into the United Nations system and working towards strengthening the 
national, regional and international response to internal displacement. Since no other entity 
in the United Nations system has a mandate to protect the rights of internally displaced 
persons, the Representative&#8217;s work has been far-reaching and has required his sustained 
engagement. The regular support provided to him by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is gratefully acknowledged. However, to 
maximize the impact of the multifaceted mandate, the Representative has also relied on the 
additional substantive and logistical support provided by the Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR) with whom the Representative has built fruitful partnerships. The 
Representative&#8217;s memorandums of understanding with both offices have improved the flow 
of information and exchange of expertise and allowed the Representative to place support 
staff in both, supplementing the staff support he receives from OHCHR. The close 
interaction at the working level has allowed the Representative to introduce a perspective 
on the rights of internally displaced persons into the work of these bodies at a policy and 
operational level. 
</p>
<p>4. The Representative cooperates effectively with other United Nations agencies, in 
particular the Bureau of Crisis Prevention and Recovery of the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) and also the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) 
and the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Children in Armed 
Conflict. Within the Secretariat, the Representative has maintained close contacts with the 
Secretary-General and his Executive Office, the Emergency Relief Coordinator, the 
Department of Political Affairs, including its Mediation Support Unit, the Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations, the Peacebuilding Support Office and the Office of Legal 
Affairs. He has also received support from other agencies, including the World Food 
Programme, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Development Fund for 
Women (UNIFEM) and has benefited from logistical, security and other support from 
different peacekeeping and political missions. 
</p>
<p>5. The Representative owes special gratitude to the Brookings-Bern Project on Internal 
Displacement, its Directors Roberta Cohen and Elisabeth Ferris, its staff, and its donors. In 
addition to greatly advancing the overall understanding and awareness of internal 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p>displacement, the Project has helped to reinforce the work of the Representative, in 
particular with research and publications on national responsibility, durable solutions, 
consultation mechanisms, peace processes and protection in situations of natural disaster. It 
has provided support for the preparation of the Manual for Law and Policy Makers, the 
Guide for Peace Mediators and the courses in San Remo, and has organized seminars at the 
regional and national levels to promote the protection of internally displaced persons.  
</p>
<p>6. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) established by the Norwegian 
Refugee Council, with which the Representative also concluded a memorandum of 
understanding, has provided valuable support to the mandate in the preparation of country 
visits and by conducting training and other follow-up activities after visits, contributing to 
the capacity-building activities of the Representative, and promoting the Guiding Principles 
on Internal Displacement. 
</p>
<p>7. One of the key findings of the Representative is that tangible improvements over 
time for internally displaced persons were only achievable where he could pay visits, 
maintain an ongoing dialogue with the authorities and gain on-the-ground support from 
United Nations partner agencies and United Nations and Inter-Agency Standing Committee 
(IASC) country teams, as well as Special Representatives of the Secretary-General. 
</p><p>8. The Representative is particularly grateful for the generous support of many donors 
which allowed him to undertake research and capacity-building activities through the 
Brookings-Bern Project on Internal Displacement and to have additional support staff. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Achievements and activities of the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>9. Achieving full respect for the human rights of internally displaced persons and 
finding durable solutions to their displacement requires at least four elements: (a) a strong 
normative framework for the protection and assistance of the displaced; (b) the political 
will to implement fully such a framework; (c) the capacity at all levels &#8212; international, 
regional, national and local &#8212; to do so; and (d) the ability to respond to emerging 
challenges. The Representative, during his mandate period, has centred his activities around 
these four elements.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Strengthening the normative framework on the basis of the Guiding 
Principles on Internal Displacement 
</b></p>
<p>10. Internally displaced persons are citizens or long-term residents of their country, with 
all the rights and privileges this entails under international and national law, and also enjoy 
the protection of international humanitarian law in conflict situations. Because they reside 
inside their own countries, they do not, unlike refugees, enjoy a special status under 
international law although, like refugees, they have needs specific to their displacement. 
The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, which the Representative is mandated to 
promote, address these needs. The Guiding Principles reflect and are consistent with 
international human rights and humanitarian law, restating existing norms and tailoring 
them to the needs of the displaced.  
</p>
<p>11. The Representative is pleased to report that the authority of the Guiding Principles 
has been consolidated at the international level since he assumed his mandate. The Heads of 
State and Government assembled in New York for the World Summit of September 2005 
unanimously recognized the Guiding Principles as an &#8220;important international framework </p>


<p>GE.10-10161 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>for the protection of internally displaced persons&#8221;, a recognition subsequently echoed by 
the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly.2 Most recently, the General 
Assembly recognized that &#8220;the protection of internally displaced persons has been 
strengthened by identifying, reaffirming and consolidating specific standards for their 
protection, in particular through the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement&#8221;.3 There 
are some indications that the Guiding Principles are emerging as customary law, providing 
a binding interpretation of the international legal norms upon which they are based.4  
</p>
<p>12. Regional and subregional organizations are increasingly shaping normative 
frameworks, building on the Guiding Principles. Africa has made the greatest advances, 
being the only region which has binding instruments specifically protecting internally 
displaced persons. The Great Lakes Protocol on Protection and Assistance to Internally 
Displaced Persons obliges 10 member States to incorporate the Guiding Principles into 
their domestic law.  
</p>
<p>13. In October 2009, the African Union (AU) Special Summit of Heads of State and 
Governments adopted the Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally 
Displaced Persons in Africa (Kampala Convention), the first internal displacement-specific 
convention covering an entire region. This historic document, to the development of which 
the Representative contributed, sets out obligations for States parties, the AU and 
humanitarian agencies in relation to all phases of displacement and had already been signed 
by 17 States when this report was finalized.  
</p>
<p>14. Other regional organizations have adopted recommendations and resolutions for the 
protection of and assistance to internally displaced persons that reference the Guiding 
Principles.5 The Representative encourages the development of regional normative 
frameworks in line with the Guiding Principles since they allow member States to address 
the specific patterns of internal displacement in their regions.  
</p>
<p>15. The Representative is particularly pleased to report that he has been able to assist a 
number of member States in developing laws and policies on internal displacement, 
including Georgia, Nepal, Turkey and Sudan. The Representative stands ready to continue

of the Great Lakes Region (in particular the Central African Republic). 
</p><p>16. There may also be a need for instruments addressing new thematic areas. Compared 
to armed conflict situations, there are relatively few binding norms that apply to disasters 
and displacement. The work of the International Law Commission (ILC) on the protection 
of persons in the event of disasters, to which the Representative has been able to provide 
input, is instructive.6 The Representative, working within the framework of the IASC, has 
further concluded that present international law fails to protect people who have no other 
choice but to leave their country as a result of disasters (e.g. because rising sea levels flood 
an entire island State as a consequence of climate change).7 
</p>
<p><b> B. Mainstreaming the human rights of the internally displaced 
</b></p>
<p>17. The mainstreaming aspect of the mandate has been an essential part of the 
Representative&#8217;s work. Throughout his tenure the Representative has been a standing 
invitee to the IASC, a forum for coordination, policy development and decision-making in 
the humanitarian area. He regularly participates at the IASC principals&#8217; level, while support 
staff engage at other levels, including in the global clusters on protection and early 
recovery. The participation in the IASC is crucial to promoting the human rights of 
internally displaced persons within the humanitarian community and to ensuring that 
humanitarian actors take into account concerns specific to displacement. The 
Representative is encouraged by the request of the General Assembly that he continue his 
work in the IASC8 and hopes that his successor will enjoy the same level of access, 
including at the principals&#8217; level.  
</p>
<p>18. Within the IASC, the Representative has developed two important policy 
documents, the Framework for Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons 
(A/HRC/13/21/Add.4) and the Operational Guidelines on Human Rights and Natural 
Disasters (A/HRC/4/38/Add.1, currently under revision based on the results of field 
testing). The endorsement of these documents by the IASC has significantly contributed to 
their application by humanitarian actors. 
</p>
<p>19. The Representative has helped to trigger and shape the IASC analysis of the 
humanitarian implications of climate change, which resulted in shared terminology on 
different affected populations and a common understanding of the normative frameworks 
for their protection and the legal and institutional gaps. This work culminated in joint 
advocacy efforts on the humanitarian implications of climate change in the negotiations on 
a United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  
</p>
<p>20. The Representative continued to engage with the World Bank and contributed to the 
development of its new three-year work programme on forced displacement.  
</p>

and specific protection and assistance needs of internally displaced persons in peace 
processes, peace agreements and reintegration and rehabilitation processes (see resolution

<p>6/32), the Representative deepened his engagement with the Peacebuilding Commission. 
Together with UNHCR, he conducted a lessons-learned meeting in 2008 on addressing 
internal displacement in peacebuilding. Further, he contributed to the peacebuilding 
strategy for the Central African Republic and intends to extend his cooperation to the 
peacebuilding strategy for Burundi. The Representative is pleased to report that the guide 
on internal displacement and peace processes for mediators, which he developed in 
cooperation with the Mediation Support Unit of the Department for Political Affairs and 
humanitarian, human rights and mediation experts, is ready for publication.9 
</p>
<p>22. Outside the United Nations system, the Representative has attached great importance 
to working with regional, subregional and other international organizations. During the 
course of last year, the Representative addressed the 120th Assembly Meeting of the Inter-
Parliamentary Union in Addis Ababa on 9 April 2009 and the Parliamentary Assembly of 
the Council of Europe in Strasbourg on 24 June 2009 (A/64/214, paras. 74&#8211;75). From 9 to 
10 July 2009, the Executive Secretariat of the International Conference on the Great Lakes 
Region, together with the Representative, OCHA, OHCHR, IDMC and the Brookings-Bern 
Project on Internal Displacement, conducted a workshop in Nairobi on the implementation 
of the Protocol on the Protection and Assistance to Internally Displaced Persons (A/64/214, 
paras. 76&#8211;79). On 22 October 2009, the Representative addressed the African Union 
historic Special Summit of Heads of State and Government on Refugees, Returnees and 
Internally Displaced Persons, which adopted the Kampala Convention. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Country engagement</b>10<b> 
</b></p>
<p>23. In accordance with his mandate, the Representative has consistently sought to 
engage with States on the basis of a constructive, transparent and sustained dialogue, 
encouraging rights-based and pragmatic solutions to concerns identified, while 
acknowledging good practices and progress made.  
</p>
<p>24. The Representative notes with appreciation that the vast majority of States have 
heeded the call of the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly to respond 
favourably to his requests for visits and information. During the course of his tenure, he has 
been able to carry out, up to the end of 2009, a total of 16 missions and 26 follow-up and 
working visits to the following member States: Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, Chad, the Central African Republic, Colombia, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Croatia, 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Georgia, Honduras, Israel, Kenya, Lebanon, 
Madagascar, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, Serbia, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Timor-
Leste, Turkey, Uganda and the United States of America. He would like to undertake one 
more mission before the end of his tenure and carry out shorter visits to Burundi, Chad, the 
Central African Republic and Turkey. The Representative thanks the member States that 
readily agreed to receive or, in several cases, even took the initiative to invite him, in 
particular for follow-up visits.  
</p>
<p>25. The Representative regrets that, due to the security situation or time constraints on 
his side he was unable to visit several countries facing serious displacement challenges. He 
regrets that, in August 2009, the Philippines declined to issue an invitation, referencing &#8220;the 
current peace and order situation in Mindanao and other equally important priorities of the

</p>
<p>Government&#8221;. In 2006, the Russian Federation agreed to a requested visit but was never in 
a position to indicate suitable dates. The Representative maintains his interest in carrying 
out the visit to Sudan (in particular the Darfur region) to which the Government agreed in 
2007 and regrets that the Government, despite repeated discussions, has been unable to 
confirm dates for such a visit.  
</p>
<p><b>  Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Representative carried out two working visits: from 2 to 6 April 2009, shortly 
before the end of hostilities, and again from 23 to 26 September 2009, at a time when the 
security situation had vastly improved, but over 250,000 internally displaced were still held 
in closed camps. Restoration of their freedom of movement had become a matter of 
urgency and it was imperative for the Government of Sri Lanka to comply with its 
commitments under international law. The Representative discussed a three-pronged 
strategy for decongesting the camps with the Government, based on returns of internally 
displaced persons to their homes, their release to host families and their temporary transfer 
to welfare centres in return areas until they were able to go back to their homes. The 
Representative urged the Government to pursue these options in parallel and with the 
highest priority. Since his visit, this process has started. At the time of writing, almost 
149,000 internally displaced persons have been released to host families or have returned to 
Jaffna, Mannar, Trincomalee, and Batticaloa as well as to Vavuniya and Killionochi.  
</p>
<p>27. The increased freedom of movement for the 135,000 internally displaced persons 
who remain in camps is a welcome step towards fully restoring free movement and finding 
a durable solution for all the displaced in Sri Lanka. A letter received by the Representative 
dated 23 November 2009 from the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights 
notes that the Government is endeavouring to complete the resettlement process by the end 
of January 2010, including for the old caseload of internally displaced, with due attention 
paid to their human rights. 
</p>
<p>28. The Representative emphasizes that return operations must be conducted in 
accordance with international standards to ensure the physical safety of returning internally 
displaced persons. He acknowledges the demining and reconstruction efforts being 
undertaken in return areas, but notes that concerns over mined areas, restrictions on 
freedom of movement and lack of access to basic services remain. Increased information 
for internally displaced persons provided by the Ministry of Resettlement and Disaster 
Relief Services and increased access of national non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
to some of the return areas are positive developments. The Representative encourages the 
Government to extend access to other NGOs as well, including international NGOs.  
</p>
<p><b>  Follow-up visit to the 2005 mission to Serbia and Montenegro 
</b></p>
<p>29. From 28 June to 4 July 2009 the Representative carried out a visit 
(A/HRC/13/21/Add.1) following up on a mission he undertook in 2005 to then Serbia and 
Montenegro (E/CN.4/2006/71/Add.5). Many of the more than 200,000 persons internally 
displaced from and within Kosovo11 have not yet found a durable solution. Authorities in 
Pristina/e expressed their commitment to facilitate the return of displaced persons, 
regardless of their ethnicity. However, due to entrenched patterns of discrimination and also 
a lack of support, in particular at the municipal level, there have been very few sustainable 
returns. The Representative is especially concerned that internally displaced Roma in

<p>northern Mitrovica/Mitrovic&#235;, including children, remain exposed to toxic lead waste, 
despite some progress in relocating them to safer areas. 
</p>
<p>30. It is commendable that the Government of Serbia has increased measures to improve 
the living and economic conditions of internally displaced persons who have not returned. 
However, vulnerable persons who have resided in collective centres for more than a decade 
and many Roma, particularly those without a registered place of residence, remain in a very 
difficult situation. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Uganda 
</b></p>
<p>31. From 13 to 17 July 2009, the Representative carried out a follow-up working visit to 
Uganda (A/64/214, paras. 70&#8211;73). The majority of the formerly 1.8 million internally 
displaced persons have returned to their villages and the Representative expressed his 
appreciation to the Government for its continued efforts. Making the returns sustainable, 
however, remains a challenge that must be addressed by quick impact recovery and 
development projects requiring the strong support of development agencies and donors. 
Despite the significant progress made thus far, the fate of a considerable number of 
especially vulnerable individuals left behind in camps with urgent humanitarian needs, as 
well as the lack of synchronization between the phasing out of humanitarian assistance and 
the undertaking of development activities, continues to be a source of concern. 
</p>
<p><b>  Somalia 
</b></p>
<p>32. From 14 to 21 October 2009, the Representative visited Somalia 
(A/HRC/13/21/Add.2). He was appalled by the degree of violence that the civilian 
population and in particular internally displaced persons in south and central Somalia 
suffer. Serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law are committed 
in an environment of impunity and are a major cause of displacement. Over 1.5 million 
internally displaced persons, the vast majority of whom are women and children, remain 
highly vulnerable and exposed to serious human rights violations, in particular sexual 
violence, during flight and in settlements of internally displaced persons. Many try to reach 
safety in urban centres in Puntland or Somaliland, putting enormous strain on the limited 
existing resources and basic services available there. Shrinking humanitarian space, severe 
constraints on humanitarian access, security risks for humanitarian workers, and the sharp 
decline in donor contributions exacerbate this long-standing and neglected humanitarian 
crisis.  
</p>
<p><b>  Visit to Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia as follow-up to the 2008 mission to Georgia 
</b></p>
<p>33. From 5 to 6 November 2009, the Representative visited the Tskhinvali region/South 
Ossetia (A/HRC/13/21/Add.3) to follow up on his mission to Georgia in October 2008 
(A/HRC/10/13/Add.2). Internal displacement from, and within, the Tskhinvali region/South 
Ossetia was linked to serious violations of international humanitarian law, in particular the 
systematic destruction and looting, on ethno-political grounds, of a number of ethnic 
Georgian villages, but also indiscriminate attacks in and around Tskhinvali. International 
humanitarian access and freedom of movement across the de facto border remain the most 
pressing challenges. Comprehensive solutions have to be found that provide for voluntary 
and dignified return and restitution of property and take into account the recent and past 
conflicts. 
</p>
<p>34. The Representative acknowledges with appreciation that since his mission to 
Georgia in 2008, the Government has adopted and started to implement an action plan to 
improve, in particular, the housing conditions of the long-term internally displaced who still 
live in collective centres. </p>

<p><b>  Bosnia and Herzegovina 
</b></p>
<p>35. From 11 to 13 November 2009, the Representative carried out a short visit to Bosnia 
and Herzegovina during which he had the opportunity to discuss the stalled adoption of the 
revised strategy on the implementation of Annex VII of the Dayton Agreement with the 
Chairperson of the Presidency and senior officials. Emphasizing that the adoption of a 
revised strategy would help improve the situation of internally displaced persons, the 
Representative recommended that obstacles to sustainable returns be removed. While many 
internally displaced persons still want to return, a large number of traumatized and 
vulnerable displaced are in need of local integration, including most of the 7,500 internally 
displaced persons who still live in decrepit collective centres.  
</p>
<p><b>  Conference on Iraqi displacement in Doha 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Representative continued to focus on Iraq, which remains the country with the 
third-largest number of internally displaced persons in the world. From 18 to 19 November 
2009, he participated in a two-day conference on Iraqi displacement, organized by the 
Brookings-Bern Project on Internal Displacement in Doha, which brought together 
representatives from Iraq and other member States in the region, international 
organizations, NGOs and donors. Now that returns of internally displaced persons and, to a 
lesser extent, refugees have begun, the Government of Iraq is facing the challenge of 
creating durable solutions for the displaced. The conference stressed that a comprehensive 
approach with the committed involvement of development actors and effective coordination 
mechanisms is needed to bring together humanitarian action, long-term development efforts 
and initiatives to reinforce security, political stability and good governance.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Training and capacity-building initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Representative has continued his capacity-building efforts to foster a better 
understanding of the Guiding Principles and promote sound, rights-based national policies 
and laws on internal displacement. He has placed emphasis on training officials and other 
national stakeholders confronted with the challenges of internal displacement on a daily 
basis. The comprehensive Manual for Law and Policymakers on Protecting Internally 
Displaced Persons12 and the annual San Remo course on the law of internal displacement 
that aims to train high-level officials from across the world, and will again be offered in 
June 2010, have been the cornerstones of these efforts.  
</p>
<p>38. In 2009, the Representative and the Brookings-Bern Project have continued to hold 
capacity-building workshops on protection in natural disasters with representatives from the 
respective regions: Chennai, India (9&#8211;10 April 2009), Guatemala City (28&#8211;29 May 2009) 
and Bangkok (18&#8211;19 June 2009).  </p>
<p><b> III. Internal displacement in 2010: What are the major 
challenges?

<p>GE.10-10161 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>progress remains to be translated into positive action on the ground. Some of the major 
challenges that need to be addressed are set out below.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Moving beyond conflicts and camps 
</b></p>
<p>40. The stereotypical image of internally displaced persons &#8212; reinforced by media 
reports &#8212; remains that of people who flee conflict areas and end up destitute in camps or 
collective shelters. The reality is far more complex. Every year more people are displaced 
by natural disasters and development projects than by conflict and violence. The majority 
of the displaced live with host families or communities, or merge with the urban poor. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Natural disasters, climate change and internal displacement 
</b></p>
<p>41. Natural disasters displace more people than any other cause but their displacement 
tends to be shorter than conflict or violence-related displacement.13 The effects of climate 
change are likely to further increase the numbers of the disaster-displaced.14 Not only is 
climate change expected to increase the magnitude and frequency of sudden-onset disasters 
such as storms or flooding, but it is also likely to exacerbate slow-onset disasters, including 
droughts, desertification, and rising sea levels, that also force people to move.15 As a result 
of the effects of climate change, between 50 and 250 million people may move by the 
middle of the century on a permanent or temporary basis.16 Many of them will move 
voluntarily as part of adaptation strategies of families and communities, yet others will have 
no other choice but to leave their homes. Most of these displaced will stay within their 
country as internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>42. Although the 1998 Guiding Principles already identify natural disasters as one of the 
causes of internal displacement, natural disasters and their human consequences were for a 
long time not considered through the lens of internal displacement. This changed in the 
wake of large-scale disasters such as the tsunami of 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, 
with the Representative emphasizing the relevance of the Guiding Principles to such 
situations. 
</p>
<p>43. After visiting a number of countries affected by disaster-induced displacement, the 
Representative found that too often insufficient attention is paid to the multiple human 
rights challenges they face in these situations.17 The rights of persons displaced by natural 
disasters often suffer not only because of weaknesses in the disaster response but also 
because disaster preparedness and disaster mitigation measures were not adequately put 
into effect. Disaster induced displacement often exacerbates pre-existing patterns of 
discrimination, putting already marginalized and vulnerable groups at increased risk of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>13
 According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC)/Office for the Coordination of 
</p>
<p>Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), <i>Monitoring Disaster Displacement in the Context of Climate Change</i> 
(September 2009), at least 36 million people were displaced by sudden-onset natural disasters which 
occurred in 2008, compared to 4.6 million people who were newly internally displaced during the 
same year as a result of conflict and violence.

<p>16
 The first IPCC assessment report (1990) noted that the greatest single impact of climate change might 
</p>
<p>be on human migration and estimated that by 2050, 150 million people could be displaced by climate 
change-related phenomena, such as desertification, increasing water scarcity, and floods and storms. 
More recent studies refer to estimates for the same period of 200 million (Stern Review 2006) and 
250 million (Christian Aid (2007), <i>Human tide: the real migration crisis</i>).

</p>
<p>human rights abuse. The result can be insufficient or inappropriate protection from threats 
caused by the effects of disaster; unequal access to humanitarian assistance, in particular for 
displaced women; discrimination in the provision of assistance; sexual and gender-based 
violence, particularly in collective shelters or camps; infringements of the right to 
education; non-replacement of lost, confiscated or destroyed documents; economic and 
sexual exploitation of children in the absence of sufficient assistance; unsafe or involuntary 
returns or forced relocations to other parts of the country; or failure to restore property and 
reconstruct houses or provide compensation.  
</p>
<p>44. Such disregard for the human rights of those affected by natural disasters is not 
necessarily intentional, but often results from inappropriate policies, a lack of capacity to 
appropriately respond to the disaster and the challenges of reconstruction, or simple 
oversight. Therefore, it is necessary to use a human rights based approach to early warning, 
disaster contingency planning, disaster management and mitigation, and efforts to find 
durable solutions for the displaced. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Development-induced displacement 
</b></p>
<p>45. Another area that requires more attention is the protection of persons who are 
obliged to leave their homes due to development projects, including urban planning and 
construction activities. Such persons are without doubt internally displaced persons.18 This 
is explicitly recognized by the Kampala Convention which addresses displacement induced 
by development projects. 
</p><p>46. The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE), a non-governmental 
organization, estimates that 1.6 million people were forcibly evicted in 2007 and 2008 &#8211; in 
many cases without consultation, adequate alternatives or compensation and therefore 
contrary to the Guiding Principles.19 UN-HABITAT has warned that forced evictions are 
increasing.20 Profound socio-economic change in rapidly growing urban centres, increased 
efforts to exploit natural resources (including renewable sources of energy), and mega-
events such as international sporting events21 are all contributing factors. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. The &#8220;invisible displaced&#8221; in urban areas and host families 
</b></p>
<p>47. Internally displaced persons are often dispersed in urban areas and required to find 
their own accommodation, stay in collective centres and public buildings such as schools, 
or live with host families. The number of urban internally displaced is likely to increase 
significantly in the future, largely due to today&#8217;s rapid urbanization.22 Identifying and 
protecting them and addressing their specific needs, without neglecting the resident urban 
poor and migrants from rural areas, are challenges that deserve more attention. In this 
respect, it is important to recognize the particular pressures on municipal authorities.

</b></p>
<p>48. In rural settings, internally displaced persons often stay with host families or host 
communities. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for instance, an estimated 70 per 
cent of internally displaced persons have been taken in by host families in keeping with 
African traditions of hospitality.23 Accessing and supporting these internally displaced 
persons and their hosts are often not given enough priority by national authorities and their 
humanitarian partners. 
</p>
<p>49. Host communities and host families often end up assuming considerable burdens 
due to the influx of displaced persons, which may create social tensions and further 
protection concerns.24 In this respect a concept of &#8220;displacement-affected communities&#8221;  is 
helpful in recognizing that not only displaced communities but also communities which 
host or (re)integrate them are affected by internal displacement. The Representative has 
consistently encouraged donors and humanitarians to expand their focus and extend 
protection and assistance to a broader spectrum of beneficiaries. Such activities should go 
beyond delivering humanitarian aid and include development interventions to strengthen 
basic infrastructure such as water and sanitation and basic services such as health and 
education, and increase food security and the availability of shelter. Such interventions may 
be less costly in the long run and would not only help to address the needs of the displaced 
but, at the same time, contribute to the development of areas and communities receiving 
them. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Unrecognized internally displaced persons 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Representative is concerned that there are several States that host large numbers 
of internally displaced persons but do not recognize them as such &#8211; sometimes going to 
great lengths to re-label the internally displaced as &#8220;mobile and vulnerable populations&#8221;, 
&#8220;dislocated people&#8221; or &#8220;internal migrants&#8221; despite international recognition of the 
description of internally displaced persons in the Guiding Principles (see above, paragraphs 
11&#8211;14). 
</p><p>51. Internally displaced persons who are not recognized as such often find their specific 
needs inadequately addressed, including by being excluded from assistance programmes 
targeting vulnerable populations. Regrettably, the Representative has experienced 
difficulties in gaining access to States where the existence of internal displacement is 
denied. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Addressing multiple layers of vulnerability and discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>52. Some observers still question special protection and assistance interventions on the 
basis of internal displacement, arguing that this tends to detract attention from the true 
causes of vulnerability such as poverty, gender or ethnic minority status, or that it 
disregards the needs of other affected populations unable to reach a safer part of the 
country. 
</p>
<p>53. While internally displaced persons may not always be worse off than non-displaced 
populations, they require special protection and assistance because displacement creates 
specific needs and vulnerabilities not experienced by others. Internally displaced persons 
lose their homes, forcing them to find alternative shelter or to live in camps or collective 
shelters with their specific problems. They also lose their livelihoods, means of survival and 
social and cultural networks, regularly leading to impoverishment, marginalization,

<p><b>14</b> GE.10-10161 
</p>
<p>exclusion from basic services and even stigmatization. Unlike those remaining in their 
homes, the displaced leave their property behind, risking its occupation by others and 
creating the challenge of how to have it restored. They may not be able to replace lost 
documentation or participate freely in elections. Finally, displaced people alone are in need 
of finding a durable solution to their displacement. 
</p>
<p>54. Displacement exacerbates pre-existing vulnerabilities and creates new ones. In many 
crisis situations the displaced, especially children and the elderly among them, are 
disproportionally affected by malnutrition and a lack of potable water.25 According to the 
World Health Organization, internally displaced persons are particularly exposed to health 
hazards.26 In urban settings, internally displaced persons are often worse off than the non-
displaced urban poor.27 People displaced to locations where they constitute an ethnic, 
religious or other minority face particular problems.28 
</p>
<p>55. Persons with multiple vulnerabilities and needs are often overlooked, especially 
where no authority or humanitarian organization is specifically mandated to protect them. 
The Representative found that the elderly, persons with disabilities and members of 
indigenous peoples, who often face particular problems in adapting to new environments, 
are regularly neglected in displacement situations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Working with States to assume their responsibilities towards the 
displaced 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Representative notes the increasing efforts of many States to assume their 
primary duty and responsibility to provide protection and humanitarian assistance to 
internally displaced persons (Guiding Principle 3 (1)). At the same time, many of the most 
serious and intractable displacement situations can be found in weak States that have little 
capacity to assume their responsibilities. The Representative has been engaged in several 
situations where State authorities had failed to exercise their responsibility towards the 
displaced and consequently international humanitarian, political, and military actors tried to 
substitute for the State, typically under conditions of precarious security and shrinking 
humanitarian space. This issue becomes particularly vexing when the State itself 
deliberately and arbitrarily displaced the very people it is then called upon to protect and 
assist. 
</p>
<p>57. In emergency situations, a certain degree of substitution on the part of the 
international community for State authority is often unavoidable and necessary to save 
lives. In the medium to long run, however, substitution is not a sustainable approach given 
that the capacity, deployment period and understanding of the dynamics on the ground of 
the international community are typically limited. 
</p>
<p>58. The Representative considers that greater efforts have to be made on the part of the 
international community to work with national and local authorities in weak States and 
strengthen their capacities, instead of taking the easier short cut of substitution that often 
leads to a dead end. Encouraging the development of laws and policies on internal 
displacement can be a first step to engaging the relevant authorities. Laws and policies of 
course do not automatically result in action on the ground, but they are a necessary

<p>precondition for authorities to assume their expected role. If soundly drafted, they define 
responsibilities within government, establish coordination mechanisms and set priorities 
and activities to which national budget lines and earmarked donor funding can be tied. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Institutional progress: from picking and choosing to a more systematic  
and predictable approach 
</b></p>
<p>59. Given the fact that there is no organization within the United Nations and the larger 
humanitarian community with a clear mandate to assist and protect internally displaced 
persons, a so-called collaborative approach was followed until 2004. Nevertheless, a 2005 
report concluded that &#8220;the absence of operational accountability and leadership in key 
sectors of IDP-specific vulnerability&#8221; was &#8212; despite that approach &#8212; &#8220;[t]he major 
weakness in recent responses to IDP crises&#8221; resulting in an inconsistent and unpredictable 
engagement of humanitarian actors.29 The humanitarian reform initiative of 2005 sought to 
overcome these deficiencies by bringing transparency and consistency, predictability and 
accountability, through the introduction of the cluster approach in which different 
organizations would assume lead coordinating responsibilities for internally displaced 
persons in their areas of expertise. This reform had a remarkable impact on United Nations 
engagement in situations of internal displacement, especially in the emergency phase, with 
clearer responsibilities assigned and better coordination provided. New funding 
mechanisms, in particular the Central Emergency Response Fund, were also successfully 
introduced to provide immediate funding of relief activities in developing crises to address 
the needs of internally displaced persons in a timely manner, and to cover urgent needs in 
underfunded protracted crises. 
</p>
<p>60. Cluster responsibilities at the global and national level have brought more 
predictability and helped to close gaps in the humanitarian response to internally displaced 
persons. In particular, UNHCR, as the cluster lead for the protection of internally displaced 
persons in conflict settings, emergency shelter, and camp management has taken on 
considerable responsibilities, including the role of &#8220;provider of last resort&#8221;. In order to live 
up to these new commitments, UNHCR has increased its operational engagement and 
provided for institutional and budgetary amendments. However, the capacities of UNHCR, 
as well as those of its partners, in particular as regards training and adequate staff numbers, 
as well as the capacity to provide guidance in the area of protection, are still very limited 
compared to the overall needs of the displaced. A more robust and decisive engagement 
will be required. 
</p>
<p>61. International mechanisms to protect internally displaced persons in situations of 
natural disasters are often not effective due to lack of understanding, knowledge and the 
capacity to address threats arising in disaster settings. OHCHR, UNHCR and UNICEF are 
still struggling to develop the capacity on the ground to match the commitment to leading 
on protection in disaster settings that they assumed during the course of the 2005 
humanitarian reform initiative. The Representative therefore welcomes the expressed 
commitment of UNHCR to fill this gap within the IASC framework and in consultation 
with UNICEF and OHCHR,30 and hopes that its capacities will be enhanced accordingly.

</p>
<p>The Representative also encourages OHCHR and UNICEF to reinforce their efforts to 
increase capacity at headquarters and on the ground. 
</p>
<p>62. The 2005 humanitarian reform initiative created an early recovery cluster,31 with 
UNDP as lead, thus acknowledging the importance of the transition between humanitarian 
action in emergency situations and steps towards full recovery. The Representative has on 
several occasions32 observed a gap between the phasing out by humanitarian actors and the 
arrival of development actors. He stresses the need for humanitarian and development 
actors to work hand in hand and to begin recovery activities as early as possible. Present 
weaknesses in early recovery activities are exacerbated by underfunding of the early 
recovery cluster and the lack of flexible funding mechanisms in this area. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Upholding distinctions between humanitarian and military roles 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Representative has observed in several countries the difficult relationship 
between United Nations political or peacekeeping missions and humanitarian actors, 
particularly where they were part of integrated missions. He welcomes efforts to strengthen 
the capabilities of United Nations peacekeeping operations to protect civilians, including 
internally displaced persons, and the fact that such missions often have a positive impact on 
humanitarian action on the ground, including by improving the security situation or 
facilitating humanitarian access. However, their impact can also be negative and even 
impair humanitarian activities, in particular where the mission is mandated to support 
militarily or politically one party to the conflict. 
</p>
<p>64. Where both humanitarian and military efforts to broaden protection of civilians 
coincide, the Representative has emphasized that the fundamental distinction between 
humanitarian action and military action be upheld at all times so as not to call into question 
the impartiality of humanitarian activities.33 Fostering a mutual understanding of each 
other&#8217;s role will certainly contribute to better coordination. The political and military arms 
of an integrated mission should reach out to non-United Nations humanitarian actors to 
promote this understanding. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Defending humanitarian space 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Representative is very concerned that the humanitarian space required to 
effectively protect and assist internally displaced persons is shrinking. Long-standing 
logistical difficulties in accessing people in crisis areas have been compounded by serious 
security concerns for humanitarian workers. In 2008, 260 humanitarian aid workers were 
killed, kidnapped or seriously injured in violent attacks, more than in any previous year on 
record.34 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>31
 The concept of early recovery has been defined as the application of development principles to 
</p>
<p>humanitarian situations in order to stabilize local and national capacities from further deterioration so 
that they can provide the foundation for full recovery, and stimulate spontaneous recovery activities 
within the affected population. Stabilizing and using these capacities in turn reduces the amount of 
humanitarian support required. See United Nations Development Programme Policy on Early 
Recovery (22 August 2008), at 1.1.

<p>GE.10-10161 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>66. General insecurity in crisis-affected States suffering from a breakdown of law and 
order is on the rise. Virtually all modern armed conflicts involve non-State armed groups 
and many of them operate more like unscrupulous criminal gangs than armed political 
movements with a sense of respect for humanitarian principles. In several countries, 
humanitarian operations have been deliberately targeted in attacks. Internally displaced 
persons and other crisis-affected populations suffer the consequences (and this destabilizing 
effect may be the very intent of attacks on humanitarians). 
</p><p>67. General insecurity and targeted attacks on humanitarian workers have led to the 
evacuation of humanitarian personnel, the imposition of staff ceilings for international staff, 
strict curfews and movement restrictions. Humanitarian actors are more and more forced 
into remote management of operations, which creates new and additional challenges. 
</p>
<p>68. The Representative is also alarmed by the fact that certain States, invoking national 
sovereignty as a cover, deny humanitarian access or make it subject to conditions that 
would make humanitarian actors complicit in violations of international law. Also on the 
increase are harassment, intimidation, the arbitrary expulsion of aid workers or the 
imposition of bureaucratic obstacles to prevent their timely deployment, measures that have 
the apparent aim of limiting the effectiveness of &#8220;protection by presence&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Ensuring accountability for arbitrary internal displacement 
</b></p>
<p>69. Year after year, a large number of people are arbitrarily displaced in violation of 
international human rights and humanitarian law as restated in the Guiding Principles.35 
One of the most effective ways to stop arbitrary displacement from occurring is for all 
relevant actors to scrupulously respect their obligations and to put an end to impunity, 
ensuring that those responsible for carrying out arbitrary displacement and other violations 
of the rights of the displaced are held accountable. 
</p>
<p>70. The Representative is pleased to note an increasing trend to criminalize the most 
atrocious forms of arbitrary displacement, including ethnic cleansing. The Rome Statute of 
the International Criminal Court recognizes that certain types of arbitrary displacement may 
amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity.36 
</p>
<p>71. It is also worth noting that the Kampala Convention obliges States to hold members 
of armed groups criminally responsible for violations of the rights of the displaced, 
including arbitrary displacement.37 A number of countries such as Colombia have already 
criminalized arbitrary displacement in their penal legislation, although the number of 
prosecutions and convictions remains low.

<p>reparation.38 Reparations can take different forms. In some cases, it may be sufficient to 
provide restitution by restoring the status quo before displacement. In other cases, 
especially those involving crimes against humanity, war crimes or ethnic cleansing, victims 
of arbitrary displacement will also be entitled to monetary compensation. Compensation 
laws must not arbitrarily differentiate between different types and causes of displacement 
and must respect the principle of equality before the law. 
</p>
<p>73. Arbitrary displacement can also be caused by negligence, especially where 
authorities fail to exercise their obligation to take all reasonable and necessary measures to 
protect life, physical integrity, health and property from natural disasters. The 
Representative notes the growing body of law holding authorities accountable for such 
failures. The European Court of Human Rights has ordered States to pay compensation for 
having negligently failed to take appropriate measures to protect people from natural or 
human-made hazards.39 The Kampala Convention also stipulates that States parties are 
liable to make reparation if they fail to protect and assist internally displaced persons in the 
event of natural disasters.40 
</p>
<p><b> H. Overcoming the politics of protracted displacement 
</b></p>
<p>74. In at least 35 countries internally displaced persons find themselves in protracted 
situations,41 meaning that processes to find durable solutions for them have stalled and the 
displaced are marginalized, and their rights, in particular economic, social and cultural 
rights, are not protected. Internally displaced persons in protracted situations often live in 
inhumane conditions and have no realistic chance of accessing opportunities to earn a 
living. The Representative has consistently found that the most likely victims of protracted 
displacement are the most vulnerable within the displaced population and include the 
elderly, people with disabilities, female-headed households and minorities.42 
</p>
<p>75. In conflict situations, political factors are often the primary cause of protracted 
displacement with parties to the conflicts not willing to achieve peace, which would allow 
the displaced to return. Even after major hostilities have ceased, resolution of the 
underlying conflict is often frozen and internally displaced persons are at risk of being 
manipulated as pawns. They cannot return, because they are seen as being associated with 
the enemy. At the same time, they are often prevented from integrating locally, because 
political decision makers calculate that continued pressure to return will uphold their 
territorial claims. 
</p>
<p>76. The Representative has consistently emphasized that allowing internally displaced 
persons to normalize their living situation does not in any way extinguish their right to 
return. On the contrary, people who have regained control of their lives are in a much 
stronger position to eventually achieve a durable solution, while also posing less of a 
burden to local communities and social services. The Representative has engaged with the

issue and notes that this has led to some positive policy changes on the part of the 
Governments concerned. 
</p>
<p>77. Modern peace agreements emphasize the right to return of all displaced, which is a 
positive trend. At the same time, there is a tendency to neglect those who are not willing or 
able to return. The Representative, sometimes with success,43 has suggested on several 
occasions to negotiators that they recognize the right of internally displaced persons to 
freely choose between return, local integration and settlement in another part of the country 
in accordance with the Guiding Principles. Involving all sectors of the displaced at least 
indirectly in peace processes, an issue on which the Representative has worked 
extensively,44 should ensure that peace agreements and peacebuilding efforts reflect the 
rights, needs and legitimate interests of the displaced. 
</p>
<p>78. Protracted displacement can also be the product of political indifference on the part 
of national authorities, development actors and donors. Internally displaced persons, who 
may have received generous humanitarian assistance at the height of a crisis, are often 
forgotten as soon as the guns fall silent or the flood waters recede. Without assistance in re-
establishing their lives (and their livelihoods in particular) the displaced enter a vicious 
cycle of dependency on aid and protracted displacement. The continued failure of the donor 
community to adequately fund early recovery strategies and activities is particularly 
worrisome in this regard. 
</p>
<p>79. The Representative is also concerned that refugee or other protected status for 
persons seeking protection abroad is sometimes revoked prematurely so that people are 
forced to return home without conditions or programmes in place for their reintegration, 
thus leading to situations where returned persons end up in protracted internal 
displacement.45 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Allowing the displaced to move on with their lives: durable 
solutions 
</b></p>
<p>80. Durable solutions for internally displaced persons &#8212; the very opposite of protracted 
displacement &#8212; are often simplistically equated with returns. It is important to emphasize 
that a durable solution can be achieved through (a) return and sustainable reintegration in 
the place of origin, (b) sustainable integration in local areas where internally displaced 
persons have taken refuge, or (c) settlement and sustainable integration in any other part of 
the country. There is no inherent hierarchy among these options. The internally displaced 
have the right to make an informed and voluntary choice as to the durable solution they 
would like to pursue. 
</p>
<p>81. Building a durable solution is a complex process of gradually achieving a situation 
where the internally displaced no longer have any displacement-specific needs and can 
enjoy their human rights without discrimination related to their displacement. Families torn 
apart by conflict or disaster have to be reunited. Livelihoods, housing, land and property 
and public services have to be reconstructed so that internally displaced persons can enjoy 
an adequate standard of living. In cases involving arbitrary displacement and other serious 
violations, it is often also necessary to restore a sense of justice and provide the displaced

<p>with effective remedies for the violations they suffered (see also above in chapter III, 
section G). 
</p><p>82. While providing the conditions and related means for durable solutions is primarily 
the responsibility of national and local authorities (see Guiding Principle 28), international 
development, political and human rights actors often need to become involved to provide 
support, including to bridge the transition period after the emergency. The Representative is 
therefore pleased to note that the Peacebuilding Commission, the World Bank and UNDP 
are increasingly recognizing the links between displacement, durable solutions and their 
own mandates. 
</p>
<p>83. In 2007, based on a request from the Emergency Relief Coordinator and after 
extensive consultations, the Representative released the pilot version of the Framework on 
Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons. The Framework provides guidance on 
how to support such solutions and establishes criteria for assessing to what extent a durable 
solution has been achieved. Feedback from the field provided the basis for a further review 
of the Framework, which is presented to the Human Rights Council in its final form 
(A/HRC/13/21/Add.4). The Framework, endorsed by the IASC, is primarily aimed at 
guiding international and non-governmental humanitarian and development actors on how 
to work with governments in supporting durable solutions. As it also provides a response to 
the requests by the Council for ways to strengthen durable solutions and benchmarks for 
assessing when displacement ends (resolution 6/32, para. 7), the Framework should also be 
useful to member States affected by internal displacement and to donors. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>84. <b>Millions of people are being newly internally displaced every year as a result of 
conflict and violence. Disasters displace even more people and the effects of climate 
change will exacerbate this trend. Development-induced displacement is also on the 
rise. With international attention focused on camps of internally displaced persons, 
many other displaced remain invisible, because they stay with host families, are 
dispersed in urban areas or their existence is officially denied. Some vulnerable 
groups within the displaced population are also regularly overlooked. Host families 
and communities are often heavily affected by displacement, but they are often 
neglected. The Representative urges member States and humanitarian and 
development actors to expand their scope of action and recommends that they: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Recognize, protect and assist all internally displaced persons in 
accordance with the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, including people 
displaced by natural and human-made disasters and people evicted in the context of 
development; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Increase efforts to protect and assist the urban displaced, including 
through development efforts and measures to assist host families as well as 
displacement-affected communities generally; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Pay greater attention to internally displaced persons with multiple layers 
of vulnerability and discrimination, especially elderly persons and those with 
disabilities, women heads of households and their children, and displaced persons 
belonging to ethnic minorities or indigenous peoples. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>While the protection of internally displaced persons is the primary 
responsibility of national authorities, many of the countries most affected by internal 
displacement have weak State institutions with little capacity to assume this </b></p>


<p>GE.10-10161 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsibility. The Representative urges all member States to show solidarity with the 
displaced and other crisis-affected populations and recommends that they: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a) Promote recognition of the Guiding Principles at the national level, 
including through domestic law and policies; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Undertake consultations with displaced populations on their conditions 
and needs; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Assist national, provincial and local authorities, including 
parliamentarians, in creating and implementing the necessary laws and policies on 
internal displacement and related issues such as disaster management or property 
restitution; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Continue to recognize that the protection of internally displaced persons 
and other crisis-affected populations is also an international concern; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Incorporate the Guiding Principles into international monitoring 
mechanisms such as the universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council and 
regional instruments; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Provide all necessary humanitarian assistance to displaced persons, 
continue to fund such assistance and undertake concerted action where humanitarian 
access is arbitrarily denied, or humanitarian staff are attacked, harassed or 
discriminated against; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Ensure that international military and civilian operations have the 
mandate and actual capacity to protect the civilian population; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Ensure that the emerging framework to address climate change deals 
with the nexus between the effects of climate change and displacement and that the 
least developed countries are provided with the resources and expertise to address the 
human consequences of climate change; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Respect the right to seek and enjoy asylum, and avoid forcibly returning 
persons to their home country where they cannot find a durable solution and as a 
result become internally displaced. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Much of the internal displacement taking place today is linked to violations of 
international human rights and humanitarian law. Arbitrary displacement could be 
prevented, but too often those responsible act with impunity and no one is held 
accountable. The Representative recommends that member States: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Scrupulously respect their obligations under international human rights 
law, international humanitarian law and international criminal law, including by 
protecting their own population from arbitrary displacement by non-State actors; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Criminalize arbitrary displacement, especially to the extent that it 
amounts to an international crime, and bring all perpetrators to justice, if necessary 
by referring situations to the International Criminal Court or other special 
mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Prevent and mitigate disaster-induced displacement by adopting and 
implementing early warning mechanisms and disaster risk reduction measures. States 
should make reparation where authorities negligently fail to take all necessary and 
reasonable measures to protect the population from natural or human made hazards; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Limit forced evictions to exceptional circumstances, ensure that all 
relevant due process guarantees are respected and provide the evicted with adequate 
compensation and alternative housing and livelihood opportunities. </b></p>


<p><b>22</b> GE.10-10161 
</p>
<p>87. <b>Durable solutions constitute the ultimate form of protection for internally 
displaced persons. At the same time, the Representative sees some of the greatest 
problems in this area. Short-sighted political calculations often create protracted 
displacement situations, which are particularly difficult to transform into durable 
solutions. Despite some advances, donors and development actors are still not 
providing enough support for durable solutions, especially crucial investments in 
early recovery. The Representative recommends that member States: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Reinvigorate processes to resolve ongoing or frozen conflicts, while 
allowing the internally displaced to normalize their living situation as far as possible; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Closely cooperate with humanitarian and development actors, on the 
basis of the Framework on Durable Solutions for Internally Displaced Persons, to 
establish processes and conditions to ensure that internally displaced persons can find 
a safe and dignified durable solution of their choice; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure that the displaced are at least indirectly involved in peace 
processes so that peace agreements and peacebuilding initiatives reflect their rights, 
needs and legitimate interests; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Develop more appropriate funding mechanisms to bridge the gap 
between emergency funding and development funding, which results in the systematic 
underfunding of recovery activities. Funding mechanisms must be flexible enough to 
respond not only to the needs of internally displaced persons themselves, but also to 
the needs of all displacement-affected communities. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>With the term of the Representative coming to an end in the late summer of 
2010, the Council will have to decide about the future of the mandate. The 
Representative is of the opinion that the activities undertaken under the mandate have 
made a significant contribution to the promotion and protection of the human rights 
of internally displaced persons. The activities carried out under the mandate have 
contributed to the progressive development of the relevant conceptual, normative and 
institutional frameworks, and concrete improvements in respect of a number of 
specific country situations have been achieved. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The nature of the mandate &#8212; situated at the heart of the United Nations system 
&#8212; and its access to many different agencies and offices, in particular all levels of the 
Inter-Agency Standing Committee, have been key features that have contributed to its 
effectiveness. It has also proven to be important that the Human Rights Council 
designated the Representative to mainstream the human rights of internally displaced 
persons and flagged thematic priorities for him to consider, such as the protection of 
the displaced in situations of natural disaster or their involvement in peace processes. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The close cooperation with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, on the 
basis of institutionalized arrangements, and access to resources beyond the regular 
support provided to a special procedure mandate holder by the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, have been indispensable to taking up 
the array of tasks that the Representative has been mandated to carry out. The ability 
to work closely with institutions and non-governmental organizations outside the 
United Nations system has also reinforced the capacity of the Representative to carry 
out the responsibilities of the mandate.
