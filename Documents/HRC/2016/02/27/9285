<p> The General Assembly in its resolution 62/161 on &#8220;The right to development&#8221; reaffirmed 
the request to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in mainstreaming the 
right to development, to undertake effectively activities aimed at strengthening the global 
partnership for development between Member States, development agencies and the 
international development, financial and trade institutions, and to reflect those activities in detail 
in her next report to the Human Rights Council. It also requested the Secretary-General to submit 
a report to the Assembly at its sixty-third session and an interim report to the Council on the 
implementation of resolution 62/161, including efforts undertaken at the national, regional and 
international levels in the promotion and realization of the right to development, and invited the 
Chairperson of the Working Group on the Right to Development to present a verbal update to the 
Assembly at its sixty-third session.

<p> In accordance with the above-mentioned annual requests and corresponding reporting 
practice over the past years, the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner will submit a 
consolidated report to the Human Rights Council at its eighth session in 2008.
