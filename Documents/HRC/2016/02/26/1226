international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> all previous resolutions and decisions adopted by the Commission on 
Human Rights and the Human Rights Council on the issue of human rights and 
international solidarity, including Commission resolution 2005/55 of 20 April 2005 and 
Council resolutions 6/3 of 27 September 2007, 7/5 of 27 March 2008, 9/2 of 24 September 
2008, 12/9 of 1 October 2009, 15/13 of 30 September 2010, 17/6 of 16 June 2011, 18/5 of 
29 September 2011, 21/10 of 27 September 2012 and 23/12 of 13 June 2013, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on the institution-building of the 
Council, and 5/2, on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the 
Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his or her 
duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> the fact that the processes of promoting and protecting human rights 
should be conducted in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the 
United Nations and international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that, at the World Conference on Human Rights, held in June 1993, States 
pledged to cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to 
development, and stressed that the international community should promote effective 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>international cooperation for the realization of the right to development and the elimination 
of obstacles to development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the fact that article 4 of the Declaration on the Right to Development 
states that sustained action is required to promote more rapid development of developing 
countries and, as a complement to the efforts of developing countries, effective 
international cooperation is essential in order to provide these countries with the 
appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity as a 
vital component of the efforts of developing countries to realize the right to development of 
their peoples and to promote the full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by 
everyone has been insufficient, and in this context reaffirming the critical relevance of 
international solidarity to the post-2015 development agenda, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the recognition set forth in the declaration adopted by the Heads of 
State and Government at the Millennium Summit of the fundamental value of solidarity to 
international relations in the twenty-first century in stating that global challenges must be 
managed in a way that distributes costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with the basic 
principles of equity and social justice, and that those who suffer or benefit least deserve 
help from those who benefit most; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Also reaffirms</i> that international solidarity is not limited to international 
assistance and cooperation, aid, charity or humanitarian assistance; it is a broader concept 
and principle that includes sustainability in international relations, especially international 
economic relations, the peaceful coexistence of all members of the international 
community, equal partnerships and the equitable sharing of benefits and burdens; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Reiterates</i> <i>its determination</i> to contribute to the solution of current world 
problems through increased international cooperation, to create conditions that will ensure 
that the needs and interests of future generations are not jeopardized by the burden of the 
past, and to hand over a better world to future generations; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Reaffirms</i> the fact that the promotion of international cooperation is a duty for 
States, that it should be implemented without any conditionality and on the basis of mutual 
respect, in full compliance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United 
Nations, in particular respect for the sovereignty of States, and taking into account national 
priorities; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Welcomes</i> the report of the Independent Expert on human rights and 
international solidarity1 and the work conducted by her; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Independent Expert on human rights 
and international solidarity for a period of three years; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Requests</i> all States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations to mainstream the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity into their activities, to cooperate with the Independent 
Expert in her mandate, to supply all necessary information requested by her and to give 
serious consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the Independent Expert to 
visit their countries, and to enable her to fulfil her mandate effectively; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to provide all the human and financial resources necessary for the 
effective fulfilment of the mandate of the Independent Expert; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>9. <i>Requests </i>the Independent Expert to continue to participate in relevant 
international forums and major events with a view to promoting the importance of 
international solidarity in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and in 
the post-2015 sustainable development agenda; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Takes note </i>with appreciation of the proposed draft declaration on the right of 
peoples and individuals to international solidarity contained in the report of the independent 
expert;<footnote name="2">A/HRC/26/34/Add.1, annex. </footnote> 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Decides</i> that, in order to obtain inputs from as many Member States as 
possible on the proposed draft declaration, the Independent Expert convene regional 
consultations and/or workshops, and requests the Office of the High Commissioner to assist 
the Independent Expert in organizing these regional consultations and/or workshops; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Requests</i> the Independent Expert to consolidate and consider the outputs from 
all the regional consultations, to submit to the Human Rights Council, at its thirty-second 
session, a report on those consultations and to submit to the Council and the General 
Assembly, before the end of her second term, a revised draft declaration; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Also requests</i> the Independent Expert to report regularly to the Human Rights 
Council and the General Assembly in accordance with their respective programmes of 
work; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this matter under the same agenda 
item.
