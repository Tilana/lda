<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 6/36, the Human Rights Council established the Expert Mechanism on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as a subsidiary expert mechanism to assist the Council in the 
implementation of its mandate by providing it with thematic expertise on the rights of 
indigenous peoples, as requested by the Council. In the resolution, the Council established that 
the thematic expertise would focus mainly on studies and research-based advice, and that the 
Mechanism may suggest proposals to the Council for its consideration and approval. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Adoption of the final report on the study on indigenous 
peoples and the right to participate in decision-making 
and of proposals 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>(b) Proposes that the Human Rights Council request the Expert Mechanism to

<p>practices with the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations 
and other business enterprises. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>Proposal 2:  Consideration of the rights of indigenous peoples in the Human Rights 
Council  
</b></p>
<p>  
 <i>The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</i>: </p>
<p>(a) Welcomes the decision by the Human Rights Council to hold an interactive 
dialogue after the presentation of the annual report of the Expert Mechanism to the Human 
Rights Council and a half-day panel on the role of language and culture in promoting and 
protecting the well-being and identity of indigenous peoples,2 and proposes that the first study 
of the Expert Mechanism on lessons learned and challenges to achieve the right of indigenous 
peoples to education be considered in the context of the half-day panel discussion in 2011; 
</p>
<p>(b) Proposes that the Human Rights Council resolve to hold similar panel discussions 
on a permanent basis annually, with the participation of the Expert Mechanism and based on the 
reports of the Expert Mechanism on its thematic studies; 
</p>
<p>(c) Also proposes that the Human Rights Council request States, United Nations 
treaty bodies, special procedures and other relevant bodies and institutions to utilize the 
recommendations and advice of the Expert Mechanism within its activities; 
</p>
<p>(d) In the context of the fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples by the General Assembly, proposes that the Human Rights 
Council commemorate the event by reaffirming its commitment to the implementation of the 
Declaration and call on those States that abstained from the vote on the Declaration to change 
their position to one of support; 
</p>
<p>(e) Refers to proposal 3 from its second session3 and proposal 7 from its third session4 
on the universal periodic review, and proposes that the Human Rights Council pay close 
attention to the implementation of the recommendations concerning indigenous peoples in its 
universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b>  Proposal 3:  Strengthening indigenous peoples&#8217; participatory rights at the United  
  Nations  
</b></p>
<p><b>    </b><i>The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</i>: 
</p>
<p> (a) Refers to article 18 of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
</p>
<p>which affirms that indigenous peoples have the right to participate in decision-making in 
matters affecting their rights, through representatives chosen by them in accordance with their 
own procedures, as well as to maintain and develop their own indigenous decision-making 
institutions; 
</p>
<p>(b) Also refers to article 41 of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
which establishes a duty for the United Nations to contribute to the full realization of the

indigenous peoples on issues affecting them; 
</p>
<p>  
2 Human Rights Council resolution 15/7, paras. 7 and 8. 
3 A/HRC/12/32. 
4 A/HRC/15/36. </p>


<p>(c) Recognizes that the United Nations consultative arrangements for non-State 
entities can prevent indigenous peoples&#8217; governance bodies and institutions, including 
traditional indigenous Governments, indigenous parliaments, assemblies and councils, from 
participating in decision-making processes at the United Nations, as they are not always 
organized as non-governmental organizations; 
</p>
<p>(d) Proposes that the Human Rights Council encourage the General Assembly to 
adopt, as a matter of urgency, appropriate permanent measures to ensure that indigenous 
peoples&#8217; governance bodies and institutions, including traditional indigenous Governments, 
indigenous parliaments, assemblies and councils, are able to participate at the United Nations 
as observers with, at a minimum, the same participatory rights as non-governmental 
organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>Proposal 4:  Measures to achieve the ends of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples 
</b></p>
<p> 
 <i>The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</i>: 
 </p>

<p>(b) Proposes that the Human Rights Council request the Expert Mechanism to 
undertake, with the assistance of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, a questionnaire survey in relation to measures to apply the Declaration to 
supplement the information received at its annual session, and to provide further detail on 
possible appropriate measures and implementation strategies to ensure respect for and full 
application of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>Proposal 5:  World Conference on Indigenous Peoples 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b> <i>The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</i>: 
 </p>
<p>(a) Refers to the need for an inclusive and principled approach to ensure the full 
participation of indigenous peoples in the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples at all 
stages, &#8211; from planning and preparations through to the conference itself and any follow-up. 
Furthermore, the principle of full, formal, equal and effective participation by indigenous 
peoples should be applied to all future world conferences on the basis of the rights affirmed in 
the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; 
</p>
<p>(b) Proposes that the Human Rights Council welcome the decision by the Saami 
Parliament, in Norway, to host an indigenous preparatory conference for the World 
Conference in 2013, and requests the General Assembly and States to ensure that the outcome 
of the indigenous peoples&#8217; preparatory process is integrated into the outcome of the World 
Conference; &#160;
</p>
<p>(c) Decides that the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples should be an agenda 
item of the fifth session of the Expert Mechanism; 
</p>
<p>(d) Proposes that the Human Rights Council support the full participation of 
indigenous peoples, including youth and women, at all stages of the World Conference on 
Indigenous Peoples.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
Proposal 6:  Follow-up on the report of the Expert Mechanism on the study on lessons learned 
and challenges to achieve the right of indigenous peoples to education 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</i>: 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>(a) Encourages United Nations specialized agencies and organizations to provide 
both financial and technical support for indigenous peoples in their effort to establish their 
own education institutions in accordance with article 14 of the Declaration;  
</p>
<p>(b) Proposes that the Human Rights Council encourage States to put in place 
legislative and policy measures that would enable the development and implementation of 
traditional education systems to strengthen indigenous language and culture in promoting and 
protecting the well-being and identity of indigenous peoples, and to ensure that quality 
education becomes a national priority within States. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>Proposal 7:  International expert seminar on truth and reconciliation processes 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b> <i>The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</i>: 
 </p>
<p>(a) Noting that there is global recognition of the need to resolve the legacy of 
residential, day and boarding school systems and orphanages established globally to realize 
fully the human rights of multiple generations of indigenous peoples; 
</p>
<p>(b) Noting also that an international expert seminar on truth and reconciliation 
processes will promote reconciliation among indigenous peoples, States, churches and other 
citizens; 
</p>
<p>(c) Refers to proposal 8 from its third session,5 in which it recognized the 
significance of national truth and reconciliation processes in providing an important model and 
mechanism for improved relations between States and indigenous peoples, and encouraging 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider the 
possibility of preparing an international expert seminar on truth and reconciliation processes; 
</p>
<p>(d) Refers to the report of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues on its tenth 
session,6 in which the Forum supported an international expert seminar on truth and 
reconciliation processes; 
</p>
<p>(e) Proposes that an international expert seminar on truth and reconciliation 
processes be held in 2013. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>Proposal 8:  National human rights institutions 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>   </b><i>The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</i>: 
 </p>
<p>(a) Refers to proposal 2 from its second session7 and proposal 1 from its third 
session,8 in which it reiterated its request to national human rights institutions to effectively 
promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples; 
</p>
<p>(b) Welcomes the initiative by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights and national human rights institutions to develop an operational guide for

<p><b> III. Organization of the session 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Attendance 
</b> 
</p>
<p>3. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples held its fourth session in 
Geneva, from 11 to 15 July 2011. The members Vital Bambanze (Burundi), Anastasia 
Chukhman (Russian Federation), Jannie Lasimbang (Malaysia), Dr. Wilton Littlechild (Canada) 
and Jos&#233; Carlos Morales Morales (Costa Rica) participated in the session. 
</p><p>4. The participants in the session of the Expert Mechanism included representatives of 
Member States, the Holy See, United Nations organizations and programmes, national human 
rights institutions, indigenous delegates and non-governmental organizations (see annex I).  
5. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples,  James Anaya, a member of 
the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, Grand Chief  Edward John, and a representative of 
the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations, Tarcila Rivera Zea, also 
participated in the session.  
</p>
<p><b>B. Documentation 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Expert Mechanism had before it the provisional agenda (A/HRC/EMRIP/2011/1) 
and the annotated agenda (A/HRC/EMRIP/2011/1/Add.1) as prepared by the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the advance edited version of the 
final report (A/HRC/EMRIP/2011/2), prepared by the Expert Mechanism.  
 
</p>
<p><b>C. Opening of the session 
</b> 
</p>
<p>7. The outgoing Chairperson-Rapporteur, Mr. Morales Morales, opened the fourth session 
of the Expert Mechanism and introduced the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights for opening remarks. 
</p><p>8. In her statement, the High Commissioner highlighted the fact that the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is a milestone in indigenous peoples&#8217; 
advocacy. She recalled that indigenous peoples continued to be some of the most marginalized 
in the world and were frequently excluded from political and economic power. She added that, 
according to a recent study, more than 80 per cent of indigenous peoples live in poverty, often 
disadvantaged in relation to education or health. The Expert Mechanism could play a key role 
in addressing human rights issues facing indigenous peoples through its studies, including the 
final report on the study on indigenous peoples and the right to participate in decision-making. 
She concluded that participation in decision-making was not only a human right in itself but 
also crucial to the enjoyment of other rights of indigenous peoples. 
9. In her opening statement, the President of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador 
Laura Dupuy, stressed that the Expert Mechanism had an advisory mandate for the Council on 
indigenous peoples&#8217; issues. She recalled that the Council, in its resolution 15/7, resolved to 
engage in an interactive dialogue with the Expert Mechanism at its eighteenth session. 
 
10. In his statement, the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples highlighted 
the work of the Expert Mechanism in developing expert thinking and practical guidance on the 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. He also stressed that the thematic studies and 
advice of the Expert Mechanism complemented the work of the Special Rapporteur and the 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. 
11. Grand Chief  Edward John, member of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, 
noted the importance of the Expert Mechanism in advocating and protecting the rights of 
indigenous peoples. He also highlighted the need for coordination between the three 
mechanisms with mandates focused on indigenous peoples. Finally, he recalled key issues 
developed during the past tenth session of the Permanent Forum that could be of interest to the 
work of the Expert Mechanism. </p>


<p>12. In her statement, the Chairperson of the International Coordinating Committee on 
National Human Rights Institutions, Rosslyn Noonan, welcomed the work and the consultative 
approach of the Expert Mechanism. She also stated that national human rights institutions were 
key actors in the promotion of the studies undertaken by the Expert Mechanism, and remained 
committed to contributing to its mandate. 
</p><p>13. In her remarks on behalf of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund 
for Indigenous Populations, Ms. Rivera Zea welcomed General Assembly resolution 65/198, 
which enables the fund to provide resources to representatives of indigenous peoples to 
participate in sessions of the Human Rights Council and human rights treaty bodies. She also 
thanked the contributors to the Voluntary Fund and called for more contributors, as there had 
been a decrease in donations. 
 
</p>
<p><b>D. Election of officers 
</b> 
</p>
<p>14. The outgoing Chairperson-Rapporteur invited the experts to nominate a Chairperson-
Rapporteur for its fourth session. Dr. Littlechild announced the experts&#8217; consensus to nominate 
Mr. Bambanze and Ms. Chukhman as Chairperson-Rapporteur and Vice-Chairperson-
Rapporteur, respectively. Thereafter, the outgoing Chairperson-Rapporteur declared the two 
members elected by acclamation. 
</p><p>15. In his statement, the new Chairperson-Rapporteur thanked his predecessor as well as the 
other members of the Expert Mechanism for his election. He also thanked the High 
Commissioner for her presence and the support provided by her Office. He then recalled that 
the Expert Mechanism was a unique forum for discussing specific issues, and that it was guided 
by Human Rights Council resolution 6/36. 
16. The Chairperson highlighted the inter-sessional activities of the Expert Mechanism, in 
particular in relation to the work of the Special Rapporteur, the Permanent Forum and the 
human rights treaty bodies. He welcomed the parallel meetings held by the Special Rapporteur 
and his team during the sessions of the Expert Mechanism to respond to allegations of human 
rights violations. 
17. Lastly, he welcomed the assistance of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for its travel 
grants, as well as the contributions of different States. He concluded by inviting all participants 
to contribute to the fourth session of the Expert Mechanism effectively and to suggest 
substantive proposals to the Human Rights Council to contribute to the promotion of the rights 
of indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p> 
<b>E. Adoption of the agenda 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>18. Before the agenda was adopted, Dr. Littlechild informed participants about the decision 
of the General Assembly to hold a World Conference on Indigenous Peoples in 2014. He 
emphasized the importance of ensuring the full participation of indigenous peoples at all stages 
of the World Conference. He highlighted the importance of the Expert Mechanism considering 
that issue at its next session. 
19.  The Expert Mechanism adopted the agenda and the programme of work of the fourth 
session.9    
</p>
<p><b> IV. Follow-up to thematic studies and advice 
</b></p>
<p>20. Ms. Lasimbang described the study of the Expert Mechanism on lessons learned and 
challenges to achieve the implementation of the right of indigenous peoples to education, and 
highlighted the fact that the focus of agenda item 3 was to solicit information from participants 
on how the study had been useful. She also referred to the half-day panel discussion on 
</p>
<p>  
9 A/HRC/EMRIP/2011/1. </p>


<p>indigenous peoples&#8217; language and culture, to be held during the eighteenth session of the 
Human Rights Council.  
</p><p>21. Dr. Littlechild highlighted the fact that education must be a national priority, and made 
reference to human rights issues associated with residential schools for indigenous peoples.  
22. Several organizations made interventions. Issues raised included the need to recognize 
traditional educational systems and the lack of funding. Concerns raised by indigenous 
representatives included the neglect of indigenous cultures within education systems, 
inadequate access to education by indigenous peoples and the importance of education provided 
in indigenous languages. 
23. Some States described the different measures, plans and programmes they had adopted 
in relation to the right of indigenous peoples to education and how they had followed up on the 
recommendations contained in the study of the Expert Mechanism.  
24. Mr. Morales Morales welcomed the interventions made by States and indigenous 
peoples and highlighted the need to work together. He added that the study clearly highlighted 
that education is one of the most effective ways to maintain indigenous cultures.  
25. Ms. Lasimbang noted that many indigenous peoples sought to establish their own 
systems of education. She commented that the challenges associated with implementing the 
right to education in the indigenous context needed to be tackled by both States and indigenous 
peoples. She concluded by noting that she would welcome a continuation of discussion of this 
issue in future sessions. 
26. Dr. Littlechild welcomed the initiatives undertaken by the different States in using the 
report, and encouraged other States to follow these good practices. He cited the importance of 
indigenous language and quality education for indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p> 
<b>V. Study on indigenous peoples and the right to participate in 
</b></p>
<p><b>decision-making 
</b> 
</p>
<p>27. Ms. Lasimbang highlighted the fact that the final report on the study on indigenous 
peoples and the right to participate in decision-making complemented the progress report on the 
study, and includes Expert Mechanism advice No. 2. When summarizing the report, Ms. 
Lasimbang pointed out that it included examples of good practices in relation to indigenous 
peoples&#8217; participation in decision-making, as requested by the Human Rights Council in its 
resolution 15/7, and drew on the research conducted by the Expert Mechanism, submissions 
received and an expert workshop held on the topic. She recalled that the Expert Mechanism 
welcomed comments from participants at the fourth session before it presented the report to the 
Human Rights Council at its eighteenth session. 
</p>
<p>28. John Henriksen, a former member of the Expert Mechanism and one of the two 
principal co-authors of the report, was introduced by the Chairperson-Rapporteur. He pointed 
out that the study had been written by previous members of the Expert Mechanism, and invited 
the current members to finalize it. He recalled that effective participation of indigenous peoples 
in decision-making is fundamental to their enjoyment of human rights. He highlighted three 
crucial concepts: (a) self-determination of indigenous peoples; (b) the duty of the State to 
consult indigenous peoples; and (c) the duty of the State to seek to obtain free, prior and 
informed consent of indigenous peoples. He then briefly described the contents of the study. 
</p>
<p>29. Dr. Littlechild commented that the action of some States created barriers to the 
participation of indigenous peoples. He highlighted the difficulties facing indigenous peoples to 
obtain visas or to have their passports recognized, especially when they had to maintain 
relations across borders.  
</p>
<p>30. Observers raised several issues, such as the challenges associated with the 
implementation of the right to participate in decision-making at the national level, the 
importance of the right to participate in decision-making processes associated with public 
policies, the participation of indigenous women in decision-making, the right to self-
determination, the right to free, prior and informed consent in relation to indigenous peoples&#8217; </p>


<p>lands, natural resources and territories, and deficiencies in funding and the lack of infrastructure 
to support indigenous peoples&#8217; participation and the right to use traditional systems of decision-
making. Other observers highlighted the fact that, in the matter of participation in decision-
making, national human rights institutions can represent a bridge between the State and 
indigenous peoples. Several States highlighted good practices and the improvements made in 
the area. 
</p>
<p>31. Dr. Littlechild thanked, inter alia, States, indigenous peoples, national human rights 
commissioners and academics for their contributions and critical analysis of the final report of 
the Expert Mechanism on its study on indigenous peoples and the right to participate in 
decision-making. During discussion of this important agenda item, the Expert Mechanism heard 
of situations throughout the world of exclusion (for example, of youth and traditional 
Governments) and lack of recognition of indigenous peoples, which constitute ongoing 
violations of the right to participate in decision-making. Some of the key issues highlighted 
included the electoral violence, the need for intercultural communications, cross-border issues 
and the recently approved Guidelines on Business and Human Rights. The Expert Mechanism 
heard that there was a need to continue building on the findings of its final report on indigenous 
peoples and the right to participate in decision-making and to continue to focus on the right to 
self-determination, free, prior and informed consent, rights relating to lands, territories and 
resources while leaving behind &#8220;consultation&#8221;, a process right that had been overemphasized, 
with the result of obscuring the material rights that underpin indigenous peoples&#8217; lives and 
livelihoods. Observers also spoke of the need for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and other United Nations agencies to enable and ensure 
effective representation and participation of indigenous peoples in decision-making (including 
management and protection of rights), especially with respect to the UNESCO conventions and 
policies relevant to indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>32. Dr. Littlechild identified the difficulties associated with the non-recognition and 
exclusion of groups as indigenous peoples, which create an impediment to the participation of 
indigenous peoples in decision-making. More generally, he emphasized the interrelationship 
between indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to self-determination, free, prior and informed consent and 
lands, territories and resources.  
</p>
<p>33. Dr. Littlechild also noted the requests for clarification of the final report of the Expert 
Mechanism and stated that they would be considered in the finalization of that study. He 
highlighted the important interventions made in relation to the activities of extractive industries, 
which was a topic of a current study of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous 
peoples. 
</p>
<p>34. Ms. Chukhman emphasized the fundamental importance of the right of indigenous 
peoples to participate in decision-making, highlighting in particular the need for guarantees for 
indigenous youth to participate in decision-making that affects them. She mentioned the need 
for resources to facilitate indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in decision-making and, in that 
context, the need to close the gap between the right and the challenges facing indigenous 
peoples in participating on the ground at all levels of decision-making.  
</p>
<p>35. Ms. Chukhman reminded participants of indigenous peoples&#8217; history of making 
decisions autonomously and the need for many indigenous peoples to revive their own 
decision-making processes. She also highlighted the need for indigenous peoples to have access 
to mass media to facilitate their participation in decision-making. 
</p>
<p>36. Mr. Morales Morales congratulated States for the attention they placed on the report of 
the Expert Mechanism on indigenous peoples and participation in decision-making. He noted 
the need to include indigenous peoples in decisions associated with development and suggested 
that the Human Rights Council, supported by the Expert Mechanism, could work with States to 
identify peaceful solutions to these issues. Mr. Morales Morales also identified free, prior and 
informed consent and processes to facilitate proper consultation with indigenous peoples as an 
area of continued work, calling on indigenous peoples to identify means through which the </p>


<p>obligation of free, prior and informed consent could be implemented by States and indigenous 
peoples in cooperation with one another. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>VI. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
</b> 
</p>
<p>37. Dr. Littlechild noted the inclusion of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples in Human Rights Council resolution 6/36, in which the Council established the Expert 
Mechanism. He commended Canada and the United States of America for changing their 
positions of opposition to the Declaration to support and endorsement, and called on the States 
that had abstained from voting on the Declaration to also endorse it.  
</p>
<p>38. Dr. Littlechild explained that the Declaration had been long-awaited and constituted a 
framework for reconciliation and a remedial instrument to overcome indigenous peoples&#8217; 
historic marginalization and to restore respectful relationships. The Declaration must inform all 
of the studies and work of the Expert Mechanism. The Expert Mechanism would work 
collaboratively with the Special Rapporteur, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and all 
United Nations agencies and programmes to ensure that the rights in the Declaration were 
realized. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples addressed the Expert 
Mechanism, first congratulating the Expert Mechanism on its study on indigenous peoples and 
the right to participate in decision-making as providing well-grounded guidance to the 
international system. He urged States to examine the study to guide them with regard to laws 
and policies associated with this fundamental right. He noted especially the call for a 
permanent mechanism for consultations with indigenous governance bodies.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur then reported on his activities over the past year with regard to 
the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as the principal normative framework for 
his work and reflecting a global consensus on the rights of indigenous peoples. He explained 
his activities with regard to encouraging good practices in the implementation of the 
Declaration, country reports, responses to allegations of infringement of the rights of 
indigenous peoples and his thematic studies. With regard to the latter, the Special Rapporteur 
noted that his 2011 report would address concerns about extractive industries. His consultations 
to date illustrated that there were conflicting views about the potential adverse effects and 
benefits of extractive industries in indigenous territories. He considered that it would be helpful 
to develop specific guidelines or principles to assist States, including in relation to indigenous 
peoples&#8217; participation in and control over the design and implementation of project activities.  
</p>
<p>41. The Chairperson-Rapporteur recalled that the Declaration was the normative framework 
guiding the work of the Expert Mechanism and that the challenge of achieving the effective 
implementation of the Declaration at all levels remained. He welcomed constructive 
suggestions for the proposals of the Expert Mechanism to be submitted to the Human Rights 
Council.  
</p>
<p>42. Several States and organizations made comments with regard to the implementation of 
the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Participants commented that United 
Nations agencies should provide advice and technical assistance to support local, regional and 
national implementation of the Declaration. Good practices of implementation were 
highlighted, such as the constitutional endorsement of specific rights in the Declaration by 
some States. Indigenous peoples raised the importance of the recognition of the right of 
indigenous peoples to self-determination as central to the implementation of the Declaration, 
as well as free, prior and informed consent in relevant circumstances, and suggested creating a 
database on specific measures taken to implement the Declaration, including best practices, 
and the establishment of national plans of action and activities to promote broader public 
awareness of and education related to the Declaration. Some called for the translation of the 
Declaration into indigenous languages, and the distribution of the Declaration to regional </p>


<p>authorities. Indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations also mentioned the necessity of promoting a 
study on the relationship between self-determination and sovereignty over natural resources. 
Some organizations noted that it could be helpful to identify the causes preventing the 
implementation of the Declaration, for example the absence of a definition of indigenous 
peoples. Some suggested that a convention on the rights of indigenous peoples could facilitate 
the enforcement of the rights contained in the Declaration, while others commented that the 
rights in the Declaration mirrored binding rights found in human rights treaties applied to the 
indigenous context. Regarding stakeholders, it was mentioned that indigenous youth must be 
engaged in the implementation of the Declaration. Some also called on States that had 
abstained in the vote on the Declaration in the General Assembly to change their position to 
one of support.  
</p>
<p>43. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) added that some of its activities 
were consistent with the Declaration, including the United Nations Indigenous Peoples 
Partnership. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>VII. Proposals to be submitted to the Human Rights Council 
</b> 
44. The Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Expert Mechanism opened the discussion on 
proposals to be submitted to the Human Rights Council, recalling Human Rights Council 
resolution 6/36.  
</p>
<p>45.  Observers made recommendations for inclusion in the proposals to be submitted by the 
Expert Mechanism. These included recommendations for thematic issues to be taken up in the 
future and for follow-up to the first and second studies undertaken by the Expert Mechanism. 
Dr. Littlechild summarized some of the proposals raised by participants, including, inter alia, a 
thematic study on extractive industries, on cross-border issues or on traditional governance 
structures, the holding of an international expert seminar on truth and reconciliation processes, 
developing guidelines for the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
requesting that the Human Rights Council hold a half-day thematic panel discussion on the 
rights of indigenous peoples on an annual basis and having the World Conference on 
Indigenous Peoples as an agenda item at the Expert Mechanism session to be held in 2012.  
</p><p>46.  The Board of the Voluntary Fund recommended that the members of the Expert 
Mechanism consider the possibility of making an appeal for contributions to all States, the 
United Nations system, foundations and other donors in support of the United Nations 
Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations in their next session report. 
</p>
<p><b> 
VIII. Adoption of the report and proposals 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>47. At its last meeting, the Expert Mechanism adopted the final report on the study on 
indigenous peoples and the right to participate in decision-making and several proposals (see 
section II above). All proposals were adopted by consensus by the members of the Expert 
Mechanism.  
48. Moreover, the members of the Expert Mechanism adopted a provisional agenda for the 
fifth session of the Expert Mechanism (see annex II). </p>
