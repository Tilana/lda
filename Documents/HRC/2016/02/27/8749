</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 In this report, submitted in accordance to resolution 8/11, the independent expert 
focuses on non-contributory pensions or so-called social pensions. Social pensions consist 
of cash benefits received by persons above a given age that do not require prior compulsory 
contributions from beneficiaries, employers or the State. Social pensions are an important 
dimension of social security systems. States are obliged progressively to ensure the right to 
social security and the right to an adequate standard of living to all individuals within the 
country. These rights are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
several international human rights treaties and International Labour Organization 
conventions. Considering the vulnerability of older persons, States must take appropriate 
measures to establish social security schemes that provide benefits to all older persons 
without discrimination of any kind and ensure equal rights for men and women. Today, 
large proportions of the population work outside the formal employment sector and 
traditional informal support systems for older people are changing under the pressure of 
increased longevity, widespread poverty, the impact of HIV/AIDS and migration. 
Contributory pension schemes (e.g. employment-based pensions) do not reach all older 
persons. Therefore, States must recognize that social pensions are critical elements for the 
progressive realization of the right to social security for older people. Non-contributory 
pensions can significantly reduce poverty and vulnerability among old people, in particular 
for women, who live longer and are less likely to benefit from contributory systems. The 
report provides recommendations on how to ensure that non-contributory pensions comply 
with core human rights standards. It also addresses the role of international assistance and 
cooperation in the field of social security.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The current report is submitted by the independent expert on the question of human 
rights and extreme poverty, Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda Carmona, in accordance with Human 
Rights Council resolution 8/11. The report reflects the expert&#8217;s work in analysing how 
specific poverty reduction strategies, in particular those related to the area of social 
protection, comply with human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>2. Since her previous annual report to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/11/9) which 
focused on a human rights approach to cash transfers programmes, the independent expert 
submitted a report to the General Assembly (A/64/279) analysing the impact of the global 
financial crisis on the human rights situation of people living in extreme poverty. It 
highlighted the urgency of establishing and enhancing solid social protection systems to 
address the impact of the crisis.   
</p>
<p>3. The independent expert visited Zambia (August 2009) and Bangladesh (December 
2009). In both countries, she comprehensively assessed existing social protection 
programmes, including cash transfer schemes. In September 2009, she took part in the 
Social Forum of the Human Rights Council, where she discussed the role of social 
protection systems. During the reporting period, the expert also participated in numerous 
events and held working meetings with Governments, United Nations agencies, donor 
agencies, academic institutions, NGOs as well as representatives of people living in 
poverty. In accordance with resolution 12/19 (October 2009) of the Human Rights Council, 
she is also preparing a progress report on ways to improve the draft guiding principles on 
extreme poverty and human rights, to be presented at the fifteenth session of the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>4. This report focuses on the role that non-contributory pensions or social pensions1 
play in reducing extreme poverty and contributing to the realization of human rights of 
older persons. It also examines how a human rights perspective can be integrated into the 
design, implementation and monitoring of these initiatives. Social pensions consist of cash 
benefits received by persons above a given age that do not require prior compulsory 
contributions from beneficiaries, employers or the State.  
</p>
<p>5. To collect information to prepare this report, the independent expert sent a 
questionnaire to Governments requesting information on their social pensions for older 
persons. The questionnaire addressed: (i) the legal and institutional framework; (ii) the 
schemes costs and coverage; (iii) implementation procedures; (iv) monitoring mechanisms 
and complaints procedures; and (v) studies and evaluations. As of 10 March 2010, 45 
countries had responded;2 all submissions are available on the webpage of the mandate.3  
</p>
<p>6. The report also benefits from a review of the existing literature on the topic of old-
age poverty and an expert meeting convened by the expert and organized by the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, with the support of HelpAge 
International and the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, on 8&#8211;9 February 2010. Twenty five experts

<p>from governments, NGOs, United Nations agencies and academic institutions attended the 
meeting and contributed to the independent expert&#8217;s evaluations on social pensions. 
</p>
<p>7. The independent expert wishes to express her gratitude to all States that submitted 
information and to the experts and NGOs that supported this process and assisted in the 
preparation of this report. She will continue to consider the topic of old age and poverty in 
future mission reports.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Poverty and old age 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Ageing and its repercussion for social policies 
</b></p>
<p>8. There is an urgent need to understand the implications of increasing longevity in the 
world. The population aged over 60 is expected to rise from 737 million persons in 2009 to 
over 2 billion in 2050.4 Those older than 80 years represent the fastest growing segment of 
all societies. Moreover, older women increasingly outnumber older men as their ages 
increase. 
</p>
<p>9. The proportion of older persons is growing fastest in developing countries. In South 
East Asia, the percentage of older persons will have increased to 10 per cent by 2025 and 
19 per cent by 2050. In South Asia, it is projected that the older population will have 
increased by 350 million between 2000 and 2050. This is more than five times the increase 
of 66 million from 1950 to 2000. Older persons constituted less than 7 per cent of the 
increase in population from 1950 to 2000 but will account for 20 and 62 per cent of the 
increase from 2000 to 2025 and from 2025 to 2050 respectively.5 In Africa, the pace of 
growth of the older persons&#8217; population is slower, but nevertheless the number of persons 
aged 60 or above is set to quadruple: from 47.9 million in 2005 to 206.8 million by 2050.6 
In Latin America and the Caribbean, about 24 per cent of the population will be 60 or over 
by 2050, with the most rapid growth occurring among the &#8220;oldest old&#8221;, those aged 80 or 
above. By 2050, there will be more people aged over 60 than under 15 years of age.7 
</p>
<p>10. Integrating ageing populations in policymaking is not just a question of financing 
welfare policies. It requires a change of vision of the relations between generations and the 
roles of different age groups. States should not rely on the traditional vision that families 
will take care of older persons that have become dependent, especially as traditional family 
care structures are under increased pressure as a result of, inter alia, migration and 
urbanization. States have a duty towards older persons that must not be reduced to a 
question of affordability.  
</p>
<p>11. The international community has committed itself to addressing the challenges 
associated with ageing in three documents: the Vienna International Plan of Action on 
Ageing (1982), the United Nations Principles for Older Persons (1991) and the Madrid 
International Plan of Action on Ageing (2002). These documents complement the existing 
human rights and labour standards which establish legally binding obligations upon States.

<p>12. The overarching goals of the Madrid Plan of Action on Ageing include ensuring the 
full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, and civil and political rights by older 
persons and the elimination of all forms of violence and discrimination against older 
persons; achieving gender equality for older persons through inter alia eliminating gender 
discrimination; and providing quality health care, support and social protection for older 
persons. The Plan of Action combines a statement of political will with practical 
recommended actions for States. Given their specificity and level of detail, these are vital 
tools to guide a State in implementing its political and legal commitments. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Determinants of poverty among older persons 
</b></p>
<p>13. Assessing poverty among older people is a complex exercise, and several factors 
cause household surveys to underestimate poverty among older persons.8 For example, 
there is a lack of understanding of the dynamics of dependency upon different family 
members. Disaggregated data on this issue is lacking, which leads to a lack of 
understanding of how income is distributed within a household and of the specific situation 
of older persons within that household. Measures of old-age poverty that rely on household 
income ignore the fact that in many multigenerational households resources are allocated 
disproportionately towards children and those of working age.  
</p>
<p>14. Difficulties in assessing poverty among older people are particularly problematic 
from a human rights perspective. They result in weaker knowledge of the specificities of 
old-age poverty, which most likely leads to policy choices that ignore and possibly exclude 
older people living in extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>15. While increased longevity is a worldwide phenomenon, the elderly population is by 
no means uniform, and risk factors for poverty are multiple depending on the country and 
on personal situation. Core factors include: lack of access to regular income and work and 
health care, declining physical and mental capacities, and dependency within the 
household. 
</p>
<p>16. As people grow older, they tend to be progressively excluded from the formal and 
informal work markets by employers who prioritize a younger workforce. At the same time, 
they are often not protected by social security systems (addressed below). Without access to 
work or income, the poorest tend to depend on others for their survival or have to seek less 
secure sources of income (often begging or undertaking menial work). Research indicates 
that the older persons who manage to enter and remain in the workforce occupy less 
attractive jobs, with lower pay than people of prime age.9 
</p><p>17. As people age, they become frailer and their need for health-care services is likely to 
increase. Such needs incur costs that older persons cannot always cover adequately. For 
example, when user fees are imposed on health-care services, older persons without a 
reliable income may not be able to access these services. In these contexts, many may fall 
into a vicious cycle where poor health engenders poverty and poverty engenders poor 
health. 
</p>
<p>18. Households with children headed by older persons and households consisting only 
of older persons, in particular single women, tend to be more vulnerable to poverty. The

</p>
<p>occurrence of poverty is particularly high in countries with large migratory trends and in 
countries hit by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Single older persons tend to be poorer in both 
developed and developing countries.10  
</p>
<p><b> C. Poverty among older women 
</b></p>
<p>19. Older women are disproportionately disadvantaged: they are marginalized due to 
their age and tend to be poorer than men. Because of gendered discrimination patterns 
throughout their life, women are often in a situation where they have accumulated lesser 
wealth than men. Cultural practices of early marriage and women&#8217;s longer life expectancy 
than men worldwide11 lead to a situation where women are more likely to be widows than 
men, and being widowed puts older women at higher risk of being poor. In many countries, 
women have limited access to land and other assets. For example, in India, 60 per cent of 
older women (compared to 30 per cent of older men) have no valuable assets in their name 
and research indicates that few female widows can count on family or community 
support.12 In urban China, poverty rates are three to four times higher among older women 
than among older men.13  
</p>
<p>20. Most older women are excluded from formal social security and health insurance 
schemes as these are linked to paid, formal-sector employment. In developing countries, the 
great majority of women work all their lives in the informal sector or unpaid activities. In 
developed countries too, older women are more likely than men to be poor at old age. On 
average, in European Union countries, older women have a poverty risk rate of about 22 per 
cent as compared to 16 per cent for older men.14 They are less likely to receive a large 
contributory pension since they are more likely to have stopped work at some point over 
their lifetime to take on the burden of child rearing and are also more likely to have 
received lesser wages for their work than men.  
</p>
<p>21. Older women are not only more likely to be poorer than men, but they are also likely 
to be burdened with caregiving responsibilities for other family members, especially their 
grandchildren. In some countries, accusations of witchcraft against poor older women are 
common, revealing worrying discriminative patterns.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Old-age poverty and migration 
</b></p>
<p>22. In many parts of the world, the widespread migration of younger generations to the 
cities challenges the idea that the active generation will support their elders. In the rural 
regions of many Asian countries, urban migration is causing a substantial decrease of co-
residence of older persons with their younger families. The same phenomenon is 
documented in African countries.15 Having to rely on their children that have moved

<p>nationally or internationally is often a risk for older persons. Often, financial support 
provided by children becomes irregular and insecure, even though they may still be asked 
to care for grandchildren.  
</p>
<p>23. Migrants can also be at risk of losing income in their old age. While persons who 
have migrated to work in their adulthood may have contributed to pension systems where 
they worked, when they retire and return to their countries of origin they are unable to reap 
the benefits of their prior contributions.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Old-age poverty and HIV/AIDS  
</b></p>
<p>24. The HIV/AIDS epidemic impacts on older persons in two ways. First, mostly 
middle-aged people die from the disease and older persons are more likely to be left 
without the care and support of their children. Second, they also may become the primary 
caregivers to their orphaned grandchildren.  
</p>
<p>25. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to 26 million of the 40 million persons living with 
HIV/AIDS worldwide and is subsequently the region with the highest number of 
households with a generation gap. In Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, 60 per cent of 
AIDS orphans live with their grandparents.16  
</p>
<p><b> III. Social protection and old age 
</b>26. As detailed in the expert&#8217;s previous reports,17 social protection is defined as 
encompassing a wide range of policies designed to address the risks and vulnerabilities of 
individuals and groups, irrespective of whether they can or cannot work. It seeks to help 
them cope with, and overcome, situations of poverty, especially when they result from 
circumstances outside of their control. Social protection systems are generally structured 
around three important objectives for poverty elimination: (i) facilitating recovery from 
crises that have led people to become poor; (ii) contributing to the ability of chronically 
poor people to emerge from poverty; and (iii) supporting the less active poor (such as the 
elderly, persons with disabilities and children) so that their poverty will not be inherited by 
the next generation. Governmental entities are the main providers of social protection, but 
often civil society entities and the private sector also contribute.  
</p>
<p>27. Social protection systems can help realize a full range of rights. International human 
rights instruments generally do not use the term &#8220;social protection&#8221;.18 Instead they establish 
the right of everyone to &#8220;social security, including social insurance&#8221;. Beyond ensuring the 
right to social security, States&#8217; duty to implement social protection systems also flows from 
the right to an adequate standard of living and a number of related economic and social 
rights enshrined in several legally binding human rights treaties.  
</p>
<p>28. Social protection can be divided in two main segments: social insurance and social 
assistance. Social insurance refers to all contributory insurance schemes providing pre-
specified support for affiliated members in the event of contingencies such as injury, 
sickness, disability and old age. Social assistance encompasses all initiatives providing both 
cash and in-kind assistance to those living in poverty; these are often financed by general 
taxation revenues or external aid. Social pensions consist of cash benefits received by

</p>
<p>persons above a given age without the requirement of compulsory contributions; they are 
essential components of social assistance. Contributory and non-contributory schemes 
should be regarded as complementary and mutually reinforcing aspects of social protection. 
</p>
<p>29. Traditionally, States have privileged the establishment of contributory pension 
systems with the objective of achieving universal coverage once the formal sector 
expanded. Today, with a vast number of workers in the informal sector, this approach must 
be re-examined. Contributory systems have left the majority of the population unprotected 
when they reach old age. Estimates indicate that less than 20 per cent of older persons are 
covered by pensions today and only about 25 per cent of the labour force is currently 
contributing or accruing pension rights.19 
</p>
<p>30. This coverage gap particularly affects those living in extreme poverty. It is in 
countries with lower GDP per capita and among the least educated that coverage rates of 
existing contributory social security systems are lowest. Contributory systems cover 85 per 
cent of the labour force in almost all high-income member States of the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),20 but in several countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa, coverage can fall to below 5 per cent of the workforce.21 Even middle-income 
countries of Latin America that had established social security systems covering a 
significant proportion of the population saw coverage rates declining in the last decades 
following the liberalization of labour markets.22  
</p>
<p>31. Even in developed countries, contributory systems are often inadequate to protect 
the elderly: often benefits are too low to cover costs of living. Moreover, legislation related 
to compulsory retirement age can make it impossible for some older persons to find 
additional sources of income.  
</p>
<p>32. In the absence of contributory social security, social assistance and, in particular, the 
provision of non-contributory pensions to older persons plays a central role in bridging the 
existing protection gap. Studies conducted in countries that have established non-
contributory schemes demonstrate their positive impact on poverty indicators. In OECD 
countries with good coverage of formal insurance and the longest experience in investing in 
this type of pension, poverty rates would be significantly higher without non-contributory 
schemes. The same is true for middle-income countries that have also invested in social 
pensions during recent decades.23   
</p>
<p>33. Social pensions are also important for addressing the particular vulnerabilities of 
women. Contributory systems tend to exacerbate gender inequalities: in many countries 
coverage rates for elderly men are twice those for their female counterparts.24 Even in 
countries with broader protection in contributory systems, older women are more likely to 
receive a lower pension due to a lower level of contributions (see sect. II C). 
</p><p>34. The benefit of social pensions may also reach beyond their direct beneficiaries and 
assist family members of the older person and any children in their care. In AIDS-affected 
countries, for example, where older persons are the primary caregivers of children orphaned 
by AIDS, social pensions may impact positively on child well-being. A study in South 
Africa found that children living with pensioners are, on average, 5 centimetres taller and

those in the poorest percentile of the population.25 
</p>
<p>35. Governments must challenge the myth that social pensions are a burden to the 
economy and the stereotyping of older persons as a burden to development. Indeed, social 
protection systems may act as economic stabilizers in critical periods and can have positive 
repercussions on local economies. For example, studies show that in rural areas, old-age 
pensions have an overall positive impact on the protection of poor rural communities 
affected by the adverse effects of agriculture reform and encourage local economic 
activity.26   
</p>
<p>36. Social pensions, however, should be seen as only one component of a broad social 
protection system designed to tackle the multidimensional aspects of poverty. The focus on 
older persons should consist of setting basic, non-contributory pensions as one of the pillars 
of a comprehensive approach that includes measures to ensure access to basic services 
(especially health services) and eliminate discrimination based on sex.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>37. Human rights treaties apply to all members of society and as such older persons are 
clearly entitled to the full range of rights established by them.27 The Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights mentions the particular vulnerability of older persons in article 25, which 
stipulates that &#8220;everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and 
well-being of himself and of his family, including &#8230; medical care and the right to security 
in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of 
livelihood in circumstances beyond his control&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>38. Several treaties contain specific references to old age. The Convention on 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women stipulates &#8220;the right to social 
security, particularly in cases of retirement, unemployment, sickness, invalidity and old age 
and other incapacity to work&#8221; (art. 11). It is also understood that the prohibition of 
discrimination included in major human rights treaties is understood as non-exhaustive; 
therefore, even if age is not mentioned specifically as a prohibitive ground for 
discrimination, it should still be accepted under &#8220;other status&#8221;. The International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families specifically identifies age as a prohibited ground for discrimination. 
</p>
<p>39. In 1995, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted a general 
comment on the rights of older persons, in which it stressed that States needed to adapt their 
social and economic policies to respond to the needs of ageing populations and should give 
more consideration to older persons in their human rights monitoring and reporting. The 
general comment also sheds light on the relationship between the provisions of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Vienna International 
Plan of Action and the United Nations Principles for Older Persons, clearly indicating that 
both binding and non-binding commitments are linked.

<p>40. In 2009, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
established a working group to elaborate a general recommendation on the rights of older 
women. In its preliminary work, the working group explains that the impact of gender 
inequalities throughout a woman&#8217;s lifespan is intensified in old age and often results in 
unfair resource allocation, maltreatment, abuse, gender-based violence and prevention of 
access to basic services. The general recommendation will be an important tool for 
addressing the human rights of older women and the elimination of discrimination they face 
throughout their lives.28  
</p>
<p><b> A. The right to social security in human rights and labour standards 
</b></p>
<p>41. The right to social security is firmly grounded in international human rights law and 
several treaties contain specific references to old age protection through social security 
schemes. Further to articles 22 and 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it 
appears in articles 9, 10 and 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, article 5 (e) (iv) of the International Convention on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination, article 11 of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women, article 26 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, article 27 of the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
mentions the right to social protection (art. 28).  
</p><p>42. At regional level, there are several provisions recognizing the specific vulnerability 
of older persons that call on States to implement specific measures to protect the elderly. 
They also emphasize the right to social security.  
</p>
<p>43. The African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights stipulates that &#8220;the aged and the 
disabled shall also have the right to special measures of protection in keeping with their 
physical or moral needs&#8221; (art. 18). The Protocol to the African Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa (Maputo Protocol) recognizes the 
particular vulnerability of older women and requests States to take a number of measures 
&#8220;commensurate with their physical, economic and social needs as well as their access to 
employment and professional training&#8221; and &#8220;ensure the right of elderly women to freedom 
from violence, including sexual abuse&#8221; (art. 22). 
</p><p>44. The Revised European Social Charter recognizes &#8220;the right of elderly persons to 
social protection&#8221; (art. 23). It calls on States to adopt or encourage appropriate measures to: 
(1) &#8220;enable elderly persons to remain full members of society for as long as possible&#8221;; (2) 
&#8220;enable elderly persons to choose their lifestyle freely and to lead independent lives in their 
familiar surroundings for as long as they wish and are able&#8221;; and (3) &#8220;guarantee elderly 
persons living in institutions appropriate support, while respecting their privacy, and 
participation in decisions concerning living conditions in the institutions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>45. The Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the Area 
of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recognizes that &#8220;everyone has the right to special 
protection in old age&#8221; (art. 17). It also called for States to take the necessary steps &#8220;to make 
this right a reality&#8221;, particularly by providing food and adequate medical services; 
undertaking work programmes specifically designed for the elderly and establishing social 
organizations designed to improve the quality of life for the elderly. 
</p>
<p>46. Several International Labour Organization conventions and declarations also 
recognize the right to social security, including the Declaration concerning the aims and

<p>purposes of the International Labour Organization, to pursue &#8220;the extension of social 
security measures to provide a basic income to all in need of such protection and 
comprehensive medical care&#8221;. The main standards are established by Convention No. 102 
concerning Minimum Standards of Social Security and Convention No. 128 concerning 
Invalidity, Old-Age and Survivors&#8217; Benefits. Convention No. 102 establishes worldwide-
agreed minimum standards for all nine branches of social security: medical care, sickness 
benefit, unemployment benefit, old-age benefit, employment injury benefit, family benefit, 
maternity benefit, invalidity benefit and survivors&#8217; benefit.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights 
</b></p>
<p>47. In its general comment No. 19 on the right to social security, the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights spells out the key features of this right and the 
content of respective States&#8217; obligations. It notes that States parties are obliged to 
progressively ensure the right to social security to all individuals within their territories, 
providing specific protection for disadvantaged and marginalized individuals and groups.29  
</p>
<p>48. Considering the vulnerability of older persons, the Committee highlights the fact 
that States are duty-bound to progressively ensure that everyone is covered by contributory 
or non-contributory systems. To this end, States parties must develop a national strategy for 
the full implementation of the right to social security in old age, and allocate adequate fiscal 
and other resources at the national level.  
</p>
<p>49. Under the Covenant, States are prohibited from deliberately taking any retrogressive 
measures, including in regard to the right to social security, unless they can prove that they 
have only been introduced after the most careful consideration of all other alternatives and 
are duly justified by reference to the totality of the rights stipulated in the Covenant.30 If 
necessary, developing countries should seek international cooperation and technical 
assistance to realize progressively the right to social security.31 
</p>
<p>50. The Committee explicitly notes that States cannot rely solely on contributory 
systems for old-age pensions, as all individuals will not always be able to secure sufficient 
means to maintain an adequate standard of living. States must have a non-contributory 
pension system in place.32 Therefore, within the limits of available resources, States must 
provide non-contributory old-age benefits to assist, at the very least, all older persons who, 
when reaching the retirement age, are not entitled to an old-age insurance-based pension.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Expanding social security in old age in the context of a 
human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>51. Establishing or extending social security systems is more than a policy option or a 
means for reducing poverty; it is first and foremost a duty of States stemming directly from 
human rights norms and standards, in particular the right to social security and the right to 
an adequate standard of living.

<p><b>12</b> GE.10-12583 
</p>
<p>52. In order to fully contribute to realizing human rights, social pensions and any other 
relevant social policy should be designed and implemented in ways that ensure their 
compliance with core human rights principles and obligations. The following section 
examines the key human rights components for a social pension scheme that complies with 
human rights law.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Recognizing the right to social security, including the right to non-
contributory pensions 
</b></p>
<p>53. As a necessary part of a rights-based approach to social pensions, the right to social 
security must be included in national legal frameworks. The most solid experiences of non-
contributory pensions are those grounded in legal instruments that ensure the permanence 
of these initiatives and give rights-holders the possibility to claim for the protection of their 
right. Spain, for example, reported that the same legal instrument regulates contributory and 
non-contributory systems.33 Brazil has the right to non-contributory pensions enshrined in 
the Constitution and a law also indicates that the value of pensions must be defined in 
accordance to a national index for payments.34 
</p>
<p>54. Despite some exceptions, States&#8217; over-reliance on contributory systems has often led 
to situations where non-contributory schemes lack a sufficient legislative basis. In several 
countries, they are implemented through weak institutional and legal arrangements such as 
presidential decrees or simple operational manuals.  
</p>
<p>55. The lack of a strong legal and institutional framework and a long-term strategy can 
seriously threaten the enjoyment of human rights by the programme&#8217;s beneficiaries. A well-
established legal framework is essential to protect the programme against political 
manipulation, and guaranteeing the long-term involvement of State authorities in all stages 
of the programme. It also allows rights-holders to know what their entitlements are, and the 
criteria for inclusion in and exclusion from the programme.  
</p>
<p>56. In order for legal and institutional frameworks to comply with core human rights 
principles, they should spell out eligibility requirements, provide for mechanisms to ensure 
transparency and access to information about programmes, define the various roles and 
responsibilities of all those involved in implementing the programme (e.g. Governments at 
the national and local levels, international organizations and civil society organizations), 
and establish accessible complaints mechanisms. Finally, they should set the ground for 
participation channels for beneficiaries.  
</p>
<p>57. Legal frameworks are of particular importance when States decide to implement 
small-scale initiatives and pilot projects. States have a duty to ensure that when pilot 
projects are discontinued, for example, the beneficiaries are protected from negative 
changes that could lead to income insecurity.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Ensuring equitable access to social security and paying special attention 
to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups 
</b></p>
<p>58. Once the decision to establish a social pension is taken, States must ensure equal 
access to it. The principles of equality and non-discrimination require States progressively

</b></p>
<p>to ensure universal protection. These principles also require taking special measures to 
protect the most vulnerable segments of society as a matter of priority.  
</p>
<p>59. There are essentially two types of non-contributory pensions: (a) universal schemes 
that ensure that every individual above a given age is entitled to receive pensions; and (b) 
targeted schemes that are intended to select beneficiaries on the basis of their income or 
poverty level and their age. To this end, several instruments could be used, such as means 
testing, proxy means testing, community targeting and/or geographical targeting. There are 
many experiences of both types of pensions around the world, but evidence described 
below reveals significant advantages of universal schemes in reducing poverty.  
</p>
<p>60. Universal pensions require the simplest structure with the lowest administrative 
costs and therefore are more likely to be successful in achieving their aims. Many 
developing countries provide universal pensions, such as Bolivia (Plurinational State of), 
Botswana, Brunei Darussalam, Namibia, Nepal and Samoa. Universal pensions avoid 
creating disincentives for low-income workers to save for their old age and disincentives 
for older persons to continue working beyond retirement age. They can also reduce 
opportunities for corruption, as they are available to all who meet the age requirement and 
there is no stigma attached.  
</p>
<p>61. Universal pensions are also more gender sensitive. In targeted programmes, existing 
power imbalances within society distort people&#8217;s ability to access benefits. The structural 
discrimination of women based on gender stereotypes that prevails in most societies means 
that they are less able to influence decision-making processes and, as a result, may be 
excluded from receiving targeted pensions. In universal schemes, access cannot be 
manipulated to the detriment of women.  
</p>
<p>62. Moreover, with universal pensions, men and women receive the same level of 
benefits irrespective of their record in the labour market, thus recognizing the contributions 
women make in unpaid work such as caregiving. In developing countries, universal 
pensions may be the only means by which most women can guarantee income in old age. 
Universal pensions are also crucial to older persons in countries with high HIV rates and 
migration as many people will call on grandparents (mainly women) to care for children.  
</p><p>63. While including wealthier older people in a universal scheme may be a legitimate 
concern of States in the context of scarce resources, when there is a high level of poverty 
and low contributory pension coverage, the proportion of non-poor older people covered by 
the universal pension is likely to be small. Moreover, evidence suggests that attempts to 
exclude the wealthiest from a social pension may decrease political support, create 
disincentives to contributing to other pensions systems and even increase the total costs.35  
</p>
<p>64. If there are strong objections to including wealthy older people in social pensions, 
there are ways to reduce the benefits to the wealthier beneficiaries. One way is pension-
testing that excludes those with other pensions and, if well-designed, should taper the size 
of the non-contributory pension benefit in line with the income received from contributory 
pensions.36 This reduces the disincentive for people to save for retirement. In developing 
countries where there are inefficient progressive income tax structures, older people on 
higher incomes can often be dissuaded from collecting the universal pension where the 
benefit is a relatively small amount. Whatever method is used to identify eligible

 This means that, for every unit of income received from an additional State-run (or supervised)

</p>
<p>beneficiaries, it is crucial to have an age eligibility criteria adapted to the specific 
characteristics of the country.  
</p>
<p>65. While targeting mechanisms may be seen as way of reaching the poorest, from a 
human rights perspective, caution is required. In principle, human rights standards are not 
compromised by the use of targeted schemes as a form of prioritization of the most 
vulnerable and disadvantaged groups within a longer-term strategy of progressively 
ensuring universal protection. However, targeted schemes must be implemented with the 
intention of providing widespread coverage.  
</p>
<p>66. Implementing an income- or poverty-targeted system introduces exclusion errors 
because the selection of beneficiaries is a complex and often controversial process. While 
the State has some mechanisms to minimize this (e.g. cross-checking targeting and re-
targeting exercises), which can significantly increase administrative costs, the exclusion of 
rightful beneficiaries constitutes a violation of their right to social security. Moreover, those 
excluded are often the most vulnerable, as they will find it most difficult to claim for their 
inclusion. Targeting can also create perverse results such as encouraging older people to 
stop working, in order to keep the benefits. 
</p>
<p>67. Targeting requires sophisticated administrative systems that may not be available in 
many developing countries. Moreover, the more complicated the method of calculation, 
such as proxy means testing, the more opaque the eligibility criteria become and the harder 
it is for the intended beneficiaries to scrutinize the process. As the process becomes less 
transparent, it becomes increasingly difficult for individuals to claim for protection.  
</p>
<p>68. Qualifying conditions for benefits of targeted schemes must be gender-sensitive, 
reasonable, objective and transparent. Particular care should be taken to ensure that it is the 
wealth of the older person him/herself that is assessed and not that of their household. 
Using household targeting methods for an individual benefit can place older persons in a 
disadvantageous position because of a lack of studies about household distribution of 
wealth. While community targeting is a method that can be implemented at reduced costs in 
many countries, it should also be examined carefully. Indeed, by leaving the decision of 
who gets the benefit to the discretion of community leaders, community targeting can 
reinforce power structures and patron-client relations. This can result in creating tensions 
between beneficiaries and others, further stigmatizing some groups.  
</p>
<p>69. The main advantage of targeted pensions is that their overall cost to the State, when 
compared with universal pensions, is low. In practice, however, the affordability of 
universal pensions is a political question. Evidence shows that, where there is political will, 
even low-income developing countries can afford these programmes. 
</p>
<p>70. For all the above reasons, it can be concluded that a universal pension scheme is 
most in keeping with human rights obligations as: (a) it responds to the claim of 
universality of human rights norms; (b) it complies with the principle of equality and non-
discrimination; (c) it reduces opportunities for corruption and manipulation in the selection 
of beneficiaries which typically excludes the poorest; and (d) reduces possible 
stigmatization as it is available to all who comply with the age requirement.  
</p>
<p>71. Eligibility requirements for social pensions must be provided for in national law and 
mechanisms must be available to ensure the timely inclusion in the programmes. When 
adopting a universal scheme, States must put in place rolling registration systems to allow 
individuals to register as soon as they reach the age requirement. If the scheme is poverty-
targeted, the qualifying conditions for benefits must be gender-sensitive, reasonable, 
objective and transparent. </p>


<p>GE.10-12583 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Ensuring accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>72. The principle of equality and non-discrimination also requires States to ensure that 
social pensions are physically and culturally accessible to all older people. 
</p>
<p>73. States must remove administrative barriers that prevent older people from accessing 
social pensions, such as requiring identification documents for registration when such 
documents are costly or may not exist in countries where many people are not registered at 
birth. Administrative requirements often affect women disproportionately as they are less 
likely to have identity cards and have been registered at birth. There are alternative ways to 
assess and record ages based on local knowledge and personal references. Furthermore, the 
establishment of social pensions can be used as an opportunity to improve data collection 
and registration.  
</p>
<p>74. Ensuring that benefits are distributed within safe physical reach and at a reasonably 
convenient geographic location is part of ensuring accessibility. Limited physical strength 
and mobility can be a major obstacle for older persons, thus particular attention should be 
paid to older persons&#8217; opportunities cost in terms of transport, loss of labour or caretaker 
time. While electronic methods of payment (e.g. debit cards, smart cards and mobile 
phones) can improve cost efficiency and provide flexibility of access, issues relating to 
older persons&#8217; lack of familiarity with these mechanisms must be taken into account.  
</p>
<p>75. Cultural accessibility requires that outreach and information on social pensions must 
be specifically designed to reach excluded segments of society (e.g. radio announcements, 
talk shows, community plays, etc.). Outreach must also overcome illiteracy and linguistic 
barriers that may impair the access of older people from minorities, indigenous or migrant 
communities (e.g. by making information available in languages used by minorities and 
indigenous peoples). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Ensuring transparency and access to information 
</b></p>
<p>76. A human rights approach emphasizes that transparency and access to information 
are important safeguards against corruption and means of increasing accessibility and 
participation. Limited access to information by beneficiaries impedes their access to 
programmes and their ability to claim their rights. Non-transparent implementation of 
pension schemes risks perpetuating unequal power relations and increasing the likelihood 
of mismanagement.  
</p>
<p>77. Guaranteeing transparency and access to information requires careful consideration 
with respect to the core components of the non-contributory pensions system, such as: (a) 
targeting mechanisms; (b) eligibility criteria; (c) benefit levels; (d) existence of complaints 
and redress mechanisms. Individuals and organizations should have the right to seek, 
receive and impart information in a clear and transparent manner.  
</p>
<p>78. Increasing transparency in the overall functioning of social pensions will also 
increase public support for investments in these policies. Any perception that pensions are 
not reaching their rightful beneficiaries or lack of trust in the sustainability of pension 
systems can be used to justify calls for limiting investment in non-contributory pensions. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Ensuring accountability 
</b></p>
<p>79. Human rights standards emphasize that everyone has the right to an effective 
remedy when his or her rights have been violated. Policymakers and others whose actions 
have an impact on the social pension schemes must also be held accountable when their </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.10-12583 
</p>
<p>decisions and actions impact negatively on the right to social security of older persons. 
Moreover, effective accountability mechanisms not only enhance protection for 
beneficiaries, but also improve the efficiency of social policies.  
</p>
<p>80. A social pension scheme without accountability and redress mechanisms is more 
likely to be viewed as an instrument of charity that can be manipulated by political actors 
than part of someone&#8217;s entitlement.  
</p>
<p>81. Ensuring that everyone has a channel to complain can be a critical element to 
ensuring that power imbalances &#8212; often prevalent at local levels &#8212; are not perpetuated. 
For complaints mechanisms to play a meaningful role, they need to meet certain technical 
standards, such as: guaranteeing anonymity; allowing for individual and collective 
complaints; as well as being sufficiently resourced and culturally appropriate. Additionally, 
there must be independent and effective judicial and quasi-judicial (e.g. ombudsperson) 
mechanisms in place to monitor the general formulation and implementation of social 
policies. 
</p>
<p>82. To be effective social pension programmes must periodically review decisions taken 
on at least three key elements: (a) the procedures utilized to register beneficiaries (in 
particular to identify the possible wrongful exclusion of beneficiaries); (b) the 
implementation of the programme (to monitor all sorts of possible abuses occurring when 
assistance is provided at the local level, e.g. sexual harassment); and (c) the overall 
payment procedures (to monitor misappropriation of financial resources throughout the 
different stages of implementation).  
</p>
<p><b> F. Respecting the principle of participation  
</b></p>
<p>83. Wide and informed public participation in the development and implementation of 
social policies is an essential feature of policies grounded in human rights standards. 
Participation of the intended beneficiaries is not simply desirable in terms of ownership and 
sustainability, but is also part of their right to take part in public life which is a core 
component of human rights instruments. Owing to the asymmetry of power between the 
beneficiaries and the authorities that administer the programme, beneficiaries are often 
unable to realize their rights. Promoting meaningful public participation must thus be an 
essential feature of the design, implementation and evaluation of social pensions. Special 
attention must also be devoted to ensuring the effective participation of older women and 
other groups that may be marginalized.  
</p>
<p>84. Evidence shows that participatory strategies are often not meaningful as they are 
often reduced to mere consultation that does not allow for real input from participants into 
decision-making. Frequently, participation processes are incorporated to social programmes 
without serious thought being given to the factors that limit older persons&#8217; possibilities to 
take part in public life and influence decisions affecting them, such as physical impairments 
and sensory losses, local power structures and family relations. Relying on family members 
or community leaders as the only communication channel with older persons limits their 
ability to voice personal views and can reinforce their dependency on others. 
</p>
<p>85. In many societies, younger generations are prioritized and social protection schemes 
might also reflect this focus unless specific attention is given to older persons&#8217; concerns 
when defining collective priorities. 
</p>
<p>86. Participation should be understood in a broad sense. It should include not only 
beneficiaries, but also civil society organizations that can play a role in advocating for the 
rights of older persons. Indeed, participatory processes are important to mobilize public 
understanding of and support for the establishment of social pensions schemes grounded on 
the recognition of the universal right to social security. In particular, public participation in </p>


<p>GE.10-12583 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>budget exercises can ensure that public resources are devoted to expanding social security, 
in particular to the most vulnerable. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Ensuring the adequacy of the benefits 
</b></p>
<p>87. The financial affordability and sustainability of expanding social pension 
programmes have immediate implications on the determination of benefit levels. While 
States should bear in mind the need to expand the coverage of existing schemes, ensuring 
that the levels of pensions remain adequate for beneficiaries is also a major concern. In this 
context, the benefits must be high enough to enable older people to enjoy an adequate 
standard of living and afford the goods and services they require to realize at least the 
minimum core content of their economic, social and cultural rights. While the cost of 
schemes can be reduced by increasing the age of eligibility or decreasing the size of the 
benefit, a balance should be struck between reaching all those in need and providing a 
benefit that would allow older people a minimum subsistence level.  
</p>
<p>88. Considering limited fiscal resources, in some countries, it could be possible to begin 
with a universal pension offered at an advanced age (providing adequate level of benefits) 
and from there slowly extend the programme to include persons of a less advanced age. 
However, this should be carefully examined. While a high age requirement could reduce 
costs and help the programme to be implemented immediately and later scaled up, if the 
age requirement is too high it may be regressive, as it could predominantly benefit the 
better-off in society.  
</p>
<p>89. Social protection programmes should not be restricted only to monetary support. As 
addressed above, social pensions do not work in isolation &#8211; they must be complemented by 
various services. Older persons are rights-holders who require not only social security 
support, but a multitude of social services to ensure an adequate standard of living, 
including in particular access to health care. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Ensuring access to health care  
</b></p>
<p>90. For older persons, financial security and health are closely linked: expenses for 
health care and medicines account for as much as three quarters of the income of the 
poorest groups.37 Under these circumstances, the positive impact of social protection 
initiatives on older persons&#8217; standards of living can be nullified by the burden posed by 
health-care-related costs.  
</p>
<p>91. Social pensions should be planned and implemented in close coordination with other 
initiatives aimed at ensuring the enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of 
health by older persons. In fact, providing pensions can be a clear opportunity to further 
integrate health services into social assistance. For example, in Mexico beneficiaries of 
cash transfers were given the chance to participate in health prevention and nutrition 
workshops as well as other social activities.  
</p>
<p>92. In accordance with the interpretation of the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, the right to health must be understood as a right to the enjoyment of a 
variety of facilities, goods, services and conditions necessary for the realization of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.38 This includes the obligation of

<p>the State to guarantee timely and appropriate access to health care and address underlying 
determinants of health, such as access to safe and drinkable water or an adequate supply of 
safe food.  
</p>
<p>93. The living conditions of persons living in extreme poverty clearly impact on their 
health status throughout their life. Higher incidence of ill-health and premature mortality 
correlates with socioeconomic factors in all regions of the world. Ageing increases a 
person&#8217;s susceptibility to illness and disability, and this phenomenon is further aggravated 
by poverty as they are less likely to be able to afford health care and more likely to 
maintain poor nutritional diets. They are also more likely to have engaged in physically 
demanding work for a living. Therefore, policies must take into account that older persons 
living in poverty may have a greater need for health care.  
</p>
<p>94. In such circumstances, receiving a social pension can increase access to health care, 
especially in the long run as it represents a stable and predictable source of income. 
However, social pensions can only positively affect older persons&#8217; enjoyment of the right to 
health if adequate health-care services are in place. Research shows, however, that public 
health policies often prioritize younger women and children and lack consideration of the 
specific needs of older people.39 Thus, health services are not geared towards fulfilling 
these needs and there can be significant gaps in the provision of services. This is 
particularly true about long-term care, for which resources and capacities are limited 
everywhere.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Ensuring gender equality  
</b></p>
<p>95. Non-contributory pensions are the most efficient means of ensuring the right to 
social security for older women and compensating them for their years of unpaid or 
inadequately paid work. However, to ensure equal access by women to a social pension, 
special measures must be implemented to overcome possible barriers to older women 
caused by structural discrimination, such as lack of access to adequate documentation and 
identification; difficulties to approach administrations or lack of gender sensitive social 
services. 
</p>
<p>96. In some countries, structural discrimination against women and increased 
competition for family resources from younger members often means older women lose 
control of assets once owned by their husbands and are left without a source of income. In 
extreme cases, they are subjected to accusations of witchcraft. The context in which 
accusations of witchcraft are made is complex, resulting from deep-seated cultural beliefs, 
and the need to apportion blame and seek redress for a negative event, such as a death in the 
family or crop failure and poverty. Nevertheless, the low status of women and their 
inability to defend themselves makes them the primary targets of such violence. 
</p>
<p>97. In such contexts, the income security and empowerment that a social pension 
provides is vital. However, the importance of social pension for women must not absolve 
States of their duty to take other measures to ensure gender equality and protect women 
against gender-based violence. In most countries, women&#8217;s vulnerability to poverty will not 
change with a social pension alone. Measures such as access to land and economic 
resources for women, fair inheritance rights and full legal capacity are essential to improve 
their standard of living.

<p><b> VI. The role of international assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>98. Where there is political will, low-income and middle-income countries can 
implement social pension programmes. Without detracting from developing States&#8217; own 
obligations, international assistance must also play a role in helping developing countries to 
progressively realize the right to social security. In those countries where the protection gap 
is widest, establishing or enhancing non-contributory pensions requires overcoming 
considerable resource, institutional and technical constraints. International assistance can be 
critical in this respect.  
</p>
<p>99. States have made a number of public political commitments underlining the shared 
international responsibility for poverty reduction and the need for a partnership among 
developed and developing countries against extreme poverty.40 The commitment to support 
through international cooperation is also present in human rights treaties such as the 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (arts. 2.1 and 11) and the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child (art. 4). The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
further emphasizes &#8220;that it is particularly incumbent on States parties and other actors in a 
position to assist, to provide &#8216;international assistance and cooperation, especially economic 
and technical&#8217; which enable developing countries to fulfil their core obligations&#8221;.41 This is 
based on the underlying premise that some countries will not be able to achieve the full 
realization of economic, social and cultural rights if those countries in a position to assist do 
not actually provide them with assistance. 
</p>
<p>100. Despite these obligations and commitments, most Governments are consistently 
failing to honour their longstanding commitments to reach a target of 0.7 per cent of gross 
national product for official development assistance. Moreover, States have only recently 
started considering international assistance in relation to social security. Donor countries 
need to change this approach. Their responsibilities under international human rights law 
also require them to support and strengthen social security systems, including social 
pensions worldwide. This will substantially help reduce poverty and ensure compliance 
with human rights norms over the long term.  
</p>
<p>101. The international community can play a key role in supporting the initial set-up of 
social pension systems, in particular in low-income countries, for example, by providing 
technical and/or material assistance in designing programmes and identifying and 
registering possible beneficiaries. A number of core common principles can also guide 
donors on how to best support and ensure the long-term sustainability of social security 
systems, including social pensions in recipient States.  
</p>
<p>102. The effective management of social pensions requires a long-term view for the 
sustainability of these initiatives. Donor States must ensure a long-term perspective and 
predictability in providing assistance. Coordination within the international donor 
community is also crucial. When providing assistance for different social protection 
schemes, donors must ensure that their initiatives are well coordinated. A short-sighted, 
fragmented approach with little coordination can contribute to a proliferation of projects, 
which in time could hinder the establishment of a social security system sustainable in the 
long term with broad coverage.

<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 These commitments include, inter alia, the Millennium Declaration and goal 8 of the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals; the Doha Declaration and the Monterrey Consensus of the International 
Conference on Financing for Development.

<p>103. Ensuring sustainability also requires strengthening the recipient State&#8217;s capabilities 
to eventually implement the social pension programme unassisted. This includes a broad 
range of measures that can be supported by donor States, such as providing technical 
support to local and national authorities, building civil society&#8217;s capacity for monitoring the 
social pension system and holding the Government accountable, and assisting in the 
implementation of effective tax systems.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>104. <b>The rapid ageing of the world population, particularly within developing 
countries, requires that there be an urgent assessment of the existing policies aimed at 
protecting older persons. Extreme poverty amongst older persons is a reality in every 
region of the world today: lack of access to work and income, increased need for 
health care and dependency within the household are some of the factors that expose 
older persons to poverty. Unless action is taken, the situation will deteriorate.  
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The traditional reliance of many States on contributory pension systems as the 
main source of social security in old age has left a significant portion of older persons 
unprotected. This problem is particularly serious for women as most are not covered 
by contributory pension schemes although they tend to live longer. Investing in non-
contributory pensions can play an important role in empowering older people and 
contribute to the realization of their human rights, in particular their economic, social 
and cultural rights.  
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Non-contributory pensions are the only means by which universal pension 
coverage can be achieved and gender imbalances redressed. However, social pensions 
must not be regarded as the sole response to old-age poverty. To be effective in the 
promotion of an adequate standard of living, social pensions can only be one 
component of a comprehensive social protection strategy that addresses the impact of 
extreme poverty throughout one person&#8217;s life cycle and includes measures to ensure 
older persons access to adequate social services, in particular access to health care.  
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>Keeping in mind important lessons learned in developing and developed 
countries that invest in non-contributory systems of social security, the 
recommendations below attempt to summarize the main human rights concerns that 
States must address when establishing or extending social pensions. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Recognize social security as a human right and establish appropriate legal 
frameworks 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>States must recognize the human right to social security in domestic law. Non-
contributory and contributory pension schemes must be guided by international 
human rights standards for the right to social security. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure universal access to social security 
</b>109. <b>States must design social pension schemes progressively to ensure access to 
social security for all. At the very least, they must provide protection to all older 
persons who, when reaching the retirement age prescribed in national legislation, 
have not completed a qualifying period of contributions or are not otherwise entitled 
to an old-age insurance-based pension and have no other source of income. </b></p>


<p>GE.10-12583 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Integrate human rights principles and standards throughout the design, 
implementation and evaluation of social pensions 
</b></p>
<p><i> (i) Equality and non-discrimination 
</i>110. <b>States must prioritize the protection of the most disadvantaged and 
marginalized individuals and groups in social security systems. Universal social 
pensions are in line with human rights standards as they reduce opportunities for the 
unfair exclusion of potential beneficiaries. When poverty-targeted pension schemes 
are adopted, States must ensure they are fair, effective and transparent, include 
safeguards against discrimination and constitute a clear step on the road to universal 
coverage.  
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>States must adopt specific measures to ensure access to social pensions by those 
in most vulnerable conditions, for example, by removing administrative barriers that 
prevent them from accessing social pensions, such as the lack of documentation. 
Specific measures are also needed to ensure that benefits are distributed within safe 
reach and at a convenient geographic location, paying particular attention to physical 
and mental impairments that affect older persons. 
</b></p>
<p><i> (ii) Transparency, access to information and accountability 
</i>112. <b>States must ensure that information on social pensions is widely available and 
accessible, especially to the poorest segments of society. In particular, information 
about eligibility criteria, levels of benefits and complaint mechanisms must be 
accessible to all potential beneficiaries. The legal and institutional framework 
regulating pension schemes must guarantee the existence of accessible accountability 
mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p><i> (iii) Meaningful and effective participation  
</i>113. <b>States must ensure the meaningful and effective participation of older persons 
in the design, implementation and monitoring of social pensions. Considering the 
specific needs of older persons, participation mechanisms must take into account 
existing power structures within communities and remove particular obstacles for 
their participation in collective decision-making processes.  
</b></p>
<p><i> (iv) Ensure close coordination among social security and health-care policies 
</i>114. <b>States must ensure social security schemes are complemented by other social 
policies, in particular the provision of health care. States must ensure access to 
adequate health-care services and address other underlying determinants of health, 
such as access to safe drinking water and food. 
</b></p>
<p><i> (v) Pay particular attention to older women 
</i>115. <b>Non-contributory pensions are the most efficient way of ensuring protection to 
older women and compensating them for their years of unpaid or inadequately paid 
work. States must address the specific challenges affecting older women seeking to 
benefit from existing social services. States must also take other measures to 
complement social security measures by ensuring women&#8217;s equal access to land and 
resources.  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Enhance international cooperation 
</b>116. <b>States must enhance international cooperation efforts related to social security. 
They must devote particular attention to ensuring the sustainability and coordination </b></p>
