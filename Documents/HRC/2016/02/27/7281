<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. During the past decade there has been a rapid increase in the number of private 
</p>
<p>providers of education in many developing countries, with many schools and educational 
</p>
<p>establishments not being registered and being funded and managed by individual 
</p>
<p>proprietors or enterprises. Such providers are distinct from other non-State actors, such as 
</p>
<p>religious institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community-based groups, 
</p>
<p>foundations and trusts. As a result, education is being commercialized and for-profit 
</p>
<p>education is flourishing as an attractive business, with scant control by pubic authorities. In 
</p>
<p>the present report, the Special Rapporteur looks at the rapid growth in private providers, 
</p>
<p>which is resulting in the commercialization of education, and examines the negative effects 
</p>
<p>of such commercialization on the norms and principles and legal frameworks underlying 
</p>
<p>the right to education as established by international human rights treaties. He also 
</p>
<p>highlights the repercussions of privatization on the principles of social justice and equity, 
</p>
<p>underlining the need for safeguarding education as a public good.  
</p>
<p>2. Building upon his 2014 report to the General Assembly (A/69/402), the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur analyses education laws and evolving jurisprudence related to privatization. 
</p>
<p>Finally, he offers a set of recommendations for developing effective regulatory frameworks 
</p>
<p>for controlling private providers in education, in keeping with State obligations on the right 
</p>
<p>to education as laid down in international human rights conventions. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Recent activities carried out by the Special Rapporteur  
</b></p>
<p>3. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur undertook missions to Algeria 
</p>
<p>and Bhutan. In his 2014 report to the General Assembly, he wrote about the negative 
</p>
<p>impact of private providers on the norms and principles of education, the underlying legal

<p>framework of the right to education and the importance of preserving education as a public 
</p>
<p>good.  
</p>

</p>
<p>as a public good. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Commercialization of education and its unfettered 
proliferation  
</b></p>
<p>36. A recent in-depth study on privatization has shown that education as a sector is 
</p>
<p>increasingly being opened up to profit-making and trade, and to agenda-setting by private, 
</p>
<p>commercial interests that conceptualize the learner as a consumer and education as a </p>


<p>consumer good.1 The reconfiguration of public services within neoliberal globalization has 
</p>
<p>placed education squarely in the headlamps of the private sector2 and international trade 
</p>
<p>agreements such as the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the Trade in Services 
</p>
<p>Agreement.3 Low-fee private schools in developing countries are a glaring example of the 
</p>
<p>commercialization of education, characterized as &#8220;edu-business&#8221;.4 A potentially very large 
</p>
<p>proportion of these schools are unregistered.5 
</p>
<p>37. These developments have their genesis in the education sector strategies of the 
</p>
<p>World Bank, which have stressed since the 1980s the key role of the private sector in 
</p>
<p>education and compelled developing countries to initiate significant cuts under structural 
</p>
<p>adjustments to their public services, including education. The most recent World Bank 
</p>
<p>education strategy, the education sector strategy 2020 (released in 2011), gives increased 
</p>
<p>prominence to private-sector engagement in education; as does the Global Partnership for 
</p>
<p>Education.6  
</p>
<p>38. Promoting for-profit education, the International Finance Corporation considers laws 
</p>
<p>as financial hurdles and provides guidance to private providers of education to be &#8220;very 
</p>
<p>profitable and flourishing enterprises&#8221;.7 This is blatantly disrespectful of the human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations of international bodies, including the World Bank, as described in general 
</p>
<p>comment No. 13 (1999) on the right to education of the Committee on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>39. The commercialization of education and its unfettered liberalization, open to 
</p>
<p>operators for lucrative purposes or objectives, is contrary to international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>The introduction of private, for-profit education into the national education landscape has a 
</p>
<p>number of serious repercussions.8 Privatization leads to shrinking public investment. Its 
</p>
<p>negative effects on education must receive foremost consideration in public policies, 
</p>
<p>bearing in mind that education is a social good. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Widespread concern with the baleful effects of privatization 
in education 
</b></p>
<p>40. A number of scholars have critically examined the neoliberal model of schooling, 
</p>
<p>which is characterized by &#8220;State withdrawal in favour of privatization&#8221; and &#8220;market-

<p>anchored conceptions of schooling&#8221; &#8212; a departure from decades of the welfare state.9 The 
</p>
<p>work of numerous civil society organizations expressing concern about the negative effects 
</p>
<p>of privatization in education must be commended.10 
</p>
<p>41. UNESCO and the International Organization of la Francophonie have expressed 
</p>
<p>concern with sweeping privatization in education reducing education to a commodity: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;With diversification in the field of education, the private providers &#8212; international or 
</p>
<p>local &#8212; are more and more numerous. International consortiums have [become] specialized 
</p>
<p>in &#8216;selling&#8217; education. A number of local figures, including many teachers and even 
</p>
<p>educational authorities, are creating schools for profit, turning to rather wealthy families 
</p>
<p>with slogans extolling the quality [of the school] or are turning towards the disadvantaged 
</p>
<p>public with altruistic slogans, which often hide the profit or political character of their 
</p>
<p>endeavours. One can observe, above all, the emergence of a quasi-market phenomenon&#8221;.11  
</p>
<p>42. Private providers undermine the right to education, both as an entitlement and as 
</p>
<p>empowerment. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Privatization and the right to education as an entitlement 
</b></p>
<p>43. Entitlement to education in terms of universal access is an essential prerequisite for 
</p>
<p>the exercise of the right to education. However, privatization breeds exclusion, as those 
</p>
<p>who are disadvantaged are unable to access private schools. This aggravates existing 
</p>
<p>disparities in access to education, further marginalizing the poor. Furthermore, voucher 
</p>
<p>schemes purported to provide economically disadvantaged parents with the means to select 
</p>
<p>a private school in fact promote group differentiation.12  
</p>
<p>44. Often, the criterion for admission to private institutions is not merit or capacity, but 
</p>
<p>rather the ability to pay. This is in contravention of the basic norms set out in the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights conventions. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Privatization and the right to education as empowerment  
</b></p>
<p>45. Advertising that portrays private schools as providers of better-quality education 
</p>
<p>lures ill-informed students and parents. The phenomenon of low-fee private schools is 
</p>
<p>projected as an affordable means of obtaining quality education. However, there is no 
</p>
<p>evidence that &#8220;private schools do anything different to induce more learning than do public

<p>schools ... many private schools do worse than public schools&#8221;.13 Quality is also 
</p>
<p>compromised by the high prevalence of underqualified teachers or instructors employed, on 
</p>
<p>a temporary basis, in private schools run by small and large enterprises. This is in direct 
</p>
<p>contravention with the UNESCO-International Labour Organization recommendation on 
</p>
<p>status of teachers, which lays down a normative framework for the teaching profession and 
</p>
<p>applies to teachers of both public and private schools. 
</p>
<p>46. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
</p>
<p>(OECD), &#8220;public schools with comparable student populations offer the same advantages&#8221; 
</p>
<p>as private schools.14 These schools take credit for academic success, yet having<b> </b>educated 
</p>
<p>wealthy parents is the most determining factor in such success.15<b> </b>Generally, private schools 
</p>
<p>are chosen owing to the lack or poor quality of public schools.  
</p>
<p><b> V. International legal framework for the right to education  
</b></p>
<p>47. The State is primarily responsible for respecting, fulfilling and protecting the right to 
</p>
<p>education. The liberty of parents and guardians to ensure the religious and moral education 
</p>
<p>of their children in conformity with their own convictions and the liberty of individuals and 
</p>
<p>bodies to establish and direct educational institutions provided for in article 13 (3) and (4) 
</p>
<p>of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is not unfettered. 
</p>
<p>Such freedom in education is subject to compliance with minimum standards in education, 
</p>
<p>to which all private educational institutions are required to conform.16 The failure to ensure 
</p>
<p>that private educational institutions conform to the minimum educational standards required 
</p>
<p>in articles 13 (3) and (4) constitutes a violation of the right to education.17 
</p>
<p>48. The UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education contains similar 
</p>
<p>provisions. It provides that the objective of the establishment or maintenance of private 
</p>
<p>educational institutions should not be to secure the exclusion of any group, but &#8220;to provide 
</p>
<p>educational facilities in addition to those provided by the public authorities&#8221; and that &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>education provided conforms with such standards as may be laid down or approved by the 
</p>
<p>competent authorities, in particular for education of the same level&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>49. Education is not a privilege of the rich and well-to-do, it is an inalienable right of 
</p>
<p>every person. The State is both guarantor and regulator of education. The provision of basic 
</p>
<p>education, free of cost, is not only a core obligation of States, it is also a moral imperative.  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur considers it essential, when looking at privatization in 
</p>
<p>education, to bear in mind State obligations in respect of the right to education: States must 
</p>
<p>ensure promote, respect and fulfil the right to education.18  
</p>
<p>51. State responsibility for providing basic education free of charge is established in 
</p>
<p>human rights law. According to the interpretation of the Committee on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights, under article 13 of the Covenant, States are regarded as having

</p>
<p> 18 The obligation to fulfil incorporates both an obligation to facilitate and an obligation to provide 
</p>
<p>(Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 13, paras. 46 and 47).  </p>


<p>principal responsibility for the direct provision of education in most circumstances; States 
</p>
<p>parties to the Covenant recommend, for example, that the &#8220;development of a system of 
</p>
<p>schools at all levels shall be actively pursued&#8221;.19 States have an &#8220;unequivocal obligation&#8221; to 
</p>
<p>provide primary education free of charge to all, with a detailed plan of action to 
</p>
<p>progressively improve provision, under article 14 of the Covenant.20
 
The Committee has 
</p>
<p>stressed that, under article 13, States are regarded as having principal responsibility for the 
</p>
<p>direct provision of education in most circumstances.21  
</p>
<p>52. According to a report by the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), &#8220;only the 
</p>
<p>State &#8230; can pull together all the components into a coherent but flexible education 
</p>
<p>system&#8221;.22 Any State in which a significant number of individuals are deprived of the most 
</p>
<p>basic form of education is, prima facie, failing to discharge its obligations under the 
</p>
<p>Covenant. If the Covenant were to be read in such a way as not to establish such a 
</p>
<p>minimum core obligation, it would be largely deprived of its raison d&#8217;&#234;tre.23 
</p>
<p>53. It is an established principle of human rights law that the State remains responsible 
</p>
<p>for its obligations, even when they are privatized. The European Court of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>has held that, under the European Convention on Human Rights, a State cannot absolve 
</p>
<p>itself from responsibility by delegating its obligations to private school bodies.24 This 
</p>
<p>position is reinforced by the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which 
</p>
<p>emphasize that when States delegate their responsibilities to businesses, they remain 
</p>
<p>responsible for ensuring that their human rights obligations are being met by those 
</p>
<p>companies. 
</p>
<p>54. The State remains primarily responsible for education on account of international 
</p>
<p>legal obligations and cannot divest itself of its core public service functions. As the 
</p>
<p>Supreme Court of the United States of America stated in the historic judgement in 
</p>
<p>Brown v. Board of Education (1954), &#8220;providing public schools ranks at the very 
</p>
<p>apex of the function of a State&#8221; and &#8220;education is perhaps the most important 
</p>
<p>function of State and local governments&#8221;.25 
</p>
<p>55. Yet, instead of controlling the growth of privatized, for-profit education, 
</p>
<p>Governments often support private providers through subsidies and tax incentives, thus 
</p>
<p>divesting themselves of their primary public function. As a result, rather than 
</p>
<p>supplementing government efforts, private providers are supplanting public education and 
</p>
<p>commercializing education in the process.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Negative impacts of privatization on fundamental principles 
and norms underpinning the right to education 
</b></p>
<p>56. Privatization of education, where it has a negative impact, violates many of the 
</p>
<p>legal and moral norms upon which the right to education is established.

<p><b> A. Non-discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>57. Discrimination based on race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
</p>
<p>opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status is prohibited in 
</p>
<p>international human rights conventions, including the International Covenant on Economic, 
</p>
<p>Social and Cultural Rights (art. 2 (2)). Private providers do not respect the prohibited 
</p>
<p>grounds of discrimination and violate fundamental principles of non-discrimination in 
</p>
<p>human rights law: social origin, economic condition, birth or property are the preponderant 
</p>
<p>factors in allowing access to private schools. It is the obligation of States to ensure the right 
</p>
<p>to education without discrimination or exclusion. Privatization in education also has 
</p>
<p>repercussions on girls&#8217; right to education, as families prioritize the education of boys over 
</p>
<p>girls. Any scheme of &#8220;vouchers purported to provide economically disadvantaged parents 
</p>
<p>the means to select a private school in fact promotes group differentiation&#8221;.26  
</p>
<p><b> B. Equality of opportunity in education 
</b></p>
<p>58. Privatization widens disparities in access to education. Private providers disregard 
</p>
<p>the fundamental principle of equality of opportunity in education common to almost all 
</p>
<p>international human rights treaties (A/HRC/17/29 and Corr.1). Inequalities in opportunities 
</p>
<p>for education will be exacerbated by the growth of unregulated private providers of 
</p>
<p>education, with economic condition, wealth or property becoming the most important 
</p>
<p>criterion in access to education.  
</p>
<p>59. States have obligations to ensure that the liberty of providing education set out in 
</p>
<p>article 13 (4) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights does 
</p>
<p>not lead to extreme disparities of educational opportunity for some groups in society.27 
</p>
<p>Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 17/3, they should give full effect to the right 
</p>
<p>to education by, inter alia, promoting equality of opportunity in education in accordance 
</p>
<p>with their human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Social justice and equity  
</b></p>
<p>60. Education is instrumental in &#8220;promoting development, social justice and other 
</p>
<p>human rights&#8221;.28 Privatization stymies the principle of social justice, which is at the core of 
</p>
<p>the global mission of the United Nations to promote development and human dignity. Low-
</p>
<p>fee private schools &#8220;not only constrain social justice in education, favouring access for 
</p>
<p>some over others, but also social justice through education&#8221; as their raison d&#8217;&#234;tre is 
</p>
<p>&#8220;monetizing access&#8221; to education. This aggravates inequality through the structural 
</p>
<p>exclusion of certain groups, entrenching a neoliberal vision of society<b>.</b>29<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>61. In the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development, entitled &#8220;The future we want&#8221; (General Assembly resolution 66/288, annex), 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly underlined the importance of the right to quality education and 
</p>
<p>expressed the resolve of the international community to work for a world that is just,

<p>equitable and inclusive. The Special Rapporteur finds it difficult to reconcile this vision 
</p>
<p>with the social implications of privatizing education. Unless social policy becomes 
</p>
<p>transformative in a spirit of (re)distributive justice, progress towards development goals is 
</p>
<p>at risk and violent conflict may result.30  
</p>
<p><b> D. Preserving and strengthening education as a public good 
</b></p>
<p>62. Privatization adversely affects education as it &#8220;recast[s] education not as a public or 
</p>
<p>societal good grounded in democratic principles of justice and equal opportunity but as an 
</p>
<p>individual, atomized and personalized private good&#8221;.31 Private, for-profit schools disregard 
</p>
<p>basic norms and standards and undermine education as a societal good. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur has consistently underlined the importance of preserving 
</p>
<p>education as a public good, while promoting the view that the State is the custodian of 
</p>
<p>quality education as a public good. Understanding the multifaceted role of the State in 
</p>
<p>education is a precondition for critically analysing educational institutions and their 
</p>
<p>responsibility for preserving and strengthening education as a public good.32  
</p>
<p>64. Safeguarding education as a public good should be an overriding concern in 
</p>
<p>considering recommendations and analyses presented in the report of the Intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>Committee of Experts on Sustainable Development Financing submitted to the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly at its sixty-ninth session (A/69/315).  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Differentiated public policy responses towards non-State 
providers of education  
</b></p>
<p>65. Alternative schools for linguistic, cultural or religious reasons in line with article 13 
</p>
<p>of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights have a recognized 
</p>
<p>place in education systems and are important in maintaining diversity and protecting 
</p>
<p>minorities within countries.  
</p>
<p>66. There are other important avenues for meeting demands in education while a State 
</p>
<p>pursues the progressive realization of the right to education. Not-for-profit, NGO, 
</p>
<p>community and religious schools all have different motivations, dynamics and outcomes. 
</p>
<p>Governments can, as in Brazil, categorize various non-State providers in education. In 
</p>
<p>Spain, contractual arrangements33  between a region and a private school establish mutual 
</p>
<p>rights and obligations.<b> </b>Public support to such educational establishments must, as provided 
</p>
<p>in the Constitution of Cabo Verde, for example, be subject to pursuing the public interest. 
</p>
<p>67. Public policies can help communities and NGOs to establish schools. Community 
</p>
<p>schools can play a meaningful complementary role in the realization of the right to 
</p>
<p>education. Such schools may be sources of innovation, leading to new teaching methods, 
</p>
<p>curricula or school management practices that can improve the public system. As in the

<p>case of the Bodh Shiksha community schools in India,34
 
they can also be integrated into 
</p>
<p>public schools. Ensuring quality in education is important in efforts to ensure &#8220;socialized&#8221; 
</p>
<p>education, as in Viet Nam, where efforts are made to increase financial and other forms of 
</p>
<p>support to schools in the community. Collaborations looking to pursue the social interest in 
</p>
<p>education can lead to public education systems being reinforced.35
 
 
</p>
<p>68. Moreover, educational establishments set up for philanthropic purposes, which are 
</p>
<p>not profit-driven but promote education as a societal good, are valuable for generating 
</p>
<p>social support for education.<b> </b>Public policies can promote the foundation of public utilities 
</p>
<p>devoted to the cause of education. Corporate social responsibility can support education 
</p>
<p>development and must be fully harnessed. All those valuing education as a public good and 
</p>
<p>a social cause as opposed to for-profit schools can be encouraged by an enabling 
</p>
<p>environment and good governance for developing education, in such innovative ways as 
</p>
<p>special trust funds created for the purpose of maximizing national investment in education.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Private providers and national legislation  
</b></p>
<p>69. States remain primarily responsible for protecting the right to education. Many 
</p>
<p>countries have national legislation with provisions applicable to non-State providers of 
</p>
<p>education. In most cases, it is broadly conceived, covering freedom for religious and moral 
</p>
<p>education in accordance with article 13 (3) and (4) of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other international human rights conventions. 
</p>
<p>Except in a few cases, such provisions do not cover privatization in all its manifestations 
</p>
<p>and do not adequately address issues specifically related to the commercialization of 
</p>
<p>education. Laws on private providers exist in only a few countries.  
</p>
<p>70. With little or no effective control, the negative effects of privatization on the right to 
</p>
<p>education in several countries can already be seen. For example, a phenomenal increase in 
</p>
<p>low-cost private schools in Pakistan, which now enrol over 40 per cent of all students, has 
</p>
<p>exacerbated inequities at all school levels, thereby heightening instabilities and violence in 
</p>
<p>conflict-affected provinces.36 In Nepal, private providers, who can register as companies 
</p>
<p>and sell education services, continue to flout government guidelines.37 The growth of fee-
</p>
<p>paying, for-profit schools in Morocco is creating a system that privileges those with means, 
</p>
<p>with the risk of developing a two-speed education system.38 In South Africa, where private 
</p>
<p>schools have become increasingly popular among the middle classes,39 the national human

<p>rights commission recently launched investigations into the for-profit Curro Foundation 
</p>
<p>School.40 
</p>
<p>71. Omega International, a chain of for-profit, low-fee private schools run according to a 
</p>
<p>business model41 in Ghana, requires fees representing up to 40 per cent of poor households&#8217; 
</p>
<p>income42 and makes a mockery of education by not following the national curriculum43 and 
</p>
<p>by employing unqualified instructors.44 The Special Rapporteur notes that providing tax 
</p>
<p>relief or subsidies to private schools, rather than establishing good-quality public ones, 
</p>
<p>violates the Constitution of Ghana, which provides that every person shall have the right, at 
</p>
<p>his own expense, to establish and maintain a private school or schools.  
</p>
<p>72. Like Ghana, Kenya and Uganda too are allowing education to be commercialized 
</p>
<p>and are encouraging for-profit schools, such as the Bridge International Academies. This 
</p>
<p>violates these States&#8217; international legal obligations to provide free basic education for all. 
</p>
<p>It also contravenes the Children Act 2001 of Kenya (reinforced by the Basic Education Act 
</p>
<p>2013), by which every child is entitled to free basic education and the Government is 
</p>
<p>responsible for providing such education.  
</p>
<p>73. Chile has embarked on a transformative, regulatory approach to undoing the 
</p>
<p>devastating impact of 30 years of market-based policies in education, which have led to 
</p>
<p>high levels of school segregation and stratification.45 The Special Rapporteur hopes the 
</p>
<p>current reforms will dismantle the underlying neoliberal economic policies and restore 
</p>
<p>education as a public service through new, socially just and equity-focused legislation.46 He 
</p>
<p>also hopes that the negative consequences of privatization in Chile will dissuade countries 
</p>
<p>such as Peru from following that path. Nearly 25 per cent of Peruvian schools are private 
</p>
<p>and, rather than protecting the public interest in education, Peru has issued legislative 
</p>
<p>decree No. 882, which leaves it to the national consumer protection agency to regulate 
</p>
<p>private schools.  
</p>
<p>74. In Sweden, the Government launched a major review to abolish the motivation of 
</p>
<p>profit for providing education after falling in the Programme for International Student 
</p>
<p>Assessment league tables and intends to bring in legislation by 2016 that would force 
</p>
<p>private companies to reinvest all profits back into their schools. &#8220;The Swedish free school 
</p>
<p>experiment shows that allowing for-profit providers into the school market has not led to 
</p>
<p>increased performance and improved schools, but instead permitted another vested interest 
</p>
<p>into education&#8221;.47

<p>75. As has been done in law in some countries,48 conditions under which private schools 
</p>
<p>can operate must be fixed by the State. In the Netherlands, for-profit, privately funded 
</p>
<p>schools, rather than private schools established for a specific religion, philosophy or 
</p>
<p>educational ethos, must meet the conditions laid down and obtain approval from the 
</p>
<p>education inspectorate if they wish to provide education to students of compulsory school 
</p>
<p>age. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Education as a public good  
</b></p>
<p>76. The concept of education as a public good can wield greater force when enshrined in 
</p>
<p>the national legal system. National legislation in several countries embodies this concept, 
</p>
<p>and must become more common. For example, the Constitution of Ecuador, which ushered 
</p>
<p>in a new human rights-based model for the State (see A/HRC/WG.6/13/ECU/1, para. 4), 
</p>
<p>establishes that education shall respond to the public interest and will not be subservient to 
</p>
<p>individual or corporate interests. 
</p>
<p>77. Similarly, the Act on National Education of 2006 in Argentina provides that 
</p>
<p>education and knowledge are public goods guaranteed by the State and that private 
</p>
<p>management will be based on objective criteria of social justice. The law in the Dominican 
</p>
<p>Republic stipulates that<b> </b>the State must primarily promote education as a &#8220;common good&#8221;.49 
</p>
<p>In some countries, private education is required to be a service of &#8220;public utility&#8221;,50 which 
</p>
<p>thus forbids for-profit education. The concept of education as a social good is also reflected 
</p>
<p>in the Constitution of Brazil. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Abolishing for-profit education 
</b></p>
<p>78. For-profit education is contrary to the concept of education as a public good, and the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur would like to mention national legislation in several countries that 
</p>
<p>outlaws for-profit schools. For example, the Education Act of the Bahamas51 establishes 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;the school shall not be established or maintained for the private profit of any person or 
</p>
<p>persons&#8221;. In Qatar, private schools are required to be authorized by the Supreme Education 
Council and &#8220;shall not be profit-oriented&#8221;.52 The Education Law of China provides that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;educational activities must conform with the public interest of the State and society&#8221;53 and 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;no organization or individual may operate a school or any other type of educational 
</p>
<p>institution for profit&#8221;.54 National legislation and policies in Finland give paramount 
</p>
<p>importance to education as a public function of the State and as a public good. The law in 
</p>
<p>Finland states that &#8220;basic education may not be provided in pursuit of financial gain&#8221;.55  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 48 For example, Law No. 2004/022 (2004) of Cameroon (art. 5); the Angolan Education Law<b> </b>of 
</p>
<p>31 December 2001;<b> </b>Law No. 1/19 of Burundi (art. 4). 
</p>
<p> 49 Organic Law of Education No. 66 of 1997 (art. 7). 
</p>
<p> 50 Constitution of Gabon (as revised in 2011) (art. 1, para. 19); the Framework Law No. 14/004 (2014) 
</p>
<p>of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (art. 137); and Law No. 2004/022 (2004) of Cameroon 
</p>
<p>(art. 2).

<p>79. For-profit education is illegal in some countries where the provision of basic 
</p>
<p>education is a constitutional obligation, as in Brazil and South Africa. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur would like to commend all those countries where for-profit education is 
</p>
<p>forbidden and to appeal to all countries to abolish for-profit education. He considers that it 
</p>
<p>is crucial to generalize this abolition in legislation and public policies, and to establish 
</p>
<p>effective oversight mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Regulating school fees 
</b></p>
<p>80. As many private providers seek to maximize the profits from education, rules and 
</p>
<p>regulations to control school fees must be imposed. Otherwise, the economic accessibility 
</p>
<p>of education for specific groups of the population is endangered.56 Public authorities can 
</p>
<p>establish maximum permissible fees to be charged by private providers, with a ban on 
</p>
<p>raising those fees without prior approval. The Guidelines for Private Schools in Bhutan, for 
</p>
<p>instance, require private schools to set and declare yearly lump-sum school fees for a 
</p>
<p>student for one academic year. In Cameroon, the fees in private schools are fixed by the 
</p>
<p>State under a contract, in consultation with providers of education.57  
</p>
<p><b> D. Minimum standards and human rights values 
</b></p>
<p>81. The commercialization of education necessarily involves the pursuit of material 
</p>
<p>values to the detriment of the humanist mission of education. Private schools propagate a 
</p>
<p>commercial value system and establish a learning system devoid of cultural diversity, as 
</p>
<p>they cater to particular social strata. The &#8220;cultural-valuational currency&#8221; they breed is 
</p>
<p>derogatory to the &#8220;moral worth&#8221; of the very poor.58 Privatization eclipses a holistic 
</p>
<p>approach to education: learning to know, learning to do, learning to live together and 
</p>
<p>learning to be.59  
</p>
<p>82. The humanistic mission of education can be strengthened and supported through 
</p>
<p>laws and policies. State policy in the sphere of education should be based on the humanistic 
</p>
<p>nature of education, giving primacy to common human values and the public character of 
</p>
<p>education, as is done in France and Greece, among other countries.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p><b> E. Some exemplary regulatory systems 
</b></p>
<p>83. In developing regulatory frameworks, States can draw upon existing regulatory 
</p>
<p>systems and approaches. Algeria, for example, is noteworthy for controlling private 
</p>
<p>educational establishments; such establishments are subject to prior authorization by the 
</p>
<p>Minister of Education and the conditions of their creation and opening are controlled by 
</p>
<p>strict rules. They are required to follow official programmes and bear civil responsibility 
</p>
<p>towards students and the educational personnel employed. At the time of establishment, and 
</p>
<p>each year thereafter, they must declare their sources of financing, including gifts and 
</p>
<p>legacies, and cannot receive any financing grant or donations from national or foreign 
</p>
<p>

<p>associations, institutions or organizations without prior approval by the Minister of 
</p>
<p>Education. Finally, the regulations provide for sanctions in case of non-conformity to the 
</p>
<p>rules by private educational establishments.60 
</p>
<p>84. In Japan, the School Education Act fixes minimum standards in education with 
</p>
<p>curriculum guidelines, and the ordinance for the enforcement of the Act provides a basis for 
</p>
<p>application of the guidelines. The country&#8217;s Private Schools Act61 lays down requirements 
</p>
<p>for the establishment and management of private schools. Failure to follow specific 
</p>
<p>regulations is punishable by sanctions of a civil nature. 
</p>
<p>85. Singapore is an especially noteworthy example of how States can effectively 
</p>
<p>regulate private education providers with sanctions in cases of abusive practices. According 
</p>
<p>to the country&#8217;s Private Education Act, private educational establishments must be 
</p>
<p>registered and abide by very strict quality standards and norms. They can be refused 
</p>
<p>permission to operate if the private education institution is not in the public interest. The 
</p>
<p>Act establishes duties and management accountabilities. It provides that &#8220;any registered 
</p>
<p>private education institution which contravenes any requirement or restriction imposed &#8230; 
</p>
<p>shall be guilty of an offence&#8221; and makes acting &#8220;fraudulently or dishonestly&#8221; or 
</p>
<p>&#8220;misleading&#8221; the public punishable by law.62 The Act contains comprehensive provisions 
</p>
<p>on inspection, enforcement and offences, as well as a detailed section on offences by 
</p>
<p>corporate bodies, including unincorporated associations that, when found guilty of an 
</p>
<p>offence, shall be liable to be prosecuted and punished accordingly.63 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Justiciability of the operations of private education providers 
</b></p>
<p>86. International and regional human rights monitoring mechanisms have noted that 
</p>
<p>States have an obligation to protect individuals from human rights abuses committed by 
</p>
<p>private parties. Public accountability of privatized schools and availability of remedies and 
</p>
<p>recourse from their decisions should be specifically and unambiguously provided for by 
</p>
<p>law. The regulatory role of the State is clearly within the scope of the obligation to 
</p>
<p>protect.64 Existing jurisprudence enables a better understanding of the obligations that the 
</p>
<p>right to education imposes upon private providers. 
</p>
<p>87. A number of court rulings worldwide have established that private providers in 
</p>
<p>education are accountable to the State and to the public. The Supreme Court of Nepal 
</p>
<p>found that fees charged by private providers of education were increasing social and 
</p>
<p>economic disparity. It ruled that the educational authorities had to devise reform 
</p>
<p>programmes to regulate private schools: regulating fees, prohibiting the sale of 
</p>
<p>unregistered and overpriced textbooks and limiting the number of private schools being 
</p>
<p>accredited.65 
</p>
<p>88. In another case, the South African Constitutional Court found that the primary 
</p>
<p>positive obligation with respect to the right to education rests on the State and that private 
</p>

<p>actors providing basic education have an obligation not to infringe on the students&#8217; right to 
</p>
<p>education.66  
</p>
<p>89. In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court of India ruled that when the Government 
</p>
<p>grants recognition to private educational institutions, it creates an agency to fulfil its 
</p>
<p>obligation to enable the citizens to enjoy the right to education: &#8220;Charging a capitation fee 
</p>
<p>in consideration of admission to educational institutions is a patent denial of a citizen&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>right to education under the Constitution&#8221;.67 
</p>
<p>90. The Constitutional Court of Colombia ruled in 1997 that excluding pupils from 
</p>
<p>schools on an economic basis only violates their enjoyment of the right to education.68 
</p>
<p>The Court also ruled that because of the fundamental character of the right to education, 
</p>
<p>private schools are bound by specific constitutional obligations.69  
</p>
<p>91. Courts in the United States have also ruled that using public money to fund private 
</p>
<p>school tuition vouchers is unconstitutional, and that public money being so used should 
</p>
<p>instead go to public schools.70 
</p>
<p>92. Independent judicial systems and independent human rights mechanisms are 
</p>
<p>necessary for ensuring that laws and regulations are enforced. It is also important that 
</p>
<p>judges be well-versed in the international obligations of States on the right to education.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>Regulations on private providers should be widely publicized so as to make them better 
</p>
<p>known, especially among parents, teachers and community members and organizations, and 
</p>
<p>should allow for any entity or individual to initiate legal action in cases of abusive or illegal 
</p>
<p>practices by private providers. Supporting public interest litigation safeguarding the right to 
</p>
<p>education against forces of privatization is also important.  
</p>
<p><b> X. Regulatory framework for governing private providers, 
centred on education as a public good 
</b></p>
<p>93. The commercialization of education by all kinds of for-profit operators or with 
</p>
<p>objectives contrary to international commitments by States and national values must be 
</p>
<p>stopped and sanctioned. Corruption by private providers continues owing to a lack of 
</p>
<p>regulations and monitoring, oversight and control mechanisms. As a result, the delivery of 
</p>
<p>primary or basic education can be made a family business by running a school in a private 
</p>
<p>house. Furthermore, few Governments have satisfactory regulations on tutoring by private 
</p>
<p>tutorial companies. Regulations for such companies are also necessary.71

</p>
<p>Education, 2013). </p>


<p>94. A regulatory framework for private providers is thus of critical importance in setting 
</p>
<p>out responsibilities and accountability requirements.72<b> </b>The corporate sector has a long track 
</p>
<p>record of attempting to prevent government regulation and numerous corporations have 
</p>
<p>sued Governments for trying to implement regulations that could harm their profits. 
</p>
<p>Governments must be bold in regulating private operators, focusing on education as a 
</p>
<p>public good. Regulations must ensure that education is accessible to all, works towards the 
</p>
<p>broader public interest and reflects a broad humanistic notion of education.  
</p>
<p>95. It should be mandatory for private providers to be transparent73 and to share with 
</p>
<p>parents, teachers and community associations information regarding school functioning, 
</p>
<p>performance and management. A regulatory framework should clearly spell out the duties 
</p>
<p>and responsibilities of private providers vis-&#224;-vis the community, students, teachers and 
</p>
<p>society at large.  
</p>
<p>96. The importance of a regulatory framework has been recognized by the United States 
</p>
<p>Supreme Court: even in the case of traditional private education, individual States have the 
</p>
<p>power to reasonably regulate all schools, to inspect, supervise and examine them, their 
</p>
<p>teachers and pupils and to ensure that teachers are of good moral character and patriotic 
</p>
<p>disposition, that certain studies plainly essential to good citizenship are taught and that 
</p>
<p>nothing is taught that is manifestly inimical to the public welfare.74  
</p>
<p>97. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize the need for States to create a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive regulatory framework to control private providers in education and uproot 
</p>
<p>commercialization in education. He considers that such a framework can be developed by 
</p>
<p>developing regulations that prescriptive, prohibitory and punitive. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Prescriptive regulations  
</b></p>
<p>98. Prescriptive regulations relate to the establishment and operation of private schools, 
</p>
<p>setting minimum standards, including conditions for their recognition and operations, 
</p>
<p>curriculum requirements, minimum qualifications for teachers, infrastructure standards and 
</p>
<p>quality measures, and recognition of degrees or diplomas issued.75 These are basic 
</p>
<p>requirements for any institution. Such regulations describe reporting obligations, including 
</p>
<p>performance measures and financial reporting, and require compliance with monitoring and 
</p>
<p>oversight agencies.

</p>
<p>the International Organization of la Francophonie, annex XII. </p>


<p><b> B. Prohibitive regulations 
</b></p>
<p>99. Regulations must ban for-profit education and prohibit fee-based discrimination 
</p>
<p>because it creates and entrenches social and economic inequalities.76 Prohibitive regulations 
</p>
<p>can ban the registration of private schools as companies, the recruitment of unqualified 
</p>
<p>teachers or those employed in public schools, the closure of schools during an academic 
</p>
<p>year, indulgence in false commercial propaganda to lure insufficiently informed students 
</p>
<p>and parents,77 the charging of capitation fees and the extraction from students or parents of 
</p>
<p>any undeclared financial contribution over and above the approved fee. Regulations must 
</p>
<p>prohibit school selection on the basis of ability, social or ethnic origin, or any form of 
</p>
<p>psychometric tests.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Punitive regulations  
</b></p>
<p>100. According to one scholar, &#8220;the failure to enforce and monitor the regulatory 
</p>
<p>framework within which private schools are to function has left the educational landscape 
</p>
<p>open to corrupt practice and manipulation&#8221;.78 In addition to being prescriptive and 
</p>
<p>prohibitive, the regulatory framework should also be punitive, including withdrawal of 
</p>
<p>operating licences for lack of compliance with regulations. This is necessary to control non-
</p>
<p>compliance with regulations as well as to take action against private providers who indulge 
</p>
<p>in fraudulent and corrupt practices, such as false declarations of profits or of salaries paid to 
</p>
<p>teachers and tax evasion. It is important that corrupt and fraudulent practices are 
</p>
<p>investigated, and operators and owners of schools who act illegally or abscond with student 
</p>
<p>fees are prosecuted in the criminal system.79  
</p>
<p><b> XI. Oversight and monitoring mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>101. The lack of effective oversight and regulating mechanisms is one of the most 
</p>
<p>significant failures of States. In spite of regulations for registration and recognition, the 
</p>
<p>rapid growth of unregistered low-fee private schools in the developing world shows that 
</p>
<p>implementation gaps remain. The State has the responsibility to establish an oversight 
</p>
<p>mechanism for private schools and must ensure its laws are being complied with. 
</p>
<p>102. The Special Rapporteur urges public authorities, parent-teacher associations, civil 
</p>
<p>society groups and teachers&#8217; unions to closely monitor publicity and false claims that 
</p>
<p>promote private providers in education. Public authorities should look into all cases of 
</p>
<p>commercial advertising in education and take action in all cases of misleading claims as to 
</p>
<p>quality education. 
</p>
<p>103. It is important that States carefully enforce laws, rules and regulations through 
</p>
<p>monitoring and enforcement. Governments should strengthen national human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms or ombudspersons to provide parents with a place to report suspected 
</p>
<p>violations, and empower such bodies to investigate allegations.

</p>
<p>countries&#8221;, Day Ashley et al., &#8220;The role and impact of private schools&#8221;, p. 27.  </p>


<p>104. Parliamentarians have a crucial role to play in safeguarding the right to education by 
</p>
<p>passing necessary legislation and, especially, by ensuring that for-profit education is 
</p>
<p>outlawed, taking up questions related to enforcing laws, rules and regulations.  
</p>
<p><b>  Monitoring privatization in education and United Nations human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>105. The repercussions of privatization in education and the need for regulation is being 
</p>
<p>increasingly recognized by the United Nations treaty bodies, notably the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
</p>
<p>and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Thus, in its concluding 
</p>
<p>observations with respect to Morocco (CRC/C/MAR/CO/3-4), the Committee on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of the Child expressed concern with the rapid expansion of private education, especially at 
</p>
<p>the primary level, without the necessary supervision, leading to the reinforcement of 
</p>
<p>inequalities in the enjoyment of the right to education. The Committee on Economic, Social 
</p>
<p>and Cultural Rights has also sought information from Morocco about the development of 
</p>
<p>private education and on the impact of privatization on education system (see 
</p>
<p>E/C.12/MAR/Q/4). 
</p>
<p>106. The questioning of the privatization of education in Ghana by both the Committee 
</p>
<p>on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (see CEDAW/C/GHA/Q/6-7) and the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Rights of the Child (see CRC/C/GHA/Q/3-5) is a welcome development.
 
</p>
<p>In October 2014, the Committee on the Rights of the Child asked Ghana to provide detailed 
</p>
<p>information on the reasons behind the increase in private education, which limits access to 
</p>
<p>quality education for children who cannot afford private school tuitions (ibid.). The 
</p>
<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has asked the Government of Uganda 
</p>
<p>to provide information on the impact of the growth of private education on the right to 
</p>
<p>education of girls and children living in poverty (see E/C.12/UGA/Q/1). 
</p>
<p>107. The Special Rapporteur would like especially to urge the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>that, in the context of the universal periodic review, noted that it is crucial to inquire about 
</p>
<p>the negative impacts of privatization on the right to education in countries under review and 
</p>
<p>measures taken by Governments to regulate private providers and safeguard education as a 
</p>
<p>public good. State obligations for protecting right to education, particularly in the context of 
</p>
<p>privatization, must be a central concern. 
</p>
<p><b> XII. Post-2015 development agenda  
</b></p>
<p>108. Education provided by private proprietors or enterprises is neither free nor equitable 
</p>
<p>and the Special Rapporteur welcomes the proposal of the Open Working Group on 
</p>
<p>Sustainable Development Goals to ensure, by 2030, that all girls and boys complete free, 
</p>
<p>equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective 
</p>
<p>learning outcomes, as well as to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and 
</p>
<p>promote lifelong learning opportunities for all (see A/68/970 and Corr.1, goal 4 and target 
</p>
<p>4.1). The underlying obligation for States to realize the right to education, including 
</p>
<p>through enhanced public investment in education as an essential prerequisite, must be 
</p>
<p>emphasized.  </p>


<p>109. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur refers with concern to the 2014 report on 
</p>
<p>assessing progress in Africa towards the Millennium Development Goals,80 which contains 
</p>
<p>a recommendation to speed up private sector investment in education.<b> </b>This disrespects the 
</p>
<p>proposal by the Open Working Group and undermines the right to education.<b> </b>The 
</p>
<p>conclusions in the report that &#8220;Africa must build a vibrant private sector that supports the 
</p>
<p>development of a dynamic primary education system ... establishing a liberal and attractive 
</p>
<p>regulatory framework that is conducive to profitable returns on investment&#8221; overthrows 
</p>
<p>States&#8217; responsibility for education as an essential public function. Ensuring free education 
</p>
<p>of good quality for all is a core obligation of States, as established in, among others, the 
</p>
<p>African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, which provides that every individual shall 
</p>
<p>have the right to education. The Special Rapporteur therefore commends a joint statement 
</p>
<p>by civil society organizations calling for the withdrawal of that report.81  
</p>
<p>110. Building an inclusive education system is a main thrust of the future development 
</p>
<p>agenda and requires measures to curb privatization, which breeds exclusion and inequities 
</p>
<p>and jeopardizes human development. Privatization impedes access to free basic education 
</p>
<p>for the poor and marginalized; preventing this must be an overriding development concern, 
</p>
<p>since education is a key instrument for ending poverty. The post-2015 development agenda 
</p>
<p>should contain firm commitments by Governments to fostering social justice and equity and 
</p>
<p>accordingly devise national implementation strategies for effectively regulating 
</p>
<p>privatization in education.  
</p>
<p><b> XIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>Education is a fundamental human right and a core obligation of States. It is 
</b></p>
<p><b>not a privilege of the rich and well-to-do, it is an inalienable right of every person. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Principal responsibility for the direct provision of education lies with the State. 
</b></p>
<p><b>However, education as a public function of States is being eroded by market-driven 
</b></p>
<p><b>approaches and the rapid growth of private providers, with scant control by public 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities. Privatization negatively affects the right to education both as an 
</b></p>
<p><b>entitlement and as empowerment. It breeds exclusion and marginalization, with 
</b></p>
<p><b>crippling effects on the fundamental principle of equality of opportunity in education. 
</b></p>
<p><b>It also entails disinvestment in public education. 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Education benefits both the individual and the society and must be preserved as 
</b></p>
<p><b>a public good; social interest in education must be protected against its 
</b></p>
<p><b>commercialization. </b>T<b>he corrosive impact of privatization on the right to education 
</b></p>
<p><b>must receive foremost consideration in education laws and public policies. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>commercialization of educatio</b>n should have no place in a country&#8217;s education system. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>Guided by principles of social justice and equity, as well as human rights law, 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulating private providers is essential to mitigate the potentially deleterious and 
</b></p>
<p><b>negative effects on students, education systems and societies. In this, Governments can 
</b></p>
<p><b>be inspired by </b>numerous decisions by courts and emerging jurisprudence. <b>  
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>Bearing in mind the issues highlighted in the present report, the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur would like to offer the recommendations below.

<p><b> 1. Provision of education as the State</b>&#8217;s<b> responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>The State remains primarily responsible for fulfilling the right to education on 
</b></p>
<p><b>account of its international legal obligations. Governments should not allow low-fee 
</b></p>
<p><b>private schools and should restore education as their essential public service function. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The provision of basic education free of cost is not only a core obligation of the State, 
</b></p>
<p><b>it is also a moral imperative. The State must discharge its responsibility as guarantor 
</b></p>
<p><b>and regulator of education as a fundamental human right of every child. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Regulatory framework centred on education as a public good 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>States should put in place an elaborate framework of regulations that are 
</b></p>
<p><b>prescriptive, prohibitory and punitive, in order to control private providers. 
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>Prescriptive regulations clearly establish conditions under which private 
</b></p>
<p><b>providers may be permitted to operate within a country, as well as minimum norms 
</b></p>
<p><b>and standards with which schools must comply. In the absence of such regulations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>unregistered schools may proliferate. </b>Laws on education should spell out the <b>duties</b> 
</p>
<p>and responsibilities of private providers vis<b>-</b>&#224;<b>-</b>vis communities, students, 
</p>
<p>teachers and societies at large.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>Prohibitory regulations are necessary to outlaw and stop discriminatory 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices, for-profit education and false commercial propaganda. </b>Education is a 
</p>
<p>public function and a social responsibility. No private provider should be 
</p>
<p>allowed to establish for<b>-</b>profit education and aggrandize private interests to the 
</p>
<p>detriment of public interest. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>Punitive measures are necessary to ensure compliance with standards and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>law. Sanctions must be applied when private providers perpetuate social injustices, 
</b></p>
<p><b>while criminal proceedings are necessary for fraudulent and corruption practices.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Controlling abusive practices  
</b></p>
<p>120. <b>Nationally designated authorities should undertake full-scale investigations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>fraudulent practices, including tax evasion by private providers who reap profits in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the name of education. States should ensure that the financial operations of all private 
</b></p>
<p><b>providers are regularly scrutinized and that this information is publicly shared.  
</b></p>
<p>121. <b>As noted in a recent study,82 the UNESCO International Institute for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Educational Planning should undertake a full-scale investigation of corruption in 
</b></p>
<p><b>privatized education and of the fraudulent and corrupt practices of private providers.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Revitalizing and valorizing education as an essential public service 
</b></p>
<p>122. <b>Learning from the devastating impact of structural adjustments on education 
</b></p>
<p><b>as an essential public service, and in the face of the prevalent market ideology and 
</b></p>
<p><b>surging privatization in education, States must expand educational opportunities, 
</b></p>
<p><b>recognizing the paramount importance of public investment in education as their 
</b></p>
<p><b>essential obligation. Under no circumstances should a State provide financial support 
</b></p>
<p><b>to private providers of education or allow private companies to operate multiple 
</b></p>
<p><b>schools. 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 82  Hallak and Poisson, &#8220;Corrupt schools, corrupt universities: what can be done?&#8221;. </p>


<p><b> 5. Engaging the community in expanding public educational opportunities 
</b></p>
<p>123. <b>When States alone cannot fully meet public demand for education, community 
</b></p>
<p><b>schools should be encouraged, as they can play a meaningful complementary role. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Public authorities should, therefore, engage with communities for the realization for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the right to education. Similarly, the foundations of public utilities established for 
</b></p>
<p><b>philanthropic motives should be encouraged to contribute to education as a public 
</b></p>
<p><b>good.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 6. Preserving education as a public good and fostering the humanistic mission 
</b></p>
<p><b>of education 
</b></p>
<p>124. <b>Public authorities should not allow the pursuit of material values to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>detriment of a humanist mission of education or the propagation by private schools of 
</b></p>
<p><b>a value system solely conducive to the market economy, with learning systems devoid 
</b></p>
<p><b>of cultural diversity. States must ensure that the education imparted in private schools 
</b></p>
<p><b>is in conformity with the objectives of education laid down in the Universal 
</b></p>
<p><b>Declaration of Human Rights and in international human rights conventions.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 7. Reporting obligations of private providers 
</b></p>
<p>125. <b>Regulations should prescribe full financial and performance reporting 
</b></p>
<p><b>requirements for all private schools. It should be obligatory for all private providers 
</b></p>
<p><b>to report regularly to designated public authorities on their financial operations, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>line with prescriptive regulations, covering matters such as school fees collected and 
</b></p>
<p><b>salaries paid to teachers, and to declare, in a fully transparent manner, that they are 
</b></p>
<p><b>not engaged in for-profit education. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 8. Strengthening human rights control mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>126. <b>Governments should strengthen existing human rights mechanisms such as 
</b></p>
<p><b>national human rights institutions and ombudspersons or create special mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p><b>to regularly oversee operations of private providers. Such mechanisms should have 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>suo motto</i> investigatory power, with a mandate to look into alleged violations by 
</b></p>
<p><b>private providers and any abusive practices. Recommendations made by such 
</b></p>
<p><b>mechanisms should be implemented by Governments.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 9. Monitoring of privatization and human rights treaty bodies  
</b></p>
<p>127. <b>The Special Rapporteur would like to urge the United Nations human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>treaty bodies to give special consideration during their dialogues with States to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>negative impacts of private providers and whether their operations are regulated and 
</b></p>
<p><b>controlled in accordance with human rights law and internationally established 
</b></p>
<p><b>frameworks of the right to education. </b></p>
<p><b> 10. Monitoring of privatization and universal periodic review </b></p>
<p>128. <b>The Special Rapporteur considers it important, in the context of the universal 
</b></p>
<p><b>periodic review, to look at the negative effects of privatization on the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>education in countries under review and for Governments to regulate private 
</b></p>
<p><b>providers and safeguard education as a public good. State obligations for respecting, 
</b></p>
<p><b>protecting and fulfilling the right to education, particularly in the context of 
</b></p>
<p><b>privatization, should be a priority concern in such reviews.  </b></p>


<p><b> 11. Fostering the justiciability of the right to education and public interest litigation  
</b></p>
<p>129. As already stated by the Special Rapporteur, the right to education is 
</p>
<p>justiciable<b> and Governments can usefully draw upon jurisprudence in formulating 
</b></p>
<p><b>laws, regulations and policies for regulating private providers </b>(<b>A/HRC/23/35). </b>When 
</p>
<p>State obligations are incorporated into national legal systems, defending the 
</p>
<p>right to education vis<b>-</b>&#224;<b>-</b>vis private providers becomes easier. <b>Rules and 
</b></p>
<p><b>regulations that govern private schools must be easily available, and avenues outside 
</b></p>
<p><b>of costly court systems must be created to allow parents, communities and civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>to bring complaints to public authorities. 
</b></p>
<p>130. <b>In order to defend the right to education vis-&#224;-vis operations of private 
</b></p>
<p><b>education providers, the State should facilitate and promote public interest litigation, 
</b></p>
<p><b>by providing legal aid or by supporting civil society entities that provide such a role. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The State should also support legal clinics in law schools that seek to research and 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforce the right to education in courts as a cost-effective way of promoting public 
</b></p>
<p><b>interest in education. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 12. Engaging with parliamentarians 
</b></p>
<p>131. <b>Parliamentarians, particularly members of education commissions or 
</b></p>
<p><b>committees, play a key role in laying down regulatory frameworks for controlling 
</b></p>
<p><b>private providers in education, as well as overseeing their implementation. Their 
</b></p>
<p><b>advocacy for such a framework is very valuable. States should empower 
</b></p>
<p><b>parliamentary committees to monitor private education providers, to ensure the right 
</b></p>
<p><b>to education is fully respected, protected and fulfilled in the country. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 13. Encouraging and supporting the role of intellectual community and civil society 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations  
</b></p>
<p>132. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon civil society organizations and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>intellectual community, as well as students, parents and community associations, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>expose the negative effects of  private providers in education. He encourages them to 
</b></p>
<p><b>voice their concerns more strongly and widely as an essential function of the social 
</b></p>
<p><b>compact for education in an endeavour to forge a global movement against the 
</b></p>
<p><b>commercialization of education. Their advocacy work for fostering social justice and 
</b></p>
<p><b>equity is valuable to counter market-based approaches in education. Research, events 
</b></p>
<p><b>and expert consultations on the effects of privatization on the exercise and enjoyment 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the right to education should be encouraged and supported.  
</b></p>
