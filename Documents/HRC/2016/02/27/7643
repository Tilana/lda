</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i>In the report submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to its resolution 24/6, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable 
standard of physical and mental health draws links between unhealthy foods and diet-
related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The Special Rapporteur highlights the urgent 
need for States to address structural changes in the food environment, which negatively 
impact individuals&#8217; enjoyment of the right to adequate and nutritious food &#8211; an underlying 
determinant of the right to health. Global trade, increased foreign direct investment (FDI) in 
the food sector and the pervasive marketing of unhealthy foods have increased the 
consumption of unhealthy foods, which have been linked to diet-related NCDs.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur outlines a number of policies to increase the availability and 
accessibility of healthier food options, including through fiscal policies and the regulation 
of marketing and promotion of unhealthy foods, as well as increasing information and 
awareness about the health risks posed by unhealthy foods. He observes States&#8217; obligations 
in ensuring the respect, protection and fulfilment of the right to health, and points to the 
responsibilities of the food industry in refraining from producing, marketing and promoting 
unhealthy foods. He also stresses the need for various accountability and remedial 
mechanisms by which individuals can seek redress to violations of their right to health, and 
underlines the importance of international assistance and cooperation in the prevention and 
reduction of the increasing burden of diet-related NCDs.  
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur concludes his report with a set of recommendations, aimed 
</p>
<p> United Nations <b>A</b>/HRC/26/31
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>at States and the food industry, to take concrete steps to reduce the production and 
consumption of unhealthy foods and increase the availability and affordability of healthier 
food alternatives.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The right to health not only embraces within its scope such underlying determinants 
of health as an adequate supply of safe food, but its realization is also inextricably linked to 
the fulfilment of the right to food. Access to nutritiously safe food as an underlying 
determinant of the right to health is connected with the concepts of food security and 
nutrition security. Food security is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization  of the 
United Nations as the situation where &#8220;all people, at all times, have physical and economic 
access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food necessary to meet their dietary needs and food 
preferences for an active and healthy life&#8221;.1 The Committee on the Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights has held that one of the core State obligations under the right to health 
includes ensuring &#8220;access to the minimum essential food which is nutritionally adequate 
and safe, to ensure freedom from hunger to everyone&#8221;.2 On the legal obligations under the 
right to food, the Committee similarly observed that: &#8220;Every State is obliged to ensure for 
everyone under its jurisdiction access to the minimum essential food which is sufficient, 
nutritionally adequate and safe, to ensure their freedom from hunger.&#8221;3 This concomitant 
obligation is increasingly important, as unhealthy foods have been implicated in the 
growing global burden of NCDs. 
</p>
<p>2. More than 36 million people die from NCDs every year. NCDs have outstripped 
communicable diseases as the leading cause of death in most parts of the world. Four main 
diseases &#8211; cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes &#8211; 
account for a majority of NCD-related deaths. Unhealthy diets are one of the primary 
modifiable risk factors associated with NCDs and account for 2.7 million deaths annually.4 
Low- and middle-income countries suffer a greater burden of NCD mortality, with 80 per 
cent of all NCD deaths occurring in these countries.5 Unhealthy diets are also linked to high 
rates of obesity, a growing global epidemic that kills around 2.8 million people a year and 
is a known risk factor for NCDs.6 
</p>
<p>3. Diets high in intake of foods such as burgers, pizzas, red meats, crisps, biscuits, salty 
snacks, sugary drinks that contain high levels of sugar, salt, trans-fats and saturated fats are 
known to pose a greater risk for obesity and NCDs.7 Most of these foods are 
ultraprocessed,8 ready to eat but energy-dense and containing empty calories devoid of 
nutritional value. Unhealthy foods consumed in small quantities and in addition to healthier 
sources are not necessarily harmful to health. However, given their high availability and

remnants of animal foods &#8211; with little or no whole foods.&#8221; </p>


<p>palatability, and due to aggressive marketing, they have replaced healthier foods in diets.9 
This is a particularly worrying trend for low- and middle-income countries, as the rate of 
consumption of unhealthy foods for such countries is projected to outpace high-income 
countries.10 While excess calories consumed from unhealthy foods may be expended 
through physical activity, the shift in technology from labour-intensive to service-oriented 
occupations and changes in modes of transportation have resulted in sedentary lifestyles 
and thereby reduced physical activity and energy expenditure.11 
</p>
<p>4. The processes of globalization, in particular trade and FDI in food processing, 
retailing, and food advertising and promotion, have been increasingly associated with 
driving shifts in dietary patterns towards those closely linked with NCDs.12 This is also 
demonstrated in the increasing presence of transnational food and beverage companies in a 
number of countries, particularly developing countries, and their pervasive marketing of 
unhealthy foods.13 While public policy responses are critical to addressing unhealthy diets 
by focusing on population-wide responses that alter purchasing and consumption patterns, 
there has been much less emphasis on addressing structural changes to the food system that 
largely affect people&#8217;s diets.14 
</p>
<p><b> II. Impact of globalization on food systems 
</b></p>
<p>5. The policies of globalization have played an important role in increasing the free 
flow of unhealthy foods between countries. Changes in the food system are now largely 
driven by transnational corporations (TNCs), including food and beverage companies and 
supermarket chains, which have altered diets from traditional and minimally processed 
foods to ultraprocessed ones. In fact, 75 per cent of the world&#8217;s food sales constitute 
processed foods, whose largest manufacturers control more than one third of the global 
market.15 TNCs have therefore been a critical link in the transition from minimally 
processed to ultraprocessed foods. They also greatly influence the sale and consumption of 
unhealthy foods in comparison to promoting the availability and affordability of healthy 
foods within the food system.16 
</p>
<p>6. Industrial technology has contributed to the dominance of TNCs in the modern food 
system. The use of agrochemicals and hybrid seeds in farming and extraction technology in 
food processing have allowed for large-scale food production at substantially lower costs.17 
The addition of high amounts of salts, saturated- and trans-fats to ultraprocessed foods have

<p>increased the shelf life of such foods and reduced transportation costs, making them more 
profitable.  
</p>
<p>7. The 1980s &#8220;structural adjustment programmes&#8221; of the International Monetary Fund 
and the World Bank compelled developing countries to open up their markets, including the 
food sector, to foreign trade as a part of loan fulfilling conditions. Agreements negotiated at 
the World Trade Organization sought further market integration by reducing tariffs and 
non-tariff barriers to trade, curtailing export subsidies and removing protections of 
domestic industry to promote the freer flow of goods and services.18 These policies were 
implemented as a means of increasing the efficiency of the food system in producing the 
foods that people needed and wanted, but they had significant effects on the types of 
available foods and their costs. As a result, there has been a drastic increase in production 
of certain products relative to others. For example, there was a substantial increase in the 
global production of vegetable oils such as partially hydrogenated soybean oil, a source of 
trans-fats, and palm oil, a source of saturated fats.19 Similarly, grains such as corn are 
produced in larger quantities to cater to the food processing industry to produce sweeteners 
like high-fructose corn syrup, substantially increasing global calorie consumption from 
such sweeteners (A/HRC/19/59, pp. 13&#8211;14). Studies show that countries adopting market 
deregulation policies experience a faster increase in unhealthy food consumption and mean 
body mass index, an indicator of obesity.20 In furthering the goals of market expansion and 
profits, critical focus areas of health such as diets and nutrition have not been given due 
consideration.21 
</p>
<p>8. Rise in levels of FDI in the processed foods sector is one such factor that allows for 
greater exposure to unhealthy foods in low- and middle-income countries.22 FDI is one of 
the mechanisms by which TNCs enter developing countries. FDI enables companies to 
purchase or invest in food-processing companies in other countries, which then produce 
processed foods for the domestic market. This circumvents import tariffs on processed 
foods and reduces the cost of transportation. FDI has been more crucial than trade in 
increasing sales of processed foods in developing countries.23 For example, in some 
emerging markets, the processed food industry is amongst the top sectors attracting FDI.24 
Most of the sales for popular soft drink and fast food brands also come from developing 
countries.25 
</p>
<p>9. Supermarkets and large food chains have largely replaced fresh food markets as a 
major source of food supply in most countries,26 and at a faster rate in developing than

<p>developed countries.27 Supermarkets based in North America and Europe have invested 
heavily in Africa, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America. Supermarkets are 
now the primary food retailers in Latin America.28 In one country, approximately three 
quarters of the FDI flows towards highly-processed foods like soft drinks, snacks and 
mayonnaise.29 
</p>
<p><b> III. Promotion and marketing of unhealthy foods  
</b></p>
<p>10. Global food promotion, marketing and advertising are closely linked with 
globalization, leading to dietary transitions towards unhealthy foods. The aim of food 
marketing is to increase demand for products by making people develop the habit of 
consuming the product regularly. Aggressive expansionist strategies pursued by TNCs in 
emerging economies over the last few decades have increased the visibility and familiarity 
of global food brands, which are then leveraged to increase consumption of these products. 
Specific marketing tools are used to increase consumption by ensuring the presence of 
global food brands in as many places as possible at affordable prices, while expanding the 
variety of their products to suit local tastes and purchasing capacities. In order to cater to 
some rural areas and low-income populations, soft drink companies have invested in 
smaller bottles at lower prices to create acceptability of the product. In other places, portion 
sizes are increased to encourage greater consumption.30 At an individual level, increased 
purchasing power and the convenience of ready-to-eat products promote the consumption 
of unhealthy foods. At a population level, the aggressive and systematic marketing 
strategies used by TNCs fuel this demand.31 
</p>
<p>11. The food industry spends billions of dollars on persistent and pervasive promotion 
and marketing of unhealthy foods. TNCs often enter into exclusive contracts with fast food 
outlets to sell their foods. Varied pricing strategies are used as a mechanism to elicit 
demand for unhealthy products. Supermarkets have also been found to provide more price 
discounts for unhealthy foods compared to healthy foods.32 
</p>
<p><b> IV. State obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the right to 
health 
</b></p>
<p>12. With respect to the availability and accessibility of nutritionally adequate and safe 
food, both the right to health and the right to food cast obligations on States. Under the right 
to health framework, States have a core and non-derogable obligation to ensure access to 
the minimum essential food that is nutritionally adequate to ensure freedom from hunger 
for everyone. Pertinently, the right to food framework requires States to ensure the 
availability and accessibility of food in a quantity and quality to satisfy the individuals&#8217;

<p>dietary needs, and which contain a mix of nutrients for physical and mental growth, 
development and maintenance, and physical activity that are in compliance with human 
physiological needs at all stages of life.  
</p>
<p>13. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights provides for 
progressive realization of the right to health, which means that States have a specific and 
continuing obligation to move as expeditiously and effectively as possible towards the full 
realization of the highest attainable standard of health. States should therefore formulate a 
time-bound plan by taking immediate and continuing steps to the maximum of their 
available resources. This obligation can be fulfilled, <i>inter alia</i>, by formulating polices 
related to health, as well as to sectors such as trade and agriculture. In particular, the right 
to health framework requires States to take measures to prevent diet-related NCDs and 
provide equal and timely access to primary health care. Thus, in order to ensure the three 
types of obligations under the right to health, namely to respect, protect and fulfil it, States 
should not only provide nutritious food, but also institute measures in all areas of 
policymaking to reduce the burden of diet-related NCDs. 
</p>
<p>14. The obligation to respect the right to health is a negative duty of the State to refrain 
from interfering with people&#8217;s enjoyment of their right to health. It recognizes the right and 
autonomy of individuals to make informed decisions with respect to their health. The 
obligation not to intervene in individual decision-making does not, however, imply a 
disengaged approach by States towards laws and policies concerning the food industry. 
Feasible alternatives should be made available and accessible to individuals from which to 
choose a healthy diet.  
</p>
<p>15. States also have the obligation to protect people from violations of their right to 
health from activities of non-State actors, including private food corporations. For instance, 
States should make sure that advertisements and promotion by food corporations convey 
accurate and easily understandable information on possible ill effects of their food products. 
This is important, as withholding or misrepresenting such information is likely to affect 
people&#8217;s diet choices, which impacts on the right to health.   
</p>
<p>16. Fulfilling the right to health is a positive obligation that requires States to adopt a 
national public health strategy and plan of action towards achieving the highest attainable 
standard of health. States also have the duty to ensure that information relating to healthy 
diets is accurate and available to encourage informed choices. In recognizing the close links 
between food and health, States would need to formulate multisectoral policies that 
positively affect the availability and accessibility of healthy foods. For instance, States may 
need to modify their food and agricultural, trade and fiscal policies. Such policies should 
take into consideration epidemiological evidence of diet-related NCDs and should be 
implemented and monitored through indicators and benchmarks. However, States should 
ensure that regulations do not unduly harm small-scale industries. Although it is necessary 
to ensure that foods produced by small-scale industries are neither unhealthy nor unsafe, 
regulatory requirements may disproportionately burden them. Alternative approaches, such 
as community and peer education among consumers as well as small-scale food 
manufacturers, may be more effective in persuading them to produce healthier foods. For 
instance, some States have successfully used peer education models in getting street-food 
vendors to replace harmful vegetable oils with healthier options.   
</p>
<p><b> A. Information and awareness-raising 
</b></p>
<p>17. As a step to progressively realizing the right to health, States should formulate and 
regularly update food and nutrition guidelines for a healthy diet for different groups, 
particularly for vulnerable groups, like children, women and low-income groups. 
Guidelines should be formulated based on scientific evidence and with the participation of </p>


<p>the community, civil society organizations and other stakeholders. To be effective, 
dissemination of these guidelines and nutritional information to people in a comprehensible 
manner is equally important. One regulatory approach that States should consider is the 
adoption of nutrient profiling models, in which foods are ranked according to their 
nutritional composition.  
</p>
<p>18. Education and public awareness programmes can help the population make healthier 
food choices. Consumer-friendly labelling of food products is a common method to raise 
awareness and encourage consumers to make informed decisions about their diets. For 
instance, some States have issued guidance for supermarkets and food and beverage 
companies to use images such as front-of-pack, &#8220;traffic light&#8221; food labelling.33 This creates 
awareness about healthier food options, impacting positively consumer choice. Traffic light 
food labelling makes use of red, amber and green colours to indicate high, medium and low 
content, respectively, of a particular nutrient. As children are particularly vulnerable to 
increased risk of NCDs in adulthood due to the consumption of unhealthy foods, States 
should involve schools in teaching children about the benefits of healthy foods in a child-
friendly manner.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Fiscal policies 
</b></p>
<p>19. To reduce the intake of unhealthy foods, States should adopt policies to create 
disincentives for consuming them. For instance, some States have levied a consumption tax 
on sugar-sweetened beverages to curb the obesity epidemic, with the revenue raised from 
sales to be spent on providing drinking water.34 However, merely increasing the price of 
unhealthy foods may have a punitive effect on low-income groups.  Reducing the price of 
nutritious food to levels cheaper than or comparable to unhealthy foods would make 
healthy foods more affordable. For instance, agricultural subsidies benefiting unhealthy 
foods could be removed and shifted to subsidies for increasing the production of healthier 
foods. States could take measures, such as tax benefits and focused investments in 
agricultural production, to incentivize farmers to produce healthier foods like vegetables 
and fruits (A/HRC/19/59).  
</p><p>20. Procurement policies could be used to encourage farmers to produce fruits and 
vegetables, guaranteeing profits and making more nutritious diets affordable for low-
income groups. For instance, some countries procure food grains at market rates directly 
from farmers that they then sell to low-income groups at affordable rates, balancing the 
interests of the farmer and a vulnerable group. Another measure adopted by States has been 
to encourage localized farming and then procure the produce for schools. This not only 
enhances local economic development, but also ensures the reduction of unhealthy foods 
among schoolchildren.35 
</p>
<p>21. Accessibility of healthy foods may not necessarily lead to their higher intake. Even 
though foods with high nutrition value may be available in areas and spaces alongside less 
nutritious foodstuffs, consumers may not be attracted to the healthier option based on

<p>various factors such as perceived palatability or lack of visibility of healthier options and 
their benefits. Retail stores and supermarket chains may stock healthy foods, but lesser 
shelf-space may be allocated to them or they may be placed at the back of the store.36 This 
would have a negative effect on consumption patterns in favour of healthier foods. To 
rectify this, States could urge and require retailers to arrange their products in ways that 
would attract the consumer to healthier options. States could also promote healthier foods 
through media and social channels traditionally used by food and beverage companies, 
from television to Internet advertisements.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Policies on marketing and promotion of unhealthy foods 
</b></p>
<p>22. To prevent harm to people&#8217;s health and fulfil their obligation under the right to 
health, States should put in place national policies to regulate advertising of unhealthy 
foods. States should formulate laws and a regulatory framework with the objective of 
reducing children&#8217;s exposure to powerful food and drink marketing. Such regulations 
should ensure that the food industry provide accurate and reader-friendly nutrition 
information when advertising their products.  
</p>
<p>23. To address the issue of aggressive marketing, some States have supported self-
regulation and have allowed food companies to voluntarily regulate their practices related 
to marketing and nutritional content of unhealthy foods to children.37 Companies often 
voluntarily adopt self-formulated guidelines and standards to restrict Government 
regulation and respond public demands. They have also taken joint initiatives and 
formulated guidelines for member companies to restrict advertising and promoting 
practices with respect to children. However, self-regulation by companies has not had any 
significant effect on altering food marketing strategies.38 Due to a variety of reasons, such 
as the non-binding nature of such self-regulation, lack of benchmarks and transparency, 
inconsistent definition of children and different nutrition criteria, companies may be able to 
circumvent guidelines, blunting the intended effect of marketing guidelines they instituted. 
</p>
<p>24. Collaboration between Governments and food corporations has been recommended 
as an alternative to self-regulation. One of the major reasons cited for promoting 
partnerships between private food companies and Governments is that food corporations 
have the ability to promote healthier dietary habits and are therefore a part of the solution to 
reduce and prevent the obesity epidemic.39 However, the conflict of interest between the 
State&#8217;s duty to promote public health and companies&#8217; responsibility towards their 
shareholders to increase profits renders private&#8211;public partnership suspect. In addition, the 
close relationship between food and beverage companies and Government agencies may 
lead to a lack of transparency and independence of regulatory authorities, which may

<p>undermine the effectiveness of public&#8211;private partnerships in States&#8217; efforts to reduce diet-
related NCDs.  
</p>
<p>25. Owing to the inherent problems associated with self-regulation and public&#8211;private 
partnerships, there is a need for States to adopt laws that prevent companies from using 
insidious marketing strategies. The responsibility to protect the enjoyment of the right to 
health warrants State intervention in situations when third parties, such as food companies, 
use their position to influence dietary habits by directly or indirectly encouraging unhealthy 
diets, which negatively affect people&#8217;s health. Therefore, States have a positive duty to 
regulate unhealthy food advertising and the promotion strategies of food companies. Under 
the right to health, States are especially required to protect vulnerable groups such as 
children from violations of their right to health. To reduce opportunities for targeted 
advertisements, some States have instituted laws to ban companies from advertising their 
products to children below a certain age and to limit the availability of unhealthy foods in 
schools.40 
</p>
<p><b> D. Policies on foreign direct investments 
</b></p>
<p>26. TNCs that manufacture and sell processed foods are making their presence felt 
globally by reaching consumer groups, which transcend national boundaries through FDI 
and international trade agreements, thus impacting on the health of transboundary 
populations. Recognizing this, States need to bring these companies within their regulatory 
framework. States may impose health-related conditions on investments by TNCs and 
require them to adhere to domestic standards on nutrition, advertisement and marketing.41 
For instance, States may condition investments by foreign retail chains on a requirement to 
make available healthy foods in their stores.  
</p>
<p>27. However, regulating FDI by TNCs through conditions on the kind of food they 
produce may affect the decision of TNCs to invest in these States.42 Some States, especially 
low- and middle-income countries that rely on foreign investments may not be able to 
impose health- or diet-related conditions. States may therefore not give primacy to the 
health of the population, undermining the full realization of the right to health. There is a 
need to use other approaches, such as incentivizing the manufacture and sale of healthier 
alternatives, to protect the right to health of people and still attract FDI. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Responsibilities of the food and beverage industry  
</b></p>
<p>28. Although international human rights instruments refer to States as primary duty-
bearers, non-State actors are also charged with the responsibility to respect the right to 
health. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights prohibits the 
violation of human rights enshrined therein not only by States, but also by any &#8220;group or 
person&#8221;, clearly implicating the responsibility of non-State actors in the realization of 
human rights (article 5). The right to health framework further crystalizes this position and 
provides that while only State parties to the Covenant are thus ultimately accountable for 
compliance with it, all members of society as well as the private business sector have

<p>responsibilities regarding the realization of the right to health. In the context of business 
corporations and TNCs, several guidelines have been adopted internationally that clarify 
that business corporations and TNCs have the responsibility to respect human rights, which 
includes the right to health.43 The responsibilities of business enterprises are independent of 
the State&#8217;s obligations to realize its obligations towards human rights and also of 
corporations&#8217; obligations to comply with national laws and regulations.44 
</p>
<p>29. The responsibility to respect the right to health requires the food industry to refrain 
from engaging in activities that negatively impact the right of people to the highest 
attainable standard of health. Where States have enacted legislation as part of national 
health policies to discourage consumption of unhealthy foods and promote healthier 
options, the food industry has the responsibility to comply with such laws and desist from 
undertaking activities that would undermine these policies. They should take measures to 
prevent, mitigate and remedy adverse impacts of their actions. For example, in light of the 
negative impact of food marketing and promotion activities on children&#8217;s diets, the food 
industry has the responsibility to refrain from advertising unhealthy products to children in 
accordance with national laws and regulations. Failure to exercise such restraint under 
domestic law may amount not only to a violation of the law, but also of the right to health. 
Similarly, the food industry should desist from promoting false or misleading health claims 
about their products, consistent with their responsibility to respect the right to health. 
Health claims about food products have often been shown to be unverifiable and deceptive 
about relative health benefits. Moreover, even where unhealthy ingredients like sugar and 
fat content are replaced with refined starch and promoted as &#8220;healthier&#8221; food options, they 
are still processed foods with minor improvement in nutritional quality.45 
</p>
<p>30. Studies have shown that the food industry uses various strategies to undermine 
public health nutrition efforts. For example, the food industry hires prominent academics 
for their advisory boards, which may result in findings being more favourable towards the 
food industry, with the danger that the food industry may use such biased findings to 
support its claims on nutrition.46 Other tactics include the funding of front groups (that 
appear independent, yet are controlled by other organizations), lobbying and instituting 
lawsuits and threats thereof.47 It has also been shown that, under the guise of corporate 
social responsibility to meet their ethical obligations towards society at large, big soft drink 
companies have attempted to shift the burden of the responsibility to make healthier choices 
onto consumers instead of addressing their role in creating an unhealthy food environment. 
Furthermore, corporate social responsibility has also been used by the big soft drink 
industry as a means to thwart attempts at government regulation and increase sales of their 
products, particularly to children.48 Such acts result in a negation of the right to health. 
</p>
<p>31. As the food industry plays a key role in the global food environment and is 
recognized as the primary driver of diet-related NCDs, it has a distinct responsibility to take

<p>steps to realize the right to health. While many challenges facing the food system, like 
environmental pressures such as draughts and floods, are out of the control of the food 
industry, there are several areas where it can make a positive impact on health by investing 
in and influencing healthier food choices. To this end, the industry should consider 
adopting standards to improve the nutritional quality of foods through product 
reformulation and to improve labelling and information on their products to contribute to 
healthier diets. The food industry should also invest in research to improve the nutritional 
content of their products rather than investing in increasing the marketability of existing 
products.49 Furthermore, supermarkets and fast food restaurants should take steps to market 
and promote healthier options. For example, in addition to providing calorie content of 
meals on menu cards, fast food restaurants should adopt appropriate nutrient profiling 
models that indicate the nutritional composition of the foods available.  
</p>
<p>32. In furthering their responsibility to respect the right to health, the food industry 
should ensure the transparency of nutritional information and composition, an area where 
thus far the efforts of the food industry have been woefully lacking. The food industry 
should take concrete steps to ensure that consumers have sufficient nutritional information 
about their products to aid and promote more responsible dietary decisions. Moreover, 
creating and implementing mechanisms that promote disclosures of conflicts of interest 
within their governance structures can contribute towards efforts to ensure transparency of 
the operations of the food industry. This is of particular relevance where global health 
funders, who are also non-State actors, are shareholders or sit on the governance boards of 
the food industry or vice versa.50 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Vulnerable groups 
</b></p>
<p>33. States have a core obligation to protect the right to health of vulnerable and 
marginalized groups. The present report focuses on three particular groups: children, 
because of their greater susceptibility to marketing; women, because gendered marketing 
perpetuates traditional and unequal gender roles; and low-income groups, because healthy 
food options are not readily available or accessible to them. Other individuals or 
communities may also face higher risks of diet-related NCDs due to race, gender, 
indigenous status or place of residence, as well as because of multiple or intersecting 
vulnerabilities. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Children  
</b></p>
<p>34. Despite the common association of NCDs with older persons, children are also 
affected by the full range of NCDs, including heart disease, cancer and diabetes, and by 
their risk factors such as being overweight or obese.51 Diet-related NCDs and obesity affect 
even very young children. For instance, of the 500 million obese people worldwide in 2008,

<p>more than 42 million were children under the age of five, with 35 million of those children 
in developing countries.52 
</p>
<p>35. Children are particularly vulnerable to diet-related NCDs either because they may be 
dependent on others, such as parents or schools, for food, or because they are more 
susceptible to marketing pressures.53 In addition, unhealthy childhood diets can have severe 
health consequences later in life because of the early formation of eating habits and 
preferences and also because childhood NCDs are likely to persist into adulthood. 
Addressing unhealthy diets as a risk factor for NCDs in children can bring substantial 
health gains and reduce the burden of health-care expenditure over their entire life cycle.54 
</p>
<p>36. In addition to marketing of unhealthy food targeted at children, including through 
toy giveaways, competitions, social media, cartoon characters, games, television, movies, 
interactive websites and in youth-oriented settings such as schools and recreation centres, 
parents are also often targeted by such pervasive marketing.55 This is done to encourage 
parents to buy unhealthy foods for their children. In many cases, the food industry&#8217;s 
marketing to children and their parents may be disproportionately aimed at particular racial, 
ethnic or socioeconomic groups, exacerbating health inequities faced by those groups.56 
</p>
<p>37. Children are also frequently exposed to junk foods in both public and private 
settings. Food served or sold in institutional settings such as schools may be 
disproportionately weighted towards junk foods or other foods of limited nutritional value, 
particularly in school lunch programmes, where funds for healthier foods may be limited.57 
Other places serving children and youth, such as sports centres, may also lack healthy food 
options. In the private sector, meals designed for children are often high in fat, sugar and 
salt, and fail to meet children&#8217;s nutritional needs, especially at fast food establishments. 
This may be the case even for foods marketed as &#8220;healthy&#8221; children&#8217;s meals. Where 
genuinely nutritious options are available, the default option may still be the unhealthy 
one.58 
</p>
<p>38. States are urged to implement their obligations regarding children&#8217;s right to health, 
which requires States to address obesity in children, limit children&#8217;s exposure to fast foods 
and drinks high in sugar and caffeine and other harmful substances, regulate the marketing 
of such foods and control their availability in schools and other places frequented by 
children. States should also ensure that effective health education and awareness 
programmes are targeted toward children, such as countermarketing campaigns or peer 
education programmes, and that healthy food options and information relating to them are 
available at institutions serving children, such as schools, paediatric health facilities or 
youth centres.

<p><b> B. Women 
</b></p>
<p>39. Unhealthy foods are commonly marketed in gendered ways, perpetuating traditional 
and unequal gender dynamics to the disadvantage of women. Despite the increase in dual-
income or female-breadwinner households, women still bear a disproportionate share of 
household duties, particularly in preparing meals. This leads to the increased consumption 
of highly-processed convenience foods, as women have less time but are still expected to be 
responsible for food provision.59 Food advertisements often target women about providing 
cooked meals for their children or by offering aspirational products that are &#8220;improved&#8221; 
over traditional diets. 
</p>
<p>40. Other marketing messages targeted at women may emphasize sexuality and 
unattainable &#8220;desirable&#8221; body types to promote unhealthy foods, which not only perpetuate 
gender stereotypes but also have a negative impact on both physical health, such as diet-
related NCDs, and mental health, such as eating disorders.60 
</p>
<p>41. Food policies that emphasize home cooking to improve diets must take into account 
these gender and labour-force dynamics. Healthy eating programmes should not focus 
solely on mothers, but must also promote the role of men in food preparation, as well as 
take into account a diverse range of family arrangements. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Low-income groups 
</b></p>
<p>42. Although NCDs are often perceived as &#8220;diseases of affluence&#8221;, the relationship 
between income and diet-related risk factors is complex.61 Studies have suggested that after 
a country reaches a per-capita gross domestic product of US$ 2,500, obesity becomes more 
prevalent in lower-income than higher-income groups,62 while consumption of unhealthy 
food is strongly associated with both lower income and lower levels of education in several 
developed and middle-income countries.63 The perception that NCDs affect only the 
wealthy has led to the neglect of the diseases in health policies for low-income persons, to 
the detriment of their right to health.64 
</p>
<p>43. Low-income groups frequently have poorer diets than other sections of the 
population,65 as healthy foods like fresh fruit and vegetables may be unaffordable for them, 
discouraging their consumption.66 Many low-income groups, such as shift workers, also

<p>tend to lack the time or facilities for cooking, making ultraprocessed, ready-to-eat foods 
more attractive than healthy foods even if they are not necessarily less expensive.  
</p>
<p>44. Low-income persons may also be more likely to live in &#8220;food deserts&#8221;, where 
healthy fresh food options are lacking, or in &#8220;food swamps&#8221;, where there is significantly 
greater presence of unhealthy foods and unhealthy food marketing. Healthy foods are 
frequently less available, of lower quality and attractiveness, or more expensive in low-
income areas.67 Conversely, lower-income areas can have up to two and a half times as 
many fast food stores as higher-income areas.68 These problems are likely to be 
compounded by geographical barriers for remote rural communities, poorly served urban 
slums or where transport between lower-income and higher-income areas is poor. 
</p>
<p>45. Poor diets tend to have greater consequences for low-income persons than for other 
groups. Undernutrition early in life may lead to a greater probability of obesity later in life 
due to a &#8220;feast or famine&#8221; response that causes the body to hoard fat when it is available.69 
This combination of lack of food security or hunger with the ready availability of calorie-
dense junk foods places many low-income communities at particular risk of NCDs, 
compared to higher-income groups. Psychosocial factors such as stress, higher incidences 
of other NCD risk factors and less access to preventive care can also increase risks of diet-
related diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and hypertension among low-income 
groups.70 
</p>
<p>46. In combating NCDs, States should therefore ensure that they comprehensively 
address socioeconomic disparities. They should ensure that food security or poverty 
reduction plans adequately address the need for healthier food options. They could do so, 
for example, by increasing availability of fruits and vegetables under food security 
schemes, incentivizing food retailers to stock healthy foods in low-income neighbourhoods 
or improving public transport to areas where healthy foods are available. In particular, 
social programmes aimed at ensuring food and nutritional security can be a useful tool for 
improving health, if they are sufficiently funded to allow for the purchase of healthy 
options and are combined with appropriate measures to provide nutrition education and 
make healthy foods available and accessible to those receiving benefits.71 Finally, States 
should work to eliminate inequities in access to primary and preventive care, to lessen the 
disproportionate effects of unhealthy foods on low-income communities.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Participation 
</b></p>
<p>47. The right to health framework requires the participation of the population, especially 
affected populations, in health-related decision-making at all levels &#8211; community, regional 
and national. States should ensure the participation of affected communities and vulnerable 
groups in developing food policy and in decision-making regarding food availability and

<p>marketing in places such as schools, workplaces and community centres. Participation 
empowers people to exercise their right to autonomy and make their own decisions about 
their dietary health. 
</p>
<p>48. Meaningful participation has public health benefits and also empowers people in 
accordance with the right to health approach. States should ensure that spaces are available 
for children and their parents to provide input on school foods, employees to give input on 
food at the workplace, or by enabling community or consumer groups to be involved in 
standard-setting. States should seek broad public consultation to inform policies across 
sectors, including on agricultural production policies, the regulation of unhealthy foods, 
nutritional standards in public institutions and for monitoring transparency in food 
labelling, marketing or promotion. 
</p>
<p>49. States should encourage community health programmes on diet-related NCDs, such 
as peer education, community gardening and cooking initiatives, or healthy eating 
initiatives based at schools, workplaces, primary health-care centres or food vendors. Since 
addressing the risk factors of NCDs involves long-term behavioural change, ownership of 
health policies by local communities can ensure the success and sustainability of nutrition 
and preventive health programmes. The participation of local communities ensures that 
health policies and programmes are better targeted to their health needs. Including 
children&#8217;s involvement and input in school lunch programmes can help identify options that 
are both healthy and appealing to children, and has often shown that the perception that 
children prefer unhealthy options is inaccurate.72 Local participation by residents of low-
income areas may help provide an assessment of foods available in those areas that is more 
reflective of the day-to-day experiences of residents than expert-formulated surveys would 
be able to establish. Likewise, educating and involving consumers and informal sector food 
vendors in healthy food programmes can improve nutrition in a sector that is otherwise 
difficult to regulate, while also allowing such vendors to maintain their livelihoods.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Accountability and remedies 
</b></p>
<p>50. States have an obligation to make legislative, judicial and administrative 
mechanisms available, accessible and effective to enable people to hold States and non-
State actors accountable and claim remedies for violations of their right to health. Omission 
by States to legislate and enforce regulatory frameworks with respect to the food industry 
may in itself be a violation of the right to health. For instance, if the State fails to put into 
place laws requiring the provision and dissemination of information, people may not be in a 
position to make informed choices about their diet, which may prevent them from realizing 
their highest attainable standard of health.  
</p>
<p>51. States should not only ensure that relevant laws and policies are in place, but also 
that they are formulated, implemented and monitored in a transparent manner, in line with 
the right to health. Transparency should be ensured at all times, including when negotiating 
international obligations. Although transparency is required by some investment treaties, it 
is linked to the promotion and protection of international investment.73 The thrust is 
towards ensuring that laws and regulations, which may affect investments, are made

<p>publicly available to the contracting parties. Some international organizations have adopted 
transparency principles that pertain, however, to the predictability of investment rules and 
regulations74 to protect the commercial interest of contracting parties, which benefits the 
private commercial interests of TNCs. Furthermore, these treaties are negotiated in secret 
without any discussion at the domestic level, which is not compatible with the right to 
health framework.75 
</p>
<p>52. Commercial investment treaties cast obligations that are automatically binding on 
States. To abide by these obligations, States may be compelled to modify national policies 
such as agricultural or labelling policies. As a result, the function of States to formulate 
domestic policy gets distorted in favour of the private rights of food and beverage 
industries, rather than the public rights of the affected population.76 The right to health 
framework, on the other hand, requires transparency in activities that directly or indirectly 
affect governance. It acts as a check against arbitrary decisions that may be taken by States 
and pre-empts violations of the right to health. One of the ways in which States could 
ensure transparency is by opening negotiations to include affected people such as farmers 
and consumers. At minimum, States should make the content of negotiations and 
agreements available for public scrutiny and invite comments by stakeholders before 
entering into these agreements. 
</p>
<p>53. Accountability can also be ensured through indicators, benchmarks and targets 
against which the performance of State and non-State actors in achieving goals to reduce 
risk and prevalence of NCDs can be monitored and evaluated.77 As multiple agencies of the 
State may be involved in regulating activities of the food industry and the provision of 
nutritious food,78 information outlining their individual and joint efforts towards attaining 
the set benchmarks should be made public. Making information available to the public and 
independent monitoring bodies will enable them to assess the activities of the food industry 
and their compliance with domestic marketing, labelling and nutrition standards and laws. 
States should also encourage monitoring of other non-State actors such as private schools 
and broadcasting agencies to review their policy <i>vis-&#224;-vis</i> the food industry. Review and 
evaluation of actions taken and standards adopted by States and non-State actors to ensure 
the sale and availability of nutritious foods comprise the accountability framework.  
</p>
<p>54. Due to the increased prevalence of NCDs and their link to practices adopted by the 
food industry, access to remedies is necessary. Judicial remedies to hold TNCs accountable 
for the violations of the right to health are particularly hard to achieve. Investment treaties 
such as bilateral investment treaties and free trade agreements, which facilitate the foray 
and entrenchment of TNCs into domestic economies, contain international dispute 
settlement mechanisms that allow private companies to sue States. However, these treaties

<p>impose unilateral obligations on host States, so that it becomes difficult to bring TNCs into 
their domestic legal system, including the judicial system. Moreover, the principles of 
limited liability and separate legal personalities are often relied upon by parent companies 
to absolve themselves of any liability of their subsidiaries operating in various 
jurisdictions.79 Even where remedies against domestic companies exist, their enforcement is 
often absent or lax, and companies are not penalized for non-compliance. Consumers 
should be able to seek remedies against food companies, irrespective of the country of 
origin of the parent company. States should therefore clarify under domestic law the 
liability of the parent company and its subsidiaries. 
</p>
<p>55. Remedies for violations of the right to health should be available from States as 
well. In cases where States have not enshrined the right to health obligation in the domestic 
legal system, adjudicatory mechanisms should exist for people to claim remedies against 
the State and hold it accountable for failing to respect, protect and fulfil the right to health. 
In cases where States neglect to take steps to fulfil international commitments to reduce the 
burden of NCDs, including diet-related NCDs, people should have access to domestic and 
thereafter international mechanisms to claim remedies against States for not taking steps 
towards this goal. Ensuring access to a range of remedies, in the form of restitution, 
compensation, satisfaction or guarantees of non-repetition, is an effective way to hold State 
and non-State actors accountable for violations of the right to health. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. International assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>56. Under the right to health framework, States should extend their assistance and 
cooperation to full realization of the right to health. While entering into international 
agreements, States should ensure that such agreements do not negatively impact on the 
enjoyment of the right to health.  
</p><p>57. Giving primacy to international trade over the right to health has widespread 
repercussions on public health.80 For instance, under international trade agreements, States 
have sometimes expressed concerns about requirements in other States&#8217; domestic nutrition 
labelling policies, which have been instituted to attain public health goals.81 Such practices 
may restrict the policy space of developing countries in favour of attracting FDI and 
avoiding economic sanctions.82 Bilateral investment treaties may subvert existing 
internationally agreed upon guidelines and lower tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, 
allowing freer import and export of unhealthy food products. For instance, free trade 
agreements have been directly linked to an increased consumption of soft drinks.83  
</p>
<p>58. Investment agreements may also contain provisions that allow States to be sued for 
taking measures to protect public health that may adversely impact investments of the 
contracting party and private corporations. The mere threat of onerous and expensive

<p>litigation may create a chilling effect where States would refrain from formulating such 
policies in the first place.84 In order to reduce the global and domestic burden of NCDs and 
ensure that health concerns override trade relations, States need to collaborate by 
supporting localized and suitable food systems and ensuring that domestic policy space on 
nutritional systems is protected.85 When entering into investment agreements, host States 
should take assertive steps and mention clear and explicit exceptions to investments that 
may harm public health.86 
</p>
<p>59. In addition, States should extend their assistance to low- and middle-income 
countries, which, due to their limited resources, may be unable to attain required nutrition 
standards, leading to an increased burden of NCDs.87 In such cases, States should extend 
their assistance through technology transfer, capacity-building and, where necessary, by 
providing monetary support (A/RES/66/2). This will help ensure that States lacking 
sufficient expertise develop and sustain the requisite technology to take preventive actions 
against NCDs.  
</p>
<p>60. Political commitment towards diet-related NCDs at the international level has so far 
been weak. NCDs have traditionally not been given importance in international policies, 
including the Millennium Development Goals.88 International aid agencies providing 
health-related assistance to low- and middle-income countries have not sufficiently 
prioritized NCDs there.89 Only recently have international and regional organizations 
shifted their focus and called upon Governments, the private sector and non-governmental 
organizations to come together to take steps towards prevention of NCDs across regions.90 
In formulating the post-2015 development agenda, States have commendably shown 
unprecedented political will to address the reduction and prevention of NCDs,91 and 
Governments have been urged to reduce the burden of NCDs by 2025.92 There is increasing 
recognition among Governments of the link between unhealthy diets and NCDs and the 
challenges they pose for development (A/RES/66/2).

<p>61. An effective international framework is needed to hold the global food industry 
legally accountable for its actions.93 There is a need to create an international framework 
that binds States and casts responsibility on them to modify their domestic laws for 
reduction and prevention of diet-related NCDs. The Framework Convention on Tobacco 
Control could be used as a foundation on which an international framework for 
accountability and monitoring of the food and beverage industry can be built. The 
international community also needs to ensure that food corporations driven by commercial 
interests do not undermine the efforts of States to realize the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of health. 
</p>
<p>62. However, mere political consensus may not be sufficient to attain a reduction in 
diet-related NCDs. States, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental 
organizations should come together to combat this epidemic. States need to have a time-
bound plan outlining concrete steps to be taken individually and jointly to progressively 
attain a global and domestic reduction in the burden of diet-related NCDs. To 
operationalize this goal, States should formulate indicators, benchmarks and global and 
domestic accountability mechanisms. States should also allocate sufficient resources to 
reduce and prevent the obesity epidemic as well as the increasing burden of diet-related 
NCDs.  
</p>
<p><b> X. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b>63.<b> In keeping with their obligations to respect, protect and fulfil the right to 
health, States should formulate and implement a national public health strategy and 
plan of action to address diet-related NCDs, which should be widely disseminated. 
Such a strategy should recognize the link between unhealthy foods and NCDs, while 
specifically addressing the structural flaws in food production, marketing and retail 
that promote the availability and accessibility of unhealthy foods over healthier 
options. Towards this end, States should necessarily develop multisectoral approaches 
that include all relevant ministries such as ministries of health, agriculture, finance, 
industry and trade. States should also ensure meaningful and effective participation of 
affected communities such as farmers and vulnerable groups like children, women 
and low-income groups in all levels of decision-making to discourage production and 
consumption of unhealthy foods and promote the availability and accessibility of 
healthier food options.  
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> With a view to respecting, protecting and fulfilling the right to health, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that States take the following steps: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Increase availability and accessibility of healthier food alternatives through 
fiscal and agricultural policies that discourage production of unhealthy foods. Also 
take measures to incentivize farmers to grow healthier products; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Make nutritious and healthy foods available and geographically and 
economically accessible, especially to low-income groups; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Provide information about the ill effects of unhealthy foods and raise awareness 
of the benefits of balanced diets and healthy foods to promote consumption of 
healthier foods;

<p>65.<b> With a view to ensuring their obligation to realize the right to health of 
vulnerable groups such as children, women and low-income groups, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that States take the following steps:

<p><b>(a) Address gender stereotypes in preparation of meals that place an unequal 
burden of cooking on women; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Formulate and implement health education programmes to promote healthy

</b></p>
<p>66.<b> Recognizing the role of the food industry in the growing burden of NCDs, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that the food industry take the following steps:

<p><b>(a) Adopt internationally acceptable nutritional labelling guidelines and comply 
with domestically-enacted guidelines in this respect; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Refrain from marketing, promoting and advertising of unhealthy foods to the

accessible to victims of violations, the Special Rapporteur recommends that States 
take the following steps:

<p><b>(a) Ensure that international investment and trade agreements are entered into 
with full transparency and participation of affected groups by conducting open 
discussions before, during and after negotiation of the agreements;

States and non-State actors for failure to take steps towards their obligations under 
the right to health and to fulfil their international commitments on reduction of diet-
related NCDs. </b></p>


<p>68.<b> With regard to the international obligations of States, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that States take the following steps:
