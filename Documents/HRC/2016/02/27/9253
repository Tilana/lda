<p><b>Summary 
</b> 
</p>
<p>Over the past six years, there have been many extrajudicial executions of leftist activists 
in the Philippines. These killings have eliminated civil society leaders, including human rights 
defenders, trade unionists and land reform advocates, intimidated a vast number of civil society 
actors, and narrowed the country&#8217;s political discourse.  Depending on who is counting and how, 
the total number of such executions ranges from 100 to over 800. Counter-insurgency strategy 
and recent changes in the priorities of the criminal justice system are of special importance to 
understanding why the killings continue. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Many in the Government have concluded that numerous civil society organizations are 
&#8220;fronts&#8221; for the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed group, the New 
People&#8217;s Army (NPA). One response has been counter-insurgency operations that result in the 
extrajudicial execution of leftist activists. In some areas, the leaders of leftist organizations are 
systematically hunted down by interrogating and torturing those who may know their 
whereabouts, and they are often killed following a campaign of individual vilification designed 
to instil fear into the community. The priorities of the criminal justice system have also been 
distorted, and it has increasingly focused on prosecuting civil society leaders rather than their 
killers. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The military is in a state of denial concerning the numerous extrajudicial executions in 
which its soldiers are implicated.  Military officers argue that many or all of the extrajudicial 
executions have actually been committed by the communist insurgents as part of an internal 
purge. The NPA does commit extrajudicial executions, sometimes dressing them up as 
&#8220;revolutionary justice&#8221;, but the evidence that it is currently engaged in a large-scale purge is 
strikingly unconvincing. The military&#8217;s insistence that the &#8220;purge theory&#8221; is correct can only be 
viewed as a cynical attempt to displace responsibility. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Some of the other situations in which extrajudicial executions occur in the Philippines 
were also studied during the visit. Journalists are killed with increasing frequency as a result of 
the prevailing impunity as well as the structure of the media industry. Disputes between peasants 
and landowners, as well as armed groups, lead to killings in the context of agrarian reform 
efforts, and the police often provide inadequate protection to the peasants involved.  A death 
squad operates in Davao City, with men routinely killing street children and others in broad 
daylight. While human rights abuses related to conflicts in western Mindanao and the Sulu 
archipelago have received less attention that those related to the conflict with the communist 
insurgency, serious abuses clearly do occur, and improved monitoring mechanisms are 
necessary. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>This report studies all of these problems and the institutional arrangements that have 
permitted them to continue.  It concludes with a series of recommendations for reform. The 
Government has shown that it is capable of responding to human rights problems with clarity 
and decisiveness. This was on display when, in 2006, the Government abolished the death 
penalty, sparing the more than 1,000 convicts on death row. Any possibility of the death penalty 
being imposed without conformity to international human rights law was ended with the stroke 
of a pen.

<p> 
</p>
<p> The many measures that have been promulgated by the Government to respond to the 
problem of extrajudicial executions are encouraging.  However, they have yet to succeed, and the 
extrajudicial executions continue.

<p><b>I. INTRODUCTION 
 
</b></p>
<p>1. Since 2001 the number of politically motivated killings in the Philippines has been high 
and the death toll has mounted steadily. These killings have eliminated civil society leaders, 
including human rights defenders, trade unionists, and land reform advocates, as well as many 
others on the left of the political spectrum. Of particular concern is the fact that those killed 
appear to have been carefully selected and intentionally targeted. The aim has been to intimidate 
a much larger number of civil society actors, many of whom have, as a result, been placed on 
notice that the same fate awaits them if they continue their activism. One of the consequences is 
that the democratic rights that the people of the Philippines fought so hard to assert are under 
serious threat.  
 
</p>
<p>2. I visited the Philippines from 12 to 21 February 2007 and traveled to Manila, Baguio, and 
Davao and I spoke with a wide range of actors to clarify responsibility for these killings and to 
formulate recommendations to bring them to an end.  I also looked at selected other issues of 
unlawful killing, including the use of a death squad in Davao City.  I was aware when I arrived 
that the international community&#8217;s concern at the wave of killings was seen by some as the 
outcome of a successful propaganda campaign by leftist activists rather than as a proportionate 
response to the problem&#8217;s actual dimensions and causes. I came with an open mind, and I 
succeeded in speaking candidly and often constructively with a very broad range of interlocutors. 
The success of my visit owes much to the full cooperation shown to me by the Government and 
to the active and energetic efforts made by civil society to inform me. 
 
</p>
<p>3. I met with key Government officials, including the President, the Cabinet Secretary, the 
Secretaries of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Defense, and the National Security Adviser. I also spoke 
with the Chief Justice, the Ombudsman, the Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission, 
among many others, and with numerous members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) 
and of the Philippines National Police (PNP) in Baguio and Davao as well as Manila. In addition 
to meetings with many civil society representatives from across the political spectrum, I 
conducted in-depth interviews with witnesses to 57 incidents involving 96 extrajudicial 
executions.<b>1</b> I also received detailed dossiers regarding 271 extrajudicial executions. As a result I 
interviewed many more witnesses than any of the previous investigations (See Appendix B). 
 
</p>
<p><b>II. INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Philippines is party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR), the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Second Additional Protocol thereto.<b>2</b>  
  
</p>
<p>5. All parties to the armed conflicts are bound by customary and conventional international 
humanitarian law and are subject to the demand of the international community that every organ 
of society respect and promote human rights.  In addition, some of the parties have made other 
formal commitments to respect human rights.<b>3</b>  Within this legal framework, both state and non-
state actors can commit extrajudicial executions.

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 
</b> 
</p>
<p>6. Human rights abuses are taking place in a context in which the Government faces not 
only normal law and order challenges but also multiple armed conflicts that have persisted for 
decades. 
 
</p>
<p>7. The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) seeks to revolutionize what it 
characterizes as the Philippines&#8217; &#8220;semifeudal&#8221; society. The CPP controls an armed group, the 
New People&#8217;s Army (NPA), and a civil society group, the National Democratic Front (NDF).<b>4</b>  
Founded in 1968, the CPP grew in strength and popularity during the years of martial law (1972&#8211;
1981), but the return to democracy in 1986 produced internal divisions culminating in a split 
between &#8220;reaffirmist&#8221; and &#8220;rejectionist&#8221; factions in the early 1990s, with the former left in 
control of the CPP/NPA/NDF and the latter fragmenting into smaller armed and unarmed 
groups. Due to its sophisticated political organization, some 7,160 fighters, and an archipelago-
wide presence, Government officials consider the CPP/NPA/NDF the &#8220;most potent threat&#8221; to 
national security.<b>5</b> While the peace process has resulted in several agreements, it is largely 
inactive today. 
 
</p>
<p>8. In western Mindanao and the islands stretching toward Borneo, the Government faces a 
number of insurgent and terrorist groups. Those with a political agenda seek autonomy or 
secession for the historically Muslim areas. In 1996, the Government reached a peace agreement 
with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and, while hostilities have restarted with some 
factions of the MNLF, they remain at a relatively low level, and the parties continue to talk.<b>6</b> The 
ceasefire between the Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) has largely 
held, and the parties are now actively engaged in peace negotiations.<b>7</b> The Government also 
confronts the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), which has been implicated in several major bomb 
attacks on civilian targets.  These groups have many fighters &#8212; 700 (MNLF), 11,770 (MILF), 
and 400 (ASG), respectively &#8212; but their distance from the capital and relatively modest aims 
have limited the extent to which they are considered security threats.<b>8</b> 
 
</p>
<p>9. The Government has also faced a series of attempted coups d&#8217;&#233;tat, many of them carried 
out by the same organized groups of officers. The failure to punish and deter such attempts, and 
the Government&#8217;s resulting reliance on the goodwill of military has eroded civilian control of the 
armed forces.<b>9</b> 
 
</p>
<p>10. The global context of the &#8220;war on terror&#8221; has affected the Government&#8217;s approach to 
these security threats. On the one hand, it has shown its willingness to compromise with the 
MILF in exchange for cooperation against the ASG and foreign terrorists.<b>10</b> On the other hand, 
Government officials have begun referring to the CPP/NPA/NDF as the &#8220;Communist Terrorist 
Movement&#8221; (CTM), legitimizing a turn from negotiation to counterinsurgency. 
 
</p>
<p><b>IV. THE KILLING OF LEFTIST ACTIVISTS 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Introduction 
 
</b></p>
<p>11. Over the past six years, there has been a spate of extrajudicial executions of leftist 
activists, including human rights defenders, trade unionists, land reform advocates, and others.<b>11</b> 
The victims have disproportionately belonged to organizations that are members of Bagong </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Alyansang Makabayn (Bayan), or the &#8220;New Patriotic Alliance&#8221;, or that are otherwise associated 
with the &#8220;national democratic&#8221; ideology also espoused by the CPP/NPA/NDF.<b>12</b> These killings 
have eliminated civil society leaders, intimidated a vast number of civil society actors, and 
narrowed the country&#8217;s political discourse. Responses to the problem have been framed by lists 
produced by civil society organizations.  The most widely cited list is that of Karapatan, which 
contains 885 names.<b>13</b> Task Force Detainees of the Philippines (TFD-P) has compiled a shorter 
list, but the different numbers indicate differences in the geographical coverage of their activist 
networks more often than disagreement about particular cases.<b>14</b> Due to a narrow definition of 
the phenomenon and its uncertainty regarding some cases, Task Force Usig, the PNP group 
charged with ensuring the effective investigation of these incidents, has a list of 116 cases that it 
is attempting to resolve.<b>15</b> 
 
</p>
<p>12. Two policy initiatives are of special importance to understanding why the killings 
continue. First, the military&#8217;s counterinsurgency strategy against the CPP/NPA/NDF increasingly 
focuses on dismantling civil society organizations that are purported to be &#8220;CPP front groups&#8221;. 
Part IV(B) below examines the general approach and its national scope.  Part IV(C) looks at the 
regional variation in how this strategy has been implemented.  Second, as examined in Part X, 
the criminal justice system has failed to arrest, convict, and imprison those responsible for 
extrajudicial executions. This is partly due to a distortion of priorities that has law enforcement 
officials focused on prosecuting civil society leaders rather than their killers. 
 
</p>
<p><b>B. Counterinsurgency Strategy: A Nationwide Focus on  
CPP &#8220;Front Groups&#8221; in Civil Society 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>13. Senior Government officials in and out of the military believe that many civil society 
organizations are fronts for the CPP and that the CPP controls these groups to instrumentalize 
popular grievances in the service of revolutionary struggle, forge anti-Government alliances, and 
recruit new party members.  While greatly overstated, these views are not entirely baseless. It is 
the self-professed policy of the CPP to engage in united front politics for the purpose of 
promoting its views among those who are dissatisfied with the status quo but would be 
disinclined to join the CPP.<b>16</b> Similarly, the CPP has publicly stated that its members engaged in 
such organizing and mobilization are subject to the principle of democratic centralism and, thus, 
ultimately to the direction of the Central Committee of the CPP. There is no reason to doubt that 
the CPP expects those of its members who occupy leadership positions within civil society 
organizations to promote its strategic priorities. This does not, however, warrant the approach of 
many officials who characterized alleged front groups as if they were simply branches of the 
CPP. More objective interlocutors recognized that the term &#8220;front&#8221; encompasses many 
gradations of control, some very tenuous, and that in virtually any front organization most 
members will not belong to the CPP and will likely be unaware of the organization&#8217;s relationship 
to the CPP. Relatively little is known about the extent of the CPP&#8217;s influence within civil society 
organizations, and it would be na&#239;ve to assume that the CPP is as powerful as it would like to 
present itself as being. 
 
</p>
<p>14. The rhetoric of many officials moves too quickly from the premise that there are some 
front organizations to the assertion, usually unsubstantiated, that particular organizations are 
indeed fronts. During the martial law period, the CPP developed a network of underground civil 
society groups, which were united under the umbrella of the NDF.  These groups remain covert, 
but their names are a matter of public record.  It is not, for example, controversial that the NDF </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 9 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>includes, among other groups, the Christians for National Liberation (CNL) and the 
Revolutionary Council of Trade Unions (RCTU).<b>17</b> What is controversial is the thesis of many 
officials that the organizations associated with Bayan are overt counterparts to covert NDF 
organizations.<b>18</b> When officials claim that &#8220;Christians for National Liberation (CNL) . . . controls 
the Promotion of Church People&#8217;s Response (PCPR), whose members man the KARAPATAN 
Human Rights Alliance&#8221; or that &#8220;[t]he RCTU controls the leadership of the aboveground militant 
labor center, Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU), through a core group composed of party members,&#8221; 
little if any evidence is given.<b>19</b>  Assertions that the CPP &#8220;fielded&#8221; such party-list groups as 
Bayan Muna, Anakpawis, and Gaberiela are similarly vague and speculative.<b>20</b> These assertions 
are based on circumstantial evidence &#8212; the personal histories of some leaders, apparent 
sympathies manifested during the CPP&#8217;s split in the early 1990s, the perceived political function 
of a group&#8217;s positions, etc. &#8212; read in light of the CPP&#8217;s avowed organizational techniques. 
 
</p>
<p>15. Membership in the CPP is legal, and has been since 1992 when Congress repealed the 
Anti-Subversion Act.<b>21</b>And nearly all my interlocutors acknowledged the principle that citizens 
should be permitted to support communist and national democratic ideas.  Similarly, the party 
list system &#8212; whereby some members of the House of Representatives are elected nationwide 
rather than from a particular district &#8212; was established by Congress in 1995 for the purpose of 
encouraging leftist groups to enter the democratic political system.<b>22</b>  Characterizing such elected 
Congressional representatives and much of civil society as &#8220;enemies&#8221; is thus completely 
inappropriate. Unsurprisingly, it has encouraged abuses. 
 
</p>
<p>16. Newspapers routinely carry reports of senior military officials urging that alleged CPP 
front groups and parties be neutralized. Often, prominent political parties and established civil 
society groups are named specifically. The public is told that supporting their work or candidates 
is tantamount to supporting &#8220;the enemy&#8221;. This practice was openly and adamantly defended by 
nearly every member of the military with whom I spoke. When I suggested to senior military 
officials that denunciation of civil society groups should only be done according to law and by 
the Government, the response was  that civilian authorities are in no position to make such 
statements because they might be assassinated as a result. On another occasion, I asked a senior 
civilian official whether the Government might issue a directive prohibiting such statements by 
military officers.  He expressed vague sympathy for the idea, but his subordinate &#8212; a retired 
military commander &#8212; promptly interjected that such a directive would be &#8220;impossible&#8221; because 
&#8220;this is a political war&#8221;. When political &#8220;warfare&#8221; is conducted by soldiers rather than civilians, 
democracy has been superseded by the military. 
 
</p>
<p>17. The public vilification of &#8220;enemies&#8221; is accompanied by operational measures. The most 
dramatic illustration is the &#8220;order of battle&#8221; approach adopted systematically by the AFP and, in 
practice, often by the PNP. In military terms an order of battle is an organizational tool used by 
military intelligence to list and analyze enemy military units. The AFP adopts an order of battle 
in relation to the various regions and sub-regions in which it operates. A copy of a leaked 
document of this type, from 2006, was provided to me, and I am aware of no reason to doubt its 
authenticity. The document, co-signed by senior military and police officials, calls upon &#8220;all 
members of the intelligence community in the [relevant] region &#8230; to adopt and be guided by this 
update to enhance a more comprehensive and concerted effort against the CPP/NPA/NDF&#8221;. 
Some 110 pages in length, the document lists hundreds of prominent civil society groups and 
individuals who have been classified, on the basis of intelligence, as members of organizations 
which the military deems &#8220;illegitimate&#8221;. While some officials formalistically deny that being on </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>the order of battle constitutes being classified as an enemy of the state, the widespread 
understanding even among the political elite is that it constitutes precisely that.<b>23</b> 
 
</p>
<p><b>C. Case Studies</b> 
 
</p>
<p>18. Counterinsurgency operations throughout the country reveal a focus as much on the 
leaders of front groups as on NPA fighters. But there is regional variation in how that strategic 
focus is implemented.<b>24</b> This report focuses on two regions about which I was able to gather 
extensive evidence. These case studies demonstrate the concrete ways in which a 
counterinsurgency focus on civil society leads to extrajudicial executions and tempts 
commanders to make such abuses routine and systematic. 
 
</p>
<p><b>1. Counterinsurgency Strategy in the Cagayan Valley Region  
(with a focus on Cagayan province)</b>25<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>19. In the Cagayan Valley Region, the AFP&#8217;s approach to counterinsurgency starts by 
sending a detachment to a barangay or sometimes to a somewhat larger area.<b>26</b> What happens 
next varies across municipalities and barangays. In some, the soldiers hold a barangay-wide 
meeting revealing the treachery of the CPP/NPA/NDF, alleging that various mass organizations 
are fronts of the CPP/NPA/NDF, and vilifying them. At these meetings, the soldiers collect the 
names and occupations of the residents and attempt to glean an understanding of the power 
structure of the community and the political alignments of its members. In others, the soldiers 
conduct a house-to-house census. 
 
</p>
<p>20. The information gathered through the meeting or census is used either to identify NPA 
fighters and members of leftist civil society organizations or as a starting point for conducting 
individual interviews to elicit that information. These interviews generally take place at persons&#8217; 
homes. (In contrast to the interrogations in Nueva Ecija, below, these do not systematically 
involve torture.) Attempts are generally made to get the persons identified to &#8220;surrender&#8221;.  Some 
of these are suspected of being NPA fighters; others belong to civil society organizations or so-
called sectoral fronts (of the CPP).  The vilification and intimidation of persons who do not 
&#8220;surrender&#8221; too often escalates into extrajudicial executions; however, these do not appear 
fundamental to the strategy. 
 
</p>
<p>21. The other use that is made of the information gathered is to recruit or assign residents to a 
Citizens Armed Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU) that, it is hoped, will &#8220;hold&#8221; the barangay 
once it has been &#8220;cleared&#8221;.<b>27</b>  A CAFGU is a paramilitary organization that works closely with 
the AFP and is subordinate to its command-and-control structure.<b>28</b> CAFGU members 
accompany AFP units on operations and also serve, in effect, as armed informants, permitting 
the military to pull-back and focus on other barangays. 
 
</p>
<p><b>2. Counterinsurgency Strategy in the Central Luzon Region 
(with a focus on Nueva Ecija province)</b>29<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>

<p>22. In parts of Central Luzon, the leaders of leftist organizations are systematically hunted 
down.  Those who may know their whereabouts may be interrogated and tortured. A campaign 
of vilification designed to instill fear into the community follows, and the individual is often </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 11 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>killed as a result.  Such attacks and the attendant fear can lead to the disintegration of organized 
civil society.  One person I met called the result &#8220;the peace of the dead&#8221;.<b> 
 
</b></p>
<p>23. This practice reflects more than the mere &#8220;excesses&#8221; of a particular commander.  Rather, 
it is a deliberate strategy in keeping with the overall trajectory of counterinsurgency thinking at 
the national level.  While the prosecution of responsible individuals is essential, such efforts in 
relation to one or a handful of people will make little overall difference.  It is, instead, essential 
to identify and decisively reject at an institutional level those innovations in counterinsurgency 
strategy that have resulted in such a high level of political killings.  Moreover, it is essential to 
prevent the replication of this strategy in other regions. 
 
</p>
<p>24. There is considerable local variation in counterinsurgency strategy within Central Luzon, 
and this account draws especially on testimony concerning the province of Nueva Ecija: 
 
</p>
<p>(a) The military establishes a detachment of roughly 10 soldiers in a barangay hall or 
other public building. 
 
</p>
<p>(b) These soldiers move about, showing that they are part of the community, playing 
sports, hearing grievances, and undertaking small development projects. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(c) After a short period, they take a door-to-door census.  One explanation of the 
census is that it is used to determine medical and other basic needs to guide development 
projects.  The better explanation appears to be that the census is for identifying members of civil 
society organizations and current and former NPA fighters.  The private setting encourages some 
to provide information on others in the community. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(d) The census results allow the detachment to draft a provisional order of battle of 
civil society leaders and former or suspected NPA fighters.  Soldiers make the fact that this has 
been drafted known to the community. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(e) The soldiers call those on the order of battle to the site of their detachment to be 
interrogated for information on civil society leaders, NPA fighters, etc.  If they do not cooperate, 
they are tortured.<b>30</b>  Any names provided are added to the order of battle, and the process 
repeated.  Over a relatively brief time the military develops a fairly detailed understanding of the 
local structure of leftist civil society. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(f) A &#8220;Know Your Enemies&#8221; seminar is held and &#8220;communist terrorist movement&#8221; 
front organizations are listed.<b>31</b>  (Sometimes such meetings also precede the census.)  Members 
of what soldiers call the &#8220;speakers bureau&#8221; tell those assembled about CPP lies, its true aims, and 
its use of fronts.  The purpose of this meeting would appear to be to encourage &#8220;surrender&#8221; and 
to lay the groundwork for making killings of civil society members appear justified and 
legitimate. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(g) Individuals identified as leaders of civil society organizations or NPA fighters are 
encouraged to &#8220;surrender&#8221;.  In some areas of Central Luzon, such as Tarlac, as well as in the 
Bohol and Southern Tagalog regions, posters or leaflets vilifying them personally as communist 
terrorists will be distributed if they resist surrendering.  Then their houses are placed under </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>surveillance.<b>32</b>  If the person flees, his or her house may be burned to the ground.  This serves as 
a signal that refusing to &#8220;surrender&#8221; is a grave and irreversible choice. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(h) Then such individuals begin to get killed.  The connection between organization 
membership and death is made unambiguous for community members.  While I do not fully 
understand the community-level dynamics, it would appear that one or two such killings will 
greatly encourage &#8220;surrenders&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(i) Finally, a Barangay Defense System (BDS) is established.  Every household in 
the community is made to contribute members.<b>33</b>  A BDS is a post that serves as a checkpoint of 
sorts.  At least in Nueva Ecija, each sitio of a barangay has had its own BDS.  When strangers or 
anyone who does not live in the sitio comes in, their name and reason to visit is recorded in a 
log.  The contents of this log are regularly communicated to the barangay captain and the 
military.  I received conflicting reports on whether the BDS are armed.  My tentative conclusion 
would be that the AFP has no general practice of providing the BDS arms, but some BDS arm 
themselves, and sometimes AFP soldiers may help them to do so. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(j) Once the BDS is established, the military detachment moves on to another 
barangay.  The BDS is expected to &#8220;hold&#8221; the barangay &#8220;cleared&#8221; by the military.  (It is not that 
the BDS is expected to literally, physically defend the barangay but that it will provide 
sufficiently solid intelligence as to make the military&#8217;s constant presence unnecessary.) 
 
</p>
<p>25. While denying the use of executions or torture, a former military commander confirmed 
most aspects of this account.  He also provided a rationale for this strategy and an alternative 
explanation of the executions that have followed the deployment of AFP detachments.  On his 
account, when the CPP/NPA/NDF moves into a barangay, it organizes sectoral front 
organizations (i.e., civil society organizations), and the chair and vice-chair of each sectoral front 
together comprise the local CPP central committee.  In addition to administering the CPP&#8217;s work 
in the barangay, that committee and, in particular its chair, serves as an intelligence service for 
the NPA, providing it with information on persons who cause problems for the residents (e.g., 
usurers) and on AFP informants.  This intelligence is used by the NPA &#8212; or, less often, by a 
barangay militia organized by the NPA &#8212; to intimidate or execute the identified individuals.  
This account of the CPP/NPA/NDF&#8217;s approach to establishing its control at the barangay level 
was largely confirmed by NDF representatives.<b>34</b> 
 
</p>
<p>26. One important aspect of this counterinsurgency strategy should be noted.  Specific 
barangays are targeted because they have active civil society organizations, not because such 
organizations are thought to be proxies for NPA presence.  On all accounts, an NPA group will 
move around quite a few barangays and may or may not even be present when the AFP comes.  
The evidence I received suggests that the entrance of the AFP into a barangay is generally 
sufficient to keep the NPA away.<b>35</b>  The civil society organizations are the targets, because the 
AFP considers them the political infrastructure of the revolution and the NPA&#8217;s intelligence 
network.  Attacking them is designed to blind the NPA and undermine the CPP&#8217;s political 
progress. 
 
</p>
<p>27. The former commander&#8217;s explanation of the killings that have accompanied the AFP&#8217;s 
presence in a barangay was that residents whose relatives were killed by the NPA take advantage 
of the new situation to retaliate against members of the local CPP committee who are suspected </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 13 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>of having fingered their relatives.  This private retaliation explanation is facially plausible; 
however, it does not align with accounts provided by any witness.  It would appear that, at least 
in the areas from which I interviewed numerous individuals, retaliation against other residents is 
carried out simply by informing on them to the AFP. 
 
</p>
<p><b>D. The &#8220;Purge Theory&#8221; of a Military in Denial</b> 
 
</p>
<p>28. The military is in a state of denial concerning the numerous extrajudicial executions in 
which its soldiers are implicated.<b>36</b>  Some military officers would concede that a few killings 
might have been perpetrated by rogue elements within the ranks, but they consistently and 
unequivocally reject the overwhelming evidence regarding the true extent of the problem.  
Instead, they relentlessly pushed on me the theory that large numbers of leftist activists are 
turning up dead because they were victims of internal purges within the CPP and NPA.<b>  </b>I 
repeatedly sought evidence from the Government to support this contention. But the evidence 
presented was strikingly unconvincing. 
 
</p>
<p>(a) The military noted that the CPP/NPA/NDF publicly claims responsibility for 
killing some current and former members.  This is true, as anyone can validate by reading the 
CPP/NPA/NDF&#8217;s publications online, but irrelevant to the broader theory. 
 
</p>
<p>(b) The military noted that the CPP/NPA/NDF has conducted large scale internal 
purges of members suspected of being government informants. This is a matter of public record 
&#8212; but these events took place roughly 20 years ago. 
 
</p>
<p>(c) The list of 1,335 individuals allegedly killed by the NPA was casually adduced as 
evidence not only that the NPA kills people but as evidence of a purge.  However, only 44 of the 
persons alleged by Karapatan to have been extrajudicially executed were even included in this 
list, and I was unable to obtain any information from the Government that would indicate that 
any particular one of these individuals was killed as part of a purge.<b>37</b>  
 
</p>
<p>(d) I was provided with a document captured from the rebels in May 2006 describing 
an &#8220;Operation Bushfire&#8221; in which the rebels would purge CPP/NPA/NDF members who were 
acting as deep penetration agents for the military and make it look as if the military was 
responsible.<b>38</b> In the absence of strong supporting evidence, which I requested, this document 
bears all the hallmarks of a fabrication and cannot be taken as evidence of anything other than 
disinformation.<b>39</b> 
 
</p>
<p>29. These pieces of evidence do not begin to support the contention that the CPP/NPA/NDF 
is engaged in a large-scale purge.  Indeed, I met no one involved in leftist politics &#8212; whether 
aligned with the CPP, opposed to the CPP, or following an independent course &#8212; who believed 
that such a purge was currently taking place.  The military&#8217;s insistence that the &#8220;correct, accurate, 
and truthful&#8221; reason for the recent rise in killings lies in CPP/NPA/NDF purges can only be 
viewed as a cynical attempt to displace responsibility.<b>40</b>

</p>
<p><b>V. KILLINGS BY THE NEW PEOPLE&#8217;S ARMY 
 
</b></p>
<p>30.<b> </b>The Government provided a list of 1,335 individuals, two-thirds of them civilians, 
allegedly killed by the NPA.<b>41</b>  Despite numerous requests for any documentation substantiating 
any of these cases, virtually none was provided.  While I have no reason to doubt that the list 
represents a good faith accounting, without further documentation it is impossible to confirm its 
reliability or to evaluate which killings violated the humanitarian law of armed conflict. 
 
</p>
<p>31. Discussions with NDF representatives and review of published CPP/NPA/NDF 
documents did, however, reveal several practices that are inconsistent with international human 
rights and humanitarian law.  First, the CPP/NPA/NDF considers &#8220;intelligence personnel&#8221; of the 
AFP, PNP, and paramilitary groups to be legitimate targets for military attack.  Some such 
persons no doubt are combatants or civilians directly participating in hostilities; however, the 
CPP/NPA/NDF defines the category so broadly as to encompass even casual Government 
informers, such as peasants who answer when asked by AFP soldiers to identify local CPP 
members or someone who calls the police when faced with NPA extortion.<b>42</b>  Killing such 
individuals violates international law. 
 
</p>
<p>32.<b> </b>Second, the CPP/NPA/NDF&#8217;s system of &#8220;people&#8217;s courts&#8221; is either deeply flawed or 
simply a sham.  The question whether the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human 
Rights and International Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL) can be interpreted to affirm the 
CPP/NPA/NDF&#8217;s contention that it has a right to constitute courts and conduct trials is a matter 
of controversy.<b>43</b>  However, insofar as the CPP/NPA/NDF does conduct trials, international 
humanitarian law (IHL) unambiguously requires it to ensure respect for due process rights.  One 
telling due process violation is that, while a people&#8217;s court purportedly requires &#8220;specification of 
charges . . . prior to trial&#8221;, the CPP/NPA/NDF lacks anything that could reasonably be 
characterized as a penal code.<b>44</b>  It is apparent that the CPP/NPA/NDF does impose punishments 
for both ordinary and counterrevolutionary crimes in areas of the country that it controls. But 
NDF representatives were unable to provide me with any concrete details on the operation of the 
people&#8217;s court system. This suggests that little or no judicial process is involved.  In some cases, 
the use of people&#8217;s courts would appear to amount to little more than an end run around the 
principle of non-combatant immunity. In other words, it seeks to add a veneer of legality to what 
would better be termed vigilantism or murder.  Failure to respect due process norms constitutes a 
violation of IHL for the NPA/CPP/NDF and may constitute a war crime for participating 
cadres.<b>45</b> 
 
</p>
<p>33.<b> </b>Third, public statements by CPP/NPA/NDF representatives that opponents owe &#8220;blood 
debts&#8221;, have &#8220;accountabilities to the people&#8221;, or are subject to prosecution before a people&#8217;s 
court, are tantamount to death threats.<b>46</b>  Issuing such threats under the guise of revolutionary 
justice is utterly inappropriate and must be decisively repudiated. 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>VI. KILLINGS RELATED TO THE CONFLICTS IN WESTERN MINDANAO 
 
</b></p>
<p>34.<b> </b>Human rights abuses related to the conflicts in western Mindanao and the Sulu 
archipelago have received less attention than those related to the conflict with the 
CPP/NPA/NDF. I did, however, receive various such allegations, and these warrant more 
attention.<b>47</b> 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 15 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>35.<b> </b>I received numerous well-substantiated allegations of extrajudicial executions on Jolo 
island.  Three factors distinguished these from executions in other areas.  First, the violence was 
relatively indiscriminate. The conflict between the Government and the NPA involves precisely 
targeted violence.  Civilians are killed, but seldom by accident.  In contrast, on Jolo, persons are 
abducted or arrested, and sometimes extrajudicially executed, for little or no apparent reason.  In 
addition, military operations involve inherently indiscriminate tactics, such as aerial 
bombardment, artillery shelling, and helicopter strafing.  Second, witnesses live in even more 
fear than in other parts of the country, and I received information regarding cases that had never 
been reported to the PNP.  Third, responsibility for abuses is often difficult to assign.  It is not 
uncommon for the Government to blame the ASG or MNLF and for victims to blame the AFP.  
In the absence of effective investigations, the truth is often difficult to determine.  Regardless of 
which group is to blame for particular abuses, it is clear that abuses increase dramatically during 
major AFP operations against the ASG or MNLF.  The CHRP has done excellent reporting work 
in the Sulu archipelago, and it should improve its capacity to deploy personnel for monitoring 
and protection as soon as military operations commence. 
 
</p>
<p>36.<b> </b>I received fewer allegations of extrajudicial executions in Maguindanao and other areas 
of western Mindanao.  It is possible that there are fewer such abuses.  The Government and 
MILF are engaged in an active peace process and have even cooperated in operations against 
terrorists.  However, the allegations that I did receive, together with the enormous population 
displacements that have been caused by ongoing fighting, tentatively suggest that the relative 
absence of reported human rights abuses in this area may not reflect the true situation.  
Consideration should be given to establishing within the framework of the Government&#8211;MILF 
peace process a mechanism for monitoring and publicly reporting on the human rights 
situation.<b>48</b> 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>VII. KILLINGS RELATED TO AGRARIAN REFORM DISPUTES 
 
</b></p>
<p>37. Peasants claiming land rights through the Government&#8217;s agrarian reform program find 
themselves implicated in conflicts among the Government, the CPP/NPA/NDF, and large 
landowners.<b>49</b>  The Government established the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program 
(CARP) in 1988 to redistribute land to peasants.<b>50</b>  The CPP/NPA/NDF views CARP as a 
&#8220;divide and rule scheme&#8221; to prevent the &#8220;genuine land reform of the revolutionary movement&#8221;.<b>51</b>  
Landowners generally oppose all redistribution programs, although the possibility of exploiting 
tensions between Government and CPP/NPA/NDF efforts has sometimes led to alliances of 
convenience.  The options facing peasants are perhaps the most fraught, for even if they support 
the CPP&#8217;s long-term program, they may wish to avail themselves immediately of CARP&#8217;s 
benefits.  This choice has, however, been discouraged by the CPP/NPA/NDF as well as by 
landowners.  For their part, local Government officials are often more interested in protecting the 
holdings of local elites than the lives and land rights of peasants, and PNP protection for peasants 
attempting to take possession of land that has been awarded to them has often been strikingly 
inadequate in practice. 
 
</p>
<p><b>VIII. KILLINGS OF JOURNALISTS 
 
</b></p>
<p>38. Journalists are killed with increasing frequency.  From 1986 to 2002, the number killed 
averaged between 2 and 3 per year, depending on how one counts.<b>52</b>  During 2003-2006, the 
number killed averaged between 7 and 10.  However, while the trends coincide and the two </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>phenomena are often joined in the public mind, the killings of journalists appear to have different 
causes than the killings of leftist activists.  The views of journalists and organizations for the 
protection of journalists with whom I spoke were that most of these killings had local roots.<b>53</b>  
Some killings had been perpetrated to prevent journalists from exposing information related to 
the crimes and corruption of powerful individuals.  Other killings resulted from local disputes in 
which the journalists had participated by publicly promoting one side or the other.  This problem 
is exacerbated by the structure of the media industry.  Many broadcasters are &#8220;block-timers&#8221; who 
purchase airtime and then pay for this airtime and seek a profit by selling advertising.  
Sometimes they also earn money through so-called &#8220;AC/DC&#8221; journalism &#8212; &#8220;attack, collect; 
defend, collect&#8221;.  Approximately three quarters of journalists killed are broadcasters, and nearly 
half of these are block-timers.<b>54</b>  Needless to say, however questionable the practices of some 
journalists may be, these do not justify murder.  There is a lamentable degree of impunity for 
murders of journalists. 
 
</p>
<p><b>IX. DAVAO: VIGILANTISM OR DEATH SQUAD? 
 
</b></p>
<p>39. It is a commonplace that a death squad known as the &#8220;Davao Death Squad&#8221; (DDS) 
operates in Davao City.  However, it has become a polite euphemism to refer vaguely to 
&#8220;vigilante groups&#8221; when accounting for the shocking predictability with which criminals, gang 
members, and street children are extrajudicially executed.  One fact points very strongly to the 
officially-sanctioned character of these killings: No one involved covers his face.  The men who 
warn mothers that their children will be the next to die unless they make themselves scarce turn 
up on doorsteps undisguised.  The men who gun down or, and this is becoming more common, 
knife children in the streets almost never cover their faces.  In fact, for these killers to wear 
&#8220;bonnets&#8221; is so nearly unheard of that the witnesses I interviewed did not think to mention the 
fact until I asked.<b>55</b>  None of those with whom I spoke had witnessed such persons covering their 
faces, and one knowledgeable advocate informed me that they do so in no more than two cases 
out of one hundred. 
 
</p>
<p>40. The mayor is an authoritarian populist who has held office, aside from a brief stint as a 
congressman, since 1988.  His program is simple: to reach a local peace with the CPP/NPA/NDF 
and to &#8220;strike hard&#8221; at criminals.  When we spoke, he insisted that he controls the army and the 
police, saying, &#8220;The buck stops here.&#8221;  But, he added, more than once, &#8220;I accept no criminal 
liability.&#8221;  While repeatedly acknowledging that it was his &#8220;full responsibility&#8221; that hundreds of 
murders committed on his watch remained unsolved, he would perfunctorily deny the existence 
of a death squad and return to the theme that there are no drug laboratories in Davao.  The mayor 
freely acknowledged that he had publicly stated that he would make Davao &#8220;dangerous&#8221; and &#8220;not 
a very safe place&#8221; for criminals, but he insisted that these statements were for public 
consumption and would have no effect on police conduct: &#8220;Police know the law.  Police get their 
training.&#8221;  The mayor&#8217;s positioning is frankly untenable: He dominates the city so thoroughly as 
to stamp out whole genres of crime, yet he remains powerless in the face of hundreds of murders 
committed by men without masks in view of witnesses. 
 
</p>
<p>41. It is a reality that when the major was first elected, the NPA routinely killed policemen.  
It is also a reality that Davao has a problem with youth gangs.  These are primarily <i>ad hoc </i>social 
groups for street children aged 10-25, but use of drugs and involvement in petty crime is 
common, and violent gang wars do take place.  By all accounts, the mayor has managed to 
largely insulate his city from the armed conflict and to limit the presence of some kinds of </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 17 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>criminal activity.  These accomplishments appear to have bought acquiescence in the measures 
he takes, and the public remains relatively ignorant of the human cost of death squad &#8220;justice&#8221;.  
 
</p>
<p>42. The human cost is very high.  Since 1998, when civil society organizations began 
keeping careful records, over 500 people have been killed by the death squad.<b>56</b>  Up until 2006, 
these victims were generally shot; since then, stabbings have become more common.  I spoke 
with witnesses and family members of 8 victims and 1 survivor, and I reviewed the case files of 
an additional 6 victims and 3 survivors.  These interviews gave some insights into how these 
killings take place and the enormous emotional damage they inflict on family and friends.<b>57</b>  The 
executions generally respond to suspicions of petty crimes, are preceded by warnings or 
notifications that clarify their significance, and are carried out publicly and with methodical 
indifference. 
 
</p>
<p>43. How does the death squad operate?  The inquiries I made do not provide a complete 
picture, but they do indicate two starting points for investigation and reform.  First, it would 
appear that the &#8220;assets&#8221; who identify targeted individuals for the death squad are often suspected 
criminals who are recruited after being arrested, with an early release as inducement.<b>58</b>  Second, 
it would appear that barangay officials are sometimes involved in selecting targets for the death 
squad, a practice perhaps originating in the role barangay officials have played in naming 
suspected drug dealers for inclusion in PNP watch lists.<b>59</b>  Insofar as prison officials and 
barangay councils help the death squad function, they can be reformed.<b>60</b>  The intelligence-
gathering role played by barangay officials can be limited, and the processing of inmates can be 
more tightly restricted.  To shut the death squad down will, however, ultimately require 
following the evidence upward to the handlers who task &#8220;assets&#8221; to provide the location of 
persons on watch lists and who direct hit men to kill them.  If it were not for the fact that the 
local office of the CHRP denies the existence of a death squad, it should be capable of 
conducting an effective investigation.  There are many witnesses who would provide information 
anonymously or who would testify were they to receive a credible protection arrangement.<b>61</b>  
 
</p>
<p>44. Defending the rights of street children may be unpopular, but no one deserves to be 
stabbed to death for petty crimes.  There are already preliminary indications that these practices 
are being replicated in other parts of Mindanao and in Cebu, and this trend needs to be halted 
immediately. 
 
</p>
<p><b>X. THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A. Overview 
 
</b></p>
<p>45. There is impunity for extrajudicial executions.  No one has been convicted in the cases 
involving leftist activists,<b>62</b> and only six cases involving journalists have resulted in 
convictions.<b>63</b>  The criminal justice system&#8217;s failure to obtain convictions and deter future 
killings should be understood in light of the system&#8217;s overall structure.  Crimes are investigated 
by two bodies: the PNP, which is organized on a national level but is generally subject to the 
&#8220;operational supervision and control&#8221; of local mayors; and the National Bureau of Investigation 
(NBI), which is centrally controlled.<b>64</b>  Prosecutors, who are organized in the National 
Prosecution Service (NPS) of the DOJ, determine whether there is probable cause and then 
prosecute the cases in the courts.<b>65</b>  This is the normal process; however, in cases implicating 
public officials, the Ombudsman should take over the investigation and conduct the prosecution.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Cases are tried before the courts, with the Supreme Court both administering the judiciary and 
providing the highest level of appellate review.<b>66</b>  Cases against senior Government officials 
should be prosecuted by the Ombudsman before the Sandiganbayan<b>67</b> rather than the ordinary 
courts, but the Supreme Court still provides the highest level of appellate review.  The Inter-
Agency Legal Action Group (IALAG) is the latest addition to the system, affecting the 
operations of the NBI, NPS, and PNP. 
 
</p>
<p><b>B. The Inter-Agency Legal Action Group (IALAG) distorts 
the criminal justice system&#8217;s priorities 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>46. Senior Government officials are attempting to use prosecutions to dismantle the 
numerous civil society organizations and party list groups that they believe to be fronts for the 
CPP.  While this project is sometimes discussed as if it were a dark conspiracy, it was explained 
to me openly and directly by numerous officials as the very function of IALAG, which was 
established in 2006.<b>68</b>  IALAG is an executive rather than advisory body and, while it includes 
representatives of various criminal justice, intelligence, and military organs, institutional power 
and legal authority over its operations is concentrated in the Office of the National Security 
Adviser.<b>69</b>  At the national level, IALAG meets at least once every other week, discusses the 
evidence in particular cases and debates whether it is sufficient to file a criminal complaint.  
There are also regional and provincial IALAG bodies with a similar structure and role.  It has 
been due to the efforts of IALAG that charges have been brought against a number of leftist 
lawmakers and persons who had been given immunity guarantees to facilitate peace negotiations 
with the NDF. 
 
</p>
<p>47. The reason that such an <i>ad hoc</i> mechanism was established for bringing charges against 
members of these civil society organizations and party list groups is that they have seldom 
committed any obvious criminal offence.  Congress has never reversed its decision to legalize 
membership in the CPP or to facilitate the entry of leftist groups into the democratic political 
system.<b>70</b>  But the executive branch, through IALAG, has worked resolutely to circumvent the 
spirit of these legislative decisions and use prosecutions to impede the work of these groups and 
put in question their right to operate freely. 
 
</p>
<p>48. What justification is given for waging this legal offensive?  One explanation that I 
received was that when membership in the CPP was legalized, the expectation was that its 
members would lay down their arms and participate in the parliamentary struggle.  On this 
interpretation, the CPP has instead sought to pursue simultaneously the armed and parliamentary 
struggles.  Many senior government officials stated unequivocally that they consider the party 
list groups in Congress as part of the insurgency.  It is evidently the case that there are persons in 
Congress as well as in the hills who adhere to a &#8220;national democratic&#8221; ideology, but when I 
would ask interlocutors in what respect party list members of Congress belonging to the most 
criticized parties &#8212; Bayan Muna, Anakpawis, and Gabriela &#8212; had gone beyond expressing 
sympathy for the armed struggle to actually supporting it, I was repeatedly provided the same 
unsubstantiated allegation, that these congresspersons provide their &#8220;pork barrel&#8221; to the NPA.<b>71</b>  
Cases filed against several congresspersons on these grounds have failed.  This has not 
discouraged senior government officials.  One insisted that although the publicly available 
evidence might be inadequate, the charges were amply supported by intelligence information that 
could not be disclosed.  Another informed me simply that warrants had been issued based on </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 19 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>probable cause and that he would not stop treating the congresspersons as criminals simply 
because no conviction had yet been achieved. 
 
</p>
<p>49. The central purpose of IALAG is to prosecute and punish members of the CPP and its 
purported front groups whenever there is any legal basis for doing so.  I received no evidence 
that it was designed or generally functions to plan extrajudicial executions.  However, IALAG&#8217;s 
proactive legal strategy requires drawing up lists of individuals who are considered enemies of 
the state but many of whom will not be reachable by legal process.  The temptation to execute 
such individuals is clear, representatives of the AFP and PNP with the capacity to do so 
participate in IALAG bodies at all levels, and there is circumstantial evidence that this has 
sometimes occurred.<b>72</b>  The most deleterious role played by IALAG bodies may, however, be to 
encourage prosecutors to act as team players with the AFP and PNP in counterinsurgency 
operations and to de-prioritize cases involving the deaths of leftist activists. 
 
</p>
<p><b>C. The police are reluctant to investigate the military 
 
</b></p>
<p>50. No one I spoke with questioned the PNP&#8217;s authority and duty to investigate crimes 
allegedly committed by the AFP.  However, in practice, it does so in only a perfunctory manner.  
Plausible explanations for this reticence include fear, a tacit understanding that crimes by the 
AFP should not be investigated, the personal bonds felt among senior AFP and PNP officers,<b>73</b> 
and the solidarity fostered by current cooperation in counterinsurgency operations.<b>74</b> 
  
</p>
<p><b>D. Poor cooperation between police and prosecutors impedes  
the effective gathering of evidence 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>51. The current system so discourages cooperation between prosecutors and police that each 
is tempted to simply blame the other for failing to achieve convictions.  Prosecutors rather than 
judges make the determination whether the evidence provides probable cause for the charges to 
be brought.  During this preliminary hearing, prosecutors are expected to show absolute 
impartiality.  Prosecutors thus perceive themselves unable to guide the police with respect to the 
testimony and physical evidence that must be obtained to make a case.  Even when prosecutors 
find the evidence presented by the police at the preliminary hearing insufficient, they seldom 
provide a reasoned explanation for that insufficiency for fear of appearing biased.  Police thus 
lack expert guidance in building cases.  While this problem is deeply embedded in the culture of 
the criminal justice system, changes in the role of the prosecutor could be effected by amending 
the Rules of Criminal Procedure, which are promulgated by the Supreme Court.<b>75</b>  The Supreme 
Court should use this power to require prosecutors to provide reasoned decisions for probable 
cause determinations and to insist that prosecutors take a more proactive role in the ensuring the 
proper investigation of criminal cases. 
 
</p>
<p><b>E. The witness protection program is inadequate 
</b> 
</p>
<p>52. The absence of witnesses is a key explanation for why extrajudicial executions hardly 
ever lead to convictions.  One expert suggested to me that the absence of witnesses results in 8 
out of 10 cases involving extrajudicial killings failing to move from the initial investigation to 
the actual prosecution stage.  In a relatively poor society, in which there is heavy dependence on 
community and very limited geographical mobility, witnesses are uniquely vulnerable when the 
forces accused of killings are all too often those, or are linked to those, who are charged with </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>ensuring their security.  The present message is that if you want to preserve your life expectancy, 
don&#8217;t act as a witness in a criminal prosecution for killing.  
  
</p>
<p>53. The witness protection program is administered by the NPS.  This is problematic only 
because the impartial role prosecutors are expected to play in the early phases of a criminal case 
can make them loath to propose witness protection.  This problem might be remedied by 
establishing a separate witness protection office independent of the prosecutors but still within 
the Department of Justice (DOJ).<b>76</b>  That office would then be free to take a proactive role in 
providing witness protection. 
 
</p>
<p>54. Implementation of the statute establishing the witness protection program is deeply 
flawed.<b>77</b>  It would seem to be truly effective in only a very limited number of cases.  The rights 
and benefits mandated by law are too narrowly interpreted in practice to make participation 
possible for some witnesses.<b>78</b>  Another widely-cited shortcoming, likely caused by inadequate 
resources, is that at-risk family members are not admitted into the program, although in theory 
&#8220;any member of his family within the second civil degree of consanguinity or affinity&#8221; who is at 
risk may be admitted.<b>79</b>  A more fundamental problem is that, even when a witness is available, 
cases seldom move quickly through the justice system,<b>80</b> and when a case fails to prosper, the 
witness is expelled from the program, although he or she may still be at risk. 
  
</p>
<p><b>F. Limited forensic resources lead to over-reliance on witness testimony 
 
</b></p>
<p>55. A greater capacity to use physical evidence would allow more cases to go forward 
without witness testimony.  The information that I received from officials was that, while there 
are some forensic laboratories and experts in Manila, there is very limited access to these 
resources throughout most of the country. 
 
</p>
<p><b>G. The Ombudsman lacks independence 
</b> 
</p>
<p>56. The Office of the Ombudsman is responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes 
and other misconduct committed by public officials.<b>81</b>  However, the Ombudsman&#8217;s office has 
done almost nothing in recent years to investigate the involvement of Government officials in 
extrajudicial executions.  Despite having received a significant number of complaints alleging 
extrajudicial executions attributed to State agents, no information was provided by the 
Ombudsman&#8217;s office indicating that it had undertaken any productive investigations. 
 
</p>
<p>57. The Office of the Ombudsman has surrendered its constitutionally-mandated 
independence from the executive branch.  First, it has adopted an untenably narrow interpretation 
of its jurisdiction, choosing not to initiate an investigation into an extrajudicial execution unless 
there is already very strong evidence that a public official was responsible in the particular case.  
Second, the Office of the Ombudsman often operates as a <i>de facto</i> subsidiary of the Department 
of Justice.  The NBI conducts most of its investigations.  Pursuant to a Memorandum of 
Agreement between the DOJ and the Office of the Ombudsman, the relevant Regional State 
Prosecutor and other senior members of DOJ&#8217;s NPS monitor and oversee the &#8220;successful 
prosecution and speedy disposition of Ombudsman cases&#8221;.  &#8220;Deputized prosecutors&#8221; from the 
NPS &#8220;have the primary responsibility of prosecuting Ombudsman cases&#8221;, and prosecutor-
investigators from the Office of the Ombudsman &#8220;assist, if practicable, the Deputized Prosecutor 
in the prosecution of the case&#8221; and &#8220;may, with prior clearance from the Ombudsman or his </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 21 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Deputy, take over the prosecution of the case at any stage&#8221;.<b>82</b>  As a practical matter, these 
arrangements serve to all but completely subordinate the Ombudsman to the DOJ. 
 
</p>
<p>58. The Ombudsman insists that her office can take over a case being handled by the DOJ at 
any time, but it is unclear how the Ombudsman would even be aware that such a measure was 
necessary given her Office&#8217;s lack of involvement.  One NPS prosecutor at the local level 
explained that, in his locality, the local representative of the Ombudsman sits in the DOJ office, 
reviews the work of DOJ prosecutors and passes this on to the Ombudsman in Manila.  It is, in 
his words, a &#8220;chummy&#8221; relationship, because the person from the Office of the Ombudsman is 
disinclined to criticize the conduct of what are, in effect, his colleagues. 
 
</p>
<p><b>H. The role of the courts 
</b> 
</p>
<p>59. When most cases stall at the investigation or prosecution stage, it is difficult to evaluate 
the effectiveness of the judiciary.  Two issues specific to the judiciary were, however, raised by 
my interlocutors.  First, trials are routinely delayed and are generally not held on consecutive 
days, increasing the opportunities for witness intimidation.  If fully implemented, the Supreme 
Court&#8217;s decision to establish &#8220;special courts&#8221; for &#8220;cases involving killings of political activists 
and members of the media&#8221; should remedy this problem for those cases.<b>83</b>  Second, witnesses 
often relocate to avoid retaliation, but judges seldom grant a change of venue on that basis.<b>84</b>  
The judiciary should ensure that docket management and venue decisions facilitate witness 
participation and protection. 
   </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>XI. CONGRESS AND THE EXECUTIVE 
 
</b></p>
<p>60. The executive branch has stymied the legislature&#8217;s efforts to oversee the execution of 
laws. Military officers are seldom permitted to appear before Congress other than at budget 
hearings. A high-ranking government official recounted with genuine puzzlement the efforts of 
the Committee on Human Rights of the House of Representatives to obtain the testimony of 
senior military officers. This was considered self-evidently preposterous and was &#8220;successfully 
avoided&#8221;. Official policy, now in the form of a &#8220;memorandum circular&#8221; provides that any official 
requested to &#8220;appear before either House of Congress&#8221; shall &#8220;forward the request . . . to the 
President through the Executive Secretary&#8221; who &#8220;shall consider whether the subject matter of the 
inquiry is in aid of legislation and/or falls within the scope of executive privilege&#8221;.<b>85</b>  Some in 
Congress have acquiesced in this arrangement.  The then Chair of the Senate Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights said that he could not recall having held any hearing relevant to the 
ongoing extrajudicial killings but maintained that this was not a problem, because killing was 
already a punishable offence, so there was no need for further legislation. 
 
</p>
<p>61. The legislature has also failed to exercise its constitutional authority to block the 
promotion of military officers implicated in human rights abuse.  Appointment as an officer 
&#8220;from the rank of colonel or naval captain&#8221; is by the President with the consent of the 
Commission on Appointments, a body comprising members of the House and Senate.<b>86</b>  (The 
AFP controls promotion to lower-ranking posts.)  It is also the express policy of the executive 
branch that soldiers must receive a human rights &#8220;clearance&#8221; from the CHRP prior to any 
promotion.<b>87</b>  Congressmen, military officers, and CHRP staff repeatedly affirmed to me that this 
is the policy, and that the AFP, the CHRP, and the Commission on Appointments all participate.   
However, I can only conclude that it is an empty formality.  I asked repeatedly, but no one could 
recall any particular instances in which a promotion had been blocked.  To provide more 
accountability, the CHRP should follow-up on clearance decisions by publicly tracking the 
subsequent promotion decisions of the AFP and the Commission on Appointments. 
 
</p>
<p><b>XII. COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b> 
</p>
<p>62. The Philippines Commission on Human Rights (CHRP) stands out as an oversight 
mechanism that has safeguarded its independence and mandate.  However, more resources must 
be devoted to ensure the effectiveness of its investigations. 
 
</p>
<p>63. The CHRP was established by the Constitution as an independent body charged with 
investigating human rights violations, providing preventive measures and legal assistance to 
victims, recommending reforms, and monitoring the Government&#8217;s compliance with its human 
rights treaty obligations.<b>88</b> 
 
</p>
<p>64. In my discussions with CHRP commissioners, CHRP staff, and civil society advocates, 
they all expressed that the CHRP&#8217;s highest priority must be to increase its investigative capacity.  
This requires hiring and training more investigators, devoting greater resources to investigations, 
and increasing investigators&#8217; capacity to make use of physical evidence.<b>89</b>  With this in mind, I 
was pleased to learn that in March the Government provided the CHRP significant additional 
funding.<b>90</b> 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 23 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>65. Many advocates and, indeed, many CHRP staff call for the CHRP to be given 
prosecutorial powers.  This is a very tempting proposition: Today, CHRP investigators can 
submit cases to a prosecutor or ombudsman, but these cases seldom prosper.  However, the 
proposal&#8217;s risks outweigh its benefits.  First, there are already other organs responsible for 
prosecuting cases, including one (the Ombudsman) that is independent of the executive.  To give 
the CHRP prosecutorial powers would not only be redundant but would compromise a 
responsibility held solely by the CHRP: to monitor all of these other organs for human rights 
compliance.  Second, while a grant of prosecutorial powers might give the CHRP more teeth, it 
would also increase the security risks faced by its investigators and witnesses.  Today, the CHRP 
has the potential to publicly and authoritatively reveal the reality of widespread abuse despite the 
near absence of criminal convictions. 
 
</p>
<p><b>XIII. RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>66. I am encouraged by the many measures recently taken by the Government,</b>91<b> and I 
have found instructive the many recommendations made in other reports.</b>92<b>  Based on my 
own observations, I believe that the following measures are essential. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>67. Extrajudicial executions must be eliminated from counterinsurgency operations:  
  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) As Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, the President must take 
concrete steps to put an end to those aspects of counterinsurgency operations which have 
led to the targeting and execution of many individuals working with civil society 
organizations. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The necessary measures should be taken to ensure that the principle of 
command responsibility, as it is understood in international law, is a basis for criminal 
liability within the domestic legal order. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The Government should immediately direct all military officers to cease 
making public statements linking political or other civil society groups to those engaged in 
armed insurgencies. Any such characterizations belong solely within the power of the 
civilian authorities. They must be based on transparent criteria, and conform with the 
human rights provisions of the Constitution and relevant treaties. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Transparency must be introduced to the &#8220;orders of battle&#8221;, &#8220;watch lists&#8221;, 
and similar list of individuals and organizations maintained by the AFP, PNP, and other 
elements of the national security system.  While their contents might justifiably be 
considered secret, which lists exist, their purposes, the criteria for inclusion, and the 
number of names on each should be made public. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>68. The use of a death squad in Davao City must end: 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) NAPOLCOM should withdraw the mayor of Davao City&#8217;s powers of 
supervision and control of PNP units within his jurisdiction and should hold the officers 
commanding those units accountable for shutting down the death squad. 
  </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>(b) While particular crimes should be reported, laws and practices in which 
barangay councils or captains submit names (e.g., of drug pushers) for inclusion on law 
enforcement watch lists should be abolished. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) An independent investigation should be conducted to identify the persons 
directing the death squad&#8217;s &#8220;assets&#8221; and hit men. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>69. Convictions in a significant number of extrajudicial executions must be achieved.  
Appropriate institutional arrangements exist but they must be more transparent if they are 
to be effective. Thus: 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) CHRP should issue a monthly report listing allegations of extrajudicial 
executions that it has received together with the current status of its investigations. 
  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Members of the public should be able to submit cases to be overseen by Task 
Force Usig.  If it concludes that a case does not fall within its mandate, it should provide a 
reasoned explanation in writing. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Task Force Usig should issue a monthly report on the status of all cases it is 
attempting to resolve. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The Supreme Court should issue a monthly report on the status of all cases 
before the special courts. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>70. IALAG should be abolished, and the criminal justice system should refocus on 
investigating and prosecuting those committing extrajudicial executions and other serious 
crimes. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>71. The witness protection program should be reformed and fully implemented: 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) It should be proactively administered by an office independent of the NPS. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Witness protection should be unstintingly provided to all those who will be 
put at risk by an individual&#8217;s testimony. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Individuals should be permitted to remain in the witness protection system 
for as long as they are at risk, even if a case stalls. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Housing and other benefits provided under the witness protection program 
should ensure the security and comfort of those protected. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>72. The Supreme Court should take all available measures to ensure the effective 
prosecution of extrajudicial executions.  Among other measures: 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The system of special courts for killings of political activists and members of 
the media should be fully implemented so as to improve the efficiency of trials, and the 
judiciary should take all other measures necessary to facilitate the participation of </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 25 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>witnesses, including sympathetic consideration of requested venue changes and docket 
management decisions that facilitate witness participation and protection. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) In conjunction with the executive branch of Government, the Supreme Court 
should use its constitutional powers over the practice of law to impress upon prosecutors 
that they have a duty to the public to uphold and protect human rights by acting to ensure 
the effective investigation of cases and protection of witnesses and that they should provide 
reasoned decisions for probable cause determinations. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>73. Human rights should be safeguarded within the peace processes: 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) The JMC should meet and fulfill its mandate under the CARHRIHL. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Consideration should be given to establishing a mechanism for monitoring 
human rights abuses within the framework of the Government &#8211; MILF peace process.  
 
</b></p>
<p><b>74. The Commission on Human Rights (CHRP) should guard its independence and 
increase its effectiveness: 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) CHRP should hire and train more investigators and provide them with the 
resources necessary for effective investigations. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) CHRP should increase the resources available for victim assistance to ensure 
that witnesses are sufficiently secure as to enable the non-judicial clarification of their 
cases. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) To provide more accountability in the AFP promotions process, CHRP 
should follow-up on its human rights clearance decisions by publicly tracking the 
subsequent promotion decisions of the AFP and the Commission on Appointments. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) CHRP should consider measures to more effectively protect as well as 
monitor human rights during military operations throughout the country. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>75. The Ombudsman&#8217;s office should begin to fulfill effectively its independent 
constitutional role in responding to extrajudicial killings plausibly attributed to public 
officials. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>76. The Government should reinstate a policy of facilitating the constitutionally-
mandated role of Congressional oversight in relation to the AFP and the PNP, starting by 
rescinding all directives, memoranda, and orders that impede such oversight. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>77. The CPP/NPA/NDF should stop using people&#8217;s courts that do not comply with 
human rights and humanitarian law standards and should ensure that lethal force is 
directed only against combatants and civilians directly participating in hostilities. 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>78. The CPP/NPA/NDF should repudiate statements that persons owe &#8220;blood debts&#8221;, 
have &#8220;accountabilities to the people&#8221;, or are subject to prosecution before people&#8217;s courts.

</p>
<p><b>Notes 
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b> I should note that some of my interlocutors suggested that these witnesses were feeding me 
</p>
<p>propaganda.  The issue of extrajudicial executions in the Philippines is undeniably politicized, 
and those who have witnessed the killing or steps leading up to the killing of leftist activists are 
not infrequently themselves sympathetic toward the left.  I took this concern about bias seriously.  
However, the existence of a propaganda dimension in accusations that the military is 
extrajudicially executing leftist activists does not, in itself, destroy the credibility of the 
information and allegations.  I proposed, instead, the need to apply several tests of credibility. 
</p>
<p>First, is it only NGOs from one part of the political spectrum which are making these 
allegations? The answer is clearly &#8220;no&#8221;. Human rights groups in the Philippines range across the 
entire spectrum in terms of their political sympathies, but I met no groups who challenged the 
basic fact that large numbers of extrajudicial executions are taking place, even if they disagreed 
on precise figures. 
</p>
<p>Second, how compelling is the actual information presented? I found there was considerable 
variation ranging from submissions which were entirely credible and contextually aware all the 
way down to some which struck me as superficial and dubious. But the great majority is closer 
to the top of that spectrum than to the bottom. 
</p>
<p>Third, has the information proved credible under &#8220;cross-examination&#8221;?  My colleagues and I 
heard a large number of cases in depth and we probed the stories presented to us in order to 
ascertain their accuracy and the broader context.  We spoke with some witnesses for over an 
hour, and we reviewed sometimes copious documentation, often including affidavits, firearms 
identification reports, autopsy reports, and police reports.  I developed doubts about a handful of 
cases but found the vast majority to be highly credible. 
Fourth, did the fact that a few of the persons who had been listed by one civil society 
organizations as victims of extrajudicial executions were actually alive indicate that the 
allegations were fabricated?  Obviously, such mistakes do not enhance an organization&#8217;s 
credibility.  However, when the PNP introduced me to two such individuals, I was informed that 
they had been detained &#8212; one for one week and one for three months &#8212; and I received 
conflicting information on how promptly their families had been notified.  (At the time of my 
visit, Task Force Usig had identified two individuals included in Karapatan&#8217;s list who were still 
alive: Renato Bugtong and Edwin Mascari&#241;as.  My understanding is that that number has since 
risen to five.  (Letter from the Philippine Mission to the United Nations, dated 23 May 2007.))  
Under these circumstances, the misreporting of what appear to have been (happily, temporary) 
disappearances as extrajudicial executions does very little to discredit the vast number of 
remaining allegations.

(ICRC), stating that, &#8220;We are the political authority representing the Filipino people and 
organized political forces that are waging an armed revolutionary struggle for national liberation 
and democracy, in the exercise of the right to self-determination within the purview of Article 1, 
paragraph 4, of Protocol I against the persistent factors and elements of colonial domination and 
against national oppression. . . .&#8221;  In its declaration, the NDFP &#8220;solemnly declare in good faith to 
undertake to apply the Geneva Conventions and Protocol I to the armed conflict&#8221; and also 
affirmed that it was &#8220;bound by international customary law pertaining to humanitarian principles, 
norms and rules in armed conflict&#8221;.  The declaration was signed by representatives of the NDF, 
CPP, and NPA.  Previously, in 1991, the NDF had &#8220;formally declare[d] its adherence to 
international humanitarian law, especially Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions as well 
as Protocol II additional to said conventions&#8221; (&#8220;Declaration of Adherence to International 
Humanitarian Law&#8221; (15 August 1991)). 
</p>
<p>The Government and the NDF signed the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human 
Rights and International Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL) on 16 March 1998.  The agreement 
affirms prohibitions on &#8220;summary executions&#8221;, &#8220;involuntary disappearances&#8221;, &#8220;massacres&#8221;, 
&#8220;indiscriminate bombardments&#8221;, and the targeting of &#8220;civilians or those taking no active part in 
the hostilities[,] persons who have surrendered[, and] those placed <i>hors de combat</i> by sickness, 
wounds, or any other cause&#8221; (Part III, Art. 2(4); Part IV, Arts. 2, 3(1), 4(2)).  CARHRIHL also 
provided for the establishment of a Joint Monitoring Committee (JMC) that would be composed 
of three members chosen by the Government&#8217;s negotiating panel and three by the NDF&#8217;s 
negotiating panel.  (Part V).  The JMC was to &#8220;receive complaints of violations of human rights 
and international humanitarian law and all pertinent information and shall initiate requests or 
recommendations for the implementation&#8221; of CARHRIHL (Part V, Article 3).  The members 
have been chosen, so that there are now Government and NDF &#8220;sections&#8221; of the JMC, but the 
JMC itself has never met. 
</p>
<p>The Government and the MILF entered into the &#8220;Agreement on peace between the government

</b> In most contexts, this report will follow the common practice of referring to the 
</p>
<p>CPP/NPA/NDF.  However, at least as a formal matter, the CPP, the NDF, and the NPA are 
distinct organizations with the CPP playing a leadership role. 
</p>
<p>According to its constitution, the NDF &#8220;upholds the program of uniting the democratic classes 
and special sectors of society for the revolutionary struggle against US imperialism, feudalism 
and bureaucrat capitalism&#8221; (art. IV) and considers that the &#8220;Philippine revolution is a national-
democratic revolution . . . under the class leadership of the proletariat through the Communist 
Party of the Philippines (MLMZT)&#8221; (art. II).  (&#8220;Constitution of the Democratic Front of the 
Philippines&#8221; adopted by the NDF National Conference of Representatives, July 1994 (Annex A-

Committee (no date)) [<i>Declaration of Undertaking</i>].) 
In accordance with the &#8220;Basic Rules of the New People&#8217;s Army&#8221; (Annex C of <i>Declaration of 
Undertaking</i>), &#8220;The New People&#8217;s Army shall always adhere to the leadership of the Communist 
Part of the Philippines and thus, it must abide with all decisions orders and directives of the 
National Congress, Central Committee, Political Bureau and the Military Commission of the 
Party.&#8221; (Principle I, Point 1).  The Military Commission is an organ of the Central Committee, 
and is the CPP&#8217;s primary point of contact with the NPA.  (Principle I, Point 2).  However, &#8220;All 
non-regular fighting units like the guerrilla, militia, self-defense and armed city partisans are 
directly under the local Party committee.  Nevertheless, they shall receive direct orders from the 
Military Commission or from the military command to link them with the regular mobile 
forces.&#8221;  (Principle I, Point 9).  The &#8220;Basic Rules of the New People&#8217;s Army&#8221; were issued by the 
Meeting of the Red Commanders and Fighters (29 March 1969) and approved by the Central 
Committee of the CPP (13 May 1969).  (Note also that article V, section 4 of the &#8220;Constitution 
of the Democratic Front of the Philippines&#8221; adopted by the NDF National Conference of 
Representatives, July 1994 provides that, &#8220;The multilateral relations within the NDF respect 
existing bilateral relations of the allied organizations.  The New People&#8217;s Army is under the 
absolute leadership of the Communist Party of the Philippines.&#8221; (Annex A-2 of <i>Declaration of

<p>CPP/NPA/NDF was described as the &#8220;most potent threat&#8221; in a briefing given by the Executive 
Secretary and other senior officials.  According to Government records, since 2000, military and 
law enforcement personnel have been killed by the NPA in every region except the Autonomous 
Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).  However, despite the archipelago-wide reach of the 
NPA insurgency, major fighting has been far more concentrated, and just 6 of the country&#8217;s 17 
regions account for over 80% of the casualties: Bicol, CALABARZON, Caraga, Central Luzon, 
Davao, and Eastern Visayas.  (&#8220;Reference Materials on Unexplained Killings (January 2007)&#8221;.)

<p> In a joint communiqu&#233; signed 6 May 2002, the Government and the MILF &#8220;agreed to the 
isolation and interdiction of all criminal syndicates and kidnap-for-ransom groups, including so-
called &#8216;lost commands&#8217; operating in Mindanao&#8221; and arranged various practical measures to this 
end, including the formation of &#8220;an Ad Hoc Joint Action Group against criminal elements in 
order to pursue and apprehend such criminal elements&#8221;. 
<b>11
</b></p>
<p> The category of &#8220;leftist activists&#8221; is employed due to its explanatory power.  Human rights 
defenders and trade unionists, along with many other civil society leaders, appear to be killed 
due more to their association with leftist groups than to their particular activities.  With respect to 
trade unionists, for instance, I spoke with representatives of both the Federation of Free Workers 
(FFW) and the Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU).  Both groups claim several hundred thousand 
members, but while KMU has lost numerous members to extrajudicial executions, FFW has not 
lost any.  The key distinction appears to be that KMU is commonly cited by Government 
officials as a CPP front group and FFW is not.  To clarify, disputes surrounding organizing 
campaigns and collective bargaining negotiations appear often to be the motivating factor behind 
decisions to attack workers and organizers, but the likelihood that such an attack will take the 
extreme form of an extrajudicial execution appears to be far higher if the worker is associated 
with what is purported to be a CPP front group.  In contrast, the killing of journalists is discussed 
separately, because it appears to constitute a distinct phenomenon.

</b></p>
<p> The list of extrajudicial victims maintained by Karapatan (as of 30 June 2007) provides the 
political or organizational affiliation of the 390 victims for which they are known.  If these are 
correlated with documents originating in the AFP that list CPP/NPA/NDF front groups, we find 
that 94% of the victims with known affiliations belonged to alleged front groups.

<p> In May 2006, the Secretary of the Interior and Local Government ordered the PNP to establish 
Task Force Usig to investigate and help to resolve the killings of journalists and leftist activists.

</p>
<p>The figure of 116 cases was accurate as of 2 April 2007 and refers to &#8220;slain party list members / 
militants&#8221;; Task Force Usig maintains a separate list of &#8220;slain mediamen&#8221;.  (Letter from the 
Philippine Mission to the United Nations, dated 23 May 2007.)   
</p>
<p>Note that the 116 cases that Task Force Usig considers within its remit is not the full number of 
incidents which human rights groups have alleged to constitute extrajudicial executions.  For 
example, of the 783 such cases enumerated by Karapatan (as of 14 November 2006), Task Force 
Usig determined that 461 either fell outside of its remit or clearly did not involve a crime, and 
considers 207 cases still in need of verification.  It is worth clarifying that Karapatan has alleged 
that Government agents &#8212; soldiers, police officers, and others &#8212; were the perpetrators in many 
but far from all of the cases that it has recorded.  However, this does not explain the extent of the 
exclusions.  I had a lengthy and productive discussion with the members of Task Force Usig 
regarding the grounds on which cases were excluded.  After my visit, Task Force Usig also 
forwarded me a large quantity of documentation to substantiate the argument that a number of 
individuals listed by civil society organizations died in legitimate encounters between the NPA 
and the AFP or PNP.  I ultimately concluded that a comprehensive, case-by-case analysis of the 
excluded cases could not usefully be undertaken by someone in my position.  I continue to 
believe, however, that there is a need for greater transparency with respect to this aspect of Task 
Force Usig&#8217;s work if its efforts are to be fully accepted by all concerned, and I make a 
recommendation to this end in Part XIII.

<p> The CPP is relatively open regarding its doctrine.  A number of these issues are, for example, 
addressed in &#8220;Further strengthen the Communist Party of the Philippines to lead the people&#8217;s 
democratic revolution&#8221;, Message of the Central Committee, CPP, <i>Ang Bayan</i> (26 December 
2006). 
</p>
<p><i>On the united front: </i>&#8220;Aside from waging armed struggle against the enemy, our Party uses the 
policy and tactics of the united front. In the main, the united front is for the armed struggle. . . . 
Both the revolutionary armed struggle and the united front have their respective ways of 
arousing, organizing and mobilizing the broad masses of the people. The revolutionary armed 
struggle has made possible solid mass organizing and building organs of political power in the 
countryside. The united front has aroused, organized and mobilized the people in the entire 
country in order to facilitate their eventual organization by the Party. Legal united front work has 
directly helped in the organizational work of legal democratic mass organizations.&#8221;  (pp10&#8211;11) 
</p>
<p><i>On democratic centralism:</i> &#8220;In our organizational life, we follow the principle of democratic 
centralism. The essence of centralism is Marxism-Leninism-Maoism. It guides democracy within 
our Party and is in turn based on it. The democratic process allows our leading organs to gather 
facts and ideas from the corresponding organization and to deliberate on them freely in order to 
arrive at policies and decisions. Individuals and the minority are subject to the will of the 
majority. The lower organ or organization is subject to the higher organ or organization. The 
Central Committee is the highest organ, while the Congress is not in session. . . . Our Party 
organization is of national scale and is deeply rooted among the masses of workers and peasants. 
The Party branches are in communities, factories, plantations, transport lines, schools and 
offices. Our Party groups or cells are at various levels of various types of organizations and

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>institutions, progressive or reactionary. We have Party elements and cells even within the 
military and police forces of the enemy.&#8221; (p11) 
</p>
<p><i>On recruitment:</i> &#8220;We recruit our Party members from the armed revolutionary movement and the 
legal democratic mass movement. These have trained and tested so many activists worthy of 
recruitment into the Party. The intense and widespread armed and legal forms of struggle are 
providing a continuous flow of fresh highly motivated and militant Party recruits who come from 
the toiling masses of workers and peasants and the middle social strata and who bring with them 
rich experience, their closeness to the masses and various types of abilities that are useful for 
advancing the people's democratic revolution.&#8221; (p11)

citizens belonging to the marginalized and underrepresented sectors, organizations and 
parties, and who lack well-defined political constituencies but who could contribute to 
the formulation and enactment of appropriate legislation that will benefit the nation as a 
whole, to become members of the House of Representatives. Towards this end, the State 
shall develop and guarantee a full, free and open party system in order to attain the 
broadest possible representation of party, sectoral or group interests in the House of 
Representatives by enhancing their chances to compete for and win seats in the 
legislature, and shall provide the simplest scheme possible.&#8221;

<p> This regional variation in counterinsurgency strategy likely explains some of the regional 
variation in how common extrajudicial executions are.  Note, for instance, that on a per capita 
basis, extrajudicial executions are nearly twice as common in Central Luzon as in the Cagayan 
Valley Region.  Such disparities would be even more apparent in a province-level analysis.

<p> A barangay is the smallest governmental unit.  (There are over 40,000 barangays in the

<p> According to the briefings I received from the Government, the guiding counterinsurgency 
strategy for the AFP against the NPA is to &#8220;clear&#8221;, &#8220;hold&#8221;, and &#8220;support&#8221; areas affected by the

<p> CAFGUs are also referred to as CAFGU Active Auxiliary (CAA) companies.  The Philippines 
has experimented with a number of forms of militia and paramilitary organization, including, in 
addition to CAA, Special CAFGU Active Auxiliaries (SCAA), Civilian Volunteer Organizations 
(CVO), Civilian Home Defense Forces (CHDF), and Barrio Self-Defense Units (BSDU).  
Officials describe these as &#8220;force multipliers&#8221; for the AFP.  The Barangay Defense Systems 
(BDS) that have recently been deployed in Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, and perhaps some other areas, 
appear to be unique, however, in their involvement of most or all of the population.

Norte, and Paitan Sur).  In addition, the civil society organization reported that BDS were 
starting to be setup in Carranglan Town (as of February 2007). 
</p>
<p>A rough statistical analysis provides further evidence of the relationship between extrajudicial 
executions and the kind of counterinsurgency operation that culminates in a BDS.  Of the 30 
extrajudicial executions that Karapatan recorded as having taken place in Nueva Ecija (as of 
November 2006), 10 took place in one of the 98 barangays that has a BDS (not counting any 
established in Carranglan).  In the 751 barangays that do not have a BDS, 20 extrajudicial 
executions have taken place (including 1 in Carranglan).  In other words, an execution was 4 
times more likely to have occurred in a barangay in which a BDS was ultimately established than 
in other barangays.  (However, of those 20 executions that took place in barangays without a 
BDS, 9 occurred in the municipality of Pantabangan, suggesting either that other problematic 
counterinsurgency methods are being used or that the process leading up to the establishment of 
a BDS has not been completed.)

<p> NDF representatives with whom I spoke said that the CPP/NPA/NDF had established a 
political infrastructure in approximately 10,000 barangays, 800 municipalities, and more than 70 
provinces.  When the CPP/NPA/NDF members enter a barangay, they attempt to establish &#8220;mass 
organizations&#8221; of peasants, women, workers, etc.  These mass organizations belong to the NDF.  
(Thus, for example, a barangay&#8217;s peasant organization would form what might loosely be 
characterized as a local chapter of the National Association of Peasants (PKM), an NDF member 
organization.) 
</p>
<p>They said that in each barangay the CPP/NPA/NDF also attempts to establish a &#8220;barrio 
organizing committee&#8221; which will be replaced with a &#8220;barrio revolutionary committee&#8221; once 
there are no longer Government informers in the barangay and the CPP/NPA/NDF has 
consolidated its control.  In keeping with this difference in the security situation, organizing 
committees are secretly elected by representatives of the mass organizations; whereas, 
revolutionary committees are openly elected by the barangay&#8217;s whole population.  A committee 
will typically have 15 members, approximately one-third of whom will belong to the CPP or

<p>NPA, one-third to the &#8220;basic&#8221; mass organizations (of peasants, workers, etc.), and one-third to 
other organizations (of teachers, professionals, etc.).  NDF representatives described these 
political structures that are established at the barangay level as &#8220;embryos of the People&#8217;s 
Democratic Government&#8221;.  They said that in these barangays Government organs, such as the 
Barangay Council, are rendered non-functional, although if some Government officials are 
willing to participate in the &#8220;new government&#8221;, they can be accommodated.  (The intended 
structure of the CPP/NPA/NDF&#8217;s barangay-level political organs can be found in &#8220;Guide for 
Establishing the People&#8217;s Democratic Government&#8221;, Chapter II.) 
</p>
<p>NDF representatives also provided some information on the role such political organs play in 
providing the NPA intelligence and in countering Government intelligence gathering efforts.  
They said that the mass organizations can generally identify Government informers and other 
&#8220;unreliable&#8221; individuals and that they report these to the barangay&#8217;s organizing or revolutionary 
committee.  The committee, in turn, provides information about suspected Government 
informers as well as AFP troop movements to the NPA.  (See Part V for information on how 
suspected informers are dealt with.)

is purported to be a CPP Central Committee Directive dated 7 April 2006, and translated 
excerpts were also provided to me during two PowerPoint presentations.  The first of these, 
given by the Executive Secretary on 12 February 2007, included: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Together with the launching of tactical offensives will be the launching of special 
operations that will target government agents who manage to infiltrate our ranks.  Special 
operations will be given emphasis in order to clean the bushfire and other legal

now in the midst of intensifying its counter-insurgency operations.  By executing our

we could portray the killings of members of our front and legal organizations as acts of

for the reason that the killings were perpetrated by the CPP/NPA to purge its ranks, no 
other plausible explanation has been given for the rise in extrajudicial killings.  To be 
sure, the AFP need not search for any &#8216;plausible explanation&#8217; because the purges 
conducted by the CPP/NPA are the correct, accurate and truthful reasons that explain the 
rise in extrajudicial killings.&#8221;

</b></p>
<p> NDF representatives called my attention to a formal declaration it had made (<i>Declaration of 
Undertaking</i>): 
</p>
<p>The NDFP regards as legitimate targets of military attacks the units, personnel and 
facilities belonging to the following: 
</p>
<p>a. The Armed Forces of the Philippines 
</p>
<p>b. The Philippine National Police 
</p>
<p>c. The paramilitary forces; and 
</p>
<p>d. The intelligence personnel of the foregoing. 
</p>
<p>Civil servants of the GRP are not subject to military attack, unless in specific cases they 
belong to any of the four abovestated categories. 
</p>
<p>The interpretation given the concept of &#8220;intelligence personnel&#8221; is quite broad, including 
ordinary civilians who provide information to Government forces.  NDF representatives stated 
that if there is certainty that someone is a Government informant, then he or she is considered a 
legitimate military target.  If there is doubt as to whether someone is a Government informant, a 
process of escalating responses is followed: He or she will be approached and given a warning, 
then he or she will be asked to leave the area, and finally a judicial process will be commenced 
before a people&#8217;s court, perhaps ultimately resulting in arrest and punishment.  Generally, 
however, they said that such people simply leave the area. 
</p>
<p>When I inquired regarding the alleged killings of persons for being Government officials and for 
refusing to pay revolutionary taxes, the importance of how &#8220;intelligence personnel&#8221; is interpreted 
was further demonstrated.  NDF representatives asserted that insofar as Government officials 
may have been killed, this would have been due to the role that particular Government officials 
had played in providing Government forces with intelligence information.  Similarly, NDF 
representatives stated that they were unaware of any case in which tax evasion as such had 
resulted in the NPA killing someone.  They explained that tax collection generally involves a 
negotiation to settle on a mutually agreeable amount.  If that negotiation breaks down and the 
 </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 40 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>firm or individual refuses to pay taxes, then the NPA might take such actions as the confiscation 
or destruction of assets.  They stated that when some has been killed in connection with tax 
collection efforts, this has been because he or she tipped off the AFP or PNP with a view to 
getting CPP or NPA members arrested to avoid making payment. 
<b>43
</b></p>
<p> The CPP/NPA/NDF variously considers itself a &#8220;sovereign&#8221;, an armed group with &#8220;status of 
belligerency&#8221;, and &#8220;the political authority representing the Filipino people and organized 
political forces that are waging an armed revolutionary struggle for national liberation and 
democracy, in the exercise of the right to self-determination&#8221;.  (<i>Declaration of Undertaking</i>).  
The CPP/NPA/NDF claims on this basis to have the authority to impose a system of criminal 
justice.  Moreover, it claims that its right to do so is affirmed by the CARHRIHL signed by 
representatives of the Government and the NDF on 16 March 1998.  CARHRIHL, Part III, 
Article 4 provides that, &#8220;The persons liable for violations and abuses of human rights shall be 
subject to investigation and, if evidence warrants, to prosecution and trial. . . .&#8221; 
<b>44
</b></p>
<p> The basic procedure of the people&#8217;s courts is provided in the &#8220;Guide for Establishing the 
People&#8217;s Democratic Government&#8221; (1972), Chapter III, but this does not explain what law the 
courts apply.  Representatives of the NDF claimed that, while the process of codification was 
ongoing, several existing documents constituted a penal code.  These were the &#8220;Guide for 
Establishing the People&#8217;s Democratic Government&#8221;, &#8220;Basic Rules of the New People&#8217;s Army&#8221; 
(1969), &#8220;Rules in the Investigation and Prosecution of Suspected Enemy Spies&#8221; (1989), and the 
&#8220;NDFP Declaration of Undertaking to Apply the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Protocol I of 
1977&#8221; (1996).  While the &#8220;Basic Rules of the New People&#8217;s Army&#8221; includes a list of offences 
that are to be punished by expulsion and death when committed by members of the NPA &#8212; 
&#8220;treachery, capitulation, abandonment of post, espionage, sabotage, mutiny, inciting for 
rebellion, murder, theft, rape, arson and severe malversation of people&#8217;s funds&#8221; (Principle IV, 
Point 8) &#8212; neither this nor any other instrument cited actually defines the elements of any 
criminal offence.

Statute of the International Criminal Court, Article 8(2)(c)(iv); International Committee of the

Doswald-Beck (eds.), Cambridge University Press, 2005, Rules 100-103, 156. 
<b>46
</b></p>
<p> NDF representatives explained that &#8220;accountabilities&#8221; to the people cover a range of situations 
including that a person has caused injury, damage, or death and warrants a warning; that a person 
has become part of the military structure and a legitimate military target; or that a person has 
been the subject of a criminal complaint before a people&#8217;s court.  When it is stated that a person 
has a &#8220;blood debt&#8221;, that would generally mean that a complaint had been filed or a warrant of 
arrest issued.  I have no evidence that the CPP/NPA/NDF uses such characterizations as a way of 
directing or inciting violence against individuals; however, the effect of intimidation that such 
statements must cause is highly irresponsible.  Thus, for instance, Jose Maria Sison stated 
publicly that two prominent non-CPP leftists, Walden Bello and Etta Rosales, &#8220;can talk and write 
as much as they want against the CPP and other revolutionary forces [and] be sure that these 
targets of their malice will always respect their right of free speech&#8221; but then added that &#8220;it is 
another matter if for example there is a criminal complaint&#8221; against either of them and hinted at

<p>what basis such a hypothetical criminal complaint might have &#8212; &#8220;organizing groups dedicated 
to intelligence and psywar for the imperialists against the patriotic and progressive forces&#8221; and 
&#8220;stealing funds from her congressional committee, covering up human rights violations or 
conniving with Imee Marcos in blocking the indemnification of the winning plaintiffs in the US 
court judgment against the Marcos estate&#8221;, respectively.  (Press Statement, 27 December 2004.)  
In this context, it was hardly unreasonable for Bello and Rosales to wonder whether they might 
be subjected to the &#8220;revolutionary justice&#8221; of a &#8220;people&#8217;s court&#8221;.  However, when I asked Sison 
whether there were such criminal complaints, he stated that he had no information that there 
were such complaints, and members of the NDF Negotiating Panel stated categorically that there 
were not.

</b> I reviewed case files concerning 45 killings that took place in the Autonomous Region of 
</p>
<p>Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), 8 in the province of Maguindanao and 37 in the province of Sulu.  
I received a number of less substantiated reports on killings in other parts of the ARMM.  I also 
reviewed case files concerning alleged killings in other areas contemplated for inclusion in the 
ARMM under the 1976 Tripoli Agreement between the Government and the MNLF: Davao del 
Sur (4 killings), SOCCSKSARGEN (10), and Zamboanga Peninsula (9).  I also interviewed 
witnesses to 8 extrajudicial executions in these areas, including 3 in Davao del Sur, 3 in Sulu, 
and 2 in SOCCSKSARGEN.

<p> The International Monitoring Team (IMT) led by Malaysia, with some 60 personnel from 
several countries, is mandated to &#8220;observe and monitor the implementation of cessation of 
hostilities, as well as the socio-economic development aspects of the agreements signed&#8221;, &#8220;[t]o 
conduct field verification to validate any reported violations of any of the cessation of hostilities 
agreements signed&#8221;, and &#8220;[t]o report to the [Government] and MILF Peace Panels its findings 
and assessment of the reported violations&#8221;.  (&#8220;Terms of Reference of the International 
Monitoring Team (IMT)&#8221; (signed 6 September 2004), art. 5.)  Earlier attempts to implement the 
agreement on monitoring made in the &#8220;Agreement on Peace&#8221; (signed 22 June 2001) recognized 
that the &#8220;cessation of hostilities&#8221; and the &#8220;socio-economic development&#8221; aspects of the 
agreements include their human rights and humanitarian law commitments.  (See, esp., 
&#8220;Implementing Guidelines on the Humanitarian, Rehabilitation and Development Aspects of the 
GRP-MILF Tripoli Agreement on Peace of 2001&#8221; (signed 7 May 2002), Article VI).  However, 
as mentioned, the terms of reference under which the IMT actually deployed in October 2004 did 
not expressly refer to human rights and humanitarian law. 
<b>49
</b></p>
<p> It is not always empirically clear whether a particular extrajudicial execution was related to the 
victim&#8217;s participation if agrarian reform programs.  This is especially so when the victim was a 
member of leftist peasant organization as well as other leftist civil society organizations.  
However, on a relatively narrow interpretation, I interviewed at least 10 witnesses to agrarian-
reform related killings.

attempt to implement the State&#8217;s constitutional obligation to &#8220;undertake an agrarian reform 
program founded on the right of farmers and regular farmworkers who are landless, to own

advocates for a more extensive redistribution program following its contemplated victory and 
uses its clout today to adjust the relative shares received by landowners and sharecroppers: &#8220;The 
current minimum land reform program involves the reduction of land rent and abolition of usury, 
and the setting up of mutual aid and labor exchange systems among the peasantry.  For the last 
24 years, the revolutionary movement has carried out this minimum program in ever-widening 
areas of the countryside. . . . After the nationwide victory of the revolution, it shall be possible to 
carry out the maximum land reform program, which involves the confiscation of landlord 
property and the equitable distribution of the land to the landless tillers at no cost to them.&#8221;

<p>The table reflects the information provided on the organizations&#8217; web sites as of 16 July 2007. 
(&lt;www.cmfr.com.ph&gt;; &lt;www.nujp.org&gt;; &lt;www.cpj.org&gt;). 
The different numbers for some years are due to differing criteria for assessing whether a 
particular killing was due to the victim&#8217;s work as a journalist.  Thus NUJP explains that &#8220;[i]n 
cases where it is not clear whether the death was work-related, or when the authorities could not 
ascertain the motives behind the killing, NUJP shall assume that the killing was work-related, 
unless future evidence points to the contrary&#8221;; whereas, CPJ explains that &#8220;[i]f the motives are 
unclear, but it is possible that a journalist was killed because of his or her work, CPJ classifies 
the case as &#8216;unconfirmed&#8217; and continues to investigate to determine the motive for the murder&#8221;.

<p> I interviewed witnesses regarding 5 extrajudicial executions of journalists and 1 frustrated 
extrajudicial execution.  I also received case files regarding a further 36 cases of extrajudicial 
execution.

<p> The relationship between the structure of the media industry and the frequency with which 
journalists are killed has been extensively studied by civil society organizations.  <i>See</i> Abi

<p>Local advocates said that identifying extrajudicial executions for which the DDS was responsible 
was made more difficult due to a transition from shooting to stabbing as the favored method of 
execution.  For this reason, they doubted that the decline in recorded cases from 2005 to 2006 
was due to a decline in actual cases. 
 
</p>
<p><b>DDS Victims by Reasons Given for Execution

No reason given 194 35% 
Total 553 100% 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>There are several ways in which advocates assess the probable reason for an execution.  The 
most reliable is when warnings given prior to the execution explained the reason.  In many cases, 
however, advocates relied on newspaper reports that the PNP or other officials had stated that the 
victim was a &#8220;known thief&#8221; or the like. 
</p>
<p>The Davao City office of the PNP provided me with detailed statistics on homicides from 2003 
through 2006, including a case-by-case breakdown as well as aggregate statistics.  These provide 
context for understanding the extrajudicial executions and tend to corroborate some elements of 
the account provided by advocates. 
</p>
<p><b>Number of homicide incidents and number of persons killed, by year 
 2003 2004 2005 2006 
Number of incidents </b>180 225 264 344 
<b>Number of persons killed </b>190 242 277 360 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>This means that Davao City&#8217;s homicide rate is roughly 17 to 31 per 100,000 population.  
(According to the 2000 census, Davao City had a population of 1,147,116.)  Insofar as 
advocates&#8217; counts of killings by the DDS are accurate &#8212; and they could be low as likely as high 
&#8212; then roughly half of murders are committed by the DDS.  (The figure would be 52% for 2003, 
44% for 2004, 56% for 2005, and 18% for 2006.) 
</p>
<p>The data also show that stabbing became a far more common method of murder starting in 2006: 
</p>
<p><b>Number of homicides, by weapon used, by year 
 2003 2004 2005 2006

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Further clarification is provided by looking at the overall homicide case resolution rate, together 
with the resolution rates for stabbing as compared to shooting cases: 
</p>
<p><b>Homicide case resolution rate, by weapon used, by year 
 2003 2004 2005 2006 
Shooting incidents </b>123 133 159 126 
<b>  Cases solved (number) </b>33 24 23 47 
<b>  Cases solved (%) </b>27% 18% 14% 37% 
<b>Stabbing incidents </b>57 92 105 218 
<b>  Cases solved (number) </b>42 73 67 98 
<b>  Cases solved (%) </b>74% 79% 64% 45% 
<b>Total incidents </b>180 225 264 344 
<b>  Cases solved (number) </b>75 97 90 145 
<b>  Cases solved (%) </b>42% 43% 34% 42% 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>The overall resolution rate for homicide cases has consistently been around 40%.  (Note that 
resolution here refers to the identification of suspects; this provides no information about the 
conviction rate.) 
</p>
<p>Also note that, consistent with the analysis of advocates, the police statistics show a sharp 
increase in the use of knives rather than guns in 2006 (a 108% rise in stabbings and a 21% fall in 
shootings) along with a sharp decrease in the proportion of stabbing homicides solved by the 
police (a 30% fall). 
<b>57
</b></p>
<p> A table analyzing some key elements of seven of these cases is included in Appendix A, para. 
27. 
<b>58
</b></p>
<p> One person with whom I spoke said that the police asked her son to become an asset after he 
was arrested.  Others had friends or acquaintances who had acted as assets.  They appear to 
invariably be gang members or petty criminals, who are in a position to report the locations of 
other gang members and criminals.  Generally assets appear to provide information to their 
handlers using cell phone text messages. 
<b>59
</b></p>
<p> In accord with DILG Memorandum Circular No. 98-227 (2 December 1998), some barangays 
have established Barangay Anti-Drug Abuse Councils (BADACs) for this purpose.  According 
to PNP officials with whom I spoke, the watch lists these groups provide are validated by PNP 
intelligence officers and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and are then used in buy-bust 
and other anti-drug operations. 
<b>60
</b></p>
<p> The mayor told me unequivocally that he would welcome investigators to come to his jails, 
talk with the inmates, and ensure that nothing remiss takes place.  The CHRP should fully 
exercise its pre-existing right to do so (Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines (1987), 
art. XIII, section 18(4)), and civil society organizations should consider whether to take the 
mayor up on his offer.

</p>
<p><b>61
</b> I spoke with a number of witnesses about why they and others have been so reticent.  One 
</p>
<p>recounted that the police came and asked various neighbors whether they had seen the killing.  
Although the killing had happened in public in the morning and many had seen the perpetrators 
and their actions, everyone told the police that they had not.  The reason was that someone in the 
neighborhood had described the killer in a previous incident; that night some had come and 
killed her.  In another incident involving a child of the same witness, the police did not even ask 
for witnesses to come forward.  They just gathered up the bullets and left.  Another witness with 
whom I spoke said that the family of one victim did not pursue the case at all, because they knew 
that the perpetrator was connected to powerful people.  He said that even in other cases that he 
was aware of, no one would testify, both from fear and because the media always reports that the 
victim was a criminal, and who wants to witness for a criminal?  A well-informed individual told 
me that in Davao City the witnesses that do come forward are nearly invariably from a victim&#8217;s 
family; no one else is willing to take the risk.

<p> According to Task Force Usig, of the 116 cases of slain party list members or militants that it 
considers within its remit, their current status is as follows:

</p>
<p>The information in this table was accurate as of 2 April 2007.  (Letter from the Philippine 
Mission to the United Nations, dated 23 May 2007.)  The Government has more recently 
informed me that Task Force Usig has now filed 56 cases (or, an additional 6 cases); I do not 
have a detailed breakdown of their status.  The Government also stated that it is &#8220;prosecuting 
fourteen (14) alleged EJK cases&#8221; and provided a list thereof.  (Letter from the Philippine Mission 
to the United Nations, dated 18 October 2007.) 
</p>
<p>There is no reason to assume that a significant proportion of cases in which suspects have been 
identified will ultimately result in convictions.  In multiple instances in which the PNP has 
&#8220;resolved&#8221; a case, others following that case have raised serious doubts as to whether the 
evidence points to the suspect identified.  One such instance is the case of Madonna Castillo y 
Lucban: The police filed charges against an alleged NPA, but others have pointed to allegedly 
recorded deathbed testimony that her attackers belonged to the AFP.  (See the case study on 
Alice Omengan-Claver and Constancio Claver in Appendix A, paras. 28-54, for more on this 
case.)  Another such instance is the case of Enrico Cabanit.  Enrique Solon was identified as the 
gunman shortly after he was killed by the police.  However, numerous factors suggest that this 
identification is unreliable, and, based on my own interviews and review of the documents, I 
concur with the view of the Melo Commission that &#8220;there are numerous discrepancies and 
suspicious details regarding the investigation which tended to disprove the police theory&#8221;.  The 
Government&#8217;s progress in achieving justice for these killings cannot be measured by anything 
less than convictions following fair trials.

<p>The two cases with convictions are those of Edgar Damalerio and Marlene Esperat.  For the 
period from 1986 to the establishment of Task Force Usig, there have also been convictions in 
two other cases, those of Alberto Berbon and Nesino Paulin Toling.  (Rachel E. Khan and 
Nathan J. Lee, &#8220;The Danger of Impunity&#8221;, CMFR (5 September 2005).)  More recently, the 
Government has also informed me that convictions have been achieved in two other cases &#8212; 
those of Allan Dizon and Frank Palma &#8212; that are not among the 26 being handled by Task Force 
Usig.  (Letter from the Philippine Mission to the United Nations, dated 18 October 2007.)

<p>Note that Task Force Usig reports that of the 45 incidents reported by the National Union of

<p> Prior to 1991, the police forces of the Philippines, comprising the Philippine Constabulary and 
the Integrated National Police, formed a branch of the AFP.  However, the 1987 Constitution 
provided that, &#8220;The State shall establish and maintain one police force, which shall be national in 
scope and civilian in character, to be administered and controlled by a national police 
commission. The authority of local executives over the police units in their jurisdiction shall be 
provided by law.&#8221;  (Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines (1987), art. XVI, section 6).  
To implement this provision, DILG, the PNP, and the National Police Commission 
(NAPOLCOM) were established by the &#8220;Department of the Interior and Local Government Act 
of 1990&#8221; (Republic Act No. 6975) (signed into law 13 December 1990).  The PNP and 
NAPOLCOM are both found within DILG. 
</p>
<p>The NAPOLCOM is &#8220;an agency attached to [DILG]&#8221; that exercises &#8220;administrative control and 
operation supervision&#8221; over the PNP.  (Republic Act No. 6975, sections 13-14 (as amended by 
Republic Act No. 8551).)  The NAPOLCOM comprises a Chairperson, four regular 
Commissioners, and the Chief of PNP.  Of the regular Commissioners, three &#8220;shall come from 
the civilian sector who are neither active nor former members of the police or military&#8221; and one 
&#8220;shall come from the law enforcement sector either active or retired&#8221;.  (Republic Act No. 6975, 
section 13 (as amended by Republic Act No. 8551).) 
</p>
<p>While the PNP is a national organization, local executives exercise considerable control over its 
operations.  City and municipal mayors are &#8220;deputized&#8221; as representatives of the NAPOLCOM, 
and &#8220;exercise operational supervision and control over PNP units in their respective 
jurisdictions&#8221; including the &#8220;power to direct, superintend, and oversee the day-to-day functions 
of police investigation of crime, crime prevention activities, and traffic control in accordance 
with the rules and regulations promulgated by the [NPC]&#8221;.  (Republic Act No. 6975, section 
51(b) (as amended by Republic Act No.8551)).  However, the Commission on Elections 
(COMELEC) assumes control during the 30 days before and the 30 days after elections.  
Moreover, NAPOLCOM may &#8220;suspend or withdraw&#8221; local control at any time for any of four 
specified reasons: &#8220;[f]requent unauthorized absences&#8221;, &#8220;[a]buse of authority&#8221;, &#8220;[p]roviding 
material support to criminal elements&#8221;, or &#8220;[e]ngaging in acts inimical to national security or 
which negate the effectiveness of the peace and order campaign&#8221;.  (Republic Act No. 6975, 
sections 51(b), 52 (as amended by Republic Act No.8551)).

<p>The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) is another law enforcement body.  However, in 
contrast to the semi-decentralized PNP, the DOJ controls the operations of the National Bureau 
of Investigation (NBI) throughout the country.  (Republic Act No. 157 (signed into law 19 June

With respect to oversight, &#8220;The IALAG shall report directly and shall be accountable to the

<p> Some activists and politicians with whom I spoke feared that the Human Security Act of 2007,

terrorism (section 4) and provides for the proscription of &#8220;[a]ny organization, association, or 
group of persons organized for the purpose of engaging in terrorism, or which, although not

<p> Each year, the General Appropriations Act includes funds for each congressional 
representative to allocate at his or her discretion.  These funds are commonly referred to as the 
representative&#8217;s &#8220;pork barrel&#8221;.  The most notable such program is the Priority Development 
Assistance Fund (PDAF), previously known as the Countryside Development Fund (CDF).  In 
the 2007 budget, PP 11.445 billion (USD 241.302 million), or approximately 1% of the budget, 
was allocated to the PDAF.

<p> Most senior officers in the PNP began their careers when the police still formed part of the 
AFP, and they attended the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) along with current senior AFP 
officers.  Today, recruits are trained at the Philippine Public Safety College (PPSC), and officers 
are trained at the Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA).  Senior AFP and PNP officers, as 
well as senior civilian officials, all take courses at the National Defense College.

<p> The bill creating the PNP in 1990 allocated to it the &#8220;primary role&#8221; in counterinsurgency,

1990&#8221; (Republic Act No. 6975) (signed into law 13 December 1990), section 12).  These roles 
were reversed in 1998, which &#8220;relieved [DILG and PNP] of the primary responsibility on matters 
involving the suppression of insurgency&#8221; (&#8220;Philippine National Police Reform and 
Reorganizations Act of 1998&#8221; (Republic Act No. 8551) (signed into law 25 February 1998), 
section 3).  Most recently, Executive Order No. 546 (14 July 2006) ordered that &#8220;[t]he PNP shall 
support the AFP in combat operations involving the suppression of insurgency and other serious 
threats to national security&#8221; (section 1) and also authorized the PNP &#8220;to deputize the barangay 
tanods as force multipliers in the implementation of the peace and order plan in the area&#8221; (section 
2).  In practice, the PNP typically conducts counterinsurgency operations in urban areas while 
the AFP does so in rural areas.

<p> <i>See </i>Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines (1987), art. VIII, section 5: &#8220;The Supreme 
Court shall have the following powers: . . . Promulgate rules concerning the protection and 
enforcement of constitutional rights, pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts, the 
admission to the practice of law, the integrated bar, and legal assistance to the under-privileged. 
Such rules shall provide a simplified and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of

<p>The Government has also informed me that the President has recently promulgated an 
administrative order to &#8220;ensure proper coordination and cooperation between the prosecutors and 
the police&#8221;.  (Letter from the Philippine Mission to the United Nations, dated 18 October 2007.)  
That order provides that, in cases falling under the jurisdiction of the special courts established 
by the Supreme Court to deal with extrajudicial executions (see Part X(H)), that the PNP and 
NBI are directed to cooperate with the NPS &#8220;by, among other things, consulting with public

<p> This reform would require DOJ to revise its rules and regulations implementing the &#8220;Witness 
Protection, Security and Benefit Act&#8221; (Republic Act No. 6981, signed into law 24 April 1991), 
but it would not require any legislative amendment.

</b></p>
<p> One worthy proposal that <i>would</i> require a statutory amendment is to increase the penalties for 
harassing witnesses.  These are minimal: a fine of not more than 3,000 pesos (USD $65) or 
imprisonment of not less than 6 months but not more than 1 year. (Republic Act No. 6981, 
section 17(e).) 
<b>78 </b>Thus, for the witnesses in one case brought to my attention, the &#8220;secure housing facility&#8221; 
promised by law consisted of small rooms in the NBI compound.  Implicated officials were not 
prevented from coming directly to where the witnesses were housed, and other financial and 
medical benefits provided were inadequate.  (For the rights and benefits provided under the 
witness protection program, see Republic Act No. 6981, section 8.)  Most of the witnesses in that

<p> Chief Justice Reynato Puno informed me of this initiative when we met, and he announced it 
shortly thereafter.  Concretely, the establishment of &#8220;special courts&#8221; means that particular trial 
courts are designated either to only hear such cases or to prioritize them in their trial calendars: 
&#8220;The cases referred to herein shall undergo mandatory continuous trial and shall be terminated 
within sixty (60) days from the commencement of trial.  Judgment thereon shall be rendered

included in the raffle of cases, criminal and civil, provided that the Executive Judges of the 
RTCs [Regional Trial Courts] concerned shall exclude the designated Special Courts from such 
raffle whenever in their judgment the caseload of these courts shall prevent them from 
conducting the continuous trial of the special cases herein specified. . . . No postponement or 
continuation of trial shall be allowed except for clearly meritorious reasons.  Pleadings or 
motions found to have been filed for dilatory purposes shall constitute direct contempt and shall 
be punished accordingly.&#8221;  (Administrative Order No. 25-2007, &#8220;Designation of Special Courts

</p>
<p>It should be straightforward to monitor the effectiveness of this arrangement, inasmuch as, &#8220;A 
report on the status of these cases shall be attached to the Monthly Report of Cases submitted 
every 10th day of the succeeding month to the Statistical Reports Division, Court Management 
Office, Office of the Court Administrator.  Failure to submit such report shall be a ground for

proper subject of investigation are one.  It follows that the operation of government, being a 
legitimate subject for legislation, is a proper subject for investigation. . . . . [T]he power of 
inquiry, &#8220;with process to enforce it,&#8221; is grounded on the necessity of information in the

<p><b>INDIVIDUAL CASE STUDIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nelson Asucena 
</b></p>
<p>1. This case illustrates an approach to counterinsurgency used in the Cagayan Valley 
Region. 
</p>
<p>2. Nelson Asucena was killed on 13 December 2006 in Barangay San Juan, Rizal, Cagayan, 
Cagayan Valley region.  At roughly ten o&#8217;clock that night, he and his family were awakened by 
barking dogs.  Someone called for him to come out.  His father stopped him from opening the 
door, but he replied that it was the voice of Lt. Marcelo Pascua. He opened the door and went 
outside with a lamp.  There were six persons outside &#8212; Pascua in a combat uniform and five 
others in bonnets (i.e., ski masks), black long-sleeved shirts and combat boots.  They told him to 
put out the light or put it back inside.  The six men asked to have some food cooked for them.  
Then the six men changed their minds and said to serve coffee rather than food, because it would 
be faster.  When his mother was about to make coffee, a man called for Nelson to bring out 
water, but his father did so instead and then went inside to prepare cups for coffee.  Then as he 
was preparing the cups, he had only put two cups on the platter, but the soldiers already called 
again for Nelson to come and get the water glasses. 
</p>
<p>3. Nelson went outside.  A few seconds later, his family members heard the loading or 
cocking of a gun.  Then they heard him make some sort of exclamation.  Then they heard gun 
shots.  His father and mother went outside and saw their son on the ground.  The six men were 
nowhere to be seen.   
</p>
<p>4. The witness with whom I spoke was uncertain as to the reason for the killing, but other 
information shared is suggestive. 
</p>
<p>5. On the morning of November 26, Lt. Pascua had come to the house, looking for Nelson 
but finding only his mother.  She said that he was in the field preparing it to plant corn.  She 
called for him, and he came home.  Lt. Pascua asked him to &#8220;surrender&#8221;. He said, &#8220;All I have is 
my bolo and my plow.  I am a civilian, youth chairman of the barangay.&#8221;  Lt. Pascua responded, 
&#8220;Then you&#8217;d better take care of yourself.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>6. Nelson was chairman of the barangay&#8217;s Youth Council (Sanguniang Kabataan).  He was 
also a member of Anakbayan, a youth organization that is part of the BAYAN coalition.  The 
witness stated Nelson had not been a member of the NPA.   
</p>
<p>7. The witness said that there is some NPA presence in the area, with NPA fighters 
sometimes passing through the barangay, but that there had not been any recent encounters 
between the AFP and NPA.  (This is consistent with incident data provided by the AFP.  
According to AFP records, in the period from 2000 to the present, there have been numerous, 
serious engagements between the AFP and the NPA to the north of this area (in the 
municipalities of Gattaran and Lasam) and to its south (in the municipalities of Balbalan and 
Pinukpuk, Kalinga, Cordillera Administrative Region).  These municipalities are, however, some 
30 kilometers from Barangay San Juan.  The AFP records do not disclose any armed encounters 
in Barangay San Juan itself, and the last encounter in neighboring Barangay Bural took place in 
January 2004 (no casualties).  More serious and persistent encounters took place in neighboring 
areas of the municipality of Sto Nino; however, these had become infrequent by 2001.  (Source:

the data for 2006 appear incomplete.)) 
</p>
<p>8. On November 24, soldiers from the Alpha Company of the 21st Infantry Battalion of the 
Army had conducted a meeting in the barangay.  At the meeting, soldiers explained their 
program on the insurgency.  During the meeting, they conducted a census, gathering the names 
and nicknames of all who attended.  The soldiers asked what the problems in the community 
were.  People answered regarding a health center and the need to fix the roads.  The soldiers 
asked how they could fix the roads when the NPA destroys the machinery.  One resident 
responded that this had happened once, but now they were not around, so why not fix the roads?  
The soldiers also spoke about how the CPP/NPA/NDF members were deceptive.  Nelson&#8217;s father 
stood up and asked why they didn&#8217;t arrest them if they were so deceptive.  A soldier responded, 
&#8220;How can we arrest them when they are legal organizations?&#8221;  (I clarified that this was just a 
question and answer session; there was no PowerPoint presentation.) 
</p>
<p>9. On November 25, the soldiers took two residents who were former members of the NPA 
to a military base in Tuao.  (The two were released in December, before Christmas.) 
</p>
<p>10. Other than in the context of the meeting, the witness was unaware of any census having 
been conducted.  However, the houses of the barangay were far apart from each other, so it 
would be difficult to know for certain.  (For context, according to census data, as of 1 May 2000, 
Barangay San Juan had a population of 408 in 76 households.)  I learned from other witnesses 
that censuses have been conducted by soldiers in some other parts of Cagayan province. 
</p>
<p>11. Later on, the soldiers assigned some of the residents to a CAFGU.  According to 
information from people still living in the area, nothing has come of this.  The persons assigned 
to the CAFGU have received information that they will be trained, but nothing has happened so 
far.  (If the second hand information received by the witness is accurate, this appears to be fairly 
unusual; other witnesses, including ones from Cagayan province, referred to individuals 
volunteering for and then serving in CAFGUs.) 
</p>
<p>12. After the killing, Nelson&#8217;s family immediately requested help from the neighbors and 
barangay officials.  In the morning, barangay officials followed visible foot prints from where 
the men who killed Nelson had been standing to Barangay Bural, a neighboring barangay in 
which the soldiers had been staying. 
</p>
<p>13. Nelson&#8217;s father gave a statement to the barangay officials, but he was afraid to talk to the 
PNP.  So the barangay officials took his statement and then relayed it to the police.  (According 
to the AFP, &#8220;The killing was reported only on 151100 December 2006 [15 December 2006 at 
11:00am] by Brgy Chairman Froilan P Dassil by text message.  Reportedly, the PNP unit of 
Rizal under P/Insp Balisi has invited the parents of the victim to shed light on the matter but they 
did not cooperate.  KARAPATAN kept the couple and advised them to go instead to the Bombo 
Radyo to air grievances.  Additional information disclosed that Charles Valencia, a 
KARAPATAN lawyer, filed a human rights case against 2LT PASCUA without doing 
investigation.&#8221; (&#8220;Status of Cases of Regular Members, CAFGUs, Suspected Military Assets and

</p>
<p>14. Nelson&#8217;s father went to the municipality to request a death certificate, but he refused to 
accept it because it listed the cause of death as malaria.  The mayor and colonel were asking 
where was the medical report on the body.   But no medical examination had been carried out, 
because they could not carry the body to the city.  The place where Nelson was killed was near 
the family&#8217;s &#8220;field house&#8221; (a small hut near their fields as opposed to their real house in the 
barangay proper).  It was a long way to the nearest jeepney stop and getting there would have 
required traversing a river while it was running high and strong.  So they buried him in their 
backyard. 
</p>
<p>15. Despite the family&#8217;s initial reluctance, they ultimately made complaints to the CHRP, the 
PNP, and the Regional State Prosecutor in Tuguegarao, the capital city of Cagayan.  Without a 
death certificate, these complaints proved difficult to make, and the witnesses are unaware of any 
progress in the case.  They have requested the CHRP&#8217;s assistance in having the body exhumed so 
that an autopsy can be conducted. 
</p>
<p>16. The AFP has provided an account of its participation in subsequent investigations: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;On 20 January 2007, a letter signed by Rev Emery V Cadiz of the KARAPATAN-CV 
Chapter was sent to Rizal Mayor Raul Dela Cruz informing him that the KARAPATAN 
in coordination with the CHR Office in Region 2 will conduct their investigation on 20-
21 January 2007. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;On 190800 January 2007, a group of people with two foreigners: Emily Totenberg, a 
U.S. national claiming to be a member of the Green for International Press; and a 
Japanese who claimed he was a student of UP-Diliman, on board a passenger jeep arrived 
in Sicalao, Lasam, Cagayan.  They are reportedly from KARAPATAN led by an 
unidentified person who introduced herself as a student of UP who was working on her 
doctorate degree.  They were stopped by elements of 21IB for routine inspection and as 
the two foreigners could not presne their passports, they were advised to go back.  It as 
observed that most of the members of the group were the usual militant persons in the 
province of Cagayan. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;On 19 and 20 February 2007, the Philippine Daily Inquirer published articles alleging 
that the group of 2LT MARCELO PASCUA PA was responsible for the klling of Mr. 
Asucena. . . . 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Commanding Officer reported that the allegations are not true.  The unit submitted 
to CSAFP an initial report and pursuant to a personal inquiry with the CO, 21st IB, 
presently the unit is willing to get certifications from witneses that 2LT PASCUA was 
with some officials and teachers of the barangay during the reported date of the incident.  
There is no subpoena yet issued by the prosecutor in the area.&#8221;

</p>
<p><b>James Ayunga 
</b></p>
<p>17. This case illustrates an approach to counterinsurgency used in the Central Luzon Region. 
</p>
<p>18. James Ayunga was a leader in the Alyansa ng Magbubukid sa Ginang Luzon (AMGL), a 
local chapter of the Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP), a peasant organization that 
belongs to the BAYAN coalition, and a barangay council member in Barangay Culong, Guimba, 
Nueva Ecija, Central Luzon.  (For context, according to the census data, as of 1 May 2000, 
Barangay Culong had a population of 1,447 in 322 households.) 
</p>
<p>19. In June 2006, a military detachment (from the 71st Infantry Battalion of the Army) was 
established in his barangay.  It called a community assembly.  At the assembly, soldiers said that 
they were there to maintain peace and order and asked members of the audience who belonged to 
the civil society organizations to provide their names, but nobody volunteered.  Then the soldiers 
conducted a door-to-door census, asking the names of inhabitants, their occupations, etc. 
</p>
<p>20. By July, soldiers had made a list based on the census and started calling everyone on the 
list to be interrogated, one by one.  The first ones called were local members of the KMP.  The 
interrogations would happen in the house rented by the detachment and would involve torture, 
including punching people in the belly and putting plastic over their heads.  Among those who 
were called were his parents and other relatives who belong to civil society organizations.  They 
were asked where he could be found, because they had information that he was a full-time 
organizer for AMGL, so he was not then in the barangay.  His daughter and son-in-law were 
afraid for him, because they had been called to the detachment and tortured, so they told him not 
to return to the village, and then they decided to leave the village as well. 
</p>
<p>21. Their fears were confirmed by the killing in their village of a barangay council member 
who had also been a leader of KMP.  (Presumably, based on other reports, this was July 
Vasquez, who was killed on 16 August 2006.)  Mr. Vasquez had been called by the soldiers and 
was interrogated.  The interrogation scared him, so he left the area for two weeks.  When he 
returned, the soldiers put up a detachment near his house and killed him that night.  The soldiers 
suspected that he had been with the NPA.  (According to the AFP, &#8220;On 161900 Aug, three (3) 
CTs shot to death Brgy Councilman July VASQUEZ in Brgy Culong, Guimba, Nueva Ecija.  
Reportedly, the CTs were asking him if they could utilize his residence as resting place whenever 
they pass by, whom he rejected.  The victim request to arrange for the establisment of an Army 
Detachment in their brgy.&#8221;  (CD labeled &#8220;Reference Materials on Unexplained Killings (Jan 
2007)&#8221; provided by the AFP).) 
</p>
<p>22. From people who remained in the village, the witness understood that the soldiers spent 
three days in late August surveilling the family&#8217;s (abandoned) house.  The soldiers regularly rode 
around the area on motorcycles dressed in civilian clothes.  Despite their civilian dress, the 
individual soldiers were recognized by neighbors.  The soldiers burned down the house on 29 
August 2006.  This was interpreted as a means of demonstrating the consequences of evading 
interrogation. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 58 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>23. On 4 November 2006, a community meeting was called by the soldiers.  (I clarified that 
no pamphlets were used for vilification in this area.)  They announced that since Mr. Ayunga 
would not report, he was &#8220;wanted&#8221;.  They said that if they saw him, they would kill him.  The 
reason they gave was that he was an NPA commander.  They gave as evidence the fact that he 
was not residing in the village and that he had not shown up to clear his name.  (In this area, 
extended families typically live in a &#8220;compound&#8221; &#8212; a lot with several houses &#8212; so it is 
considered especially suspicious when a family member is missing.  The assumption soldiers 
make is that the person missing is with the NPA.) 
</p>
<p>24. According to the witness with whom I spoke, in the past, NPA fighters would pass 
through and be given food and sometimes accommodation.  People were afraid of not 
accommodating NPAs for fear of what would happen.  However, since the last quarter of 2003, 
there have not been any NPAs around.  And there have been no encounters whatsoever between 
the AFP and the NPA in the time since the soldiers set up their detachment in the barangay.  
(This account is consistent with incident data provided by the AFP.  According to AFP records, 
in the period from 2000 to the present, there has been a high intensity of engagement between the 
AFP and the NPA to its north (in the municipalities of Cuyapo, Lupao, and Umingan, but 
especially in Carranglan) and to the southwest (in and around Tarlac City).  These areas are 15 to 
30 kilometers from Barangay Culong.  The closest areas that have seen actual armed encounters 
between the AFP and NPA are Barangay San Pascual, Sto Domingo, Nueva Ecija (February 
2000) and Barangay Gabaldon, Munoz City, Nueva Ecija (July 2003), though neither resulted in 
casualties.  The NPA is also recorded as having stopped a vehicle to free detained NPA members 
in a neighboring barangay in July 2005.  The only incident the AFP records as having occurred 
in Barangay Culong concerns the killing of July Vasquez, discussed above.  (CD labeled 
&#8220;Reference Materials on Unexplained Killings (Jan 2007)&#8221; provided by the AFP with various 
files contributing to &#8220;chronology of [NPA-related] violent incidents&#8221; from 2000 to 2006; the data 
for 2006 appear incomplete.)) 
</p>
<p>25. A Barangay Defense System has been setup 10 meters from Mr. Ayunga&#8217;s house.  The 
BDS is a converted bus stop, walled in by sand bags stacked five high and painted green, like 
camouflage.  (I was also provided photographs of various BDS posts.)  All the people of the 
barangay are compelled to take part in the BDS, and a schedule is setup.  Usually only men have 
to participate, but if they cannot join, the wife must, and otherwise the children.  Participants 
took an oath but did not receive training.  The BDS is armed with confiscated shot guns.  
Contributions are gathered from every household for coffee and snacks for the people working in 
the BDS.  The witness also provided a great deal of testimony about the setting up and 
movement of detachments and the conduct of surveillance, some of which is reflected in the 
main text of this report. 
</p>
<p>26. Given that he has survived, Task Force Usig has not investigated the case of James 
Ayunga.  It has also excluded the case of July Vasquez from its remit on the grounds that an 
(unspecified) &#8220;other motive&#8221; was behind his killing.  (Annex E of &#8220;Task Force &#8216;Usig&#8217;&#8221; document

he had just committed.  
Earlier, a member of the

him to leave Davao and 
had separately told his

safe-keep her son because 
he would be the next

would wash and watched 
cars parked at an 
establishment and then 
seek payment when the 
owners returned.  His

not.)  The man said that if

<p><b>Alice Omengan-Claver and Constancio Clever 
</b></p>
<p>28. These cases illustrate the complexities of the involvement of the PNP and of prosecutors 
in the Government&#8217;s counterinsurgency efforts. 
</p>
<p>29. On 31 July 2006, Alice Omengan-Claver and Dr. Constancio Clever were shot 
repeatedly; Alice died later that day.  Her death and the threats to his life may be best understood 
in the context of their involvement in the community and of other events that have taken place. 
</p>
<p>30. Alice had previously been on the staff of the Cordillera Peoples&#8217; Alliance in Manila, and 
was a supporter of Bayan Muna.  She was also an officer of the Parent-Teachers-Community 
Associations of their children&#8217;s schools.  Constancio is a surgeon and family physician.  He 
founded the Community Health Concerns for Kalinga, which setup health programs in 17 
barangays of Kalinga.  He is the Chairperson of Bayan Muna &#8211; Kalinga, the Vice Chairperson of 
the Cordillera Peoples&#8217; Alliance &#8211; Kalinga Chapter, Chairman of the Board of the Philippine 
National Red Cross &#8211; Kalinga, a member of the Kalinga Medical Society, and a member of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 61 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Philippine Academy of Family Physicians.  Despite recent statements by officials, my 
understanding is that Alice and Constancio have stated that they were never members of the 
NDF. 
</p>
<p>31. In March 2006, Pedro Ramos became the new provincial commander of PNP-Kalinga.  
Prior to the attack on Alice and Constancio, there had been 16 unsolved killings during the time 
that Ramos held the post. 
</p>
<p>32. According to one source, the provincial Inter-Agency Legal Action Group (IALAG) met 
with the participation of security and intelligence agencies but without the participation of the 
prosecutor. 
</p>
<p>33. On 8 June 2006, Rafael &#8220;Markus&#8221; Bangit, Vice Chairperson of Bayan Muna &#8211; Kalinga 
Chapter and a close friend of Alice and Constancio, was killed by unidentified assailants riding 
in a van in Echague, Isabela Province, Cagayan Valley region.  (Echague and Kalinga provinces 
border each other.) 
</p>
<p>34. Later that summer, Constancio was being interviewed live over Radio Natin on the Bayan 
Muna&#8217;s views on the charter change issue.  While the interview was going on, Alice received a 
text message reading, stating that &#8220;the doctor&#8221; does not seem to care about you or the children. 
</p>
<p>35. Four days prior to the attack, Constancio&#8217;s clinic was plastered with anti-NPA leaflets of 
the sort used by the military to argue that the NPA was conducting a purge. 
</p>
<p>36. At around 6:45 in the morning of 31 July 2006, Alice and Constancio were driving their 
daughters to school in Barangay Bulanao, Tabuk City, Kalinga Province, Cordillera 
Administrative Region.  Shortly after dropping off one daughter, a dark-colored van pulled in 
front of their car, and two armed men fired at its windshield.  Alice and Constancio both received 
multiple gun shot wounds; their daughter was barely scratched.  They were rushed to the Kalinga 
Provincial Hospital in Bulanao.  Reportedly, Ramos tried to enter the surgical area, saying that 
he wanted &#8220;just to see whether they are still alive&#8221;, but he was prevented from entering.  Alice 
died later that day. 
</p>
<p>37. At about 7 in the morning, while they were undergoing treatment at the hospital, the radio 
station DZRH reported that they had both been killed.  At 8:06am, Ramos made a radio report to 
General Raul Gonzales of the Cordillera Regional Police Command that Constancio was a 
&#8220;member of the NDF, Klg Baggas&#8221;.  At 8:15am, Gonzales was quoted as telling the media that, 
&#8220;Claver is a suspected member of the National Democratic Front&#8221;.   
</p>
<p>38. The van fled in the direction of the Kaliga-Cagayan Valley border and Tuguegarao City.  
On this road, there are three AFP and PNP checkpoints.  The checkpoints were never notified to 
stop the van.  Reportedly, the Assistant Police Director Hoover Coyoy subsequently explained 
this omission by saying that &#8220;we didn&#8217;t have load&#8221; on the pre-paid mobile phones.  One police 
car did pursue the van, but it was called off. 
</p>
<p>39. Task Force Usig formed Task Force Bulanao to investigate the incident.  The lead unit 
was the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG). </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 62 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>40. After roughly one month, Ramos was recalled to the PNP national headquarters at Camp 
Crame and replaced as police chief by Col. Damian.  One month later, Col. Damian was replaced 
by Romeo Abaring. 
</p>
<p>41. On 22 September 2006, Task Force Bulanao filed a case with prosecutor against Police 
Officer Jessie Caranto, who had been Ramos&#8217;s bodyguard and driver.   
</p>
<p>42. On 28 September 2006, police under the command of Capt. Domallig, the chief of a PNP 
substation, disarmed and detained the CIDG members of Task Force Bulanao for roughly 9 
hours.  Later, Ramos arrived and ordered the checkpoints be setup to recapture them, though this 
failed.   
</p>
<p>43. The witnesses subsequently retracted their statements.   
</p>
<p>44. The PNP placed Ramos and Caranto on restricted movement for 90 days.  (Caranto 
appears to have been held at the PNP national headquarters at Camp Crame.) 
</p>
<p>45. The Provincial Prosecutors Office of Kalinga chose to inhibit himself &#8212; i.e., disqualify 
himself from participating in the case &#8212; and transferred the case to the Regional Prosecutor&#8217;s 
office.  On 10 January 2007, the case was dismissed for insufficient evidence. 
</p>
<p>46. Threats against Constancio continued after the incident. 
</p>
<p>47. On 2 August 2006, Constancio received a text message, &#8220;May clearance ang tangkang 
pagpatay kay Dr. Claver kaya sabihin sa mga kapamilya na huwag silang magtiwala sa mga 
kapulisan dyan.&#8221;  (A clearance has been ordered to kill Dr. Claver.  Inform the family not to trust 
the local police.) 
</p>
<p>48. In the first week of January 2007, members of the Kalinga Medical Society received text 
messages reading, &#8220;Pakisabi kay Dr Claver na mag-ingat dahil hindi siya titigilan, at may plano 
pang gamitin ang mga bata.  Hindi ko na uulitin ang pag-contact sa inyo dahil baka mahalata 
ako&#8221;.  (Warn Dr. Claver to take care because they will keep going after him.  They even are 
thinking of using the children.  I will not contact you anymore because they might get 
suspicious.) 
</p>
<p>49. After Radio Natin broadcast an interview with Constancio, the station management 
received a text message, &#8220;Pakisabi po sobrang tapang ni Dr. Claver.  At pati kayo, nakikiuto.  
Ingat lang kayo diyan taga Radio Natin. Kayo ang isusunod naming!&#8221;  (Tell Dr. Claver that he is 
too outspoken.  And you in Radio Natin are believing him!  You better watch out or we&#8217;ll put 
you next in our list.) 
</p>
<p>50. Over the past few months, &#8220;leaks&#8221; from the AFP to the local media have indicated that 
Constancio&#8217;s name has been found in &#8220;captured ledger materials&#8221; of the NPA recording 
donations of his. 
</p>
<p>51. Task Force Usig has decided that the case of Alice Omengan-Claver does not fall within 
its remit on the grounds that an (unspecified) &#8220;other motive&#8221; was behind her killing.  (Annex E 
of &#8220;Task Force &#8216;Usig&#8217;&#8221; document provided by Government.)   </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 63 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>52. Task Force Usig is overseeing the case of Rafael Bangit.  It has reported that the case is 
&#8220;under investigation&#8221; and that, &#8220;The results of the ballistics/exam comparison done by Crime 
Lab pointed out that the spent shell and slugs of Cal. 45 recovered from the scene of Castillo in 
Echague and Bangit in San Isidro, both of Isabela came from the same firearms.  This would 
indicate that the perpetrators in both crimes are the same people.&#8221;  With respect to the case of 
Madonna Castillo y Lucban, Task Force Usig has reported that she was &#8220;[k]illed by Armando 
Inong @ Justin/Rio &amp; John Doe, member of SYP1 SECOM, Central Front, CVRC [i.e., 
Samahang Yunit Pampropaganda (propaganda unit) 1, South Eastern Command, Central Front, 
Cagayan Valley Regional Committee of the NPA]&#8221; and that the &#8220;[m]otive is purging of party 
members.  The CTs [communist terrorists] believed that victim is already a military informant&#8221;.  
A case against the alleged killer of Castillo was reportedly filed on 24 August 2006.  (Annex 
PRO2 of &#8220;Task Force &#8216;Usig&#8217; Synopsis&#8221; document provided by Government.) 
</p>
<p>53. The report of the NDFP Nominated Section of the JMC&#8217;s Joint Secretariat discusses the 
complaint addressed to the JMC against the NDF for the Castillo case, and argues, <i>inter alia</i>, 
&#8220;The news report mentions the death bed declaration of the victim before she succumbed from 
her wounds, identifying her assailants before media practitioners who got her statement on tape.  
This can easily be verified by an impartial investigation of the incident. . . . Without taking into 
account the death bed declaration of the victim that here assailants were members of the 502nd 
Infantry Brigade of the Philippine Army, the police had closed the investigation.&#8221;  (&#8220;The Lies of 
GRP Officials on Extrajudicial Killings: Study by NDFP MC-JS of Twenty-Three (23) 
Complaints for Extrajudicial Killings Submitted to the GRP-NDFP Joint Monitoring Committee 
(JMC) that President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Task Force Usig and General Hermogenes 
Esperon are Blaming on the NDFP&#8221; (NDFP Human Rights Committee, 19 February 2007)). 
</p>
<p>54. I would consider the cases of Alice Omengan-Claver, Rafael Bangit, and Madonna 
Castillo y Lucban to all fall within the Task Force Usig&#8217;s mandate and to all be in need of further 
investigation. </p>

<p><b>PROGRAMME OF THE VISIT 
</b></p>
<p>1. I visited the Philippines upon the invitation of the Government from 12 to 21 February 
</p><p>2007.  Most of my visit was spent in Manila, Baguio, and Davao.   
</p>
<p>2. I met with President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the Executive Secretary, and members of 
her cabinet, including the Secretaries of Justice, Defense, and Foreign Affairs.  I also met with 
the Undersecretary of the Department of the Interior and Local Government, the National 
Security Adviser, the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process, the Executive Director of the 
Presidential Human Rights Committee, and the chair and members of the Melo Commission 
(appointed by the President to investigate &#8220;media and activist killings&#8221;).  In most cases, I also 
met with members of their staff and of subordinate agencies, of which I can list only a few.   
</p>
<p>3. From the Philippine National Police (PNP), I met the commander in charge of Task Force 
Usig, the group overseeing investigation into killings of leftist activists and journalists, the Police 
Chief Superintendent, the Inspector General (head of the Internal Affairs Service), the Davao 
District PNP chief, and regional heads of Task Force Usig in Baguio and Davao.  From the 
Department of Justice (DOJ), I met the Chief State Prosecutor, the City Prosecutors of Baguio 
and Davao, the head of the witness protection program in Baguio, the head of the National 
Bureau of Investigation (NBI), the head of the NBI in Baguio, and the deputy head of the NBI in 
Davao.  From the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), I met the Chief of Staff, numerous 
senior staff officers, and local and regional commanders in Baguio and Davao.  I also met with 
the Mayor of Davao, Rodrigo Duterte. 
</p>
<p>4. I met with key persons from other branches of the Government, including the Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court, Reynato Puno, the Chair of the Senate Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights, Juan Ponce Enrile, and with the Chair and six members of the House Committee 
on Human Rights.  I met with the Chair of the Commission on Human Rights (CHRP), 
Purificacion Quisumbing, and two other commissioners as well as staff from the regional offices 
in Baguio and Davao.  I met with the Ombudsman, Merceditas Gutierrez, and two deputy 
Ombudsmen. 
</p>
<p>5. In terms of the various peace processes, I met with the Presidential Adviser on the Peace 
Process, his deputy and staff, members of the Government Panel for negotiations with the 
National Democratic Front (NDF), the secretariat of the NDF-nominated section in the Joint 
Monitoring Committee (JMC), the Secretary-General and the Vice-Chairman of the Moro 
National Liberation Front (MNLF), and the head of the secretariat of the Moro Islamic 
Liberation Front (MILF) Coordinating Committee on the Cessation of Hostilities (CCCH).  I also 
met with the Head of Mission of the International Monitoring Team (IMT).  I was regrettably 
unable to expand my itinerary to accept the invitation of the National Democratic Front (NDF) to 
meet in Utrecht; however, I spoke by phone with the Chairperson of the NDFP Negotiating 
panel, Luis Jalandoni, and the NDFP Chief Political Consultant, Jose Maria Sison. 
</p>
<p>6. I met with numerous members of the diplomatic community. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.2 
page 65 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7. I spoke with members of a large number of civil society organizations representing 
diverse views.  These included organizations associated with both Karapatan and the Philippine 
Alliance of Human Rights Advocates (PAHRA), as well as the Free Legal Assistance Group 
(FLAG), Peace Advocates for Truth, Healing and Justice (PATH), among other human rights 
organizations.  I also spoke with trade unionists, and representatives of organizations devoted to 
the protection of journalists, and a range of other civil society organizations. 
</p><p>8. I interviewed witnesses to 57 incidents involving 96 extrajudicial executions.  (Some 
witnesses had seen the execution itself; others could attest to prior events, such as threats, or to 
subsequent responses by law enforcement authorities and others.)  I also spoke with witnesses to 
12 other incidents that did not involve extrajudicial executions.  I received case files regarding a 
total of 271 extrajudicial executions and a number of other incidents. 
9. To all the persons I met with I express my gratitude for the assistance offered. I am 
indebted to the United Nations Resident Coordinator, Nileema Noble, and the United Nations 
country team for so capably facilitating my visit.  I am also grateful to the civil society 
representatives who facilitated my interviews with victims and witnesses and who provided 
copious documentation and reports.  I am uncertain of the extent to which individuals and 
organizations would want attention drawn to the assistance that they provided, and I have 
accordingly erred on the side of discretion rather than offering credit.  Finally, I am most grateful 
for the full cooperation extended by the Government.  I was able to meet with all of the officials 
with whom I requested meetings, and my many requests for documents were met with prompt 
and sympathetic consideration.
