<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report of the independent expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to 
access to safe drinking water and sanitation is submitted to the Human Rights Council in 
accordance with Council resolution 7/22. As the independent expert only took up her mandate on 
1 November 2008, this report is preliminary in nature.  
</p>
<p> The report reviews the history leading up to the establishment of the mandate of the 
independent expert, and notes meetings already held with various stakeholders to discuss matters 
related to the mandate. In particular, the report explains that the independent expert intends to 
take a thematic approach to her mandate, focusing on different themes each year, with the first 
year concentrated on sanitation. She provides a brief overview of the problem of lack of access 
to sanitation, and its connection to other human rights violations. She announces her hope to hold 
two consultations in 2009, one focused on elaborating the normative content of human rights 
obligations related to access to sanitation, and one focused on developing criteria by which to 
identify good practices with regard to the human rights obligations related to water and 
sanitation. She indicates her desire to present a deeper analysis of the issues identified in this 
report in her next report to the Human Rights Council.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its decision 2/104 on human rights and access to water, the Human Rights Council 
requested &#8220;the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, taking into 
account the views of States and other stakeholders, to conduct, within existing resources, a 
detailed study on the scope and content of the relevant human rights obligations related to 
equitable access to safe drinking water and sanitation under international human rights 
instruments, which includes relevant conclusions and recommendations thereon, to be submitted 
prior to the sixth session of the Council&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>2. As part of the consultation process, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR) sought written submissions from various stakeholders. Over 
90 responses were received from States, intergovernmental organizations, local governments, 
national human rights institutions (NHRIs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the 
business sector, universities and individuals. These contributions included responses to the 
OHCHR questionnaire, along with publications, articles and books. The United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights presented the study (A/HRC/6/3) to the Human Rights 
Council at its sixth session in September 2007. 
</p>
<p>3. In the study, the former High Commissioner expressed her belief &#8220;that it is now time to 
consider access to safe drinking water and sanitation as a human right, defined as the right to 
equal and non-discriminatory access to a sufficient amount of safe drinking water for personal 
and domestic uses - drinking, personal sanitation, washing of clothes, food preparation and 
personal and household hygiene - to sustain life and health&#8221;.<b>1</b> The High Commissioner also 
declared that &#8220;States should prioritize these personal and domestic uses over other water uses 
and should take steps to ensure that this sufficient amount is of good quality, affordable for all 
and can be collected within a reasonable distance from a person&#8217;s home.&#8221;<b>2 </b> 
</p>
<p>4. The High Commissioner also noted that, inter alia, &#8220;detailed practical advice is required 
on: the normative content of human rights obligations in relation to access to sanitation; the 
human rights obligations attached to the elaboration of a national strategy on water and 
sanitation; the regulation of the private sector in the context of private provision of safe drinking 
water and sanitation; criteria to protect the right to safe drinking water and sanitation in case of 
disconnection; and the specific obligations of local authorities&#8221;.<b>3 </b>The study also called for 
continued debate on several issues, including &#8220;whether access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation is a self-standing right or is derived from other human rights; the prioritization among 
various water uses; interaction with other areas of international law, including trade and 
investment law&#8221;.<b>4 </b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>5. In the final part of the study, the High Commissioner encouraged the &#8220;Human Rights 
Council to continue its consideration of human rights obligations in relation to access to safe 
drinking water and sanitation &#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;States, intergovernmental organizations, national human 
rights institutions, civil society and business enterprises to identify good practices in the field of 
safe drinking water, sanitation and human rights and make them available to the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.&#8221;<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>6. In March 2008, the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 7/22 adopted without a vote, 
decided to appoint an independent expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to 
access to safe drinking water and sanitation. At its ninth session in September 2008, the Council 
appointed Catarina de Albuquerque as independent expert, for a period of three years. 
Ms. de Albuquerque took up her mandate on 1 November 2008 and has since then engaged in 
different consultations with various stakeholders in order to define her priorities and organize her 
work.  
</p>
<p><b>I.  THE MANDATE OF THE INDEPENDENT EXPERT 
</b></p>
<p>7. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 7/22, the activities of the independent expert 
will focus on the following: 
</p>
<p> (a) Firstly, on developing a dialogue with Governments, the relevant United Nations 
bodies, the private sector, local authorities, national human rights institutions, civil society 
organizations and academic institutions, to identify, promote and exchange views on best 
practices related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and, in that regard, to prepare a 
compendium of best practices;  
</p>
<p> (b) Secondly, on advancing the work by undertaking a study, in cooperation with and 
reflecting the views of Governments and relevant United Nations bodies, and in further 
cooperation with the private sector, local authorities, national human rights institutions, civil 
society organizations and academic institutions, on the further clarification of the content of 
human rights obligations, including non-discrimination obligations, in relation to access to safe 
drinking water and sanitation;  
</p>
<p> (c) Thirdly, on making recommendations that could help the realization of the 
Millennium Development Goals, in particular of Goal 7.<b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>8. The resolution also requests the independent expert to apply a gender perspective to her 
work, including through the identification of gender-specific vulnerabilities, as well as to work in 
close coordination with other special procedures and subsidiary organs of the Council, relevant 
United Nations bodies and the treaty bodies, and taking into account the views of other 
stakeholders, including relevant regional human rights mechanisms, national human rights 
institutions, civil society organizations and academic institutions. 
</p>
<p>

</b>  See para. 2 of the resolution. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>II. COOPERATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND  
RELEVANT PARTNERS 
</b></p>
<p>9. Within the limited time available between taking up office and the need to submit this 
preliminary report, the independent expert has consulted different stakeholders as widely as 
possible. On a preliminary and informal basis, she has discussed her mandate with some States. 
She has also had preliminary and informal discussions with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF) in both Geneva and New York, the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP), the United Nations Secretary-General&#8217;s Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation 
(UNSGAB), UN-Water and OHCHR. She also had the occasion to meet with the Senior 
Adviser to the President of the General Assembly on water issues and her team in New York, in 
addition to holding discussions with some non-governmental organizations, national 
human rights institutions and academic institutions that are working in the area of water and 
sanitation.  
</p>
<p>10. The independent expert has also had informal meetings with members, including 
chairpersons, of various treaty bodies, and she hopes to be able to meet officially with the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights at its upcoming session in May 2009 in 
order to discuss her mandate and potential collaboration. She has also met some of the other 
special procedures mandate holders, and envisages much cooperation with them in her future 
work.  
</p>
<p>11. The independent expert met with and greatly appreciated the support and encouragement 
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and her staff concerning her mandate and 
programmed activities.  
</p>
<p>12. In 2008, the independent expert attended two meetings on the subject matter of her 
mandate: one in Berlin, organized by the Federal Foreign Office and one in Oslo, organized 
jointly by Oslo University, Oxford University and UNDP. On these occasions she had the chance 
to meet with many key actors working on water and sanitation. Since taking up her mandate, the 
independent expert has also attended, or been represented at, various NGO meetings to present 
her mandate and explore deeper cooperation.  
</p>
<p>13. The independent expert is very grateful to all those with whom she has met. She notes a 
momentous and important interest in the areas covered by her mandate and hopes that in the 
years to come she will be able - as time and resources permit - to enhance consultations and 
develop a true cooperation with all stakeholders working on subjects related to her mandate. She 
is also inspired by the work, commitment and dedication of many of the States, individuals and 
organizations she has met with concerning the subject matter of her mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>14. The OHCHR study concluded that the increasing references to water in human rights 
instruments as a component of other human rights reflects the growing importance of the human </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>rights dimensions of this matter for the international community. As mentioned above, the 
High Commissioner has suggested that it is time &#8220;to consider access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation as a human right&#8221;.<b>7</b>  
</p>
<p>15. In 2002, five years before the High Commissioner&#8217;s study was conducted, the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued general comment No. 15 (2002) on the right to 
water (arts. 11 and 12 of the Covenant), which is defined therein as &#8220;the right of everyone to 
sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic 
uses&#8221;.<b>8 </b>According to the Committee, the right to water is consecrated in article 11 of the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights &#8220;implicitly&#8221;, since that 
provision uses an open formulation as it guarantees the &#8220;right of everyone to an adequate 
standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and 
to the continuous improvement of living conditions&#8221;.<b>9 </b>The word &#8220;including&#8221; would mean, 
according to the Committee, that the catalogue of rights contained in article 11 was not intended 
to be exhaustive. To justify this assertion, the Committee remarks that &#8220;the right to water clearly 
falls within the category of guarantees essential for securing an adequate standard of living, 
particularly since it is one of the most fundamental conditions for survival&#8221;.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>16. Other binding international human rights instruments refer to access to safe drinking water 
and sanitation explicitly, as for example the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and International Labour Organization Convention 
(ILO) No. 161 (1985) concerning Occupational Health Services. At the regional level, the 
African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the Protocol to the African Charter 
on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa include specific provisions on 
access to water. International humanitarian law, particularly the Geneva Conventions of 
12 August 1949, also refers to the obligation to provide drinking water for prisoners of war and 
internees. Moreover, in Additional Protocols I and II to the Geneva Conventions it is prohibited, 
both in international and non-international armed conflict, &#8220;to attack, destroy, remove or render 
useless for that purpose, objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such 
as &#8230; drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works&#8221;.<b>11</b>

<p>  Additional Protocol I, art. 54, para. 2, Additional Protocol II, art. 14. Para. 3 of art. 54 of 
Protocol I entails some exceptions to the said rule.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>17. Moreover, declarations and resolutions by the United Nations and other organizations 
recognize safe drinking water and sanitation as a human right, as for example the 1977 Mar del 
Plata Action Plan of the United Nations Water Conference, the 1992 Dublin Statement on Water 
and Sustainable Development adopted at the International Conference on Water and the 
Environment, the 1994 Programme of Action adopted by the United Nations International 
Conference on Population and Development and the 1996 Istanbul Declaration on Human 
Settlements of the Habitat Agenda agreed at the Habitat II conference. Additionally, other 
General Assembly and Commission on Human Rights resolutions<b>12</b> refer to clean water as a 
human right and the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights 
adopted guidelines for the realization of the right to drinking water and sanitation in 
resolution 2006/10.<b>13</b> Groups of States have also declared their recognition of the right to water 
and sanitation in other forums. For example, the members of the Non-Aligned Movement at their 
fourteenth summit acknowledged the right to water for all;<b>14</b> Asian States at the first Asia-Pacific 
Water Summit recognized the &#8220;right to safe drinking water and basic sanitation as a basic human 
right&#8221;;<b>15</b> and at the Third South Asian Conference on Sanitation (SACOSAN), delegations from 
the region recognized that &#8220;access to sanitation and safe drinking water is a basic right&#8221;.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>18. A right to water and, in some cases, sanitation has also been recognized in several national 
legal systems, including Algeria, Belgium, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, France, 
South Africa, Uganda, Ukraine and Uruguay. 
</p>
<p>19. However, the recognition of water as a human right in declarations and resolutions has 
been irregular. Several States have not yet recognized a human right to water and sanitation 
either at the national or international levels, having rather defended the need to further explore 
the connections between human rights obligations and water and sanitation, rather than debating 
whether a human right to water and sanitation exists.  
</p>
<p>20. In this regard, the focus of the Human Rights Council resolutions has been on the links 
between access to water and sanitation and human rights, and indeed resolution 7/22 recognized 
a need for further study to clarify the content of human rights obligation in relation to safe 
drinking water and sanitation. The independent expert was specifically asked to work on this 
topic.

</p>
<p><b>IV.  SUBSTANTIVE PRIORITIES FOR THE FIRST YEAR:  SANITATION 
</b></p>
<p>21. Given the multitude of tasks, the broad mandate, the fact that it is newly created, and also 
since it covers more than one issue - namely both water and sanitation - the independent expert 
decided to take a thematic approach to the tasks ahead. This means that she will not address all 
subjects simultaneously, but rather intends to focus on a different subject each year. The 
conclusions of the OHCHR study provide an initial basis for identifying themes that need further 
study under the mandate. During the first year of her mandate the independent expert plans to 
pay special attention to sanitation, namely to the normative content of human rights obligations 
in relation to access to sanitation.  
</p>
<p>22. Sanitation has been identified in a poll of over 11,000 participants, organized by the British 
Medical Journal (BMJ), as the most important medical breakthrough since 1840 (the year the 
first issue of the journal appeared) - beating antibiotics, vaccines, anaesthesia and the discovery 
of the DNA structure. However, according to United Nations agencies, access to improved 
sanitation remains a promise unfulfilled for nearly 40 per cent of the world&#8217;s population 
(c. 2.5 billion).<b>17</b> Globally, it is estimated that 1.6 million people die each year from water and 
sanitation-related causes<b>18 </b>- the vast majority of those affected being children under 5. 
Tragically, as of 2006, 23 per cent of the world&#8217;s population still had no access to any sanitation 
and practised open defecation.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>23. Improved sanitation which ensures separation of waste from human contact is important as 
open defecation jeopardizes the health of the whole community, resulting in increased diarrhoeal 
diseases, including cholera, as well as worm infestations and hepatitis. Almost 50 per cent of all 
people in developing countries are suffering at any given time from a health problem caused by a 
lack of water and sanitation.<b>20</b> According to the World Health Organization (WHO), access to 
improved sanitation results in a 32 per cent reduction of diarrhoeal diseases.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>17
</b>  Estimates vary between 2.4 and 2.6 billion as to the number of people without access to basic 
</p>
<p>sanitation. See United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization 
(WHO) Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation, 2008 report, p. 7, 
available at http://www.wssinfo.org/en/40_MDG2008.html. See also p. 6 for a definition of 
improved sanitation.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>24. In addition, improved access to sanitation would increase school attendance, especially for 
girls, and help schoolchildren to learn better. It is estimated that lack of access to water and 
sanitation results in 443 million lost school days each year because of water-related illnesses.<b>22</b> 
In addition, girls can be prevented from attending school because of a lack of toilets (or of 
girls-only toilets).<b>23</b>  
</p>
<p>25. Addressing issues related to water and sanitation could also have a major effect on the 
economies of many countries. Treating diarrhoea-related diseases costs an estimated 12 per cent 
of national health budgets in sub-Saharan Africa.<b>24</b> There is also compelling evidence that 
sanitation, as a public health intervention, brings a significant return on investment.<b>25 
</b>Unsurprisingly, it is the poorest and most marginalized groups who suffer from the worst 
sanitation conditions. With widespread disease and illness, worker productivity is drastically 
reduced. Likewise health risks and epidemics from waterborne diseases can greatly reduce 
tourism and agricultural exports, with the associated economic costs much greater than the cost 
of investments in water supply and sanitation to address the problems.<b>26 </b>In total, the potential 
economic benefits of investing in water and sanitation are estimated at around US$ 38 billion per 
year.<b>27 </b> 
</p>
<p>26. Despite the benefits of ensuring access to sanitation, it remains the most neglected and 
most off-track of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets. According to estimates

<p>  According to UNICEF &#8220;Many girls drop out of school at the onset of menstruation, which 
makes them particularly vulnerable when there are no separate toilets.&#8221; See <i>The State of the

<p>  For example according to a study published by WHO, &#8220;The cost-benefit ratio of water and

and US$ 11 economic benefit per US$ 1 invested for most developing world sub-regions and for 
most interventions.&#8221; See G. Hutton and L. Haller, <i>Evaluation of the Costs and Benefits of Water

 <p> 
</p>
<p>from 2008, meeting the Millennium Development target for sanitation requires ensuring access 
to improved sanitation for 1.4 billion people by 2015, or on average 173 million people per 
year.<b>28 </b>Although there has been increased access to improved sanitation, WHO and UNICEF 
estimate that if current trends continue, the total number of people without access to improved 
sanitation will only have decreased slightly by 2015 - to 2.4 billion people.<b>29 </b>Even though these 
observations are extremely concerning, States and the international community have not done 
enough to respond. For example, according to the 2008 UN-Water Global Annual Assessment of 
Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS), external development assistance for sanitation 
comprises only 37 per cent of the total aid to the sanitation and drinking-water sectors 
combined.<b>30 </b>As of now, the global sanitation crisis has not yet been able to galvanize concerted 
national and international action.<b>31 </b>Sanitation has, in fact, historically been viewed as a lower 
priority than water supply and has attracted less investment.  
</p>
<p>27. Similarly, although the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights offers 
comprehensive guidance on the interpretation and understanding of the right to water in its 
general comment No. 15, relatively less attention was paid to sanitation. General comment 
No. 15 recognizes that &#8220;ensuring that everyone has access to adequate sanitation is not only 
fundamental for human dignity and privacy, but is one of the principal mechanisms for 
protecting the quality of drinking water supplies and resources&#8221;.<b>32</b> However, the general 
comment is focused on the right to water and, notably, not the right to water and sanitation. 
Besides the fact that less interest has been paid to sanitation generally, there has also been little 
exploration of the human rights obligations related to sanitation. 
</p>
<p>28. When the independent expert took up her mandate in 2008, it was the International Year of 
Sanitation. Numerous initiatives have been undertaken in celebration of this year. For example, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

</b>  See footnote 17 above, p. 8.

<p><b>29
</b>  Ibid. While the number of people without access to sanitation is decreasing, if taken as a 
</p>
<p>percentage of the total world population, the decrease in absolute numbers of people without 
access is less pronounced due to population growth. See E/CN.17/2004/5, para. 10.

Report - Testing a New Reporting Approach</i>, p. 26.

</b></p>
<p>  One of the reasons for this resides in the fact that the benefits of sanitation accrue to the wider 
community &#8220;owing to reduced risk of transmission of infectious and parasitic diseases, more 
than to the individual. This contrasts with safe drinking water supply, whose benefits are mostly 
captured by the individual user ... As a result, individuals are more likely to invest in, or demand 
public investment in, drinking water than in sanitation. Reflecting this demand, Governments in 
developing countries tend to invest more heavily in water supply than in sanitation.&#8221;

<p>regional ministerial conferences have been held on issues related to sanitation<b>33</b> and specific 
fund-raising efforts have focused on providing resources to targeted sanitation programmes.<b>34 
</b>Local initiatives have also been launched to raise awareness about issues related to sanitation and 
hygiene.<b>35 </b>More broadly, and even before the International Year of Sanitation, international 
efforts have been organized, such as the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All (WASH) 
campaign, which have placed an emphasis on children and youth and gender-sensitive hygiene 
education. Also on 15 October 2008, Global Handwashing Day was celebrated in over 
70 countries with initiatives aimed at making handwashing with soap before eating and after 
using the toilet into a life-saving habit. 
</p>
<p>29. However, despite these laudable activities and initiatives in the past year, the subject 
matter still suffers from little attention and less investment, when compared with the associated 
area of water, which itself still receives insufficient overall attention.  
</p>
<p>30. The independent expert considers it crucial to explore and identify the human rights 
obligations regarding sanitation. Human rights law offers a framework by which duty bearers 
may better understand their obligations and rights holders may be able to better claim their 
rights. In fact, sanitation can be related to human rights in at least three different ways. First, the 
enjoyment of a large number of human rights - civil, cultural, economic, political and social - 
hinges on access to sanitation. Secondly, lack of access to sanitation is frequently a consequence 
of larger societal discrimination, inequality and exclusion, fundamentally inconsistent with 
human rights protection. Thirdly, and more fundamentally, lack of access to sanitation 
constitutes, in itself, a serious human rights concern, as it relates to the inherent dignity of the 
human being. Sanitation is undoubtedly a matter of human rights and it is the link between the 
two that the independent expert wishes to further explore, in accordance with her mandate, in the 
course of 2009. 
</p>
<p>31. Although lack of access to sanitation is at the origin of the non-realization of basic human 
rights, the area of sanitation has not been adequately analysed from a human rights perspective.

</b>  For example, regional sanitation conferences have been held, such as the Third South Asian 
</p>

<p>  For instance, the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council launched the Global 
Sanitation Fund - the first global mechanism for financing sanitation.

</p>
<p>Cultural barriers and the taboo nature of the topic are a serious challenge to examining 
sanitation. As was stated by the Chairman of the United Nations Secretary-General&#8217;s Advisory 
Board on Water and Sanitation (UNSGAB), &#8220;it is time to break through the taboo, to call a spade 
a spade or a toilet a toilet and start doing something about this unacceptable killer&#8221;.<b>36</b> The 
international community cannot shy away from this subject simply because it is uncomfortable, 
unmentionable, unpopular, or just because it is a very private matter that can be challenging to 
consider publicly. Sanitation and the human rights obligations concerning this subject must in 
fact be addressed in a direct and open manner. The independent expert hopes to contribute to this 
endeavour.  
</p>
<p>32. In carrying out her mandate, the independent expert will work towards clarifying the 
content of human rights obligations regarding access to sanitation. In this regard, she plans to 
organize a consultation on this subject in 2009. 
</p><p>33. This particular focus on sanitation during the first year of her mandate, does not mean that 
the independent expert will disregard water during that period of time - there are inextricable 
links between the two, and public policies for water and sanitation have to be seen as part of an 
integrated strategy. In fact, clean drinking water supplies cannot be secured without adequate 
attention to sanitation, since human excreta remains one of the most serious sources of drinking 
water contamination. The absence of adequate sanitation leads to the extensive pollution of water 
sources that communities depend on for survival. Thus, it is impossible to consider one without 
the other.  
</p>
<p><b>V. METHODOLOGY CONCERNING PRIORITIES IN ACTIVITIES  
DURING THE FIRST YEAR:  BEST PRACTICES 
</b></p>
<p>34. As called for in the resolution establishing her mandate, the independent expert will 
particularly examine best practices. During the first year, she wishes to elaborate a methodology, 
focused on developing criteria or prerequisites that will enable her to classify a practice as a 
&#8220;good practice&#8221;.<b>37</b> In order to report on this, resources permitting, the independent expert wishes 
to organize an expert consultation on criteria for identifying good practices, in order to ensure an 
early exchange of views, experiences and opinions.  
</p>
<p>35. Additionally, in the course of 2009, the independent expert plans to organize a mission to 
New York in order to help her formulate the recommendations she will submit regarding the 
realization of the MDGs. She is equally planning two country missions for 2009, which will 
allow her to gather practical and concrete information concerning the priorities identified, as well 
as the full range of issues covered by her mandate.

</p>
<p><b>37
</b>  Although the resolution refers to &#8220;best practices&#8221;, it is the opinion of the independent expert 
</p>
<p>that rarely can a practice be qualified as best and that the concept of good practices is preferable.  </p>

<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>36. <b>The present report has outlined some of the thematic priorities for the independent 
expert for her first year. She will present a more comprehensive report to the Human 
Rights Council in accordance with its annual programme of work. Her first substantive 
report will examine the matters outlined above in more depth. She welcomes comments 
and reactions to the present report and looks forward to working with all stakeholders to 
advance the discussion on the human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking 
water and sanitation.
