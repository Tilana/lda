<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution S-12/1 B of 16 October 2009, the Human Rights Council endorsed 
the recommendations contained in the report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission 
on the Gaza Conflict (hereinafter the &#8220;Mission&#8221;),1 called upon all concerned parties, 
including United Nations bodies, to ensure their implementation in accordance with their 
respective mandates, recommended to the General Assembly that it consider the report 
during the main part of its sixty-fourth session, and requested the Secretary-General to 
submit to the Council, at its thirteenth session, a report on the status of the implementation 
of those recommendations. The present report is submitted pursuant to that request. The 
information it contains has been requested and received from States, organizations and 
other entities to which the Mission addressed its recommendations, as well as being 
gathered directly by the United Nations from relevant sources.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Status of the implementation of the recommendations of the 
Mission report  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Action by the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>2. In paragraph 1968 of its report, the Mission addressed five recommendations to the 
Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>3. In paragraph 1968 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;the United 
Nations Human Rights Council should endorse the recommendations contained in this 
report, take appropriate action to implement them as recommended by the Mission and 
through other means as it may deem appropriate, and continue to review their 
implementation in future sessions&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>4. In paragraph 3 of its resolution S-12/1 B, the Human Rights Council endorsed the 
recommendations contained in the Mission&#8217;s report and called on all concerned parties, 
including United Nations bodies, to ensure their implementation in accordance with their 
respective mandates. In paragraph 4 of its resolution S-12/1 C, the Human Rights Council 
decided to follow up on the implementation, inter alia, of Section B of that resolution as its 
thirteenth session. 
</p>
<p>5. In paragraph 1968 (b) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;in view of the 
gravity of the violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and possible 
war crimes and crimes against humanity that it has reported . . . the United Nations Human 
Rights Council should request the United Nations Secretary-General to bring this report to 
the attention of the United Nations Security Council under Article 99 of the Charter of the 
United Nations so that the Security Council may consider action according to the Mission&#8217;s 
relevant recommendations below&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>6. In its resolution S-12/1 B, the Human Rights Council did not direct any specific 
request to the Secretary-General to bring the Mission&#8217;s report to the attention of the 
Security Council under Article 99 of the Charter. At the same time, in paragraph 3 of that 
resolution, the Human Rights Council endorsed the recommendations of the Mission.  
</p>
<p>  
 1 A/HRC/12/48. </p>


<p>7. In paragraph 1968 (c) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;the United 
Nations Human Rights Council should formally submit this report to the Prosecutor of the 
International Criminal Court&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>8. Further to paragraph 3 of Human Rights Council resolution S-12/1 B, the report of 
the Mission was transmitted by the Council secretariat to the Prosecutor of the International 
Criminal Court on 10 December 2009. 
</p>
<p>9. In paragraph 1968 (d) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;the Human 
Rights Council should submit this report to the General Assembly with a request that it 
should be considered&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>10. In paragraph 4 of its resolution S-12/1 B, the Human Rights Council 
&#8220;recommend[ed] that the General Assembly consider the report of the [Mission], during the 
main part of its sixty-fourth session&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>11. In paragraph 1968 (e) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;the Human 
Rights Council should bring the Mission&#8217;s recommendations to the attention of the relevant 
United Nations human rights treaty bodies so that they may include review of progress in 
their implementation, as may be relevant to their mandate and procedures, in their periodic 
review of compliance by Israel with its human rights obligations. The Mission further 
recommends that the Human Rights Council should consider review of progress as part of 
its universal periodic review process&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>12. The Mission&#8217;s report was transmitted to the United Nations treaty bodies that 
monitor compliance by the State of Israel with the human rights treaties to which it is party2 
on 10 December 2009.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Action by the Security Council 
</b></p>
<p>13. In paragraph 1969 of its report, the Mission addressed a total of six 
recommendations to the Security Council.  
</p>
<p>14. In paragraph 1969 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended that that the &#8220;Security 
Council should require the Government of Israel, under Article 40 of the Charter of the 
United Nations: (i) To take all appropriate steps, within a period of three months, to launch 
appropriate investigations that are independent and in conformity with international 
standards, into the serious violations of international humanitarian and international human 
rights law reported by the Mission and any other serious allegations that might come to its 
attention; and (ii) To inform the Security Council, within a further period of three months, 
of actions taken, or in process of being taken, by the Government of Israel to inquire into, 
investigate and prosecute such serious violations&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>15. To date, the Security Council has not directed such a request to the Government of 
Israel. 
</p>
<p>16. In paragraph 1969 (b) of its report, the Mission further recommended that the 
&#8220;Security Council should at the same time establish an independent committee of experts in 
international humanitarian and human rights law to monitor and report on any domestic 
legal or other proceedings undertaken by the Government of Israel in relation to the 
aforesaid investigations. Such committee of experts should report at the end of the six-
</p>
<p>  
 2 The Human Rights Committee, Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Committee on 
</p>
<p>the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against 
Women, Committee Against Torture and Committee on the Rights of the Child. </p>


<p>month period to the Security Council on its assessment of relevant domestic proceedings 
initiated by the Government of Israel, including their progress, effectiveness and 
genuineness, so that the Security Council may assess whether appropriate action to ensure 
justice for victims and accountability for perpetrators has been or is being taken at the 
domestic level. The Security Council should request the committee to report to it at 
determined intervals, as may be necessary. The committee should be appropriately 
supported by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>17. To date, the Security Council has not established such a committee. 
</p>
<p>18. In paragraph 1969 (d) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;the Security 
Council should require the independent committee of experts referred to in [paragraph 1969 
(b)] to monitor and report on any domestic legal or other proceedings undertaken by the 
relevant authorities in the Gaza Strip in relation to the aforesaid investigations. The 
committee should report at the end of the six-month period to the Security Council on its 
assessment of relevant domestic proceedings initiated by the relevant authorities in Gaza, 
including their progress, effectiveness and genuineness, so that the Security Council may 
assess whether appropriate action to ensure justice for victims and accountability for 
perpetrators has been taken or is being taken at the domestic level. The Security Council 
should request the committee to report to it at determined intervals, as may be necessary&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>19. In paragraphs 1969 (c) and (e) of its report, the Mission further recommended that 
&#8220;upon receipt of the committee&#8217;s report, the Security Council should consider the situation 
and, in the absence of good-faith investigations that are independent and in conformity with 
international standards having been undertaken or being under way within six months of the 
date of its resolution under Article 40&#8221; by the appropriate authorities of the State of Israel 
or the relevant authorities in Gaza, respectively, &#8220;acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of 
the United Nations, refer the situation in Gaza to the Prosecutor of the International 
Criminal Court pursuant to article 13 (b) of the Rome Statute&#8221; of the International Criminal 
Court. In paragraph 1969 (f) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;lack of 
cooperation by the Government of Israel or the Gaza authorities with the work of the 
committee should be regarded by the Security Council to be obstruction of the work of the 
committee&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>20. As the Security Council has not established an independent committee of experts, 
none of these recommended actions have been carried out.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Action by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court 
</b></p>
<p>21. In paragraph 1970 of its report, the Mission stated that, &#8220;with reference to the 
declaration under article 12 (3) [of the Rome Statute] received by the Office of the 
Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court from the Government of Palestine, [it] 
considers that accountability for victims and the interests of peace and justice in the region 
require that the Prosecutor should make the required legal determination as expeditiously as 
possible&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>22. By a letter dated 12 January 2010 addressed to the Deputy High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court stated that 
the Prosecutor had not, as of that date, made a determination whether, in his view, the 
International Criminal Court has jurisdiction in respect of any crimes referred to in article 5 
of the Rome Statute that may have been committed in the Gaza Strip between December 
2008 and January 2009. The Office of the Prosecutor additionally noted in its letter that the </p>


<p>Prosecutor had not yet made a determination whether, in his view, any cases relating to 
such crimes would be admissible before the Court.3 
</p>
<p><b> D. Action by the General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>23. In paragraph 1971 of its report, the Mission addressed four recommendations to the 
General Assembly.  
</p>
<p>24. In paragraph 1971 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;the General 
Assembly should request the Security Council to report to it on measures taken with regard 
to ensuring accountability for serious violations of international humanitarian law and 
human rights in relation to the facts in this report and any other relevant facts in the context 
of the military operations in Gaza, including the implementation of the Mission&#8217;s 
recommendations. The General Assembly may remain appraised of the matter until it is 
satisfied that appropriate action is taken at the domestic or international level in order to 
ensure justice for victims and accountability for perpetrators. The General Assembly may 
consider whether additional action within its powers is required in the interests of justice, 
including under its resolution 377 (V) on uniting for peace&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>25. To date, the General Assembly has not directed such a request to the Security 
Council.  
</p>
<p>26. In paragraph 1971 (b) of its report, the Mission recommended to the General 
Assembly that it &#8220;should establish an escrow fund to be used to pay adequate compensation 
to Palestinians who have suffered loss and damage as a result of unlawful acts attributable 
to Israel during the December-January military operation and actions in connection with it, 
and that the Government of Israel should pay the required amounts into such fund. The 
Mission further recommends that the General Assembly should ask the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide expert advice on the appropriate 
modalities to establish the escrow fund&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>27. To date, the General Assembly has not established such a fund. 
</p>
<p>28. In paragraph 1971 (c) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;the General 
Assembly should ask the Government of Switzerland to convene a conference of the high 
contracting parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 on measures to enforce the 
Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and to ensure its respect in accordance 
with its article 1&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>29. In paragraph 5 of its resolution 64/10 of 5 November 2009, the General Assembly 
&#8220;recommend[ed] that the Government of Switzerland, in its capacity as depository of the 
Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, 
undertake as soon as possible the necessary steps to reconvene a Conference of High 
Contracting parties to the Fourth Geneva Conventions on measures to enforce the 
Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to ensure 
its respect in accordance with common article 1&#8221;. In a subsequent communication to the 
Secretary-General, the Government of Switzerland provided an update on the preliminary 
consultations it had undertaken to this end.4

</p>
<p> 4 A/64/651, Annex III. </p>


<p>30. In paragraph 1971 (d) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;the General 
Assembly should promote an urgent discussion on the future legality of the use of certain 
munitions referred to in this report, and in particular white phosphorous, flechettes and 
heavy metal such as tungsten. In such discussion the General Assembly should draw inter 
alia on the expertise of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The Mission 
further recommend[ed] that the Government of Israel should undertake a moratorium on the 
use of such weapons in the light of the human suffering and damage they have caused in the 
Gaza Strip&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>31. To date, the General Assembly has not taken action to promote such a discussion.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Action by the State of Israel 
</b></p>
<p>32. In paragraph 1972 of its report, the Mission addressed a total of nine 
recommendations to the State of Israel. 
</p>
<p>33. In paragraph 1972 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended &#8220;that Israel should 
immediately cease the border closures and restrictions on passage through border crossings 
with the Gaza Strip and allow the passage of goods necessary and sufficient to meet the 
needs of the population, for the recovery and reconstruction of housing and essential 
services, and for the resumption of meaningful economic activity in the Gaza Strip&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>34. As of the date of this report, the policy of closures of Gaza remains in effect. The 
quantity and range of goods allowed into Gaza remain severely restricted, and the majority 
of material allowed in continues to be food and hygiene items (84 per cent of imports since 
October 2009). Material needed to commence reconstruction continues to be barred from 
entry, but some smaller-scale improvement has been noted. So, for example: outstanding 
shipments of spare parts for the Gaza Electricity Distribution Company have been allowed 
in between November 2009 and January 2010; 103 truckloads of glass have entered since 
29 December 2009, and the United Nations is now starting negotiations to allow for a 
second tranche of glass; construction material including cement, gravel and tar for the 
Northern Gaza Waste Water Treatment project was allowed entry in November 2009. The 
Government of Israel has also indicated that the transfer of educational supplies to the Gaza 
strip was facilitated on 11 November 2009.5 
</p>
<p>35. In paragraph 1972 (b) of its report, the Mission recommended &#8220;that Israel should 
cease the restrictions on access to the sea for fishing purposes imposed on the Gaza Strip 
and allow such fishing activities within the 20 nautical miles as provided for in the Oslo 
Accords. It further recommends that Israel should allow the resumption of agricultural 
activity within the Gaza Strip, including within areas in the vicinity of the borders with 
Israel&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>36. As of the date of this report, Israeli naval forces continue to prohibit Gazans access 
beyond three nautical miles from the shore and within a 300-metre-wide strip of land near 
the border fence.  
</p>
<p>37. In paragraph 1972 (c) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;Israel should 
initiate a review of the rules of engagement, standard operating procedures, open fire 
regulations and other guidance for military and security personnel. The Mission 
recommends that Israel should avail itself of the expertise of the International Committee of 
the Red Cross, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and 
</p>
<p>  
 5 Letter from the Permanent Mission of Israel to the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 16 
</p>
<p>November 2009. </p>


<p>other relevant bodies, and Israeli experts, civil society organizations with the relevant 
expertise and specialization, in order to ensure compliance in this respect with international 
humanitarian law and international human rights law. In particular such rules of 
engagement should ensure that the principles of proportionality, distinction, precaution and 
non-discrimination are effectively integrated in all such guidance and in any oral briefings 
provided to officers, soldiers and security forces, so as to avoid the recurrence of 
Palestinian civilian deaths, destruction and affronts on human dignity in violation of 
international law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>38. The Government of Israel has informed the United Nations that, on 20 January 2009, 
the Chief of General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ordered investigations into a 
range of allegations regarding the conduct of the IDF during the Gaza conflict. As a result 
of those investigations, the Chief of General Staff &#8220;ordered the IDF to implement lessons 
learned on a broad range of matters, directing that certain standing orders be highlighted or 
clarified, establishing further guidelines on the use of various munitions, and instructing 
that steps be taken to improve coordination with humanitarian organisations and entities&#8221;.6 
On 9 November 2009 the Government of Israel informed the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights that, on the basis of its investigations conducted to date, &#8220;significant 
measures are already being taken to implement the lessons learned and improve IDF&#8217;s 
operational activities. Among the measures is the formulation of revised procedures for the 
destruction of property and infrastructure for military purposes, as well as for the use of 
certain means of warfare&#8221;.7 The Government of Israel has not to date approached the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to avail itself of its 
expertise in connection with a review of rules of engagement, standard operating 
procedures, open fire regulations or other relevant guidance for military personnel.  
</p>
<p>39. In paragraph 1972 (d) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;Israel should 
allow freedom of movement for Palestinians within the Occupied Palestinian Territory &#8212; 
within the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, between the Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank, and between the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the outside world &#8212; in 
accordance with international human rights standards and international commitments 
entered into by Israel and the representatives of the Palestinian people. The Mission further 
recommend[ed] that Israel should forthwith lift travel bans currently placed on Palestinians 
by reason of their human rights or political activities&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>40. Freedom of movement of Palestinians within the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
remains highly limited. The Israeli policy of closures continues to prevent the free 
movement of people and goods into and out of Gaza. Within the West Bank, since October 
2009, the Israeli authorities continued to implement measures to increase freedom of 
movement of Palestinians between most Palestinian urban centres &#8212; excluding East 
Jerusalem &#8212; through the removal of some permanent obstacles and by allowing 
Palestinians to access roads previously reserved for Israelis.8 On the other hand, in January 
and February 2010 there was a significant increase in random, or so-called &#8220;flying&#8221;, 
checkpoints throughout the West Bank. In total, there were 550 obstacles to movement in 
</p>

 7 &#8220;Examination of allegations by Israel Defense Force,&#8221; annex to Letter from the Permanent Mission of 
</p>
<p>Israel to the High Commissioner, 9 November 2009. The High Commissioner for Human Rights 
requested further details on this by way of a letter dated 18 November 2009, but has yet to receive a 
reply. 
</p>
<p> 8 In this regard, see report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the 
implementation of Human Rights Council resolutions S-9/1 and S-12/1 (A/HRC/13/54, para. 7), 
which discusses the recent decision by the Israeli High Court of Justice that orders the IDF to allow 
Palestinian access to Route 443. </p>


<p>the West Bank as of February 2010 as compared to 592 in October 2009.9 Furthermore, 
many Palestinians engaged in human rights and political activities continue to face 
difficulties travelling between the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the outside world, 
since Israel has not lifted travel bans that are currently in place.  
</p>
<p>41. In paragraph 1972 (e) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;Israel should 
release Palestinians who are detained in Israeli prisons in connection with the occupation. 
The release of children should be an utmost priority. The Mission further recommends that 
Israel should cease the discriminatory treatment of Palestinian detainees. Family visits for 
prisoners from Gaza should resume&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>42. Recently obtained information indicates that approximately 6,800 Palestinians are 
being held in Israeli prisons, including approximately 300 children.10 Approximately 260 
persons are being held in administrative detention.11 The number of such detainees 
fluctuates regularly, and it is often not possible to ascertain the reason that a detainee has 
been released. Family visits for prisoners from Gaza still do not take place, following the 
suspension by Israeli authorities of the Family Visits Programme of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross on 4 June 2007. The Israeli High Court of Justice upheld the 
suspension of this programme in December 2009.12  
</p>
<p>43. In paragraph 1972 (f) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;Israel should 
forthwith cease interference with national political processes in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, and as a first step release all members of the Palestinian Legislative Council 
currently in detention and allow all members of the Council to move between Gaza and the 
West Bank so that it may resume functioning&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>44. On 1 and 2 November 2009 Israel released seven members of the Palestinian 
Legislative Council; all affiliated to Hamas, bringing the total of Palestine Legislative 
Council (PLC) members in Israel's custody to 16, including 13 from Hamas, 2 from Fatah 
and one from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). A small number of 
PLC members in the West Bank have been able to visit Gaza, but there has been no broad-
based facilitation of movement of PLC members between Gaza and the West Bank. 
</p>
<p>45. In paragraph 1972(g) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;the Government 
of Israel should cease actions aimed at limiting the expression of criticism by civil society 
and members of the public concerning Israel&#8217;s policies and conduct during the military 
operations in the Gaza Strip. The Mission also recommends that Israel should set up an 
independent inquiry to assess whether the treatment by Israeli judicial authorities of 
Palestinian and Jewish Israelis expressing dissent in connection with the offensive was 
discriminatory, in terms of both charges and detention pending trial. The results of the 
inquiry should be made public and, subject to the findings, appropriate remedial action 
should be taken&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>46. Human rights NGOs have reported that the Government of Israel has made efforts to 
decrease the financial support available to such organizations working in the Occupied 
</p>

at para. 8. </p>


<p>Palestinian Territory.13 As of the date of this report, Israel has not established an inquiry of 
the kind recommended by the Mission.  
</p>
<p>47. In paragraph 1972 (h) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;that the 
Government of Israel should refrain from any action of reprisal against Palestinian and 
Israeli individuals and organizations that have cooperated with the United Nations Fact 
Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, in particular individuals who have appeared at the 
public hearings held by the Mission in Gaza and Geneva and expressed criticism of actions 
by Israel&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>48. In an open letter to senior Israeli government officials, a group of Israeli NGOs 
warned of the increasing &#8220;delegitimization&#8221; of organizations that cooperated with the 
Mission,14 which has raised serious concerns among civil society organizations carrying out 
human rights work.15  
</p>
<p>49. In paragraph 1972 (i) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;Israel should 
reiterate its commitment to respecting the inviolability of United Nations premises and 
personnel and that it should undertake all appropriate measures to ensure that there is no 
repetition of violations in the future&#8221;. It further recommended that &#8220;reparations to the 
United Nations should be provided fully and without further delay, and that the General 
Assembly should consider this matter&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>50. As of the date of this report, the United Nations has not received any formal 
communication from the Government of Israel reiterating its commitment to respect the 
inviolability of United Nations premises and personnel.  
</p>
<p>51. In June and July 2009, the Secretary-General exchanged letters with the Foreign 
Minister of the Government of Israel regarding steps to improve coordination between the 
United Nations and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), so as to ensure that United Nations 
personnel, operations and premises are not put at risk in the event of any future military 
operations affecting Gaza. The United Nations has prepared a proposal to improve 
coordination for discussion with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
</p>
<p>52. In its resolution 64/89 of 10 December 2009, the General Assembly &#8220;deplor[ed] the 
extensive damage to and destruction of [United Nations Relief and Works Agency for 
Palestine Refugees in the Near East] facilities in the Gaza Strip caused during the military 
operations between December 2008 and January 2009, including to schools where civilians

<p>Government of Israel to speedily compensate [UNRWA] for damage and destruction to its 
property and facilities resulting from actions by the Israeli side, including as a result of the 
military operations in the Gaza Strip between December 2008 and January 2009&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>53. In August 2009, the United Nations submitted a claim to Israel for reimbursement 
for the losses that the Organization had sustained in seven incidents that had been 
investigated by the United Nations Headquarters Board of Inquiry into Certain Incidents 
that Occurred in Gaza Strip between 27 December 2008 and 19 January 2009 and for which 
the Board had found Israel responsible.16 In January 2010, the Government of Israel made a 
payment to the United Nations of $10.5 million in respect of the losses that the 
Organization had sustained in the incidents that were investigated by the Board of Inquiry. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Action by Palestinian armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>54. In paragraph 1973 of its report, the Mission addressed two recommendations to 
Palestinian Armed Groups. </p>
<p>55. In paragraph 1973 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;Palestinian 
armed groups should undertake forthwith to respect international humanitarian law, in 
particular by renouncing attacks on Israeli civilians and civilian objects, and take all 
feasible precautionary measures to avoid harm to Palestinian civilians during hostilities&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>56. Indiscriminate rocket and mortar attacks launched by Palestinian armed groups from 
Gaza continue to occur.17 OHCHR is unable to confirm whether Palestinian armed groups 
have taken &#8220;all feasible precautionary measures to avoid harm to Palestinian civilians 
during hostilities.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>57. In paragraph 1973(b) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;Palestinian 
armed groups who hold Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in detention should release him on 
humanitarian grounds. Pending such release they should recognize his status as prisoner of 
war, treat him as such, and allow him ICRC visits&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>58. At the time of writing, Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit remains in detention, without 
being recognized as a prisoner of war and without being allowed contact with the 
International Committee of the Red Cross.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Action by responsible Palestinian authorities 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Mission directed three recommendations to responsible Palestinian authorities 
in paragraph 1974 of its report.  </p>
<p>60. In paragraph 1974 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;the Palestinian 
Authority issue clear instructions to security forces under its command to abide by human 
rights norms as enshrined in the Palestinian Basic Law and international instruments, 
ensure prompt and independent investigations of all allegations of serious human rights 
violations by security forces under its control, and end resort to military justice to deal with 
cases involving civilians&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>  
 16 A/63/855&#8211;S/2009/250.  
 17 Letters from the Permanent Mission of Israel to the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 9 
</p>
<p>November 2009, 26 November 2009, 14 December 2009, 5 January 2010, and 12 January 2010. </p>


<p>61. The Minister of Interior of the Palestinian Authority has issued two decisions18 that 
instruct security forces, within the context of handling detainees, to abide by human rights 
norms, as enshrined in the Palestinian Basic Law and international instruments. OHCHR 
has not been able to confirm whether the Palestinian Authority has ended resort to military 
justice to deal with cases involving civilians. At the same time, the Palestinian Authority 
established a committee on 25 January 2010,19 which is mandated to follow up on the 
implementation of the Mission&#8217;s report in so far as it relates to the Palestinian Authority, 
and to undertake the investigative duties and responsibilities required of it by the Mission&#8217;s 
report.  
</p>
<p>62. In paragraph 1974 (b) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;the Palestinian 
Authority and the Gaza authorities should release without delay all political detainees 
currently in their power and refrain from further arrests on political grounds and in 
violation of international human rights law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>63. According to information provided to OHCHR, 523 detainees are being held in the 
West Bank for political reasons.20 OHCHR has received information that approximately 
100 prisoners were being held by the de facto Gaza authorities as of 1 December 2009 for 
political reasons.21 On 18 February it was reported that the de facto Gaza authorities had 
released 22 persons who were allegedly detained on political grounds.22 The Palestinian 
Authority and the de facto Gaza authorities both publicly claim that detainees and prisoners 
are not held on political but rather only on security or criminal grounds. 
</p>
<p>64. In paragraph 1974 (c) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;the Palestinian 
Authority and the Gaza authorities should continue to enable the free and independent 
operation of Palestinian non-governmental organizations, including human rights 
organizations, and of the Independent Commission for Human Rights&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>65. There is no indication that any specific action has been taken to implement this 
recommendation. Moreover, an escalation of attacks on human rights defenders in Gaza has 
been observed in recent months. One example is the attempt by Hamas security forces to 
close the Independent Commission for Human Rights&#8217; office in Gaza on 22 October 2009. 
It remains unclear who is responsible for the incursion into the premises of the Al-Dameer 
Institute for Human Rights on 15 November 2009 and the attack against the Palestinian 
Network of Non-Governmental Organizations on 13 December 2009.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Action by the international community 
</b></p>
<p>66. Paragraph 1975 of the Mission&#8217;s report contains five recommendations addressed to 
a range of actors and partners in the international community. States and relevant 
organizations have provided information on the implementation of those recommendations.  </p>
<p>67. In paragraph 1975 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;the States parties 
to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 should start criminal investigations in national courts, 
using universal jurisdiction, where there is sufficient evidence of the commission of grave

<p>breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949. Where so warranted following investigations, 
alleged perpetrators should be arrested and prosecuted in accordance with internationally 
recognized standards of justice&#8221;. </p>
<p>68. The High Commissioner for Human Rights sent notes verbales to all States parties 
to the Geneva Conventions to request information on the implementation of this 
recommendation. None of the States which replied indicated that any case related to the 
Gaza conflict was being investigated by its relevant national authorities or prosecuted 
before its national courts.23  </p>
<p>69. In paragraph 1975(b) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;international aid 
providers should step up financial and technical assistance for organizations providing 
psychological support and mental health services to the Palestinian population&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>70. The High Commissioner for Human Rights sent letters to United Nations agencies 
engaged in such activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and the following 
information regarding this recommendation is based on the replies received.24 
</p>
<p>71. UNICEF has been working with the Palestinian Center for Democracy and Conflict 
Resolution (PCDCR) to provide psychosocial support to children and families affected by 
the conflict. This work includes initial and in-depth group sessions for children referred by 
schools, community-based organizations and community workers; individual support for 
children who require more focused help; emergency visits to children and communities; a 
toll free line to which children and families can call for support, advice and referral; and a 
socio-legal defence centre where people can call for legal advice on their rights and 
entitlements, referral and support. In 2009 UNICEF increased its support to PCDCR by 
establishing an emergency standby team of psychosocial support workers. A publicity 
campaign was also carried out in the lead-up to the anniversary of the war, with messages 
to parents that addressed the dangers of over-exposure to television and media images 
related to the conflict. 
</p>
<p>72. UNICEF is supporting the NGO Terre des Hommes to implement a mental health 
and psychosocial technical support unit for Gaza. The aim is to support mental health and 
psychosocial support (MHPSS) by mapping existing MHPSS actors and the different levels 
of support that are already in place, raising awareness regarding support available for 
mental health problems, including de-stigmatization of such problems, and adapting and 
disseminating the Inter-Agency Standing Committee&#8217;s (IASC) Guidelines on Mental Health 
and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings. Furthermore, UNICEF, in its capacity as 
co-chair of the MHPSS working group in Gaza, is providing periodic trainings in relation to 
the IASC Guidelines. 
</p>
<p>73. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that over 80 national and 
international NGOs have been involved in working on MHPSS issues through the 
implementation of a coordinated joint effort. These organizations have convened on a 
</p>
<p>  
 23 As of 2 March 2010, replies had been received from Burkina Faso, Cyprus, Egypt, Finland, France, 
</p>
<p>Jordan, Norway, Pakistan (in its capacity as Coordinator of the Organization of the Islamic 
Conference Group on human rights and humanitarian issues), Portugal, Nigeria (in its capacity as 
Coordinator of the Africa Group on human rights issues), Switzerland and Slovenia. 
</p>
<p> 24 Letters were addressed to: the Humanitarian Coordinator of the Office of the United Nations Special 
Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO), which was copied to the Heads of United 
Nations Agencies in the Occupied Palestinian Territory; the Prosecutor of the International Criminal 
Court (ICC); to international aid providers: the European Commission in the West Bank and Gaza 
and to the Chair of the Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee, to the Special Envoy of the Quartet, to the United 
National Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).  </p>


<p>regular basis to review and plan activities and develop and endorse input into policymaking 
regarding MHPSS issues. 
</p>
<p>74. In paragraph 1975 (c) of its report, the Mission recommended that, &#8220;in view of their 
crucial function . . . donor countries/assistance providers should continue to support the 
work of Palestinian and Israeli human rights organizations in documenting and publicly 
reporting on violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and advising 
relevant authorities on their compliance with international law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>75. In response to informal queries from the OHCHR field presence in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, neither Israeli nor Palestinian NGOs have reported any major changes 
in their funding as of the time of writing.  
</p>
<p>76. UNICEF chairs an inter-agency working group on grave violations against children 
that includes representatives of Palestinian and Israeli human rights organizations. Through 
this working group, which carries out monitoring and reporting activities, UNICEF has, 
since the date of the Mission&#8217;s report, organized workshops in Gaza and the West Bank to 
strengthen local capacities to contribute to reports for the Security Council regarding the 
situation of children in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. 
</p>
<p>77. OHCHR continues to lead the Protection Cluster Working Group as well as the 
Accountability Task Force within it. Both include a number of Palestinian and Israeli 
NGOs and both were active throughout the 2009, as was the Displacement Working Group, 
led by OCHA.  
</p>
<p>78. In paragraph 1975 (d) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;States involved 
in peace negotiations between Israel and representatives of the Palestinian people, 
especially the Quartet, should ensure that respect for the rule of law, international law and 
human rights assumes a central role in internationally sponsored peace initiatives&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>79. The High Commissioner for Human Rights sent a letter on 14 December 2009 to the 
Quartet Representative requesting information on the implementation of this 
recommendation, and has not received a response to date.  
</p>
<p>80. In paragraph 1975 (e) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;in view of the 
allegations and reports about long-term environmental damage that may have been created 
by certain munitions or debris from munitions . . . a programme of environmental 
monitoring should take place under the auspices of the United Nations, for as long as 
deemed necessary. The programme should include the Gaza Strip and areas within southern 
Israel close to impact sites. The environmental monitoring programme should be in 
accordance with the recommendations of an independent body, and samples and analyses 
should be analysed by one or more independent expert institutions. Such recommendations, 
at least at the outset, should include measurement mechanisms which address the fears of 
the population of Gaza and southern Israel at this time and should at a minimum be in a 
position to determine the presences of heavy metals of all varieties, white phosphorous, 
tungsten micro-shrapnel and granules and such other chemicals as may be revealed by the 
investigation&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>81. On 14 December 2009, the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) 
released a report entitled &#8220;Environmental assessment of the Gaza Strip: following the 
escalation of hostilities in December 2008-January 2009&#8221;. In that report, lack of safe 
drinking water and the prevalence of methemoglobinemia are identified as critical 
concerns, including in relation to blue baby syndrome. In this regard, the UN Humanitarian 
Coordinator has agreed to launch a detailed study on methemoglobinemia, and UNICEF 
will prepare a strategy note on providing safe water for all children in the Gaza Strip. The 
report stresses that the situation with respect to groundwater continues to deteriorate and </p>


<p>that the aquifer is likely to collapse if action is not taken urgently. UNEP is preparing a 
technical paper on the long-term solutions required to address groundwater issues in Gaza.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Action by the international community and responsible Palestinian 
authorities 
</b></p>
<p>82. In paragraph 1976 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended to the international 
community and responsible Palestinian authorities that &#8220;appropriate mechanisms should be 
established to ensure that the funds pledged by international donors for reconstruction 
activities in the Gaza Strip are smoothly and effectively disbursed, and urgently put to use 
for the benefit of the population of Gaza.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>83. To date, no mechanism has been established to track commitments against the US$ 
4.2 billion pledged by international donors at the Gaza reconstruction conference held in 
Sharm el-Sheikh in March 2009. The low commitments against the US$ 4.2 billion pledged 
may be attributable to the ongoing closures of Gaza. Notwithstanding this, some donor 
funding is reaching Gaza via budget and programme support to the Palestinian Authority (a 
significant portion of which goes to Gaza) and direct project support for various projects in 
Gaza. UNRWA reports that it has received US$ 100 million to support reconstruction 
activities, although it notes that it is not possible to undertake such activities due to 
continuing restrictions on the import of reconstruction materials.  
</p>
<p>84. In paragraph 1976 (b) of its report, the Mission recommended that, &#8220;in view of the 
consequences of the military operations, . . . responsible Palestinian authorities as well as 
international aid providers should pay special attention to the needs of persons with 
disabilities. In addition, the Mission recommends that medical follow-up should be ensured 
by relevant international and Palestinian structures with regard to patients who suffered 
amputations or were otherwise injured by munitions, the nature of which has not been 
clarified, in order to monitor any possible long-term impact on their health. Financial and 
technical assistance should be provided to ensure adequate medical follow-up to Palestinian 
patients.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>85. It is reported that the Ministry of Social Affairs of the de facto authorities in Gaza 
recently established a department to provided support for persons with disabilities.25 
OHCHR is not aware of any further action taken by responsible Palestinian authorities or 
Palestinian structures, in response to the recommendation contained in paragraph 1976 (b) 
of the Mission&#8217;s report.  
</p>
<p>86. WHO reports that approximately 70 NGOs have been working in support of persons 
with disabilities. Substantial numbers of traumatic disabilities resulted from the Gaza 
conflict, including at least 221 amputees. Many seriously injured persons were transferred 
abroad during or immediately after the conflict to receive care. At the same time, a number 
of surgeons from abroad came to Gaza after the end of the conflict to assist in carrying out 
surgical corrective programmes. International NGOs, such as M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res, 
continue to provide specialized support and post-operative care, while the local production 
of prostheses by the Artificial Limb and Polio Centre has doubled, thanks to support from 
the international humanitarian community.  
</p>
<p>87. UNRWA&#8217;s effort to assist persons with disabilities includes the provision of cash 
assistance to 76 individuals; the inclusion of 21 disabled persons in training opportunities 
abroad; supporting six community-based rehabilitation centres with technical expertise and 
human resource assistance (134 short-term workers); special educational services for 822 
</p>
<p>  
 25 Information received from National Society for Rehabilitation on 17 January 2010.  </p>


<p>persons; equipment, such as wheel chairs, walkers, crutches, air mattresses, etc. for nearly 
2,000 people; morale-boosting activities for children, such as festivals and days of 
recognition; medical follow up for amputees or persons otherwise wounded; and support 
for 17 health-care facilities in Gaza that specialize in various treatments. Furthermore, 
UNRWA cooperated with local organizations to ensure that 48 patients received prosthetic 
devices and artificial limbs, and provided physiotherapy for 393 persons who sustained 
injuries during the Gaza conflict, 33 per cent of whom were under 20 years old. 26 
</p>
<p>88.  UNICEF reports that it provided surgical (trauma) kits, drugs and medical 
consumables sufficient to support the emergency care and rehabilitation of an estimated 
250 children and adults affected by the crisis. 
</p>
<p>89. The UN Mine Action Team and its partners have been continuing to clear 
unexploded ordinance in destroyed houses and buildings, with a view toward reducing the 
risk of further disabilities. 
</p>
<p>90. The European Commission, through its ECHO humanitarian aid arm, has made 
efforts to meet shortages of medical supplies, assistive devices and training opportunities 
for medical professionals in Gaza, with a particular focus on providing care and 
rehabilitation services for persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p>91. The OHCHR office in the Occupied Palestinian Territory has conducted a survey 
regarding persons with disabilities27 and found that 529 persons were disabled as a result of 
the Gaza conflict, 173 of whom are children.28 All persons interviewed by the OHCHR 
pointed out to the lack of access to sustained rehabilitation and support services. Persons 
with disabilities rely on rehabilitation services, both mental and physical, that are provided 
by NGOs and the United Nations. OHCHR came across a number of cases in which 
persons with disabilities were in need of a prosthetic device, yet were not able to receive 
help from either local organizations or from the de facto authorities in Gaza. In general, 
support provided by local authorities is highly limited and sporadic, especially for persons 
who are not considered to be in the most difficult situations.  
</p>
<p><b> J. Action by the international community, Israel and Palestinian 
authorities 
</b></p>
<p>92. In paragraph 1977 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended &#8220;that Israel and 
representatives of the Palestinian people, and international actors involved in the peace 
process, should involve Israeli and Palestinian civil society in devising sustainable peace 
agreements based on respect for international law. The participation of women should be 
ensured in accordance with Security Council resolution 1325 (2000)&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>93. There are many ongoing efforts to involve Israeli and Palestinian civil society 
groups in the peace process, and many civil society groups continue to play an active role in 
promoting ideas and processes to foster a successful peace process. The Secretary-General 
and the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East peace process continues to 
engage with a broad spectrum of actors who are promoting initiatives in support of the 
</p>
<p>  
 26 The injuries incurred by these patients are broken down as follows: 43 per cent fractures, 29 per cent 
</p>
<p>soft injuries, 20 per cent peripheral and centre nerve injury, 4 per cent amputees, and 4 per cent 
multiple injuries. 
</p>
<p> 27 Consisting of a series of interviews with persons with disabilities due to the operation Cast Lead and 
relevant local organizations.  
</p>
<p> 28 Out of the 529, 75 per cent are male (399) and 25 per cent female (120), while 42 per cent are from 
Gaza City.  </p>


<p>peace process. The absence of formal peace negotiations presents a constraint to ensuring 
the sustainability of these initiatives and their integration into peace agreements. 
</p>
<p>94. In paragraph 1977 (b) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;attention should 
be given to the position of women and steps be taken to ensure their access to 
compensation, legal assistance and economic security&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>95. The UN Inter-Agency Gender Task Force, led by UNIFEM and the GenCap 
Adviser, has been carrying out a range of activities in relation to the position of women. 
This includes launching a major survey and report on women&#8217;s specific needs after the 
conflict, and following up the report with a series of meetings with various communities 
throughout Gaza. Further, UNIFEM is supporting the opening of a safe house in Gaza to 
protect women affected by violence and the formation of a mechanism for women&#8217;s 
advocacy. 
</p>
<p>96. UNRWA has provided 777 loans to women owned and operated small businesses 
and employed an average of 3,800 women on a temporary basis through a job creation 
programme. UNRWA has also convened events to improve women&#8217;s self-sufficiency and 
ability to take leadership roles in their communities, provided technical and human 
resources support to organizations providing legal advice to women, and disseminated 
information targeted to women regarding how to obtain further assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> K. Action by the Secretary-General 
</b></p>
<p>97. In paragraph 1978 of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;the Secretary 
General should develop a policy to integrate human rights into peace initiatives in which 
the United Nations is involved, especially the Quartet, and request the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights to provide expertise required to implement this 
recommendation&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>98. The Secretary-General continues to make efforts to ensure that human rights are 
integrated into peace initiatives in which the United Nations is involved, including the 
Quartet. 
</p>
<p><b> L. Action by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>99. Paragraph 1979 of the Mission&#8217;s report contains two recommendations directed to 
OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>100. In paragraph 1979 (a) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights should monitor the situation of 
persons who have cooperated with the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza 
Conflict and periodically update the Human Rights Council through its public reports and 
in other ways as it may deem appropriate&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>101. Through its field presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, OHCHR has 
maintained contact with persons who have cooperated with the Mission, in order to monitor 
their situation, and will periodically report on their situation. 
</p>
<p>102. In paragraph 1979 (b) of its report, the Mission recommended that &#8220;the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights should give attention to the Mission&#8217;s 
recommendations in its periodic reporting on the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the 
Human Rights Council.&#8221; </p>


<p>103. The High Commissioner&#8217;s periodic report on the implementation of Human Rights 
Council resolution S-9/1 (A/HRC/13/54) addresses a number of human rights issues that 
are also relevant to the Mission&#8217;s recommendations.
