 <p></p>
<p><i> Recalling further</i> its resolution 6/37 and the resolutions on the elimination of all forms of 
intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief adopted by the General Assembly 
and by the Commission on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting with interest</i> the recent adoption of the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights by the General Assembly,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,  
</p>
<p><i> Firmly believing</i> that further intensified and strong efforts are required to promote and 
protect the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief and to eliminate all 
forms of hatred, intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief, as also noted at the 
World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance,  
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>that a formal or legal distinction at the national level between different kinds of 
faith-based communities may constitute discrimination and may impinge on the enjoyment of the 
freedom of religion or belief,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that persons belonging to religious minorities are often particularly vulnerable 
to discrimination based on religion or belief with regard to the enjoyment of  all their human

</p>

belief, in particular with regard to access to, inter alia, humanitarian assistance, social benefits or

</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To ensure that no one is affected, because of his or her religion or belief, in the 
enjoyment of his or her economic, social and cultural rights by, inter alia, discriminatory laws on 
housing or land trust, legal provisions concerning inheritance rights, the abusive use of property 
confiscation or any other discriminatory practices; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To take the necessary measures, in accordance with international human rights law, 
to combat discrimination based on religion or belief by non-State actors, with particular regard to

discrimination based on religion or belief that affects the enjoyment of their economic, social and 
cultural rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To promote and encourage, through all available means, including education and 
inter-religious dialogue, understanding, tolerance and respect in all matters relating to freedom of  </p>

 <p></p>
<p>religion or belief and religious tolerance, and to make all appropriate efforts to encourage those 
engaged in teaching, as well as social workers, to promote mutual understanding, tolerance and 
respect; 
</p>
<p> 6.<i> Welcomes and encourages</i> the continuing efforts of all actors in society, including 
non-governmental organizations and bodies and groups based on religion or belief, to promote 
the implementation of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of 
Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, and further encourages their work in promoting 
freedom of religion or belief and in highlighting cases of religious intolerance, discrimination 
and persecution; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Requests </i>the Special Rapporteur to submit her next annual report to the Council at its 
thirteenth session; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Decides </i>to remain seized of the question of the elimination of all forms of
