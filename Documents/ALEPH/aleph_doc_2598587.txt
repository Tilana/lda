Commentary on the results and review of operations
The net loss alter tax for the financial year was $398,485 (2015: proﬁt of $1,003,323).
Total revenue for the period was $584,582 (2015: $735,230) and total expenses were
$1,213,918 (2015: $412,260).
The change in proﬁt is the result of:

a) Accounting loss of $419,466 on disposal of available for sale investment
property with a fair value at the beginning of the financial year of $2,510,000.
The property was sold for $2,090,534 net of selling costs. The taxation result
from the sale of the property was a capital gain of $338,005;

b) Capital loss of $299,001 on disposal of listed securities during the ﬁnancial
year;

c) Rental revenue generated by the property at Lane Cove continued to decrease
due to the cessation of the lease at end of November 2014 and writing off of
unpaid outgoings. The company continued to charge rent on a month by month
basis but was unsuccesslul in recovering the unpaid rent from the tenant and
directors resolved to write off a total bad debt of $119,357 (2015: provision tor
doubtful debt of $43,596) in June 2016 when the property was sold;

d) Decreased interest derived from the company's cash holdings (down by 6%)
due to weak interest rates on subordinate notes:

e) Decrease in dividend and unit trust distribution income by 1.8%

f) Increase in administration expenditure by 9.7% due to increase in compliance
costs.

Mining production, which ceased in December 2009, is not expected to resume in the
future, as mineral resources at the company’s lease are exhausted. A mining lease fee
of $24,000 was received during the year from the mine operator P.B. White Minerals
Pty Ltd as a reimbursement of mining lease fees incurred by Paciﬁc Mining Ltd (2015:
$24,000).

CHAIRMAN’S REPORT

for the :: ended 30 June 2016
During the 2016 ﬁnancial year the company continued to consolidate management of its assets,
commercial real estate and publicly listed stocks, The company will continue to reinvest earnings and
build the investment portfolio.
The challenging economic conditions in recent financial years have been tackled with a conservative
approach to protect capital value of shareholders’ funds.
The Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income reports a loss after tax for the year of
$398,489 compared to a net proﬁt after tax of $1,008,323 for 2015. Total revenue for the year was
$584,802 (2015: $735,230) and total expenses were $1,213,918 (2015: $412,260).

The reported result includes one-off transactions which have a significant impact on the result as follows:
a) The company sold its 50% interest in the Lane Cove property. This resulted in a capital gain of
$338,006. The report includes an accounting loss of $419,466 on the transaction principally
resulting from the difference between the required market value revaluation of Lane Cove property

in the 2015 ﬁnancial year and the subsequent sale price in June 2016. In the 2015 ﬁnancial year.
the company entered into an option agreement to sell the property. The directors were required to
revalue the property at 30 June 2015 to the value in the option agreement. The option agreement
was not exercised. The property was sold for a value less than the revalued amount resulting in
the accounting loss.

b) The company carried out a review of the investment portfolio during the year. As a result there was
a divestment of a portion of the portfolio resulting in a capital loss of $299,001 and the taxation
beneﬁt of the loss. The proceeds of the investment sale and the proceeds of the property sale
have been reinvested in accordance with this review.

In addition to the above oneeoff transactions, the change in proﬁt is the result of:

c) Rental revenue generated by the property at Lane Cove continued to decrease due to the
cessation of the lease at end of November 2014 and writing off of unpaid outgoings. The company
continued to charge rent on a month by month basis but was unsuccessful in recovering the
unpaid rent from the tenant and directors resolved to write off a total bad debt of $119,357
(2015: provision for doubtful debt of $43,596) in June 2016 when the property was sold;

d) Decreased interest derived from the company's cash holdings (down by 6%) due to weak interest
rates on subordinate notes:

e) Decrease in dividend and unit trust distribution income by 1.8%

f) Increase in administration expenditure by 9.7% due to increase in compliance costs.

The company's investment assets contribute more than 90% of total revenue and the percentage of
financial assets will continue to increase following the sale of one of the investment properties in the 2016
year.
The Directors have recommended that no dividend be paid to shareholders in order to consolidate the
company's strong ﬁnancial position and further build the investment portfolio.
There were no changes in environmental or other legislative requirements during the year that have
significantly impacted the results or operations of the company.
I would like to thank my fellow Directors for managing the company in a professional manner and in the
interest of all shareholders.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
for the e : r ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
This statement outlines the main Corporate Governance practices that were in place throughout the
ﬁnancial year. which comply with the ASX Corporate Governance Council recommendations unless
otherwise stated. Whilst the company supports the ASX recommendations it is not possible to implement
every recommendation given both the small size and operations of the company.
Board of Directors
The Board’s primary role is the protection and enhancement of long-term shareholder value. To fulfil this
role the Board is responsible for the overall Corporate Governance of the company including formulating
its strategic direction, approving and monitoring capital expenditure, investments and setting
remuneration. It is responsible for approving and monitoring financial and other reporting. The Board has
also established a framework for the management of the company including a system of internal controls,
a business risk management process and the establishment of appropriate ethical standards.
The names of the Directors of the company in office at the date of this statement are set out in the
Directors' Report on page 8 of this Annual Report.
Mr David L Bentley is considered to be the only independent non-executive director.
When determining whether a non-executive director is independent the director must not fail any of the
following materiality thresholds:
- less than 10% of company shares are held by the director and any entity or individual directly or
indirectly associated with the director;
a no sales are made to or purchases made from any entity or individual directly or indirectly
associated with the director. and
- none of the directors income or the income of an individual or entity directly or indirectly associated
with the director is derived from a contract with any member of the economic entity other than
income derived as a director of the entity.
The Board believes that the individuals on the Board can make. and do make. quality and independent
judgements in the best interests of the company on all relevant issues. The Board considers that the
company is not currently of a size. nor are its affairs of such complexity to justify the appointment and
further experience of another independent non-executive director.
The composition of the Board is reviewed on an annual basis. In accordance with the company‘s Articles
of Association, each director must retire every three years. then if eligible. and holding the necessary
knowledge and expertise. is able to stand for re-election at the general meeting of shareholders.
Otherwise if a vacancy exists. through whatever cause. the Board will consider the required knowledge
and expertise of the potential candidate and appoint the most suitable candidate who must also stand for
election at the general meeting of shareholders.
Due to the small scale of company activities. there is no formal program to induct new directors and
provide appropriate professional development opportunities for directors to develop and maintain the skills
and knowledge needed to perform their role as directors effectively. The remaining directors who have
many years of experience in running the company will provide the necessary support and guidance to the
new directors.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT

for the e : r ended 30 June 2016 (continued)

Remuneration Report
The Remuneration Report is set out on page 10 and forms part of the Directors' Report for the year ended
30 June 2016.
There are no schemes for retirement beneﬁts other than statutory superannuation for non-executive
Directors.

Performance Evaluation

No formal performance evaluation of the Board or Directors took place during the year, however such
performance is regularly informally evaluated and communicated.

Committees

Due to the small size and scale of company actithies. the Board has not established a Nomination
Committee or a Remuneration Committee. The Audit Committee's activities are undertaken by the Board
of Directors of the company with the advice of external accountants.
The Board has adopted a formal audit charter and meets to plan and review annual and half-yearly
financial statements and reports prior to their reiease to the Australian Securities Exchange.

Share Trading
The Board have adopted a Share Trading Policy, which applies to all Directors, employees and
contractors of the company. The policy covers matters of insider trading, share trading window periods
and the maintenance of conﬁdentiality.

Share trading is only permitted within window periods, no Director, employee, contractor or their
immediate family members, may purchase or sell company securities outside of these window periods
unless prior permission is granted by the Board.

Internal Control Framework
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the overall internal control framework. but recognises
that no cost effective internal control system will preclude all errors and irregularities. Due to the small
scale of company activities. the main internal control involves review by the Managing Director in addition
to consultation and review by the other directors and external accountants.
The Board reviews the performance of the external auditors on an annual basis. It is a requirement of the
Corporations Act to rotate the audit engagement partner at least every 5 years. The current audit partner
was appointed at the commencement of the audit for the year ended 30 June 2016.

Ethical Standards
The majority of Directors belong to professional organisations and are bound by those organisations’
codes of professional conduct. As a result and due to the small size and scale of activities the Board
does not believe that it is necessary to adopt a formal Code of Conduct. All Directors and external
consultants are expected to act with the utmost integrity and objectivity, striving at all times to enhance
the reputation and performance of the company.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
for the e : r ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
Diversity
The Company is committed to having an appropriate blend of diversity on the Board and in the Group's
executive positions. However, at this stage, the Board does not consider it is relevant to establish a
diversity policy as the Company did not have any female employees and had one executive and two non—
executive employees consisting of the directors as set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 9 of the
Company’s 2016 annual report during the 2016 financial year. Due to the size and scope of operations
during the year a diversity policy is not yet in place.
The Board at this juncture has not set measurable objectives. This policy will be reviewed as part of the
annual compliance review to the Board to ensure that the Diversity Policy is being progressed as required
and to set measurable objectives when appropriate for the Company.
Risk Management
The Board acknowledges the business risk of the industries in which it operates. Due to the small size
and scale of the company‘s activities. the Board adopts a conservative approach to risk assessment.
ensuring adequate safeguards are in place to minimise any unforeseen circumstances. The hands-on
approach and experience of the Managing Director also ensures that business risks are promptly
identiﬁed and adequately controlled.
The company continues to monitor its operations to identify the greatest areas of potential risk to minimise
any adverse effects on the company's strategic, operational and ﬁnancial activities. The Managing
Director has stated to the Board in writing that the risk management and internal compliance and control
system is operating efﬁciently and effectively in all material aspects.
Financial Reporting
It is the Board‘s policy that a director sign off in writing to the Board that the financial statements present a
true and fair view, in all material respects, of the company‘s financial position and operational results and
are in accordance with relevant accounting standards; the statement is founded on a sound system of risk
management and internal compliance and control which implements policies adopted by the Board; and
the company‘s risk management and internal compliance and control system is operating efﬁciently and
effectively in all material respects.
Communication with Shareholders
The Board of Directors aims to ensure that the shareholders are informed of all major developments
affecting the company's state of affairs. Information is communicated to shareholders as follows:
0 The annual report is distributed to all shareholders.
- The half-yearly report and the quarterly activities reports are lodged with the ASX and are available
from the ASX website.

level of accountability with the company's strategy and goals. Important issues are presented to the
shareholders as a single resolution.

shareholders‘ questions about the conduct of the audit and the preparation and content of the auditor's
report.

Review of Operatlons
During the 2016 ﬁnancial year the company continued to consolidate management of its assets,
commercial real estate and publicly listed stocks, The company will continue to reinvest earnings and
build the investment portfolio.
The challenging economic conditions in recent financial years have been tackled with a conservative
approach to protect capital value of shareholders’ funds.
The Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income reports a loss after tax for the year of
$398,439 compared to a net proﬁt after tax of $1,008,323 for 2015. Total revenue for the year was
$584,882 (2015: $735,230) and total expenses were $1,213,918 (2015: $412,260).

The reported result includes one-off transactions which have a significant impact on the result as follows:
a) The company sold its 50% interest in the Lane Cove property. This resulted in a capital gain of
$338,006. The report includes an accounting loss of $419,466 on the transaction principally
resulting from the difference between the required market value revaluation of Lane Cove property

in the 2015 ﬁnancial year and the subsequent sale price in June 2016. In the 2015 ﬁnancial year,
the company entered into an option agreement to sell the property. The directors were required to
revalue the property at 30 June 2015 to the value in the option agreement. The option agreement
was not exercised. The property was sold for a value less than the revalued amount resulting in
the accounting loss.

b) The company carried out a review of the investment portfolio during the year. As a result there was
a divestment of a portion of the portfolio resulting in a capital loss of $299,001 and the taxation
beneﬁt of the loss. The proceeds of the investment sale and the proceeds of the property sale
have been reinvested in accordance with this review.

In addition to the above one-off transactions, the change in proﬁt is the result of:

0) Rental revenue generated by the property at Lane Cove continued to decrease due to the
cessation of the lease at end of November 2014 and writing off of unpaid outgoings. The company
continued to charge rent on a month by month basis but was unsuccessful in recovering the
unpaid rent from the tenant and directors resolved to write off a total bad debt of $119,357
(2015: provision for doubtful debt of $43,596) in June 2016 when the property was sold;

d) Decreased interest derived from the company's cash holdings (down by 6%) due to weak interest
rates on subordinate notes;

e) Decrease in dividend and unit trust distribution income by 1.8%

f) Increase in administration expenditure by 9.7% due to increase in compliance costs.

The company's assets contribute more than 90% of total revenue, We are developing its portfolio and
anticipate that its investments will continue to provide a significant proportion of revenues, The company
continues to investigate alternative opportunities.
DIVIDENDS
No dividend has been paid or declared by the company since the end of the previous ﬁnancial year.
STATE OF AFFAIRS
In the opinion of the Directors there were no significant changes in the state of affairs of the company that
occurred during the ﬁnancial year.
LIKELY DEVELOPMENTS
The company will continue to pursue its business objectives and seek improvements and efﬁciencies
whenever possible. The company will also continue to develop its investment portfolio.
Further information about likely developments in the operations of the company and the expected results
of those operations in future financial years has not been included in this report because disclosure of the
information would be likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the company.

Notes to the Financial Statements

for the :: ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
1. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
(d) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefit will ﬂow to the company and the
revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable.
Rental Income
Rental income from investment properties is recognised in the Statement of Proﬁt or Loss and Other
Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives granted are
recognised as an integral part of the rental income.
Interest Income

Interest income is recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income as it
accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend Income
Dividend income is recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income on
the date the company‘s right to receive payments is established which in the case of quoted securities is
ex-dividend date.

Other revenue
Other revenue is recognised when it is received or when the right to receive payment is established.
(e) Income tax
The income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on that period's taxable income based
on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and
liabilities attributable to temporary differences and unused tax losses and the adjustment recognised for
prior periods, where applicable.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to
apply when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates that are enacted or
substantively enacted. except for:

' When the deferred income tax asset or liabil'ty arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the
transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profits; or

' When the taxable temporary difference is associated with investments in subsidiaries. associates
or interests in joint ventures, and the timing of the reversal can be controlled and it is probable
that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is
probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
The carrying amount of recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed each reporting
date. Deferred tax assets recognised are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future
taxable proﬁts will be available for the carrying amount to be recovered. Previously unrecognised deferred
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there are future taxable proﬁts available to
recover the asset.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current
tax assets against current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities; and they
relate to the same taxable authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entity‘s which
intend to settle simultaneously.

Notes to the Financial Statements

for the :: ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
1. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
(f) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with ﬁnancial institutions, other
short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
(9) Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment. Trade receivables are generally
due for settlement within 30 days.
Ccllectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Debts which are knovm to be
uncollectable are written off by reducing the carrying amount directly. A provision for impairment of trade
receivables is raised when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all
amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant ﬁnancial difﬁculties of the
debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or
delinquency in payments (more than 60 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable
may be impaired. The amount of the impairment allowance is the difference between the asset's carrying
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest
rate. Cash ﬂows relating to short—term receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is
immaterial.
Other receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less any provision for impairment.
(h) Investments and other financial assets

Investments and other ﬁnancial assets are measured at either amortised cost or fair value depending on
their classification. Classiﬁcation is determined based on the purpose of the acquisition and subsequent
reclassification to other categories is restricted. The fair values of quoted investments are based on
current bid prices. For unlisted investments, the company establishes fair value by using valuation
techniques. These include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that
are substantially the same. discounted cash flow analysis. and option pricing models.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the ﬁnancial assets have
expired or have been transferred and the company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership.
AVaiIabIe-for—sale ﬁnancial assets
Available—for—sale ﬁnancial assets are non-derivative financial assets, principally equity securities, that are
either designated as available-for-sale or not classified as any other category. After initial recognition, fair
value movements are recognised directly in the fair value reserve in equity. Cumulative gain or loss
previously reported in the fair value reserve is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised
or impaired.
Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
The company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a
financial asset or group of ﬁnancial assets is impaired. Objective evidence includes signiﬁcant ﬁnancial
difficulty of the issuer or obligor; a breach of contract such as default or delinquency in payments; the
lender granting to a borrower concessions due to economic or legal reasons that the lender would not
otherwise do; it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other ﬁnancial
reorganisation; the disappearance of an active market for the financial asset; or observable data
indicating that there is a measurable decrease in estimated future cash flows.

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the :: ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
1. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Available—for—sale ﬁnancial assets are considered impaired when there has been a signiﬁcant or
prolonged decline in value below initial cost. Subsequent increments in value are recognised directly in
the fair value reserve.
(i) Investment properties
Investment properties principally comprise of freehold land and buildings held for long-term rental and
capital appreciation that are not occupied by the company. Investment properties are stated at fair value.
Investment properties are derecognised when disposal of or when there is no future economic benefit
expected.
The fair values have not been determined by an independent valuation. The directors at the end of the
reporting period determined the fair value of Thornton by considering the aggregate net annual rents
receivable from the property and applying a yield which reflects the specific risk inherent in the net cash
flow, The yield applied to this property in the current period is 921% and for the comparative period is
9.05%.
Non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale
Non-current assets and assets of disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount
will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continued use. They are
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal. For non-current
assets or assets of disposal groups to be classified as held for sale. they must be available for immediate
sale in their present condition and their sale must be highly probable.
An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write down of the non-current assets and
assets of disposal groups to fair value less costs of disposal. A gain is recognised for any subsequent
increases in fair value less costs of disposal of a non»current assets and assets of disposal groups. but
not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised.
Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest
and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of assets held for sale continue to be recognised.
Non-current assets classiﬁed as held for sale and the assets of disposal groups classiﬁed as held for sale
are presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position, in current assets, The liabilities
of disposal groups classiﬁed as held for sale are presented separately on the face of the statement of
financial position. in current liabilities.
Movements in fair value are recognised directly to profit or loss.
(j) Property, plant and equipment
Furniture and fittings is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical
cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items
Depreciation is calculated on either straight line or diminishing value basis to write off the net cost of each
item of property, plant and equipment (excluding landl over their expected useful lives as follows:
Ofﬁce Furniture and Fittings 3 - 5 years
The residual values. useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed. and adjusted if appropriate, at
each reporting date.

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the :: ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
1. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when there is no future
economic beneﬁt to the company. Gains and losses between the carrying amount and the disposal
proceeds are taken to proﬁt or loss.
(k) Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the
arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on
the use of a speciﬁc asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
A distinction is made between finance leases, which effectively transfer from the lessor to the lessee
substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of leased assets, and operating leases,
under which the lessor effectively retains substantially all such risks and beneﬁts.
Operating lease payments, net of any incentives received from the lessor. are charged to proﬁt or loss on
a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease income from operating leases is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease
term. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating operating leases are added to the carrying value of the
leased asset and recognised as an expense over the lease term on the same bases as the lease income.
(I) Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets
Non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by
which the asset‘s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount
Reooverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. The value-in-
use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows relating to the asset using a pre—tax discount
rate specific to the asset or cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Assets that do not have
independent cash ﬂows are grouped together to form a cash-generating unit.
(m) Trade and other payables
These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the company prior to the end of the
financial year and which are unpaid. Due to their short-tenn nature they are measured at amortised cost
and are not discounted. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
(n) Employee beneﬁts
Wages and salaries and annual leave
Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary beneﬁts, and annual leave expected to be
settled within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in current liabilities in respect of employees'
services up to the reporting date and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the
liabilities are settled.
Long service leave
The liability for long service leave is recognised in current and non-current liabilities, depending on the
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. The
liability is measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services
provided by employees up to the reporting date using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is
given to expected future wage and salary levels. experience of employee departures and periods of
service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on national
corporate bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match. as closely as possible. the estimated
future cash outflows.

(0) Issued capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
(p) Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of Pacific Mining
Limited, excluding any costs of sen/icing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the ﬁnancial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary
shares issued during the ﬁnancial year.
(q) Goods and services tax ('GST') and other similar taxes
Revenues. expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST. unless the GST
incurred is not recoverable from the tax authority, In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of the
acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense
Receivables and payables are slated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net
amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority is included in other receivables or other
payables in the statement of ﬁnancial position.
Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash ﬂows arising from investing or
financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the tax authority, are presented as operating
cash flows.
Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to,
the tax authority.
(r) New Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted
Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are
not yet mandatory. have not been early adopted by the company for the annual reporting period ended 30
June 2016. The company's assessment of the impact of these new or amended Accounting Standards
and Interpretations. most relevant to the company, are set out below.
AASB 9 Financial Instruments
This standard is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The
standard replaces all previous versions of AASB 9 and completes the project to replace IAS 39 'Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement'. AASB 9 introduces new classiﬁcation and measurement
models for ﬁnancial assets. A financial asset shall be measured at amortised cost, if it is held within a
business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash ﬂows, which arise on
speciﬁed dates and solely principal and interest. All other financial instrument assets are to be classified
and measured at fair value through profit or loss unless the entity makes an irrevocable election on initial
recognition to present gains and losses on equity instruments (that are not held-for-trading) in other
comprehensive income ('OCI'). For ﬁnancial liabilities, the standard requires the portion of the change in
fair value that relates to the entity's own credit risk to be presented in OCI (unless it would create an
accounting mismatch). New simpler hedge accounting requirements are intended to more closely align
the accounting treatment with the risk management activities of the entity. New impairment requirements
will use an ‘expected credit loss‘ (‘ECL') model to recognise an allowance.

Paciﬁc Mining Limited A.B.N. 64 000 140 938
Notes to the Financial Statements
for the e : r ended 30 June 2016 (continued)
1. Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
lmpairrnent will be measured under a 12-month ECL method unless the credit risk on a ﬁnancial
instrument has increased signﬂicantly since initial recognition in which case the lifetime ECL method is
adopted. The standard introduces additional new disclosures. The consolidated entity will adopt this
standard from 1 July 2018 but the impact of its adoption is yet to be assessed by the consolidated entity.
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
This standard is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The
standard provides a single standard for revenue recognition. The core principle of the standard is that an
entity will recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services. The standard will require: contracts (either written, verbal or implied) to be identified,
together with the separate performance obligations within the contract; determine the transaction price.
adjusted for the time value of money excluding credit risk; allocation of the transaction price to the
separate performance obligations on a basis of relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or
service. or estimation approach if no distinct observable prices exist; and recognition of revenue when
each performance obligation is satisfied.
Credit risk will be presented separately as an expense rather than adjusted to revenue. For goods, the
performance obligation would be satisﬁed when the customer obtains control of the goods. For services.
the performance obligation is satisﬁed when the service has been provided. typically for promises to
transfer services to customers.
For performance obligations satisfied over time. an entity would select an appropriate measure of
progress to determine how much revenue should be recognised as the performance obligation is
satisfied. Contracts with customers will be presented in an entity's statement of ﬁnancial position as a
contract liability, a contract asset. or a receivable. depending on the relationship between the entity's
performance and the customer‘s payment. Sufficient quantitative and qualitative disclosure is required to
enable users to understand the contracts with customers; the significant judgments made in applying the
guidance to those contracts; and any assets recognised from the costs to obtain or fulﬁl a contract with a
customer. The Corporation will adopt this standard from 1 January 2018 but the impact of its adoption is
yet to be assessed by the Corporation.
AASB 16 Leases
This standard is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. To the
extent that the entity. as lessee, has significant operating leases outstanding at the date of initial
application. right—ot—use assets will be recognised for the amount at the unamortised portion of the useful
life. and lease liabilities will be recognised at the present value of the outstanding lease
payments. Thereafter. earnings before interest. depreciation, amortisation and tax (‘EBITDA') will
increase because operating lease expenses currently included in EBITDA will be recognised instead as
amortisation of the right—cf—use asset. and interest expense on the lease liability. However. there will be an
overall reduction in net proﬁt before tax in the early years of a lease because the amortisation and interest
charges will exceed the current straight-line expense incurred under AASB 117 Leases. This trend will
reverse in the later years. There will be no change to the accounting treatment for shorteterm leases less
than 12 months and leases of low value items. which will continue to be expensed on a straight-line basis.

2. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the ﬁnancial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management continually
evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and
expenses. Management bases its judgements, estimates and assumptions on historical experience and
on other various factors, including expectations of fu1ure events, management believes to be reasonable
under the circumstances. The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom equal the
related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year are
discussed below.
Investment properties
The fair values of investment properties are determined by the Board of Directors at the end of each
reporting period by considering the aggregate net annual rents receivable from the properties and
applying a yield which reﬂects the specific risk inherent in the net cash flow. The yield applied to the
Thornton property in the current period is 9.21% and for the comparative period is 9.05%. The Lane Cove
property was sold in June 2016.
Recovery of deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised tor deductible temporary differences only if the company considers it
is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.
Long service leave provision
As discussed in note 1, the liability for long service leave is recognised and measured at the present value
of the estimated future cash flows to be made in respect of all employees at the reporting date. In
determining the present value of the liability, estimates of attrition rates and pay increases through
promotion and inflation have been taken into account.

3. Segment information

Operating segments are presented using the “management approach" under which segment information
is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes The company has identified
two operating segments. mining and investment segments. The business segment reporting format
reﬂects the company's management and internal reporting structure.

Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on
a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly income-earning assets and revenue, and
corporate assets and expenses.

Notes to the Financial Statements
for the :: ended 30 June 2016 (continued)

23. Financial instruments (continued)
Interest rate risks (continued)
The Directors consider an increase in interest rates of 0.5 per cent is reasonably possible and would lead
to an increase in the company's proﬁt of $951 (2015: $697) and a decrease in interest rates of 0.5 per
cent would lead to a decrease of $951 (2015: $697), assuming a ﬂat tax—rate of 30 per cent.
Credit Risk Exposure
Credit risk on ﬁnancial assets is minimised by dealing with recognised ﬁnancial institutions with acceptable
credit ratings. There is a concentration of credit risk in respect of trade debtors from mining and rental
revenues.
The trade debtors‘ balance from mining revenue was within its terms of trade and no impairment was
made.
The company provided for impairment of $43596 at 30 June 2015 against the debt owed by Samsara
Yoga Pty Ltd. a tenant at the Lane Cove property. The tenant incurred further debt which is unrecoverable
and directors resolved to write off a total amount of $119,357 excluding GST at the end of the ﬁnancial
year subsequent to the sale of the property.
The management closely monitors the balance of each debtor on a monthly basis and is in regular
contact with customers to mitigate future debtors’ risk
The maximum amount of any loss which may be realised is the carrying amount of the ﬁnancial
instrument. The company does not hold any collateral.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
This risk is controlled through investment in financial instruments which are readily convertible to cash if
required. In addition, the company‘s strategy is to minimize external borrowings and the company
maintains sufﬁcient cash and cash equivalents to meet normal operating requirements.
The remaining contractual maturities of the company‘s financial instrument liabilities equal the carrying
values as described per note 19.
Market Risk
Market risk relates to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate
because of changes in market prices.
The company can never be free of market risk as it invests in securities which are not risk free — the
market price of these securities can fluctuate.
The Directors consider as reasonably possible a general fall in market prices of 5 per cent and 10 per
cent, which if spread equally over all available for sale financial assets would lead to a reduction in the
company’s equity of $210,832 (2015: $149,160) and $421,665 (2015: $298,320) respectively, assuming a
flat tax-rate of 30 per cent.
The company seeks to manage and constrain market risk by diversification of the investment portfolio
across multiple stocks and industry sectors.
The current volatility in the Australian Securities Market has lead to a total increase in market value of the
investment portfolio held at 30 June 2016 of $231,265 or 7.106% as at 23 August 2016.

assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company’s
preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial report.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations
Act 2001. We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which
has been given to the directors of Pacific Mining Limited, would be in the same terms if given to the
directors as at the time of this auditor's report,
