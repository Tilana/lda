<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and 
consequences, visited Ecuador from 25 January to 1 February 2010, at the invitation of the 
Government. This report presents information gathered on the existing legislation, 
institutional mechanisms, programmes, plans and activities aimed at preventing, combating 
and eradicating contemporary forms of slavery, its causes and consequences in light of 
international human rights standards. The report also presents major challenges and makes 
recommendations to address the worst forms of child labour, preventing slavery-like 
situations among asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants, the protection of domestic 
workers against slavery-like practices, assistance to victims of human trafficking and the 
detection of cases of bonded labour. 
</p>
<p>2. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with Government officials from the 
Ministries of Justice and Human Rights; Labour Relations; Coordination for Social 
Development; Economic and Social inclusion; and Foreign Affairs. She also met with the 
National Council for Children and Adolescents; the Metropolitan Council for 
Comprehensive Protection of Children and Adolescents and the protection boards (Juntas 
de protecci&#243;n); The National Committee for the Prevention and Progressive Elimination of 
Child Labour (CONEPTI); the Secretariat of Peoples, Social Movements and Citizenship 
Participation; the Council for the Development of the Afro-Ecuadorian People. She also 
met with representatives of the Fund for the Development of Indigenous Peoples, the 
national human rights institution (Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo), the Council for Development of 
Peoples and Nationalities of Ecuador, the National Directorate of Police for Children and 
Adolescents. She also met with members of the commission of transition towards the 
Council on Women and Gender Equity and members of an inter-departmental commission 
established to implement the National Plan to combat human trafficking in persons, 
smuggling of migrants, sexual exploitation and other forms of labour exploitation and 
prostitution of women, children and adolescents, child pornography and corruption of 
minors, adopted in August 2006.1 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur visited Quito and Machala in the province of El Oro, 
Esmeraldas and San Lorenzo in the province of Esmeraldas and Lita and Ibarra in the 
province of Imbabura. She met with domestic and sex workers and children. She also met 
with workers from different industries, including the informal economy sector, gold-mining 
and banana, palm and flower plantations. She interviewed victims and gathered information 
from beneficiaries of programmes for the eradication of child labour, including 
programmes of accelerated education for children labourers. 
</p>
<p>4. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur also held consultations with the United 
Nations resident coordinator and the following United Nations agencies with a presence in 
Ecuador: the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF); the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); the International Labour Organization (ILO); 
the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the United Nations 
Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). 
</p>
<p>  
 1 This interdepartmental commission is headed by the Ministry of the Interior and made up of the 
</p>
<p>Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Justice and Human Rights, Tourism, Education, Labour, Health and 
Economic and Social Inclusion, the State Attorney-General, the National Secretariat for Migrants, the 
National Council of Women, the National Council for Children and Adolescents and the Institute for 
Children and Family. </p>

</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur also met with a variety of stakeholders, including civil 
society organizations working on issues related to her mandate, representatives from the 
business community, academics and grass-roots leaders from different sectors of the 
population including refugees, asylum-seekers, migrants, Afro-Ecuadorians and indigenous 
peoples.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur expresses her appreciation to the Government of Ecuador, 
as well as to all stakeholders, for their time and cooperation. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General background to the visit 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur focused her visit on sectors of labour in which, according to 
information received, worst forms of child labour, the exploitation of children for economic 
purposes as well as other exploitative and abusive slave-like situations persist. Those 
sectors included gold-mining and the banana, flower and palm oil industries. They also 
included domestic household services and the informal sectors of the economy. The Special 
Rapporteur also aimed to examine the magnitude of child mendicity and instances of &#8220;rent&#8221; 
of children, as described in section IV. She also sought to gather information in situ on the 
persistence of contemporary forms of slavery among sectors of the population at high risk 
of becoming subject to slavery-like practices such as Afro-descendents, indigenous peoples, 
migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees. She further intended to assess the special 
vulnerability of women and children to contemporary forms of slavery.  
</p>
<p>8. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the persistence of contemporary forms of slavery 
in Ecuador should be examined in light of the correlation between discrimination, social 
exclusion and poverty and, therefore, she deems it pertinent to summarize some 
information on the demography and social conditions of the country, as well as on the 
geographic areas on which she focused her visit.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Demography and socio-economic conditions 
</b></p>
<p>9. According to the Population Census of 2001, Ecuador has a population of 
12,090,804, of which 50.4 per cent are women. Some 39 per cent of the population lives in 
rural areas, with the 61 per cent remaining concentrated in urban areas. Information 
available from the United Nations Population Division indicates that the total population of 
Ecuador amounted to 13,481,000 in 2008.2 The same year, the child population in Ecuador 
was estimated at 5,054,000, of which 1,392,000 were children under age 5.3  
</p>
<p>10. The ethnic composition of the population of Ecuador includes mestizos,4 indigenous 
persons, Afro-descendents5 and montubios.6 The interrelatedness between ethnicity, social

 5 According to the 2000 Household Survey, 72 per cent of the population above 15 years of age 
</p>
<p>considered appropriate the &#8220;mestizo&#8221; designation: 15 per cent defined themselves as &#8220;white&#8221;; 6 per 
cent as Amerindian, 4 per cent as &#8220;black&#8221; and, 2 per cent as &#8220;mulatto&#8221; (half black, half white).

<p><b>A/HRC/15/20/Add.3

</p>
<p>exclusion and discrimination in Ecuador has been documented in a number of studies.7 For 
example, a 2007 survey elaborated by the Ministry of Coordination for Social 
Development, highlights that both Afro-Ecuadorians and indigenous peoples are among the 
poorest of the poor, with 48 per cent living below the poverty line (national average is 38 
per cent) and 13.7 per cent in extreme poverty. Afro-Ecuadorians have the highest 
unemployment rate of any group in the country reaching 12 per cent in urban areas, while 
the national average is 7.2 per cent.8 
</p>
<p>11. The correlation between poverty and ethnicity seems evident from the information 
on the living and working conditions of indigenous peoples and Afro-descendents in 
Ecuador. In 2008, an analysis of consumption poverty disaggregated by ethnicity yielded an 
incidence among indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian groups of 70 per cent and 48 per cent, 
respectively.9 The same year, a report on Economic and Social Progress in Latin-America 
indicated that access to basic services, income and education attainment for indigenous and 
Afro-descendent groups, as well as for women, was lower than for other social groups.10  
</p>
<p>12. In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur aimed during her visit at exploring 
in situ the possible correlation between poverty, ethnicity, social exclusion and 
discrimination in line of the persistence of contemporary forms of slavery 
</p>
<p><b> B. Geographic areas of focus 
</b></p>
<p>13. The geographic areas of focus of this visit included the coast and the highlands 
regions. On the coast, the Special Rapporteur visited Machala in the province of El Oro, 
and Esmeraldas and San Lorenzo in the province of Esmeraldas. In the highlands, she 
visited Quito in the province of Pichincha, and Lita and Ibarra in the province of Imbabura. 
An important geographic focus of the visit included provinces in the northern border area 
between Ecuador and Colombia (Esmeraldas, Imbabura and the border of the province of 
Carchi). 
</p>
<p>14. Information provided suggested the existence of porous areas within the Ecuadorian-
Colombian border.  These reportedly include a number of approximately 30 irregular paths 
across borders in the Rumichaca bridge area, which have reportedly favoured the 
proliferation of transnational organized crime, including the alleged smuggling of wood, 
gas, arm munitions and narcotics, in which both adults and children are allegedly 
employed. Information received also suggested the presence of asylum-seekers, refugees, 
migrants, victims of transnational organized crime, Afro-descendents of Colombian and 
Ecuadorian origin and indigenous communities, some of which claim their bi-national 
status. 
</p>
<p>15. The regional focus of the visit is then explained by the complex and difficult 
situation at the northern border, in terms of geographical access, territorial control,

<p>communications and the economic and social situation of the region, among other factors.11 
It is also explained by the presence of groups at a higher risk of being victims of 
contemporary forms of slavery given the above-mentioned correlation between ethnicity, 
poverty, discrimination, social exclusion and slavery-like situations. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Normative and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The international legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>16. Ecuador holds a key record of ratification of international treaties adopted within the 
framework of the United Nations, of which it is a founding member. Ecuador has ratified 
major international human rights instruments.12 Ecuador is also a party to a number of ILO 
conventions, which are relevant for the prevention and/or the elimination of contemporary 
forms of slavery, such as: the Forced Labour Convention (No. 29); the Abolition of Forced 
Labour Convention (No. 105); and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention (No. 
182), which was adopted in 1999 and which Ecuador ratified in 2000. 
</p>
<p>17. In 1955, Ecuador deposited the instrument of acceptance13 of the Protocol amending 
the Slavery Convention, adopted in 1953, and signed the Slavery Convention adopted in 
1926 as amended by the aforementioned protocol.14 In 1960, Ecuador acceded to the 
Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions 
and Practices Similar to Slavery, adopted in Geneva in 1956. 
</p>
<p>18. Ecuador is also a party to the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in 
Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others, ratified in 1969, as well as to 
the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, ratified in 2002, 
and the United Nations Convention against Corruption, ratified in 2005, both of which 
contain provisions requiring or encouraging measures of protection for witnesses of 
offences sanctioned under those treaties. The State has also been ,since 2002, a party to the 
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Person, Especially Women and

Available from http://scm.oas.org/doc_public/ENGLISH/HIST_08/RC00089E04.DOC. 
</p>
<p> 12 These include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols; 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and its Optional Protocol; the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and its two optional protocols; the International Convention on 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination; the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women and its Optional Protocol; the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families; the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance.  
</p>
<p> 13 The instrument of acceptance of a treaty has the same legal effect as ratification and consequently 
expresses the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty. In the practice of some States, acceptance has 
been used instead of ratification when, at a national level, constitutional law does not require the 
treaty to be ratified by the head of State. See <i>Treaty Handbook</i> (United Nations publication, Sales No. 
E.02.V.2). Available from http://treaties.un.org/doc/source/publications/THB/English.pdf. 
</p>
<p> 14 Notwithstanding that Ecuador is yet to ratify the 1926 Slavery Convention, pursuant to applicable 
international law, the signature of a treaty qualifies the signatory State to proceed to ratification, 
acceptance or approval of the treaty and creates and obligation to refrain, in good faith, from acts that 
would defeat the object and the purpose of the treaty. See Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 
of 1969, ratified by Ecuador on 11 February 2005, arts. 10 and 18. </p>

</p>
<p>Children, and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, both of 
which supplement the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The regional legal, institutional and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>19. Ecuador is one of the founding members of the Organization of American States 
(OAS) and, in 1977, became a party to the American Convention on Human Rights adopted 
in 1969. Ecuador thereby allows individuals under its jurisdiction to lodge petitions with 
the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on alleged violations of the 
Convention,15 which recognizes in article 6 the freedom from slavery16 and from forced or 
compulsory labour.17 Pursuant to article 27, paragraph 2, of the Convention, the freedom 
from slavery is recognized to belong to the core of non-derogable human rights.   
</p>
<p>20. Ecuador has ratified all legal instruments adopted within the framework of the inter-
American system of human rights. Furthermore, since 24 July 1984, the State has 
recognized the competence of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to receive 
and examine communications in which a State party alleges that another State party has 
committed a violation of the human rights set forth in the Convention, and the jurisdiction 
of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, on all matters relating to the interpretation or 
application of the Convention. The State has also reserved its right to withdraw the 
recognition of the competence of the Court whenever it may deem it advisable.   
</p>
<p>21. Ecuador is also a founding member of the Inter-American Development Bank and 
has benefited from its programmes since 1959. The Bank&#8217;s current country strategy with 
Ecuador (2008&#8211;2011) has identified as its three priorities areas cooperation, social 
development and economic inclusion. Furthermore, United Nations agencies with a 
regional focus such as the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and 
the Pan American Health Organization have also provided technical advice and cooperation 
to the Government.  
</p>
<p><b> C. The national legal, institutional and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>22. Ecuador is a unitary State which is returning to political stability, after a decade of 
constant changes of Government and major constraints on the design and implementation 
of major socio-economic strategies.18 The current President of Ecuador came to power in 
January 2007 and was re-elected to a second term in April 2009.  
</p>
<p>23. The new constitution, adopted in 2008, strengthens some institutions established 
under the 1998 Constitution, and makes significant changes to the institutional and legal 
framework of the country. It also sets the basis for current social policies, most of which are 
grounded in article 3 of the Constitution, which recognizes the State obligation to ensure 
the enjoyment of human rights without discrimination, particularly regarding to education, 
health, food, social security and safe drinking water. 
</p>
<p>  
 15 See American Convention on Human Rights, art. 44. 
</p>
<p> 16 This  includes slavery or involuntary servitude, in all their forms, as well as slave trade and trafficking 
in women.  
</p>
<p> 17 Excepting when the penalty of deprivation of liberty at forced labour is recognized in the countries, 
which in any case shall not adversely affect the dignity of the physical or intellectual capacity of the 
prisoner.

</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>24. Ecuador is currently in a transitional phase between the institutions of the former 
and new constitutions19 and the revision and reformulation of social strategies, policies and 
programmes.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Legal and policy framework on contemporary forms of slavery 
</b></p>
<p>25. Afro-descendents were first brought as slaves to Ecuador in 1526.20 Their 
manumission was proclaimed in 1851 and slavery as an institution was abolished in 1852.21 
The current legal framework explicitly prohibits slavery and its contemporary forms22 and 
recognizes the State obligation to take all necessary measures to prevent, eliminate and 
sanction them.23  
</p>
<p>26. The prohibition of slavery in all its forms is recognized in article 66 of the 
Constitution, which also recognizes the right to personal integrity, including a life free of 
violence. The Constitution recognizes the State obligation to adopt the necessary measures 
to prevent, suppress and punish all forms of slavery, especially against women, children 
and adolescents, elderly people, people with disabilities and any other person in a 
disadvantaged or vulnerable situation.  
</p>
<p>27. Domestic laws reinforce the constitutional prohibition of all forms of slavery or 
practices similar to slavery. This is the case of the Labour Code, which in article 138 
prohibits slavery and slavery-like practices. Such practices include the sale and trafficking 
of children; debt bondage and serfdom and forced or compulsory labour, including forced 
or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict; the use, procuring or 
offering of a child for prostitution, for the production of pornography or for pornographic 
performances; the use, procuring or offering of a child for illicit activities, in particular for 
the production and trafficking of drugs as defined in the relevant international treaties; all 
work that, by its nature or the conditions under which it is performed, may harm the health, 
safety and morals of the children involved; and the employment of person below the age of 
18 in industries or activities deemed to be dangerous or unhealthy. Labour inspectors have 
the responsibility to report to the regional labour office on cases related to all forms of 
slavery.  
</p>
<p><i> (a) Forced labour 
</i></p>
<p>28. Forced labour is prohibited by article 66 of the Constitution, which recognizes, inter 
alia, the right to freedom at work, according to which &#8220;no person shall be obliged to 
perform unpaid or forced labour, except in cases defined by the law&#8221;. The same provision 
also recognizes that no one is to be obliged to do something that is prohibited by the law.24   
</p>
<p>29. The prohibition of forced labour is also recognized in the Criminal Code, which 
stipulates in article 209 that &#8220;any political, civil, ecclesiastical or military official, who 
demands services that are not compulsory under the law, or who compels a person to work 
without prior agreement, shall be liable to one to three months&#8217; imprisonment&#8221;.

<p>30. In 1998, Ecuador drew up a national human rights plan, which prioritized the 
establishment of policies for the elimination of forced and child labour.25 Nevertheless, the 
implementation of this plan was limited, according to an evaluation undertaken at the 
request of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights.26  
</p>
<p>31. In August 2006, the President of the Republic adopted and put into effect the 
National Plan to combat trafficking in persons, smuggling of migrants, sexual exploitation 
and other forms of labour exploitation and prostitution of women, children and adolescents, 
child pornography and corruption of minors, which is being implemented through inter-
ministerial and inter-institutional cooperation arrangements.   
</p>
<p><i> (b) Child exploitation for economic purposes 
</i></p>
<p>32. The special protection of children against any kind of labour exploitation or 
economic exploitation is recognized in the current Constitution, which stipulates in article 
46 that the State shall adopt special protection measures against any kind of labour 
exploitation or economic exploitation of children and adolescents.  
</p>
<p>33. The 2008 Constitution sets the minimum age for employment at 15 years. Minimum 
age provisions do not apply to children involved in formative cultural or ancestral practices, 
as long as they are not exposed to physical or psychological harm. The law prohibits 
adolescents from age 15 to 18 from working more than 6 hours per day and more than 5 
days per week. A Ministerial Directive (No. 016 of 2008) prohibits children under 15 years 
from working in 93 economic activities, including livestock raising, fishing, extraction of 
salt, the textile industry, logging and quarrying. 
</p>
<p>34. The prevention of child commercial sexual exploitation in the tourism industry has 
been a matter of particular attention by the State institutions. In this regard, the Ministry of 
Tourism, in partnership with the Ministry of Social and Economic Inclusion and the 
Federation of Provincial Tourism Boards, adopted a manual for sustainable tourism for 
tourist providers, aimed at preventing sex tourism. It also launched awareness-raising 
campaigns, organized workshops for the tourism industry, parents, and high school students 
and published informational materials. This ministry was designated as the South American 
regional coordinator for the Joint Group for the Elimination of Commercial Sexual 
Exploitation of Children in Tourism, created in 2005, which conducts prevention and 
awareness-raising campaigns to combat the commercial exploitation of children in Latin 
America and includes the Ministries of Tourism of Argentina, the Plurinational State of 
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) The worst forms of child labour 
</i></p>
<p>35. The Constitution set up in article 46 the basis for the progressive elimination of child 
labour in Ecuador and the complete prohibition of the worst forms of child labour. The 
national plan for the prevention and eradication of child labour (2008&#8211;2013) was adopted to 
implement this provision, which has also been mainstreamed, inter alia, in the Social 
Agenda for the Child and the Youth (2007&#8211;2010) and the country&#8217;s Social Agenda, both of 
which are national action plans. Furthermore, the National Development Plan (2009&#8211;2013) 
includes goals working towards the elimination of child labour, including its worst forms.

<p>In this connection, ensuring the global development of childhood for the full exercise of 
their rights has been included as a national objective (No. 1) and a policy (No. 1.10).  Some 
of the goals set for 2013 include the reduction of child labour (No. 1.10.2) and the full 
eradication of child mendicity (goals Nos. 1.10.2 and 4).27 
</p>
<p>36. Article 138 of the Labour Code reinforces the prohibition of the worst forms of child 
labour including all work that, by its nature or the conditions under which it is performed, 
may harm the health, safety and morals of the children involved. Some of the industries or 
activities deemed to be dangerous or unhealthy are stipulated in special regulations and 
include work in tunnels or quarries and work constituting a serious danger, morally or for 
the physical development of women and men under the age indicated. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Institutional framework to eradicate contemporary forms of slavery 
</b></p>
<p>37. There are a number of governmental institutions that deal with aspects of the 
protection against contemporary forms of slavery. This is the case of the national human 
rights institution (Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo), established in accordance with article 214 of the 
Constitution, whose advocacy and protection role is essential in both preventing 
contemporary forms of slavery and protecting its victims.  This is also the case of the Office 
for Public Prosecution (Defensor&#237;a P&#250;blica), established in accordance with article 119 of 
the 2008 Constitution and mandated to ensure access to justice for the most vulnerable.  
</p>
<p>38. Two umbrella ministries, the Ministry of Coordination for Social Development28 and 
the Ministry of Coordination for Internal and External Security,29 are instrumental for the 
implementation and coordination of plans, programmes and policies related to the 
elimination of contemporary forms of slavery. A number of ministries are also crucial in 
policy- and decision-making related to the elimination of contemporary forms of slavery. 
This is the case of the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights; the Ministry of Government, 
Police and Cults; the Ministry of Labour Relations; the Ministry of Economic and Social 
Inclusion, the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  
</p>
<p>39. The Ministry of Labour Relations has 27 child labour inspectors that investigate 
cases of child labour throughout the country. Ten child labour inspectors are exclusively 
dedicated to eradicating child labour in mining. The Ministry has established a specific unit 
devoted to the elimination of child labour, which leads programmes that ensure compliance 
with the rights of children and adolescents exposed to exploitation at work, and addresses 
the structural causes of child labour with a view to achieving its progressive elimination. 
Furthermore, the Labour Inspectorate and the municipalities oversee labour contracts and 
work permits for adolescents aged 15 and over. The law prescribes sanctions for violations 
of child labour laws, such as monetary fines and the closing of establishments where child 
labour occurs. 
</p>
<p>40. Most of the ministries cooperate through collegiate bodies in charge of 
policymaking for targeted groups, including children and adolescents. This is the case of

<p>the National Council for Children and Adolescents,30 which is the body responsible for 
defining, monitoring and implementing policies aimed at the protection of the rights of 
children and adolescents in Ecuador. The ministries also cooperate for the implementation 
of national plans, such as through the referral mechanism set up under the National Plan to 
combat trafficking in persons, smuggling of migrants, sexual exploitation and other forms 
of labour exploitation and prostitution of women, children and adolescents, child 
pornography and corruption of minors.  
</p>
<p>41. Other multi-stakeholders efforts include CONEPTI, established in 1997. The 
Committee is composed of ILO, the Government, the private sector and civil society 
organizations. CONEPTI oversees the implementation of the national policy on the 
prevention, control and monitoring of child labour.   
</p>
<p>42. The Metropolitan Council for Comprehensive Protection of Children and 
Adolescents is responsible for the formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation 
of policies aimed at ensuring the protection and enforcement of the rights of children and 
adolescents, in the metropolitan district of Quito.  
</p>
<p>43. The rights protection committees are part of the Comprehensive System of 
Protection of Children and Adolescents and are responsible for monitoring the individual 
and collective rights of children and adolescents of Quito and undertaking administrative 
(not judicial) measures to protect children and adolescents, from the threat or the actual 
violation to their rights.  
</p>
<p>44. The Institute for Children and Family (INFA), which is ascribed to the Ministry of 
Economic and Social Inclusion, guarantees the rights of children and adolescents by 
implementing plans, policies and measures on integral protection for children and their 
families. Its areas of action are: child development, special protection, participation, care 
and emergency risk. INFA has developed the Plan for the Elimination of Child Labour in 
Dump Wastes, and has raised awareness on child begging. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Contemporary forms of slavery in Ecuador 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Children as victims of slavery 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur collected information on the magnitude of child labour and 
economic exploitation of children as it pertains to the worst forms of child labour.   
</p>
<p>46. The Second National Child Labour Survey (2006) released in 2008, estimated that 
there were 580,889 child workers in Ecuador. Official estimates indicate that some 662,665 
children working are aged from 5 to 18 years. Children were found, primarily in the 
banana, flowers and mining industries. They were also found to be sexually exploited, and 
to work in dump wastes and in the informal sector of the economy.31 The same survey 
shows that the number of child labourers aged 5 to 17 decreased from 720,450 in 2001 to 
662,650 in 2006 and that school attendance increased from 84.2 per cent to 87.9 per cent 
over the same period.32 The worst forms of child labour, mostly including hazardous labour,

</b></p>
<p>was estimated to affect 231,752 children aged 15 to 17, representing the 88 per cent of the 
total child labourer population.  
</p>
<p>47. While in situ, the Special Rapporteur observed child labourers in the streets of the 
cities visited. They worked mostly in the informal sector as street vendors of fruits, 
vegetables and candies, shoe shiners, or waitress in small restaurants and sellers in small 
shops. Interviews with children in the informal sector of the economy brought to light the 
exposure of children to situations that harm their safety and morals, including abusive 
practices and sexual violence. Estimates by stakeholders indicate that approximately 12,000 
children work on the streets of cities of more than 10,000 inhabitants. 
</p>
<p>48. Various sources, including children themselves, reported that child exploitation for 
economic purposes takes several forms in Ecuador. These include, but are not limited to, 
the simple placement of children to help in families or in the houses or farms of close 
family friends as farm workers, maids and cleaners, to the recruitment and transportation of 
children from rural to urban centres for different forms of labour under exploitative 
conditions. This form of &#8220;labour placement&#8221; was reported to increase in the holiday 
seasons. A gendered division of child labour was also mentioned, as household work was 
reported mostly to be undertaken by girls. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur also received information about the  
&#8220;lend or rent of children&#8221; for small amounts of money for the entire period of work ranging 
from 30 to 80 dollars to &#8220;help&#8221; those to whom they have been lend in a wide variety of 
tasks. During the time children are lent, they are left at the full mercy of their &#8220;tenants&#8221; and 
their parents are unaware of the whereabouts or occupation of their children. While in some 
instances children have been reported to be &#8220;used&#8221; as street vendors and farm workers, in 
others they have been reported to be in domestic servitude or smuggled to neighbouring 
countries (including Chile, Colombia, Peru and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) for 
forced labour activities, sexual exploitation and mendicity.  
</p>
<p>50. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur heard allegations of the use of children &#8211; 
particularly children of indigenous or Afro-descendent origin in the northern border for 
dangerous work and transnational organized crime &#8211; including smuggling of gas and wood, 
weapons&#8217; munitions transportation and the smuggling of illicit drugs. She also received 
information on child labour in the flower, banana and palm oil industry, where children 
often use chemicals and sharp tools and lift heavy loads which are considered hazardous 
and, therefore, fall into the group of the worst forms of child labour.   
</p>
<p><b> B. Other exploitative and abusive slave-like situations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Domestic household workers 
</b></p>
<p>51. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention was drawn to a wide range of 
abuses encountered by domestic workers in their workplaces, including poor working and 
living conditions, psychological and physical abuse, forced labour and sexual aggression. In 
connection with migrant domestic workers, she was also informed about instances of 
withholding of identity and travel documents, low or no wages and excessive working 
hours, sometimes without meal or rest breaks. Women and girls were reported to be mostly 
employed in household domestic work 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur also received information from victims themselves on 
threats and intimidation, physical and gender-based violence, including sexual aggressions 
of children of domestic workers living in their employers&#8217; houses.  Instances of spurious 
allegations to the police of domestic workers stealing, used as a way to threaten them not to 
denunciate exploitative and abusive situations, were also reported.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/20/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>53. Regular migrant domestic workers enjoy the protection of the law, including of their 
right to the national minimum wage, adequate rest breaks, remunerated holidays and 
maternity-related rights, including leave. However, evidence received by the Special 
Rapporteur proves that challenges remain in the monitoring of living and working 
conditions, as the workplace of domestic workers is often the home of their employers.   
</p>
<p><b> 2. Palm oil industry workers 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur interviewed palm oil workers from the province of 
Esmeraldas, who reported labour conditions that ranged from situations of labour 
exploitation to situations of being forced into debt for food and accommodation. Most of 
the workers interviewed were of Colombian origin, holding a variety of immigration 
statuses (irregular migrants, asylum-seekers, refugees) and only very few workers were of 
Ecuadorian origin. Workers interviewed reported that approximately 10 to 12 palm oil 
companies are present in the area, but that only 2 or 3 were employing workers in 
vulnerable situations and that most of them did not employ persons of Colombian origin, 
even if they are documented in Ecuador. 
</p>
<p>55. The palm oil industry workers of Colombian origin that were interviewed reported 
discrimination on the ground of their national origin and, in some instances, their 
immigration status. Most of them reported having been recruited in Colombia by the 
companies for which they work (Olensa and Energy Palma). They reported having arrived 
in Ecuador to receive a daily payment of US$ 10 cents for carrying oil palms for more than 
8 hours, as the rest of their wage (they are unaware of the amount) was considered to be in 
exchange of food and accommodation. They reported that their accommodation facilities 
were overcrowded, as approximately 30 persons were accommodated in small rooms 
located close to the palm oil fields. They reported sleeping on the concrete floor (without 
any type of mattress), with no access to water, (including no facilities for showering) or 
electricity. They also told of a deduction from their wages to cover social security and of 
not knowing how to access a medical practitioner or what the social security benefits to 
which they might be entitled were. Some of them reported having met workers that got sick 
after one or two months of work and who were fired accordingly. 
</p>
<p>56. A number of workers reported to receive a salary of US$ 30 per hectare (10,000 
square metres). They mentioned that if they work at their best they can complete a hectare 
in four or five days. They also reported being served food in the company's canteen, which 
is deducted from their payment. Some others reported receiving US$ 50 a month, having 
been promised or even signed a contract for US$ 300. 
</p>
<p>57. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the information received indicates the existence of 
an unregulated system of wages, mistreatment and sub-human conditions at work 
(excessive work hours, very low or no wages), lack of social security (including any type of 
entitlements in case of illness and misinformation about labour inspection authorities) and 
the existence of contemporary forms of slavery, as workers are being forced into debt for 
food and accommodation.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Promising measures to eradicate contemporary forms of 
slavery and prevent vulnerability to slavery-like situations 
</b></p>
<p>58. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed on various cooperation 
initiatives that illustrate the commitment of the Government and/or other stakeholders to 
the realization of human rights in the context of the elimination of contemporary forms of 
slavery. Of those initiatives, the Special Rapporteur wishes to highlight a non-exhaustive </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/20/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>list of some promising measures undertaken for the elimination of the worst forms of child 
labour.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Governmental cooperation initiatives to address the worst forms of 
child labour 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur welcomes efforts led by the Government, in most cases with 
stakeholders&#8217; participation, to eliminate the worst forms of child labour. She also welcomes 
the current execution of several governmental projects aimed at the eradication of the worst 
forms of child labour. She especially welcomes the implementation of the National 
Programme for the Eradication of Child Labour in Dump Wastes since 2004 and the 
establishment of the goal to declare Ecuador free from child work in dump wastes in 2010. 
She also praises the pilot project for the eradication of child labour in the mine industry, 
according to which, the Governments expects to have intervened between 2009 and 2010 in 
at least 1,000 cases of child labour in mining.  
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur commends efforts undertaken as part of the project for the 
eradication of child labour in the banana industry, whose outcomes indicate that over a two-
year period 500 cases have been addressed. In 2010, the authorities expect to address 500 
more cases. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the proposal presented in 2009 for 
preventing child labour in domestic households, which will be launched in geographic areas 
considered to be at high risk. Irrespective of the fact that information provided by the 
Government indicates that child labour, including its worst forms, is perceived in some 
rural areas as culturally rooted practice, actions should be taken to raise awareness of it as a 
worst form of child labour and, therefore, a contemporary form of slavery.  
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes efforts undertaken by the State to eliminate 
child mendicity by raising awareness and building community resilience to this 
phenomenon through recreational and vocational activities. Accomplishments of this 
strategy include the reduction of child mendicity by 90 per cent in the provinces of Bolivar, 
Chimborazo, Cotopaxi, Imbabura, Pichincha, Santa Elena and Tungurahua. The Special 
Rapporteur encourages the Government to enhance the implementation of constitutional 
and legal obligations on the elimination of the worst forms of child labour and other 
stakeholders, to strengthen these programmes and to expand their coverage and scope, as 
she will mention it in her recommendations at the end of this report.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Private sector cooperation initiatives to eliminate child labour in 
Ecuador 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur welcomes efforts undertaken by the private sector to 
contribute to the national goal to eliminate child labour in Ecuador. She especially 
welcomes the establishment of the programme Proni&#241;o aimed at contributing to the 
achievement of national, regional and international goals on the elimination of the worst 
forms of child labour before 2015 and the eradication of all child labour by 2020.   
</p>
<p>63. The programme has as its main objectives the comprehensive protection of the child 
by providing quality education and strengthening socio-institutional capacity. Its main 
activities include providing a system of scholarships targeting child labourers affected by </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/20/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>poverty, who require financial support to re-enter the educational system,33 and technical 
equipment and academic tools.  
</p>
<p>64. The programme was piloted in Ecuador in 1998 and now numbers 11,667 
beneficiaries from the following provinces: Azuay; Chimborazo; Cotopaxi; El Oro, 
Tungurahua, Napo; Los Rios; Manab&#237;; Pichincha; Imbabura; Sucumb&#237;os; Guayas; 
Esmeraldas, 728 schools and 35 assistance centres. The programme has extended to other 
countries in the region and has provided scholarships and assistance to over 100,000 
children and adolescents in 13 countries in Latin America. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Addressing poverty as one of the major root causes of the worst forms 
of child labour 
</b></p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur welcomes governmental efforts to address the root causes of 
the worst forms of child labour and provide alternatives for the alleviation of poverty. She 
especially welcomes cash transfer and human development bond programmes, both of 
which have shown their positive impact in the elimination of child labour, particularly of its 
worst forms, among the poorest of the poor. The Special Rapporteur notes with 
appreciation that the Bono Solidario (also known as the &#8220;Poverty Bond&#8221;) was established in 
1998 to mitigate the impact of eliminating fuel subsidies and raising electricity prices. In 
2003, the Bono Solidario changed into the Bono de Desarrollo Humano (&#8220;Human 
Development Bond&#8221;) directed at the poorest segment of the population through selective 
criteria set up as part of the Social Programme Beneficiary Identification and Selection 
System.34 
</p>
<p>66. An evaluation of the Human Development Bond Programme in the light of its 
impact on child labour concluded in 2006 that children in the programme were less likely to 
be sent to work than if they had benefited therefrom. Furthermore, the evaluation found that 
the bond had a high impact on school enrolment and attendance and on child labour: school 
enrolment increased by around 10 percentage points, whereas child labour fell by 17 
percentage points. The probability of a boy or girl from any household receiving the bond 
working was 6.2 percentage points less than for those not receiving the bond. Boys and 
girls in households receiving the bond worked 2.5 hours less than girls and boys who did 
not receive it. 35  
</p>
<p><b> D. The establishment of multilateral platforms for the progressive 
eradication of the worst forms of child labour 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the establishment of multilateral platforms and 
multi-stakeholders activities and programmes in connection with the eradication of the 
worst forms of child labour. The Special Rapporteur praises the establishment of CONEPTI 
</p>
<p>  
 33 As the national education system in Ecuador is fee-free, the scholarships are designed to provide 
</p>
<p>schoolbooks, tools and the child&#8217;s school uniform.

national policy on the prevention, control and monitoring of child labour. In this 
connection, the Special Rapporteur welcomes efforts aimed at regularizing of the work of 
children between 15 and 17 years old36 in the flower industry, including technical and 
vocational training for child labourers in that range of age.37 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the partnerships created between UNICEF, 
the Ministry of Labour Relations, INFA, the Centre for Development and Self-
Development and the Telefonica Foundation for the Implementation of the National 
Programme for the Eradication of Child Labour in Dump Wastes. She especially welcomes 
major outcomes from these partnerships, including the eradication of child labour of over 
1,900 children and adolescents, out of 2,014 cases detected, who have left work in garbage 
dumps. She also welcomes the consolidation of such partnerships for the full eradication of 
child labour in dump wastes, which is expected to be achieved by 2010. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Strengthening efforts to determine the status of persons in need of 
international refugee protection  
</b></p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the implementation of the Enhanced Registration 
Project for the determination of refugee status, as a component of the refugee policy of 
Ecuador adopted in September 2008. This project, developed by the Government of 
Ecuador, with the technical and logistical support of UNHCR, was piloted in March 2009.  
Through the Enhanced Registration Project, the status of refugee was granted to 27,740 
asylum-seekers of Colombian origin and 1,169 asylum claims were referred for an in-depth 
assessment under the ordinary process for the determination of the status of refugee. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur especially welcomes the added value of this project, as it 
makes accessible the procedure for the determination of refugee status for asylum-seekers 
who were unable to access it for a number of reasons, including inhabiting in remote areas, 
lacking resources or fearing detention on the ground of their immigration status.  In the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, this project has contributed to a decrease in the risk of abuse of 
persons of Colombian origin in need of international refugee protection, as refugees duly 
documented and well-informed of their rights are less vulnerable to fall into labour 
exploitation in slave-like situations.   
</p>
<p><b> VI. Major challenges to the elimination of contemporary forms 
of slavery in Ecuador  
</b></p>
<p>71. Despite the legal, policy and institutional framework aimed at eradicating 
contemporary forms of slavery and the measures that illustrate the strong commitment 
towards the achievement of this goal, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, major challenges 
remain.  
</p>
<p>  
 36 Pursuant to the Code for Children and Adolescents, the minimum age of a worker should be 15 years 
</p>
<p>old. Regulations applicable to the work of children between the ages of 15 and 18 include a maximum 
of six hours of work per day and five days a week, on condition that the work does not interfere with

</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p><b> A. The conceptualization and implementation of programmes to eradicate 
slavery  
</b></p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur noted the significant knowledge of governmental authorities 
on the different dimensions and manifestations that slavery takes nowadays. She also 
observed with appreciation the commitment of the Government to translating the 
obligations of the State on the elimination of slavery-like practices into effective laws, 
policies and programmes. 
</p>
<p>73. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur observed that the current plans, 
programmes and policies rarely refer to forced labour or bonded labour, as a separate  form 
of contemporary slavery: in many instances these forms of slavery are seen as derivative of 
human trafficking.   
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur wishes to insist on the importance of mapping the State 
obligations on the elimination of both forced labour and bonded labour. In her view, such 
an exercise may facilitate the implementation of those obligations through specific laws, 
policies and programmes, which should include the follow-up to cases already detected and 
addressed.  
</p>
<p>75. The Special Rapporteur was very encouraged by the political will of the 
Government to evaluate current policies addressing contemporary forms of slavery as, in 
her view, it is only through a comprehensive and holistic assessment of the obstacles to 
their implementation that the elimination of contemporary forms of slavery will become a 
reality in Ecuador.  
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur also shares the Government&#8217;s view that the most pressing 
challenges are also chronic problems related to poverty, discrimination, impunity and the 
need to strengthen the implementation capacities of State actors and civil society 
organizations. In this regard, she noted during her visit a lack of knowledge among the local 
population, particularly its most vulnerable segments, about their rights and the 
corresponding mechanisms for their justiciability. She also noted in some instances, the 
lack of awareness of segments of the population in vulnerable situations, about available 
social programmes, including on the existence of cash transfer programmes and poverty 
bonds for families which should benefit from them. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The situation of migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees of Colombian 
origin 
</b></p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the significant efforts made over the 
years by the Government in declaring a policy of open doors for all those who seek 
protection in Ecuador, specifically, persons of Colombian origin.38 She also recognizes the 
several challenges in granting protection to asylum-seekers, refugees and other persons in 
need of international protection,39 particularly in the northern border area, which, as 
</p>
<p>  
 38 Information provided by UNHCR indicates that the implementation of the Enhanced Registration 
</p>
<p>Project, together with the regular process of refugee status determination at the Offices of the 
Department of Refugees in Quito, Cuenca and Lago Agrio, have made of Ecuador the country with 
the largest number of recognized refugees in Latin America. Figures available in December 2009 
showed a total of 45,192 refugees recognized in Ecuador, out of which 98.2 per cent are of 
Colombian origin. 
</p>
<p> 39 The Constitution of Ecuador recognizes in article 9 the equal protection of the law for all those under 
the jurisdiction of Ecuador. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/20/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>described in section II, has a complex socio-economic and security situation and 
systematically receives large migratory flows. 
</p>
<p>78. Information received by the Special Rapporteur indicates that migration inflows 
from Colombia into Ecuador are characterized by a mixture of economic immigrants in 
regular and irregular situations; smuggled migrants; victims of transnational organized 
crime, including trafficked victims for sexual commercial purposes, forced labour and 
bonded labour and asylum-seekers. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, this situation 
illustrates the need to address the causes and consequences of these phenomena, while, at 
the same time, undertake an assessment of the effectiveness of policies in place with a view 
to fully ensuring human rights-based responses and durable solutions. 
</p>
<p>79. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was also informed about the acute situation 
of labour exploitation, discrimination and, in some instances, xenophobia and related 
intolerance encountered by a great number of persons of Colombian origin, particularly in 
the northern border provinces.   
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur was also informed by stakeholders about the presence of 
refugees in the whole country and the constant inflow of persons in need of international 
refugee protection, mainly in the northern border area. In the city of Ibarra, located in the 
province of Imbabura, stakeholders reported the presence of refugees and asylum-seekers 
mainly from the provinces of Valle del Cauca and Nari&#241;o in Colombia, who are usually 
employed in the informal economy sector. Stakeholders also highlighted that an important 
number of persons of Colombian origin, enjoying different statuses (asylum-seekers, 
refugees, migrants, trafficked victims) were present in the cities of San Gabriel and El 
Carmelo in the province of Carchi, where they are victims of exploitation in different 
forms.   
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur wishes to highlight that, when the immigration and 
humanitarian situation of persons in need of protection remains invisible, it fuels their 
exploitation in slavery-like situations.  Their vulnerability has been reported to be used by 
employers in the banana, flower and palm oil industries.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Health, labour exploitation and slavery  
</b></p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur received information about instances of slavery-like labour 
exploitation in the banana, palm oil, flower and gold-mining industries. She also received 
information about the difficult working conditions faced by workers in these industries, 
particularly in connection with the detrimental health and environmental impact that some 
of the materials used.   
</p>
<p>83. Stakeholders and workers informed the Special Rapporteur during her visit that the 
fear of losing their jobs added to their situation of extreme poverty makes them accept all 
type of dangerous and unprotected conditions, including denouncing their right to social 
security and health care, low wages and excessive hours of work.  
</p>
<p>84. Information received indicates that many of the chemicals used in the above-
mentioned industries are highly toxic and pose potential dangers to humans and wildlife.  
Information received also documented cases of cancer, genetic malformations in the 
descendents of workers and physical injuries including accidental poisoning, partially due 
to lack of awareness on the danger posed by the products used and instructions on safety 
and equipment use. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur noticed that misinformation, 
climatic specifics and a lack of awareness about wearing specific protection equipment 
presents dangers for the health of workers. This information indicates the need for the 
Government to strengthen labour inspections on the work conditions in those industries, 
including their health and environmental impact. </p>

</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur also received information on the use of plastic bags coated 
with neurotoxic pesticides used to cover the maturing fruit and protect it from insect 
damage. The methods of disposal of these bags are allegedly uncontrolled and, therefore, 
their use poses high risks for children&#8217;s health: it was reported that girls are preparing these 
bags and washing them after use and boys are putting them on bananas. Their use also 
poses a high risk to the environment, including of malformations affecting the workers 
future generations.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> Ecuador has shown genuine efforts to establish policies aimed at the 
elimination of contemporary forms of slavery affecting different sectors of the 
population. The implementation of some of those policies, particularly in connection 
with the eradication of the worst forms of child labour, have proven the capacity of 
the State to progress towards the elimination of contemporary forms of slavery. The 
establishment of partnerships between the State and a variety of stakeholders, 
particularly in connection with alternatives of schooling for children in labour 
industries, also illustrates the proactive approach of the State to developing holistic 
policies and an environment conducive to eliminating the scourge of slavery in its 
contemporary forms. 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> Despite the progress made, the Special Rapporteur holds the view that 
contemporary forms of slavery persist in Ecuador and are directly related to 
pervasive instances of discrimination, social exclusion and poverty. They affect sectors 
of the population that have faced historical wrongdoings, such as Afro-descendents 
and indigenous peoples, as well as those whose conditions make them the easy prey of 
exploitation, such as children of impoverished families, asylum-seekers, refugees and 
irregular and smuggled migrants and women. These people are put into conditions 
that make them extremely vulnerable to slavery and slavery-like practices and are 
generally unaware of circumstances at work that amount to forced labour and/or 
bonded labour and about the rights they are entitled to as workers. They are also 
frequently uninformed or misinformed about the health risks of their job, including in 
some instances, about potential irreparable damages to their health and that of their 
future generations that can be caused by the use of dangerous chemicals. In some 
instances, they might also be lured into lending their children for small amounts of 
money, exposing them to slavery-like situations. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> Contemporary forms of slavery are also present mostly in the primary and 
tertiary sectors of the economy in specific labour industries such as gold-mining; 
flower and banana plantations; palm oil extraction; domestic servitude, and the</b> 
<b>informal economy sector. Based on her findings, the Special Rapporteur wishes to 
make the following recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Addressing the worst forms of child labour 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> The Special Rapporteur wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the 
definition of child labour provided by article 3(d) of ILO Convention No. 182</b>40<b> and to 
the accompanying recommendation No. 190 concerning the prohibition and 
</b></p>
<p>  
 40  Work which, by its nature of the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, 
</p>
<p>safety or morals of children. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/20/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour (1999) and 
encourages the State to: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Consider child work in the streets as one of the worst forms of child labour, 
given that the Special Rapporteur gathered evidence according to which the 
circumstances in which this work is carried out by children harm their safety 
and morals, exposing them to abusive practices, including sexual violence;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Take all necessary steps to implement the recommendations made by the 
Committee of the Rights of the Child in its 2010 concluding observations 
(CRC/C/ECU/CO/4), particularly those relating to the  economic exploitation of 
children, children in street situations and sexual exploitation and abuse of 
children; and to develop a mechanism to enhance the impact and coverage of 
existing programmes on prevention and protection of children from 
exploitation and slavery; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Implement the recommendations of the ILO Committee of Experts on the 
Application of Conventions and Recommendations, and the national plan to 
combat the trafficking of persons and commercial sexual exploitation and the 
plans to combat the commercial exploitation of children and the trafficking of 
children in Cuenca and Machala;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Increase resource allocation to build the capacity and number of labour 
inspectors so that they can effectively monitor labour practices throughout the 
country;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Introduce assessments on health and environmental impact of labour practices 
in the country within the system of labour inspectorates.  
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government initiative to undertake a 
national census in 2010 and strongly recommends that statistical information on child 
labour be included as a special chapter therein in a gender disaggregated manner.  
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Ministry of Labour Relations 
develop a nationwide policy to: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Enhance programmes addressing root causes of child labour in a holistic and 
comprehensive  manner and raise awareness on the rights of the child and 
on the worst forms of child labour as both a violation of the rights of the child 
and a contemporary form of slavery; and  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Monitor the compliance with the prohibition of the worst forms of child labour 
in all sectors of the economy. 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Institute for Children and 
Family (INFA) to undertake an evaluation of the programme of scholarships as a 
measure to prevent child labour, including its worst forms, as information received 
suggests it only has 40,000 beneficiaries. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Government should strengthen its cooperation with the civil society and 
the business community  in the prevention and protection of children against the 
worst forms of child labour and implement long-term comprehensive programmes for 
children. </b></p>

<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Measures to prevent slavery-like situations among asylum-seekers, 
refugees and migrants 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to strengthen measures to 
prevent slavery-like situations among asylum-seekers, refuges and migrants. Among 
those measures, the Government should increase efforts to implement the Mexico 
Declaration and Plan of Action to Strengthen the International Protection of Refugees 
in Latin America,</b>41<b> in particular to:  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Continue strengthening the capacity of national refugee commissions to 
guarantee respect for due process standards and ensuring asylum-seekers&#8217; 
access to refugee status determination procedures, establishing effective 
remedies, taking decisions on claims within a reasonable timeframe and 
establishing procedures for appealing a decision to an independent body;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Strengthen and enhance coverage of  programmes for self-sufficiency and local 
integration of refugees, including &#8211; but not limited to &#8211; fostering the generation 
of sources of employment, in particular, the establishment of microcredit 
systems; and simplifying procedures for authentication and recognition of 
certificates and diplomas issued abroad;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Promote the development of border areas through the consolidation of the 
presence of State institutions along with specific investments and projects 
sponsored by the international community, and to address basic infrastructure 
and community services needs, in particular in the areas of health and 
education, as well as to facilitate employment generation and productive 
projects, as necessary. All these endeavours should be gender- and age-
sensitive. The Government should also formulate and implement public 
awareness programmes targeting local populations to prevent negative feelings 
and all forms of discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> In connection with the protection of migrant workers and their families, 
regardless of immigration status, from labour exploitation and slavery-like situations, 
the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government establishes effective and 
accessible channels, which allow all &#8211; including irregular &#8211; migrant workers to lodge 
complaints on violations of their rights without fear of retaliation.  
</b></p>
<p><b> C. The protection of domestic workers against slavery-like practices 
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that domestic workers are protected by labour law and that effective 
remedies are in place, including gender- and age-sensitive mechanisms to 
denounce abuses by employers and receive the appropriate assistance and 
counselling, when required; 
</b></p>
<p>  
 41 The Mexico Declaration and Plan of Action to Strengthen the International Protection of Refugees in 
</p>
<p>Latin America was adopted by consensus in November 2004 as the outcome of the four subregional 
preparatory meetings held on the occasion of the  twentieth anniversary of the Cartagena Declaration 
on Refugees, at the initiative of the UNHCR, together with the Norwegian Refugee Council, the Inter-
American Commission on Human Rights, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the Inter-
American Institute of Human Rights and the Governments of Brazil, Costa Rica and Mexico.

<p>&#8226; <b>Address the legislative and practical barriers currently faced by domestic 
workers in having access to mechanisms of compensation and redress under 
employment legislation; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Strengthen awareness-raising programmes to combat prejudice against

increase efforts to raise awareness on domestic workers&#8217; rights as a way to 
prevent human rights abuses and exploitation in slave-like situations.  
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Assistance to victims 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Separate the mechanisms, plans and programmes dealing with  trafficking in 
persons and the smuggling of migrants as they are crimes that differ in nature 
and require different responses;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Establish special mechanisms for compensating victims of contemporary forms 
of slavery for the crimes committed towards them; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Take all necessary steps to prevent multiple discrimination and revictimization, 
ensuring that effective structures and mechanisms are put in place to assist 
victims to reintegrate  into society, including by providing them with 
psychological, health and social assistance; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Incorporate into national policies, plans and programmes, and effectively 
implement, the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and 
Human Trafficking (E/2002/68/Add.1); 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Consider signing the Council of Europe Convention on Action against 
Trafficking in Human Beings (which provides strong protection mechanisms 
and is open to non-member States) as a means to strengthening its legal 
framework and mechanisms for the protection of victims of contemporary 
forms of slavery. 
</b></p>
<p><b> E. Other recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to establish local 
programmes aimed at eradicating forced labour, bonded labour and other 
contemporary forms of slavery, and restoring and protecting the rights of victims. She 
also encourages the Government to raise awareness about such programmes as good 
practices, particularly in areas of the country where implementation gaps have been 
identified by the Government or other stakeholders.  
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to make available to the 
public information disaggregated by age and gender on the number of victims of 
contemporary forms of slavery that have been detected and assisted.  
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> In connection with information received about outbreaks of xenophobia and 
related intolerance against persons of Colombian origin, particularly near the 
northern border, which fuel anti-migrant sentiments and create an environment </b></p>

circumstances, the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>Take all necessary steps to uphold its obligation to respect the principle of non-

and xenophobia, guaranteeing the exercise of the rights of all persons under the 
jurisdiction of the State, particularly without any distinction on the grounds of 
national origin, economic status, immigration or refugee status or status of 
others in need of international protection.

<p>101.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Ministry of Coordination for 
Social Development:

<p>&#8226; <b>Elaborate policies to effectively coordinate activities among public institutions 
in connection with educational needs of child workers; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Increase efforts of coordination of policies aimed at bringing children up to the 
appropriate level of education;
