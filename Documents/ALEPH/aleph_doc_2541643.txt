properties.
There are no known proven reserves of minerals on Golden Goliath’s properties.  The Company does not have any
commercially producing mines or sites, nor is the Company in the process of developing any commercial mines or
sites.  The Company has not reported any revenue from operations since incorporation.  As such, the Company is
defined as an “exploration-stage company”.  The Company is not sufficiently capitalized with approximately $10,000 in
working capital at 11/30/2014 to fund the current exploration program, estimated at $0.5 million for Fiscal 2015.
FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION
In this Annual Report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in Canadian Dollars (“CDN$” or
“$”).    The  Government  of  Canada  permits  a  floating  exchange  rate  to  determine  the  value  of  the  Canadian  Dollar
against the U.S. Dollar (US$).
This Annual Report on Form 20-F contains forward-looking statements.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

discussion, expectation, or projection of future operating or financial performance, events or trends.  Forward-looking
statements  are  based  on  management's  current  expectations  and  assumptions,  which  are  inherently  subject  to
uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.  Actual outcomes and results may differ
materially from these expectations/assumptions due to changes in global political, economic, business, competitive,
market,  regulatory  and  other  factors.    We  undertake  no  obligation  to  publicly  update  or  review  any  forward-looking

3.A.3.  Exchange Rates
In this Annual Report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in Canadian Dollars (CDN$).  The
Government of Canada permits a floating exchange rate to determine the value of the Canadian Dollar against the U.S.
Dollar (US$).
The following table sets forth the rate of exchange for the Canadian Dollar at the end of the five most recent fiscal
periods ended August 31st, the average rates for the period, and the range of high and low rates for the period.  The
data for each month during the previous six months are also provided.
For purposes of this table, the rate of exchange means the noon buying rate in New York City for cable transfers in
foreign currencies as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The table sets forth the
number of Canadian Dollars required under that formula to buy one U.S. Dollar.  The average rate means the average
of the exchange rates on the last day of each month during the period.

3.D.  RISK FACTORS
In addition to the other information presented in this Annual Report, the following should be considered carefully in
evaluating the Company and its business.  This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks
and uncertainties.  The Company's actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking
statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual
Report.
Risks Pertaining to Golden Goliath
Cumulative  Unsuccessful  Exploration  Efforts  By  Golden  Goliath  Personnel  Could  Result  In  the  Company
Having to Cease Operations:
The expenditures to be made by Golden Goliath in the exploration of its properties as described herein may not result
in discoveries of mineralized material in commercial quantities.  Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery
of commercially mineable ore deposits and this occurrence could ultimately result in Golden Goliath having to cease
operations.  Management  feels  that  if  exploration  efforts  were  unsuccessful  for  a  period  of  ten  years,  the  Company
would cease operations. If that were the case, investors would lose their entire investment in the Company.
Golden Goliath Has No Reserves on the Properties in Which It Has an Interest and If Reserves Are Not Defined
the Company Could Have to Cease Operations:
The properties in which Golden Goliath has an interest or the concessions in which Golden Goliath has the right to
earn an interest are in the exploratory stage only and are without a known body of ore.  If Golden Goliath does not
ultimately find a body of ore, it would have to cease operations. As stated above, management believes that if reserves
were not defined on any of the properties on which Golden Goliath has an interest after a period of ten years, the
Company would cease operations.  If that were the case, investors would lose their entire investment in the Company.
- 6 -
Golden  Goliath  Has  Minimal  Positive  Cash  Flow  and  No  Recent  History  of  Significant  Earnings  and  Is
Dependent Upon Public and Private Distributions of Equity to Obtain Capital in Order to Sustain Operations.
Public distributions of capital result in dilution to existing shareholders:
None of Golden Goliath’s properties have advanced to the commercial production stage and Golden Goliath has no
history of earnings or positive cash flow from operations.  Golden Goliath does not know if it will ever generate material
revenue from mining operations or if it will ever achieve self-sustaining commercial mining operations. Historically, the
only  source  of  funds  available  to  Golden  Goliath  has  been  through  the  sale  of  its  common  shares.    Any  future
additional equity financing would cause dilution to current stockholders.
As of 12/15/2014, Golden Goliath currently had 6,700,000 share purchase options outstanding and 11,988,888 share
purchase  warrants  outstanding.    If  all  of  the  share  purchase  options  and  warrants  were  exercised,  the  number  of
common shares issued and outstanding would increase from 106,660,889 (as of 12/15/2014) to 125,349,777.  This
represents a potential increase of 17.6% in the number of shares issued and outstanding and would result in dilution to
current shareholders.
Dilution  Through  Employee/Director/Consultant  Options  Could  Adversely  Affect  Golden  Goliath’s
Stockholders
Because the success of Golden Goliath is highly dependent upon its respective employees, the Company has granted
to  some  or  all  of  its  key  employees,  Directors  and  consultants  options  to  purchase  common  shares  as  non-cash
incentives.  To the extent that significant numbers of such options may be granted and exercised, the interests of the
other  stockholders  of  the  Company  may  be  diluted.    At  12/15/2014,  there  were  6,700,000  share  purchase  options
outstanding, which, if exercised, would result in an additional 6,700,000 common shares being issued and outstanding.
 (For a breakdown of dilution, refer to the risk factor entitled: “Golden Goliath Has Minimal Positive Cash Flow and No
Recent History of Significant Earnings and Is Dependent Upon Public and Private Distributions of Equity to Obtain
Capital in Order to Sustain Operations.  Public distributions of capital will result in dilution to existing shareholders”).
The  Amount  of  Capital  Necessary  to  Meet  All  Environmental  Regulations  Associated  with  the  Exploration
Programs  of  Golden  Goliath  Could  Be  In  An  Amount  Great  Enough  to  Force  Golden  Goliath  to  Cease
Operations:
The current and anticipated future operations of Golden Goliath, including further exploration activities require permits
from  various  Federal  and  State  governmental  authorities  in  Mexico.    Such  operations  are  subject  to  various  laws
governing land use, the protection of the environment, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health,
waste disposal, toxic substances, mine safety and other matters.  Unfavorable amendments to current laws, regulations
and permits governing operations and activities of resource exploration companies, or more stringent implementation
thereof, could have a materially adverse impact on the Company and cause increases in capital expenditures which
could result in a cessation of operations by the Company.
Failure  to  comply  with  applicable  laws,  regulations  and  permitting  requirements  may  result  in  enforcement  actions
there under, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed,
and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial
actions. Parties engaged in resource exploration may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by
reason of the mining activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violation of applicable laws
or regulations.
Large increases in capital expenditures resulting from any of the above factors could force Golden Goliath to cease
operations.  If that were the case, investors would lose their entire investment in the Company.
The Risks Associated with Penny Stock Classification Could Affect the Marketability of the Common Stock of
Golden Goliath and Shareholders Could Find It Difficult to Sell Their Stock:
Golden Goliath’s stock is subject to “penny stock” rules as defined in 1934 Securities and Exchange Act rule 3a51-1.
 The Commission has adopted rules that  regulate  broker-dealer  practices  in  connection  with  transactions  in  penny
stocks.  Golden Goliath’s common shares are subject to these penny stock rules. Transaction costs associated with
purchases and sales of penny stocks are likely to be higher than those for other securities.  Penny stocks generally are
equity  securities  with  a  price  of  less  than  US$5.00  (other  than  securities  registered  on  certain  national  securities
exchanges  or  quoted  on  the  NASDAQ  system,  provided  that  current  price  and  volume  information  with  respect  to
transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system).
- 7 -
The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the
rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the nature
and level of risks in the penny stock market.  The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and
offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and
monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account.  The bid
and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer
orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the
customer’s confirmation.
In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from such
rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the
purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction.  These disclosure requirements may have
the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the Company’s common shares in the
United States and shareholders may find it more difficult to sell their shares.
Golden Goliath is Dependent on Key Personnel and the Absence of Any of These Individuals Could Result in
the Company Having to Cease Operations:
While engaged in the business of exploring mineral properties, the nature of Golden Goliath’s business, its ability to
continue  its  exploration  of  potential  exploration  projects,  and  to  develop  a  competitive  edge  in  the  marketplace,
depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and maintain qualified key management personnel.  Competition for such
personnel is intense and the Company may not be able to attract and retain such personnel.  Golden Goliath’s growth
will  depend,  on  the  efforts  of  its  Senior  Management,  particularly  its:  President/Director,  J.  Paul  Sorbara;  its
CFO/Corporate Secretary, Stephen Pearce; Daniel Fermandez, a Director and Manager of a wholly-owned subsidiary,
Minera Delta S.A. de C.V.
U.S.  Investors  May  Not  Be  Able  to  Enforce  Their  Civil  Liabilities  Against  Us  or  Our  Directors,  Controlling
Persons and Officers:
It may be difficult to bring and enforce suits against Golden Goliath.  Golden Goliath is a corporation incorporated in the
province of British Columbia under the British Columbia Business Corporations Act.  A substantial portion of Golden
Goliath’s assets are located outside of the United States, predominately in Mexico and Canada.  As a result, it may be
difficult for U.S. holders of our common shares to effect service of process on these persons within the United States or
to realize in the United States upon judgments rendered against them.  In addition, a shareholder should not assume
that the courts of Canada, (i) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against us or such persons
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws or other laws of the United States, or (ii)
would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against us or such persons predicated upon the U.S. federal securities
laws or other laws of the United States.
However, U.S. laws would generally be enforced by a Canadian court provided that those laws are not contrary to
Canadian public policy, are not foreign penal laws or laws that deal with taxation or the taking of property by a foreign
government and provided that they are in compliance with applicable Canadian legislation regarding the limitation of
actions.  Also, a Canadian court would generally recognize a judgment obtained in a U.S. Court except, for example:
a)
where the U.S. court where the judgment was rendered had no jurisdiction according to applicable Canadian law;
b)
the judgment was subject to ordinary remedy (appeal, judicial review and any other judicial proceeding which renders
the  judgment  not  final,  conclusive  or  enforceable  under  the  laws  of  the  applicable  state)  or  not  final,  conclusive  or
enforceable under the laws of the applicable state;
c)
the  judgment  was  obtained  by  fraud  or  in  any  manner  contrary  to  natural  justice  or  rendered  in  contravention  of
fundamental principles of procedure;
d)
a dispute between the same parties, based on the same subject matter has given rise to a judgment rendered in a
Canadian court or has been decided in a third country and the judgment meets the necessary conditions for recognition
in a Canadian court;
e)
the outcome of the judgment of the U.S. court was inconsistent with Canadian public policy;
f)
the  judgment  enforces  obligations  arising  from  foreign  penal  laws  or  laws  that  deal  with  taxation  or  the  taking  of
property by a foreign government; or
g)
there has not been compliance with applicable Canadian law dealing with the limitation of actions.
- 8 -
As a “foreign private issuer”, Golden Goliath is exempt from the Section 14 proxy rules and Section 16 of the
1934 Securities Act. This could result in shareholders having less complete and timely Data
The submission of proxy and annual meeting of shareholder information (prepared to Canadian standards) on Form 6-
K may result in shareholders having less complete and timely data.  The exemption from Section 16 rules regarding
sales of common shares by insiders may result in shareholders having less data.
Mineral Prices May Not Support Corporate Profit for Golden Goliath:
Risks Pertaining to the Industry
The resource exploration industry is intensely competitive and even if commercial quantities of mineral resources are
developed (which is not guaranteed), a profitable market may not exist for the sale.  If a profitable market does not exist,
Golden Goliath could have to cease operations.
Operating Hazards and Risks Associated with the Exploration-stage Mining Industry Could Result in Golden
Goliath Having to Cease Operations:
Resource  exploration  activities  generally  involve  a  high  degree  of  risk.    Hazards  such  as  unusual  or  unexpected
formations and other conditions are involved.  Operations in which Golden Goliath has a direct or indirect interest will
be subject to all the hazards and risks normally incidental to exploration for precious and base metals, any of which
could  result  in  work  stoppages,  damage  to  or  destruction  of  exploration  facilities,  damage  to  life  and  property,
environmental damage and legal liability for any or all damage.  Golden Goliath may become subject to liability for
cave-ins and other hazards for which it cannot insure or against which it may elect not to insure where premium costs
are disproportionate to the Company’s perception of the relevant risks.  The payment of such insurance premiums and
of such liabilities would reduce the funds available for exploration activities and could force Golden Goliath to cease
operations.

4.B.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Corporate Overview
Golden Goliath Resources Ltd. is a junior exploration company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (symbol GNG).
 The Company is focused on exploring and developing the gold and silver potential of an historic mining camp located
in  the  Sierra  Madre  Occidental  Mountains  of  northwestern  Mexico.    The  Uruachic  mining  camp  lies  directly  in  the
center of the several-hundred-kilometer trend of important past producers and new discoveries that characterize the
Sierra Madre Occidental.  Uniquely, Golden Goliath controls an entire old mining camp, or district, that covers an area
of 15-kilometers by 25-kilometers, with numerous past-producing gold and silver mines dating back to the time of the
Spaniards.  Golden Goliath’s Uruachic claims are owned 100% by the Company (except Corona which has a 40% JV
interest with Comstock) and are fully paid for with no property option or purchase payments to make.
Golden Goliath also owns two other significant properties outside of the Uruachic Camp.
- 11 -
One of these is a silver property called La Cruz, which is located on the eastern edge of the Sierra Madre Belt.   La
Cruz has several old mine workings and extensive old dumps, attesting to considerable past production.  However the
property has been inactive for at least 75 years and there are no available records of production or previous exploration
drilling.    La  Cruz  gained  the  attention  of  well-known  international  silver  producer,  Pan  American  Silver,  and  in
September  2007,  Golden  Goliath  signed  an  Option  and  Joint  Venture  Agreement  with  Pan  American’s  Mexican
subsidiary.  Under the terms of the option agreement, Pan American Silver Corp’s Mexican subsidiary, Minera Corner
Bay S.A. de C.V., has the right to earn a 60% interest in La Cruz by making cash payments totaling US$300,000 and
spending US$450,000 on the property over a period of three years.  The property will consist of: the Company’s La
Cruz  property;  additional  ground  staked  around  the  La  Cruz  property;  and  the  La  Cruzada  property  for  which  Pan
American’s subsidiary already has an option.  Golden Goliath will be responsible for 25% of the costs associated with
La Cruzada.  Upon Minera Corner Bay exercising its option, a 60/40 joint venture would proceed on the La Cruz and
newly staked grounds, with Pan American having the right to earn an additional 15% by completing a feasibility study.
 This option was terminated after an initial drill program conducted by Corner Bay.
The other exploration property that Golden Goliath owns is called Chamizal.  This property differs from the others in
that it is a lead, zinc, silver target and it lies outside of the Sierra Madre in central Chihuahua State.  This region hosts
two lead, zinc, silver mines called Santa Eulalia and Naica.  Together these two deposits have produced 60 million
tonnes of ore grading 15% combined lead-zinc and 150 grams silver per tonne.  The Chamizal Property is hosted in
the same geological formation as the Santa Eulalia and Naica and also has the same style of alteration.  Chamizal
also has old workings that were used to produce lead, zinc and silver, and as in Uruachic, these workings have never
been drilled.”

In May 2007 and amended April 2011, the Company optioned to Comstock Metals Ltd. (“Comstock”) the right to earn
up  to  a  75%  and  60%  interest  respectively  in  the  Corona  and  El  Chamizal  properties  in  exchange  for  Comstock
spending $500,000 and $200,000 on the respective properties before February 8, 2014, and issuing 300,000 (300,000
common  shares  received)  and  150,000  (25,000  common  shares  received)  common  shares  respectively  to  the
Company over a period of two years. In order to keep the option in good standing, Comstock paid $50,000 and issued
an additional 200,000 common shares to the Company.
The Company has received notice from Comstock that it has spent in excess of $1,000,000 at Corona and effective
April  9,  2013  the  Company  and  Comstock  entered  into  a  joint  venture  agreement  to  further  explore  the  property
whereby  Comstock  shall  act  as  the  operator.    The  Company  is  responsible  for  40%  of  all  exploration  costs  going
forward.  The Company has been advised that Comstock no longer wishes to participate in the joint venture, as such,
the Company is responsible for 100% of the costs for the Corona Property.
Comstock has advised the Company that it will no longer proceed with the El Chamizal option and has returned a
100% interest in the Property back to the Company.

Material Effects of Government Regulations
In October 2013, the Mexican government enacted significant changes to the mining tax and royalty regime which have
significant impacts on the mining industry.  As the changes are very recent, it is still uncertain what the final impact of
these changes will have on the Company, however, the Company has initiated a review of these changes to see how
they will impact the business of the Company.
The Company's exploration activities are subject to extensive and costly environmental requirements regulated in all
countries  in  which  the  Company  operates  under  various  federal,  state,  provincial  and  local  laws  relating  to  the
protection  of  the  environment,  which  generally  includes  air  and  water  quality,  hazardous  waste  management  and
reclamation.    Environmental  hazards  may  exist  on  the  properties  in  which  the  Company  holds  interests  which  are
unknown to the Company at present and which have been caused by previous or existing owners or operators of the
properties.  Environmental  legislation  is  evolving  in  a  manner  that  will  require  stricter  standards  and  enforcement,
increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and
a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees.  Current and future
laws,  regulations  and  permits  will  impose  significant  costs,  liabilities  or  obligations  or  could  limit  or  prevent  the
Company’s ability to continue operations or undertake new operations.
In particular, regulatory requirements to which the Company is subject to in Mexico include certain permits that require
periodic  or  annual  renewal  with  governmental  and  regulatory  authorities.    In  addition,  the  Company  is  required  to
comply with existing permit conditions.  The Company believes that it is currently in full compliance with existing permit
conditions.  Although its permits have been renewed by governmental and regulatory authorities in the past, there is a
risk  that  the  applicable  governmental  and  regulatory  authorities  will  not  renew  the  permits  as  they  expire,  or  that
pending or future permit applications will not be granted, or that existing permits will be revoked.  In the event that the
required  permits  are  not  granted  or  renewed  in  a  timely  manner,  or  in  the  event  that  governmental  and  regulatory
authorities determine that the Company is not in compliance with its existing permits, the Company may be forced to
suspend operations.
Fiscal 2014 Property Acquisition and Exploration
First Quarter 2014
Overall Performance
During the first fiscal quarter, ending 11/30/2013, exploration activities of the Company were focused on the report
compilation  and  writing  stage  from  the  program  of  underground  rehabilitation,  mapping,  and  sampling  on  the  San
Timoteo property that had been ongoing throughout the preceding quarters.  Cost cutting measures were implemented
company-wide  in  2013  due  to  market  conditions  and  no  new  field  work  was  initiated  on  the  Company’s  other
properties.  The Company looks to advance the properties by way of partnerships, strategic alliances and possible
future equity financings depending on market conditions and seeking out these opportunities was done during the first
quarter and is ongoing.
San Timoteo Property
The exploration program on the San Timoteo property was concentrated in the area of the past producing San Martin
mine. Numerous sub levels were opened for the first time since the mine shut down, believed to be around the time of
the Mexican Revolution.  This was followed by surveying, detailed geological and structural mapping, clay mineralogy
analysis and structural setting studies. The detailed rock sampling on many levels showed the presence of several
high grade ore shoots along the 500 metre trend of the main level.  The depth extension and dimensions of these
shoots needs to be determined, as well as grades at depth. This work was conducted on a low cost basis, without the
use  of  mechanized  equipment  and  expensive  sub-contractors,  in  accordance  with  the  Company’s  cost-cutting
measures.  The Company’s ability to do this stems from the property’s location adjacent to the town of Uruachic, which
is a source of excellent local labor.
- 15 -
The Uruachic district is a nested caldera complex, which is one of several associated with other producing mines in the
northern  region  of  the  Sierra  Madre  Occidental  geologic  province.    Some  of  these  are  well  known,  large  regional
structures, such as the Ocampo caldera.  The Uruachic complex lies to the southeast of the Ocampo caldera.  Calderas
that are not excessive in geological age often have a circular topographical expression. The local structural setting
analysis of the northern portion of the Uruachic area, where the San Timoteo property lies, showed that the San Martin
workings lie on the edge of a smaller circular feature, within the complex, at the point of intersection with linear features
interpreted to be faults.  This is viewed as a favorable setting for the development of caldera related mineral deposits.
 The program also involved revisiting data from old drill holes that were completed further to the west, away from the
San  Martin  workings.    Potential  for  deeper,  porphyry-related  copper  and  gold  mineralization  was  identified.    The
Company is pleased with the results of this work.  Further refinements to the main report and additional data plotting
and 3D-modeling, carried on into the following quarter and is still ongoing.
Other Properties
During the quarter ending 11/30/2013 no significant new work was conducted on the Company’s other properties.
Second Quarter 2014
Overall Performance
During the second fiscal quarter, ending 2/28/2014, exploration activities of the Company were focused on refining the
plans and sections highlighting the area 500-level adit and the area beneath it in the old San Martin mine.  This was
the completion of the program of underground rehabilitation, mapping, and sampling on the San Timoteo property that
had  been  ongoing  throughout  the  preceding  quarters.    Cost  cutting  measures  were  implemented  company-wide  in
2013 and 2014 due to market conditions.  The Company has parties interested in possible option agreements and
conducted several tours of certain properties, including Las Bolas. A small program of rehabilitation was initiated in
March  on  the  El  Manto  tunnel,  which  is  located  on  the  western  side  of  the  Las  Bolas  property,  in  order  to  further
facilitate this review.  The Company looks to advance the properties by way of partnerships, strategic alliances and
possible future equity financings depending on market conditions.
San Timoteo Property
The exploration program on the San Timoteo property was concentrated in the area of the past producing San Martin
mine.    The  principal  workings  at  San  Martin  are  located  at  the  500-level  adit,  which  has  a  diameter  of  over  three
meters, making it the largest diameter tunnel on any of the Golden Goliath properties.  The 500 level is over 500 meters
long and is also the only old working in the Uruachic camp known to have used tracks.  The mapping and sampling
program revealed that there are three mineralized shoots exposed within San Martin.  A zone of manto, or blanket, style
mineralization was also identified in this area.  The shoot closest to the entrance of the 500-level tunnel is known as
Manatial.  All structures contained gold/silver values from continuous channel sampling: this structure is exposed for 32
meters; in the central area of the tunnel, the La Cascada structure is exposed for 78 meter; and at the far end of the 500
level, the Pozo de Agua structure is exposed for at least 84 meters.  Additional non continuous sampling outside of this
section also returned good values.  The true thickness and grade of the blanket or manto style mineralization is not
certain due to limited exposure.  Modeling of the three shoots dimensions and grades below the 500 level is uncertain
due  to  lack  of  drill  data  in  the  specific  areas,  but  relatively  nearby  drill  holes  do  show  significant  mineralization.
 Potential for deeper, porphyry-related copper and gold mineralization was identified by this program.
Other Properties
During the quarter ending 2/28/2014,no significant new work was conducted on the Company’s other properties.
Third Quarter 2014
Overall Performance
During the third quarter ending 5/31/2014, cleaning and rehabilitation work continued at the El Manto tunnel on the
Company’s Las Bolas property.  Presentations about the Company’s properties as well as field tours and discussions
about possible options and/or partnership agreements also continued.  Cost cutting measures continued company-
wide  due  to  market  conditions.    The  Company  looks  to  advance  the  properties  by  way  of  partnerships,  strategic
alliances and possible future equity financings depending on market conditions.

Las Bolas Property - El Manto Tunnel
The old El Manto Mine lies on the western side of the Las Bolas property at the lowest topographical area on the
property, adjacent to the Rio Uruachic river.  It is located approximately 888 metres west of the old Las Bolas Mine and
368 meters topographically below it.  El Manto is 1,545 meters west of the Los Hilos Mine, which is on the east side of
the Las Bolas property and about 555 vertical meters lower than Los Hilos.  The old El Manto Mine is reported by
locals as having produced high grade silver mineralization, grading up to 10kg/ton, in manto style mineralization.
There are actually two tunnels in the old El Manto Mine area.  Rehabilation of one of these was attempted in 2010.
 Geological mapping and sampling was conducted, but due to the intense alteration and oxidation of the rock, this
tunnel collapsed and work had to cease for safety reasons.  In March 2014, the rehabilitation of the second tunnel was
started. The tunnel has now been cleared for a distance of 60 meters. Preliminary mapping has identified oxidized
manto  or  “blanket”  zones,  as  well  as  mineralized  faults  containing  lead,  zinc  and  silver  mineralization  as  well  as
intense, pervasive clay alteration.  This work had to be stopped at the end of May due to rockfalls causing dangerous
working conditions.  Extensive timbering will be required to continue this work.
Other Properties
During the quarter ending 5/31/2014, Golden Goliath personnel conducted site visits by other parties on several of the
Company’s  properties  in  the  Uruachic  district.    No  significant  new  work  was  conducted  on  the  Company’s  other
properties.
Fourth Quarter 2014 and Fiscal Year
Overall Performance
During the year ended 8/31/2014 no significant field work was conducted on the Company’s properties. Presentations
about the Company’s properties as well as field tours and discussions about possible options and/or partnerships were
conducted.
Cost  cutting  measures  continued  company-wide  due  to  market  conditions.    The  Company  looks  to  advance  the
properties  by  way  of  partnerships,  strategic  alliances  and  possible  future  equity  financings  depending  on  market
conditions.
Other Properties
During the year ended 8/31/2014, Golden Goliath personnel conducted site visits by other parties on several of the
Company’s  properties  in  the  Uruachic  district.    No  significant  new  work  was  conducted  on  the  Company’s  other
properties.
Fiscal 2013 Property Acquisition and Exploration
First Quarter 2013
Overall Performance
During the first fiscal quarter ended 11/30/2012, work on the Company’s properties consisted mostly of data review and
recompilation  of  previous  exploration  work  on  properties  including  La  Reforma,  San  Timoteo,  Nueva  Union  and  la
Barranca  in  light  of  the  new  deposit  model  generated  by  the  discovery  at  Orisyvo.    Looking  for  evidence  of  high
sulphidation  epithermal  mineralization  related  to  porphyryitic  intrusions  is  important  as  we  want  to  thoroughly
investigate the potential of those properties for hosting that type of mineralization.  Porphyritic intrusions exist on the La
Reforma and San Timoteo properties and the data review did show some potential on them as well as giving us a
better understanding of the low sulphidation epithermal potential on the Nueva Union property, which has several old
workings and has never been drilled.  New work on Nopalera was limited to analyzing data already collected and the
selection of possible drill holes.  This allowed the Company to be prepared for drilling on the property while conserving
capital during the downturn in the markets.
Las Bolas Property
During the first quarter, Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited (“Agnico-Eagle”) completed their first year’s work commitment on
the Las Bolas property. Agnico-Eagle’s work comprised mainly diamond drilling.  Under the terms of the Earn-In and
Shareholders agreement between Agnico-Eagle and the Company, Agnico has the right to earn a 51% interest in the
property by spending $5,000,000 on the property over a period of five years.  The first year’s work commitment is a firm
commitment of $500,000 with expenditure requirements increasing each year thereafter.  Upon exercising its option,
Agnico will have the right to earn an additional 20% interest by spending $6,000,000 over another period of four years
and completing a feasibility study or by spending $10,000,000 over a longer period of eight years.
- 17 -
Corona Property
On the Corona property, Comstock Metals Ltd., having completed the necessary expenditures and payments has now
earned a 60% interest in the property.  Exploration of the property will continue under a 60/40 Joint Venture.  Legal
work by both parties to draft the agreement outlining the specific terms of the agreement are in progress.
Other Properties
During the first quarter, no significant new work was conducted on the Company’s other properties.
Second Quarter 2013
Overall Performance
During the s cond fiscal quarter ended 2/28/2013, work on the Company’s properties consisted mostly of data review
and initiating the rehabilitation of the San Martin adit on the San Timoteo property.  The adit was cleaned and sampled
several years ago, but as this tunnel makes water it has become filled with mud and potentially dangerous to re-enter.
 The previous data review led the Company to the conclusion that the San Martin area has very significant potential
and the earlier work inside the old mine was done before the Company acquired the services of Ing. Jorge Madrigal,
who has significant experience in detailed underground mapping.  New work on Nopalera was focused on making
detailed sections across the property in order to better understand the geological situation at depth.
Las Bolas Property
During the second quarter, Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited (“Agnico-Eagle”) delivered the report of their first year’s work
on the Las Bolas/Los Hilos property.  During this first year of the option agreement a program of diamond drilling that
consisted of 2,803.5 meters of NQ diameter diamond drilling in ten holes of varying lengths was completed.  A total of
2,712 samples were taken from this core for analysis by ALS Chemex.  Of the ten holes in this program, eight were
located in the area known as the Filo de Oro Trend, which includes the old Los Hilos adit, and two were located in the
area known as “El Orito”, which is also on the eastern side of the property.
The  drilling  program  was  oriented  with  the  purpose  of  looking  for  mineralized  structures,  such  as  veins,  stockwork
zones, faults and fractures parallel to the known structural trends in the area in order to extend the mineralized zones
previously indicated by Golden Goliath’s work.  Eight of the ten holes had mineralized intersections extending these
target areas.  This includes hole ALH-12-001which extended the “Crucero Largo” zone by 120 meters.  This structure is
adjacent to, and strikes perpendicular to, the main Los Hilos vein.  A zone of disseminated mineralization, hosted in
riodacite, rhyolite and volcanic agglomerate, was also intersected above the old Los Hilos mine tunnel in hole ALH-12-
003 and mineralized structures were encountered below this old tunnel in hole ALH-12-008.  The two holes in the El
Orito zone were also encouraging and this zone was pointed out as a good target for further drilling.  Golden Goliath
believes  that  these  results  have  grown  the  known  mineralization  on  the  property.    The  report  recommended  more
drilling on the property including the El Orito and Las Bolas areas as well as further surface work.  The second year’s
drilling program is scheduled to commence in early May 2013.
Other Properties
During the second quarter, no significant new work was conducted on the Company’s other properties.
Third Quarter 2013
Overall Performance
During the third fiscal quarter ended 5/31/2013,, work on the Company’s properties consisted mostly of data review and
underground work on the San Martin adit, which is on the San Timoteo property.  New work on Nopalera was focused
on making detailed sections across the property in order to better understand the geological situation at depth.
Las Bolas Property
During the third quarter, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (“Agnico”) commenced the second year of drilling on the Las
Bolas property.
- 18 -
San Timoteo
During  the  third  quarter.  the  Company  continued  a  program  of  underground  rehabilitation  (dewatering),  detailed
geological and structural mapping and channel sampling within the old San Martin adit on the San Timoteo property.
 Ing. Madrigal reviewed the previous work and highly recommended continuing these efforts. New levels have been
opened and the geologic staff is very pleased with the results to date, especially considering that very little drilling has
been done in this area and the targets being generated are essentially untested.  The new assay data is presently
being compiled and will be released when the
report is completed.
Nopalera
During  the  second  quarter,  the  Company  completed  its  surface  exploration  program  on  the  Nopalera  property.
 Nopalera is adjacent to the new discovery by Fresnillo PLC called Orisyvo.  Orisyvo already has a large published
resource of gold and of silver.  The mineralization is related to a porphyry intrusion. Fresnillo has already spent $150
million  at  Orisyvo  and  has  announced  that  they  plan  to  spend  another  $800  million  to  bring  the  property  to  the
production  stage.    This  new  discovery  has  spurred  extensive  upgrading  of  the  local  infrastructure  by  the  State
government,  including  the  widening  and  paving  of  the  50-kilometer  access  road  leading  to  the  area.    These
infrastructure improvements will greatly benefit the district and the Company.  The discovery of such an important gold
deposit  also  is  likely  to  focus  attention  on  the  region.    Golden  Goliath’s  Nopalera  property  has  similar  geology,
alteration,  pathfinder  element  geochemistry  to  Orisyvo  as  well  as  old  workings,  and  is  immediately  adjacent  to  the
discovery claim.  Nopalera is a large property and hosts four porphyry intrusions, three of which have been found to be
mineralized.  Potential drill targets have been generated, but the Company has decided to wait for better market and
financial conditions before any drilling.
Other Properties
During the third quarter, no significant new work was conducted on the Company’s other properties.
Fourth Quarter 2013 and Fiscal Year
Overall Performance
During the year ended August 31, 2013, work on the Company’s properties consisted mostly of underground work on
the San Martin adit, which is on the San Timoteo property and data compilation.  The previous data review led the
Company to the conclusion that the San Martin area has significant potential.
New work on Nopalera was focused on making detailed sections across the property in order to better understand the
geological situation at depth.
Las Bolas Property
During 2012 and 2013, the Las Bolas property was subject to an Earn-in and Shareholders Agreement with Agnico
Eagle Mines Ltd. Under the terms of this agreement AEM was required to spend a total of $5million in exploration in
order to earn a 51% of the Las Bolas Property.
Las Bolas is a fairly large property with extensive  old  workings  across  an  area  that  is  3  kilometres  east-west  by  1
kilometre  north-south.    Known  mineralization  also  extends  over  a  vertical  range  of  about  700  metres.  Historical
production of high grade silver and gold from the old workings was substantial and the silver used in coins minted in
the town of Uruachic during the 1800’s are believed to come from this property.
During  the  last  two  years,  AEM  completed  two  small  drill  programs  totalling  about  3,500  metres.    The  holes  were
mostly shallow and many of these holes intersected previously unknown areas of mineralization.  Most of the AEM drill
holes, including all of those completed in the first year, were located on the eastern portion of the property, in the Las
Hilos  area.  During  that  first  year  of  the  option  agreement  the  program  consisted  of  2,803.5  meters  of  NQ  diameter
diamond drilling in 10 holes of varying lengths was completed.  A total of 2,712 samples were taken from this core for
analysis by ALS Chemex.  That drilling program was oriented with the purpose of looking for mineralized structures,
such  as  veins,  stockwork  zones,  faults  and  fractures  parallel  to  the  known  structural  trends  in  the  area  in  order  to
extend the mineralized zones previously indicated by Golden Goliath’s work.  Eight of the ten holes had mineralized
intersections extending these target areas.
- 19 -
During the second year, a much smaller program of drilling was conducted which included a few holes near the main
zone of the extensive old Las Bolas workings, on the western side of the property. However, many of the old workings
in this area were not drill tested by them. The deeper El Manto zone, which lies even further west, was also not tested
by AEM.  In the El Manto area massive sulphide mineralization with good gold and silver grades was intersected by the
Company in a previous reverse circulation drilling program.
Following the work conducted in Spring 2013, AEM considered that the results of their drilling were not sufficient to
carry on with the required $5 million total expenditures required to earn 51% of the Las Bolas Property.  The Company
believes the property has very significant potential but understands AEM’s decision, especially in the light of current
share prices and market capitalization.
The Company, which is conserving cash, has not yet resumed its own work on this property and would prefer to option
it to a third party.  Another substantial silver producing company has recently visited Las Bolas and has expressed
interest in further visits and possible negotiations in the New Year.
San Timoteo
Throughout much of the 2012-2013 fiscal year, the Company conducted a detailed program of underground exploration
on the old San Martin Mine workings, which lie in the northeast corner of its 100% owned San Timoteo property.  This
program  included  substantial  underground  rehabilitation  before  conducting  the  detailed  exploration  work,  which
included  geological  and  structural  mapping,  extensive  detailed  rock  sampling  and  clay  mineralogical  studies.
 Previously unknown levels and workings were re-opened, cleaned, mapped and sampled. The Company is pleased
with the results of this work, which returned excellent gold and silver values in several areas, indicated epithermal
potential  at  depth,  defined  areas  for  future  drilling  and  demonstrated  the  possibility  of  deeper  porphyry-related
mineralization.    Very  little  drilling  has  been  done  in  San  Martin  area  of  the  San  Timoteo  property  and  the  targets
generated,  which  include  mineralized  shoots  as  well  as  mantos,  are  essentially  untested.    The  2013  exploration
program  in  the  San  Martin  area  was  conducted  without  the  use  of  expensive  mechanized  equipment  in  order  to
conserve funds during the current market downturn.  The Company’s ability to do this stems from the property’s location
adjacent to the town of Uruachic, which is a source of excellent local labor.  The Company is currently evaluating its
options for the future exploration of this attractive target.
Nopalera
During the fiscal year ending August 31, 2013, the Company completed its intermittent surface exploration program on
the Nopalera property.  The program consisted of detailed geological and structural mapping as well as geochemical
surveys  and  clay  mineralogy  studies.  The  results  of  the  program  were  very  encouraging.  Four  distinct  porphyryitic
intrusions were identified, three of which are mineralized. Anomalous gold zones were outlined and high temperature
clay minerals indicate alteration associated with hydrothermal fluids. The regional structural setting of the property was
also interpreted and it was determined that the setting is analogous to known gold and silver deposits in the northern
Sierra  Madre  region.    Many  similarities  between  Nopalera  and  the  Orisyvo  discovery  were  identified,  including  the
distribution of pathfinder elements. Future drill targets were also defined and recommended.
Nopalera is adjacent to the large new discovery by Fresnillo PLC called Orisyvo.  Orisyvo already has a significant
published gold and silver resource.  The mineralization is related to a porphyry intrusion. Fresnillo has already spent
$150 million at Orisyvo and has announced that they plan to spend another $800 million to bring the property to the
production  stage.    This  new  discovery  has  spurred  extensive  upgrading  of  the  local  infrastructure  by  the  State
government, including the widening and paving of the 50 km access road leading to the area.  These infrastructure
improvements will greatly benefit the district and the Company.  The discovery of such an important gold deposit also is
likely to focus attention on the region.
Last year’s work by the Company on the Nopalera property has greatly enhanced our understanding of the property
and  has  demonstrated  that  the  property  has  excellent  potential  for  hosting  various  types  of  precious  metal
mineralization, including the large tonnage porphyry – associated type being developed at Orisyvo. Nopalera is a large
property,  approximately  five-kilometers  by  five-kilometers,  and  to  date  only  the  southern  portion  has  received
substantial exploration work. This further blue sky potential further enhances the attractiveness of the property.  Drilling
of the defined targets would require a substantial investment and the Company has decided to wait for better market
and financial conditions before proceeding with any drilling.

Other Properties
During  the  fiscal  year  ending  August  31,  2013  no  significant  new  work  was  conducted  on  the  Company’s  other
properties.
Fiscal 2012 Property Acquisition and Exploration
First Quarter
During December 2011, the Company signed the final Earn-in and Shareholders Agreement with Agnico-Eagle Mines
Limited (“Agnico”) (NYSE: AEM) (TSX: AEM) for the exploration and development of the Company’s Las Bolas/Los
Hilos  property.    During  the  first  quarter,  preliminary  work  continued  on  the  Nopelera  property  including  to  the  date
hereof with a focus on mapping and sampling all outcrops, road building and rehabilitation of old adits.
Las Bolas Property: During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2011 the Company completed its drilling program on the
Las Bolas/Los Hilos property and then worked with the legal team from Agnico the final agreement for the Las Bolas
property option and joint venture.  During December 2011, the Company signed the final Earn-in and Shareholders
Agreement with Agnico for the exploration and development of the Company’s Las Bolas/Los Hilos property (see map).
  Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  which  is  subject  to  conditions,  including  TSX-V  approval,  Agnico’s  Mexican
subsidiary has the right to earn a 51% interest in the property by spending $5,000,000 on the property over a period of
five  years.    The  first  year’s  work  commitment  is  a  firm  commitment  of  $500,000  with  expenditure  requirements
increasing each year thereafter. Upon exercising its option, Agnico will have the right to earn an additional 20% interest
by spending $6 million over another period of four years and completing a feasibility study or by spending $10 million
over a longer period of eight years.  The Company views this agreement as an important milestone.
Nopalera Property:  During  the  quarter  ending  November  30,  2011,  the  Company  continued  field  work  on  its  100%
owned Nopalera property.  This work was designed to develop specific drill targets to be tested in Calendar 2012.
 Nopalera is a large claim that adjoins the Los Hilos claims on the west side.  Nopalera hosts a very large and intense
alteration zone that is related to a porphyry intrusion and has a chemical trace element signature that is very similar the
Fresnillo PLC’s new flagship discovery called Orisyvo; the Orisyvo claims are contiguous to the Nopalera property on
its south east corner.  Fresnillo’s sister company, Peñoles, has also surrounded the Golden Goliath claims with their
own staking.  This has led to the development of what is essentially an area play with three major companies, Frenillo,
Peñoles and Agnico and one junior company, namely Golden Goliath.  The Company believes that Nopalera has a
geologic setting, stratigraphic interval and pathfinder distribution pattern which indicates that gold mineralization may
lie  at  depth.    These  characteristics  are  also  very  similar  to  those  believed  to  be  present  at  the  Orisyvo.  Work  on
Nopalera during the quarter included geological mapping, sampling, and analysis of clay alteration minerals using the
Company’s  Terraspec  apparatus,  as  well  as  the  construction  of  new  access  roads.    The  Company  is  pursuing  an
aggressive  exploration  program  for  the  Nopalera  claim  leading  to  a  major  diamond  drilling  program  as  soon  as
practicable.
Other Properties: Throughout the quarter ended November 2011, the Company did not perform any significant work on
its other properties.  With work on the Las Bolas and Los Hilos properties being conducted by Agnico, the Company is
looking forward to focusing on some of these other properties.
Second Quarter
Nopalera Property:  During  the  quarter  ending  February  29,  2012,  the  Company  continued  surface  fieldwork  on  its
100% owned Nopalera property.  This work was designed to develop specific drill targets to be tested in 2012.  Work
on Nopalera during the quarter included geological mapping, sampling, and analysis of clay alteration minerals using
the Company’s Terraspec apparatus, as well as the construction of new access roads.  The Company is pursuing an
aggressive  exploration  program  for  the  Nopalera  claim  leading  to  a  major  diamond  drilling  program  as  soon  as
practicable.
Other Properties: Throughout the quarter ended February 29, 2012, the Company did not perform any significant work
on its other properties.
- 21 -
Third Quarter
Nopalera Property: During the quarter ending May 31, 2012, the Company continued surface field work on its 100%
owned  Nopalera  property.    This  work  is  designed  to  develop  specific  drill  targets.    Nopalera  is  a  large  claim  that
adjoins the Los Hilos claims on the west side.  Nopalera hosts a very large and intense alteration zone which is related
to a porphyry intrusion and has a chemical trace element signature that is very similar the Fresnillo PLC’s new flagship
discovery called Orisyvo.  Work on Nopalera during the quarter included geological mapping, sampling, and analysis
of clay alteration minerals using the Company’s Terraspec apparatus, as well as the construction of new access roads.
The  Company  is  pursuing  an  aggressive  exploration  program  for  the  Nopalera  claim  leading  to  a  major  diamond
drilling program as soon as practicable.
Other Work being conducted Regionally: Over the years the entire Camp has been covered by mineral claims.  While
Golden Goliath was first to the Camp and believes it has the best ground, the most significant work is being done
adjacent  to  Golden  Goliath’s  Nopalera  property  by  Fresnillo  PLC  who  drilled  37,580  meters  in  51  holes  and
constructed the first 300 meters of an exploration adit in 2011 on their Orisyvo project; further, they state that in 2012
they  plan  to  continue  drilling  from  surface  and  underground  and  study  mining  methodology  and  conduct  further
metallurgical testing.
Our Nopalera claim itself is about four-kilometers by four-kilometres, adjacent to Orisyvo with the border about eight
kilometers from the adit.  Less than a third of Nopalera has been explored to date.  The best explored portion of the
property already has several drill targets and our exploration team is greatly encouraged by the work to date and the
similarities  to  Orisyvo  and  eagerly  anticipate  the  start  of  the  first  diamond  drilling  program  on  the  property.    While
Fresnillo  has  been  conducting  the  bulk  of  the  work  within  the  Uruachic  Mining  Camp,  Peñoles  S.A.  de  C.V.  has
completely surrounded our claims.  Essentially we  have  a  closed  gate  community  with  Fresnillo,  Peñoles,  Agnico-
Eagle and Golden Goliath.  As the sole junior in the
heart of the Uruachic Mining Camp we are challenged in:
a.
obtaining  as  much  knowledge  as  possible  from  the  extensive  work  being  done  in  the  area  to  assist  in  our  own
exploration activities.  Major mining companies like Fresnillo and Peñoles generally do not announce their exploration
successes.
b.
Share with our investors the true potential of the Uruachic Mining Camp to host significant gold and silver deposits.  We
have always believed that the hundreds of old tunnels and adits dating back hundreds of years in the Camp would
undoubtedly lead to major new discoveries.  Orisyvo is proof of this theory.  And, despite spending $150 million dollars,
Fresnillo has disclosed very little about the true potential of Orisyvo or the Uruachic Camp as a whole.
With respect to advancing our geological understanding of the Uruachic Mining Camp and the Orisyvo deposit type, we
are working closely with Agnico-Eagle and their technical team, some of whom were a part of the Orisyvo discovery
before joining Agnico.  Agnico-Eagle has been an exceptional partner both in their financial and exploration support.
 Their drill program, which just commenced, will continue to build and enhance our understanding.  Further, our own
senior geologists with extensive experience working at major mining companies finding and building mines combined
with a handful of young gun geologists being trained and directed by them, we believe our own, Mexican, exploration
team is second to none.  We are proud of the fact that our entire team has been together for several years adding
consistency, building on their knowledge and a shared belief by all in the significant potential of the Camp. Our team
continues working at Nopalera.
With respect to the potential of the Uruachic Mining Camp we can surmise that Peñoles land position is based on the
extensive work at Orisyvo and the technical analysis and interpretations derived therefrom to hold the most prospective
ground for further discoveries by the fact Peñoles and Fresnillo work together closely (Peñoles holds approximately
77% of the issued share capital of Fresnillo PLC).  It is interesting to note that Peñoles holds the majority of the land in
the Camp.  Peñoles is a private company and not subject to any public reporting requirements for the work it does or
results obtained.  Fresnillo PLC currently trades on the London Stock Exchange and is subject to UK reporting rules for
public companies.  A further initiative demonstrating the potential of the Uruachic Mining Camp is the building of a road
to  the  town  of  Uruachic.    The  Mexican  Government  has  commenced  construction  to  pave  the  40-kilometer  road  to
Uruachic.  This is a significant investment in the region. Fresnillo’s plans to extend the paved road to Orisyvo suggests
Orisyvo may be on the fast track to production.
- 22 -
While Fresnillo’s regulatory disclosure has provided some indication as to the significance of the Orisyvo Deposit, its
local public announcements have also been insightful.  Fresnillo operates several mines in Mexico and claims to be
the largest primary silver producer in the world.  As such, its public image is critical to local communities throughout
Mexico. A recent article in El Heraldo in Chihuahua City stated that exploration at Orisyvo to date has amounted to
approximately  US$150M  and  is  expected  in  the  years  ahead  could  reach  US$800M  for  feasibility  through  to
construction.  Further, the article states direct employment during production at Orisyvo would be 1,500 people with up
to 7,500 additional indirect jobs created.  The nature and scale of the potential economic benefit from Orisyvo likely
explains  the  Mexican  Government’s  investment  in  the  road  to  Uruachic  as  they  have  been  very  aggressive  in
promoting mining and subsidizing some of the necessary infrastructure.
Barranca  Property:  The  Mexican  government  is  building  a  new  road  along  the  Oteros  River  which  has  given  our
exploration  crew  the  first  road  access  to  our  large  (1,503  ha)  100%-owned  Barranca  claim.    The  La  Barranca
concession is one of the Company’s original concessions in the area, but no significant work had been conducted due
to the difficult access.  Since the new road access, the Company has identified a very promising zone with excellent
grades in gold and silver.  Recent initial work carried out by the Company’s exploration team on the La Barranca claim,
has shown the presence of gold, silver and copper values in mantos and quartz veins within a 600 x 1,000 meter skarn
zone.  Work continues on this promising new area.  Currently 42 channel samples have been taken over a cumulative
length of 205 meters across structures with an average width of 3.57 meters.
Las Bolas/Los Hilos Property: In December 2011, the Company signed an Earn-in and Shareholders Agreement with
Agnico-Eagle for the exploration and development of the Company’s Las Bolas/Los Hilos property. Under the terms of
the agreement, Agnico-Eagle’s Mexican subsidiary has the right to earn a 51% interest in the property by spending
$5,000,000  on  the  property  over  a  period  of  fivr  years.    The  first  year’s  work  commitment  is  a  firm  commitment  of
$500,000 with expenditure requirements increasing each year thereafter.  Upon exercising its option, Agnico-Eagle will
have  the  right  to  earn  an  additional  20%  interest  by  spending  $4  million  over  another  period  of  four  years  and
completing a feasibility study or by spending $10 million over a longer period of eight years.  Agnico-Eagle is currently
drilling this property.
Corona Property: Comstock Metals Ltd. holds an option to earn up to a 75% interest in the Corona Property pursuant to
the earn-in agreement, an initial 60% interest can be earned by Comstock by completing $500,000 in exploration work
and by making share payments to Golden Goliath.  At that point Comstock has the option of either proceeding on a
60/40 joint venture basis, or continuing to fund exploration until the completion of a feasibility study in order to earn a
further 15% interest in the property.  The Company has been advised that Comstock has spent in excess of $1 million
on the property and are pleased with the results of their work and advised that they have decided to proceed on a 60/40
joint venture basis.  This agreement is currently being negotiated.
In February 2012 and March 2012, Comstock completed a diamond drill program of 12 holes (2,126 meters), which
discovered two new zones, one of porphyry-style gold mineralization after drilling 34.5 meters of gold and the second is
a high grade gold-silver vein assaying silver/gold/lead/zinc over 1.0 meter.  Comstock’s drilling on Corona indicated
that the gold-silver mineralization in the Northeast Zone may be “High Sulphidation Epithermal” in origin.  At Corona
prospecting and mapping has found an area known as the “Jerry Zone”, which is an extension of the Northeast Zone
further  to  the  northeast,  where  the  rhyolite  flows  and  tuffs  of  the  Upper  Group  are  highly  fractured,  brecciated  and
altered to an alunite-rich rock that passes into outcrops of leached rhyolite with extensive and well-developed vuggy
and residual silica.  Between the areas of near-massive vuggy quartz the host rock is highly fractured and has networks
of dark vuggy silica veinlets and silica-cemented hydrothermal breccia.  The zone of vuggy silica was traced in outcrop
and float over a distance of 800 meters.  At the northern end of the zone extensive areas of alunite alteration occur
within pumice and tuff that is in fault-contact with the Jerry Zone.  Comstock’s interpretation of the results is that the
mineralogy, occurrence and trace element geochemistry suggests that the Jerry Zone is the high-level “lithocap” of a
concealed mineral system.  Comstock’s drilling during February 2012 and March 2012 started on the “Northeast Zone”,
250-to-300 meters southwest of Jerry, where mineralization is focused along the contact between the Upper and Lower
Volcanic Groups.  This mineralization is also believed to be part of a high sulphidation system.
- 23 -
Comstock’s 2012 drilling started testing a portion of the area between the NE Extension and the southern end of Jerry
with  some  relatively  shallow  drill  holes,  resulting  in  the  discovery  of  extensive  thicknesses  of  highly  fractured
granodiorite, diorite, and hydrothermal breccia that is densely fractured and often well-mineralized.  This “porphyry-
style”  gold  mineralization  is  oxidized,  with  pervasive  hematite,  and  silicification  plus  “clay”  alteration  that  is  locally
intense.  Comstock now believes that drilling beneath the lithocap and extending into un-drilled terrain north and south
may define an intrusive body which forms a “cupola” or dome of highly fractured and brecciated porphyry that may
extend well beyond the areas of both current and historic drilling.  Comstock’s diamond drill program also included a
hole  on  the  Esperanza  vein.    This  structure  is  exposed  in  an  old  adit  dug  into  an  overburden  covered  hillside,
mineralization consists of a coarsely banded quartz vein that is up to 30 cm wide hosted within sericite-altered and
silicified diorite.  Zinc and lead minerals are evident as sphalerite and galena. Grab samples taken in 2002 and 2007
from  the  adit  returned  gold/silver/lead/copper/zinc  and  up  to  gold/silver  across  15  cm  in  a  sample  collected  by
Comstock.    Comstock  hopes  that  the  Esperanza  showing  itself  may  be  part  of  a  larger  east-west  trending  set  of
structures that returned high gold and silver values in earlier surface sampling programs.  The drill hole Comstock
completed on the down dip extension of the Esperanza vein returned silver/gold/lead/zinc over a width of 1 meter at a
depth of 68 meters below surface.  Comstock plans further holes on this
structure in the future.
Other Properties: Throughout the quarter ended May 31, 2012, the Company did not perform any significant work on
its other properties.
Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year
During the year ended August 31, 2012, the Company compiled the final report for the drilling program on the Las
Bolas / Los Hilos property to provide a comprehensive summary to Agnico-Eagle Mines so they can properly conduct
future exploration on the property.  Preliminary work also began on the Nopelera property continuing to the date hereof
with a focus on mapping and sampling all outcrops, road building and rehabilitation of old adits.
During the fourth quarter, the Company announced the appointment of David Moore to the Board of Directors.  Mr.
Moore is President & CEO of Serengeti Resources Inc.  Prior to joining Serengeti, David had a 30-year career with
Teck Cominco; including management of Cominco’s Western Canadian and Canadian Exploration groups between
1995  and  1998,  and  International  Exploration  group  from  1991  to  2001.    He  has  participated  in  the  discovery  and
delineation of mineral deposits in a number of countries including leading the drill-out of the world class Red Dog zinc-
lead deposit in Alaska.  He brings experience and expertise from grassroots prospecting, to resource delineation, to
exploration management and international business development.
Since joining Serengeti in 2004 Mr. Moore has been instrumental in transforming the company into a successful British
Columbia based mineral explorer.  Moving early to acquire a large land package in the highly prospective Quesnel
trough, he has raised more than $30 million in equity financing and in late 2006, along with partner Myron Osatenko,
lead the discovery of the Kwanika copper-gold deposit.  The significance of this discovery was recognized by AMEBC
in 2011 when Mr. Moore was co-awarded the prestigious H.H.  “Spud” Huestis Prospector of the Year Award.
The Company also reported that Richard Hughes and Rob Hutchinson have retired from the Board.  Messrs. Hughes
and Hutchinson have both served as directors since prior to the Company going public and the Company thanked
them for their time and dedication to the Company over the years.
Las  Bolas  Property.    During  the  fiscal  year  ended  August  31,  2012,  Agnico-Eagle  Mines  Limited  (“Agnico-Eagle”)
(NYSE:AEM; TSX:AEM), initiated its first year exploration program on the Las Bolas property.  Under the terms of the
Earn-In  and  Shareholders  agreement  between  Agnico-Eagle  and  the  Company,  Agnico-Eagle  had  to  spend  a
minimum  of  $500,000  on  exploration  on  the  property  during  the  first  year  of  the  agreement.  Agnico-Eagle’s  work
comprised mainly diamond drilling. The program was initiated in late spring/early summer and continued until after the
end of the fiscal year.  At the time of writing, Agnico-Eagle had not yet delivered to the Company, its report on their
exploration activities.  Consequently, details regarding the number of holes completed, total meters drilled, the logs and
assays for these holes are not yet available for the Company to discuss in this filing.
- 24 -
Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  Agnico-Eagle  has  the  right  to  earn  a  51%  interest  in  the  property  by  spending
$5,000,000  on  the  property  over  a  period  of  five  years.    The  first  year’s  work  commitment  is  a  firm  commitment  of
$500,000 with expenditure requirements increasing each year thereafter. Upon exercising its option, Agnico-Eagle will
have  the  right  to  earn  an  additional  20%  interest  by  spending  $6  million  over  another  period  of  four  years  and
completing a feasibility study or by spending $10 million over a longer period of eight years.
Nopalera Property.  During the year ending August 31, 2012, the Company continued surface field work on its 100%
owned Nopalera property.  Nopalera is a large claim which adjoins the Los Hilos claims on the west side.  Nopalera
hosts  a  very  large  and  intense  alteration  zone  which  is  related  to  a  porphyry  intrusion  and  has  a  chemical  trace
element signature that is very similar the Fresnillo PLC’s new flagship discovery called Orisyvo.  The Orisyvo claims
are  contiguous  to  the  Nopalera  property  on  its  south  east  corner.    Fresnillo  has  released  documents  showing  that
Orisyvo has a large resource of gold and of silver.  Fresnillo’s sister company Peñoles has also surrounded the Golden
Goliath  claims  with  their  own  staking.    In  an  interview  with  Fresnillo  in  the  Chihuahua  Herald  newspaper  in  early
summer, Fresnillo announced that they had already spent about $150 million on the Orisyvo project and expenditures
could reach $800 million during the feasibility and construction phases. They plan to directly employ 1,500 people
directly for a minimum mine life of 15 years.
During  the  fiscal  year  ended  August  31,  2012,  the  Mexican  government  started  a  major  upgrade  of  the  local
infrastructure.  The 45 kilometers of single lane, gravel road leading from a major highway to the town of Uruachic is
being widened and upgraded to a two lane paved road.  This very large and expensive project, which is scheduled for
completion in 2013, will be of great benefit to Fresnillo and also to Golden Goliath.
The continued surface work on Nopalera by the Company during the year included the ongoing construction of new
access  roads  and  the  rehabilitation  and  sampling  of  several  small  old  mine  workings,  geological  and  structural
mapping, geochemical analysis of surface rock samples and clay mineral identification. Clay mineralogy is important
as it distinguishes between clay mineral formed by hydrothermal alteration generated at depth by metaliferous fluids,
from clay minerals formed by meteoric weathing and provides vectors for drilling.  Very significant amounts of the high
temperature  hydrothermal  clay  minerals  were  found,  which  is  very  encouraging.  Surface  mapping  also  identified
significant amounts of “vuggy silica”, which is also very encouraging as this material is formed in high sulphidation
epithermal systems.  It results from the  formation of strong sulphuric acid which leaches other minerals from siliceous,
felsic rocks, leaving behind a silica with a sponge like texture. The Company is very encouraged by this, as it indicates
that there was a high sulphidation system at work at depth. The geological mapping also identified felsic, porphyritic
intrusive rocks similar to those at Orisyvo.
The Company believes that Nopalera has a geologic setting, lithology, stratigraphic interval, alteration and pathfinder
element  distribution  pattern  which  are  similar  to  those  believed  to  be  present  at  the  Orisyvo,  which  is  a  high
sulphidation system related to a porphyritic intrusion.
The  Company  is  pursuing  an  aggressive  exploration  program  for  the  Nopalera  claim  leading  to  a  major  diamond
drilling program as soon as practicable.
Corona Property.  Comstock Metals Ltd. holds an option to earn up to a 75% interest in the Corona Property pursuant to
the earn-in agreement, an initial 60% interest can be earned by Comstock by completing $500,000 in exploration work
and by making share payments to Golden Goliath. At that point Comstock has the option of either proceeding on a 60 /
40 joint venture basis, or continuing to fund exploration until the completion of a feasibility study in order to earn a
further 15% interest in the property.  The Company has been advised that Comstock has spent in excess of $1 million
on the property and are pleased with the results of their work and advised that they have decided to proceed on a 60/40
joint venture basis.  This agreement is currently being negotiated.  In February and March 2012, Comstock completed a
diamond  drill  program  of  12  holes  (2,126  meters),  which  discovered  two  new  zones,  one  of  porphyry-style  gold
mineralization after drilling 34.5 meters and the second is a high grade gold-silver vein over 1.0 meter.
- 25 -
Comstock’s  drilling  on  Corona  indicated  t  that  the  gold-silver  mineralization  in  the  Northeast  Zone  may  be  “High
Sulphidation Epithermal” in origin.  At Corona prospecting and mapping has found an area known as the “Jerry Zone”,
which is an extension of the Northeast Zone further to the northeast, where the rhyolite flows and tuffs of the Upper
Group are highly fractured, brecciated and altered to an alunite-rich rock that passes into outcrops of leached rhyolite
with extensive and well-developed vuggy and residual silica.  Between the areas of near-massive vuggy quartz the
host rock is highly fractured and has networks of dark vuggy silica veinlets and silica-cemented hydrothermal breccia.
 The zone of vuggy silica was traced in outcrop and float over a distance of 800 metres.  At the northern end of the zone
extensive  areas  of  alunite  alteration  occur  within  pumice  and  tuff  that  is  in  fault-contact  with  the Jerry  Zone.
 Comstock’s interpretation of the results is that the mineralogy, occurrence and trace element geochemistry suggests
that the Jerry Zone is the high-level “lithocap” of a concealed mineral system.
Comstock’s drilling during February and March 2012 started on the “Northeast Zone”, 250-to-300 meters southwest of
Jerry, where  mineralization  is  focused  along  the  contact  between  the  Upper  and  Lower  Volcanic  Groups.    This
mineralization is also believed to be part of a high sulphidation system.  Comstock’s 2012 drilling started testing a
portion of the area between the NE Extension and the southern end of Jerry with some relatively shallow drill holes,
resulting in the discovery of extensive thicknesses of highly fractured granodiorite, diorite, and hydrothermal breccia
that  is  densely  fractured  and  often  well-mineralized.  This  “porphyry-style”  gold  mineralization  is  oxidized,  with
pervasive hematite, and silicification plus “clay” alteration that is locally intense.
Comstock now believes that drilling beneath the lithocap and extending into un-drilled terrain north and south may
define an intrusive body which forms a “cupola” or dome of highly fractured and brecciated porphyry that may extend
well beyond the areas of both current and historic drilling.
Comstock’s diamond drill program also included a hole on the Esperanza vein. This structure is exposed in an old adit
dug into an overburden covered hillside, mineralization consists of a coarsely banded quartz vein that is up to 30 cm
wide hosted within sericite-altered and silicified diorite.  Zinc and lead minerals are evident as sphalerite and galena.
 Grab samples taken in 2002 and 2007 from the adit returned assays of gold, silver, lead, copper and zinc.  Comstock
hopes that the Esperanza showing itself may be part of a larger east-west trending set of structures that returned high
gold  and  silver  values  in  earlier  surface  sampling  programs.    The  drill  hole  Comstock  completed  on  the  down  dip
extension  of  the  Esperanza  vein  returned  silver,  gold,  lead,  and  zinc  over  a  width  of  1  meter  at  a  depth  of  68
metersbelow surface.  Comstock plans further holes on this structure in the future.
Barranca Property.    The  Mexican  government  is  building  a  new  road  along  the  Oteros  River  which  has  given  our
exploration  crew  the  first  road  access  to  our  large  (1,503  ha)  100%-owned  Barranca  claim.    The  La  Barranca
concession is one of the Company’s original concessions in the area, but no significant work had been conducted due
to the difficult access.  Since the new road access, the Company has identified a very promising zone with excellent
grades in gold and silver.
During the year, work carried out by the Company’s exploration team on the La Barranca claim, (location map available
on Properties page of the Company’s website) has shown the presence of gold, silver and copper values in mantos
and quartz veins within a 600 x 1,000 meter skarn zone.  Work continues on this promising new area.  Currently 42
channel samples have been taken over a cumulative length of 205 meters across structures with an average width of
3.57 meters.
Other  Properties.    Throughout  the  year  ended  August  31,  2012,  the  Company  also  reviewed  older  data  from  the
Reforma,  San  Timoto  and  Nueva  Union  properties  in  light  of  the  new  exploration  model  generated  by  the  Orisyvo
discovery.  This work indicated that there is some potential for this type of target on La Reforma as well as potential foe
low-sulphidation mineralization at Nueva Union.

4.D.  Property, Plant and Equipment
This  section  first  discloses  where  Golden  Goliath’s  office  is  located  in  Canada  and  then  describes  the  mineral
properties in which Golden Goliath has an interest.  In the description of the mineral properties, it is disclosed that these
properties are only exploration stage properties and that a substantial amount of capital will have to be spent on each
property before management will know if they contain commercially viable mineral deposits.
Golden Goliath’s executive offices are located in rented premises of approximately 1,500 sq. ft. at Suite 711, 675 West
Hastings Street, Vancouver, British Columbia Canada  V6B 1N2.  Golden Goliath began occupying these facilities in
January 2001.  Monthly rent is $2,000.
All of the Company’s current mineral exploration properties except two (Chamizal and La Cruz) are located in close
proximity to each other within the historic mining district of Uruachic in Chihuahua, Mexico.  Golden Goliath has a
100% interest in 10,000 hectares (25,000 acres) in the district.
Golden Goliath entered into an option/joint venture agreement with Comstock in 2007 on the Company’s Corona and
El Chamizal claims. The agreement provides that Comstock can earn up to a 75% interest in these properties through
cash  and  share  payments,  work  expenditures  and  completing  a  positive  feasibility  study.    Since  entering  the
agreement  Comstock  has  completed  various  work  programs  spending  in  excess  of  $1,000,000.    The  encouraging
results have allowed Comstock to complete a transaction to become a publicly traded company. This was done by an
amalgamation with Tectonic Minerals Corporation, later changing its name to Comstock Metals Ltd. Shareholders can
obtain detailed exploration results on sedar under Comstock’s profile.  Details of the amalgamation were announced
by Tectonic on February 3, 2011.  In summary, the transaction has resulted in Tectonic acquiring all of the issued and
outstanding  shares  of  Comstock  through  a  "three-cornered"  amalgamation,  whereby  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of
Tectonic  amalgamated  with  Comstock.  Through  the  amalgamation,  shareholders  of  Comstock  received  39,213,682
shares of Tectonic (includes shares issued pursuant to a brokered private placement of 8,750,000 units at a price of
$0.20 per unit, for gross proceeds of $1.75 million), and the resulting amalgamated company, possessing the assets
and  business  of  Comstock,  became  Tectonic's  wholly  owned  operating  subsidiary.    In  order  to  exercise  the  El
Chamizal Option Tectonic shall spend $200,000 in work expenditures in respect to the El Chamizal Property over a
period of three (3) years or less and also issue a total of 150,000 shares of Tectonic to GNG over three (3) years or
less. 25,000 shares to be issued on listing on a stock exchange, 50,000 shares on or before the date which is 12
months from the date of listing on a stock exchange and 75,000 shares on or before the date which is 24 months from
listing  on  a  stock  exchange.  Upon  Tectonic  earning  its  60%  interest  in  the  El  Chamizal  Property,  Tectonic  shall
thereafter  have  the  further  right  and  option  to  earn  an  additional  15%  interest  by  completing  a  positive  bankable
feasibility study, as that term is generally defined in the mining industry, by December 31, 2017.  The Company has
received notice from Comstock that it has spent in excess of $1,000,000 at Corona and wishes to enter into a joint
venture to further explore the property. As of the date hereof the Company has not yet finalized a joint venture with
Comstock  on  the  Corona  property.    Comstock  has  advised  the  Company  that  it  will  no  longer  proceed  with  the  El
Chamizal option and has returned a 100% interest in the Property back to the Company.
In December 2011, the Company signed an Earn-in and Shareholders Agreement with Agnico Eagle Mines Limited
(“Agnico Eagle”) for the exploration and development of the Company’s Las Bolas/Los Hilos property.  Under the terms
of the agreement, Agnico Eagle has the right to earn a 51% interest in the property by spending $5,000,000 on the
property over a period of 5 years. The first year’s work commitment is a firm commitment of $500,000 with expenditure
requirements increasing each year thereafter. Upon exercising its option, Agnico Eagle will have the right to earn an
additional 20% interest by spending $6,000,000 over another period of four years and completing a feasibility study or
by spending $10,000,000 over a longer period of eight years. In August 2013 Agnico Eagle elected to terminate the
agreement.
Mineral Properties
The Company has a 100% interest (except for a 40% interest in the Corona Property) in claims grouped into seven
properties totaling 20,794 acres within the Uruachic Mining District.  The Company also owns two other significant
properties outside of the Uruachic Camp.  One, La Cruz, is a silver property located on the eastern edge of the Sierra
Madre Belt.  The other exploration property that Golden Goliath owns is Chamizal; this property differs from the others
in that it is a lead, zinc, silver target and it lies outside of the Sierra Madre in central Chihuahua State.
- 27 -
Uruachic Mining Camp Properties
The Company acquired its 100% interest in the seven Uruachic Mining Camp properties and the Chamizal Property,
partially as a result of a default on a promissory held by Golden Goliath from Minera Uruachic S.A. de C.V. (“Minera
Uruachic”).  Minera Uruachic originally purchased certain claims from local residents.  Minera Uruachic is a related
company to Golden Goliath in that it is controlled by J. Paul Sorbara, the President/Director of Golden Goliath and
Daniel Nofrietta Fernandez, a Director of Golden Goliath.
The town of Uruachic is located in the northwestern part of Chihuahua State, some 60 kilometers south of the main
highway connecting the cities of Chihuahua and Hermosillo, Sonora.  A secondary road leads from the highway to the
waterfalls at Basaseachic and then continues south for a further 45 kilometers to Uruachic.  The geographic (Google
Earth) coordinates for the town are: 27° 52’ 06” North and 108° 12’ 52” West.
The  Uruachic  district  is  located  approximately  250  kilometers  southwest  of  the  city  of  Chihuahua.    The  town  of
Uruachic of 1,000 people is located in the approximate center of the project area.  Access to the area is via a paved
highway from the city of Chihuahua to Las Estrellas, then via a gravel road to the project area.  Total travel time from
Chihuahua is about six hours.  Local services, such as gasoline and food, are available in Uruachic.  Power lines run
from Las Estrellas to Uruachic.
The project area is located in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range, and elevations in the area are from 1000
meters to 2000 meters.  Topography is moderate to rugged.  During winter from November to January, the temperature
can drop below freezing and snow and ice are common at the higher elevations.  During July and August, rain is very
common and roads are often washed out.  Vegetation at lower elevations is tropical, while oak and pine forests cover
higher elevations.
The Uruachic mining camp is predominantly underlain by Tertiary volcanic rocks on the Lower Volcanic Complex, cut
locally by small intrusive bodies.  These rocks are highly favorable for hosting gold and silver mineralization, with an
estimated 90% of the precious metal mines in the Sierra Madre Occidental occurring within this package.  Throughout
most of the Sierra Madre, the Lower Volcanic Sequence is covered by a thick layer of rhyolitic tuffaceous rocks of the
Upper Volcanic Sequence, which prohibits the exploration of the favorable rocks underlying it.  In the Uruachic area,
the Rio Oteros has eroded the overlying rhyolitic rocks and has left exposed a complete section through the Lower
Volcanic suite.  It is in these highly altered rocks that the precious metal mineralization of the Uruachic camp is found.
The history of the Uruachic mining camp dates back to 1735 when two Spaniards searching for gold and silver founded
the town in order to exploit the areas riches.  At that time the Town was named Real De Minas De Santa Rosa De
Uruachic.  The town and the many mines surrounding it became very prosperous, eventually minting their own silver
coins.   The prosperity continued until about the time of the Mexican Revolution in the early 1900’s.

San Timoteo Property.  The San Timoteo property includes several claims, which total 793 hectares.  These are San
Timoteo, San Timoteo II, Oro Leon, Las Trojas and Bufalo B.
La Reforma Property.  The La Reforma property comprises three claims totaling 987.4 hectares.  The claims are La
reforma, La Lluvia and Bufalo A.
- 30 -
Nueva  Union  Property.    The  Nueva  Union  property  has  just  one  claim,  called  Nueva  Union,  which  covers  211.89
hectares.
Los Hilos/Las Bolas Property.  The Las Bolas property comprises seven claims totaling 656.76 hectares: Los Hilos,
Los Hilos II, Los Hilos II Frac.1, Mina de Las Bolas, Don Lazaro, El Manto, Ampliation La Verde.  In December 2011,
the Company signed an Earn-in and Shareholders Agreement with Agnico-Eagle for the exploration and development
of the Company’s Las Bolas/Los Hilos property.  Under the terms of the agreement, Agnico Eagle has the right to earn
a 51% interest in the property by spending $5,000,000 on the property over a period of 5 years. The first year’s work
commitment is a firm commitment of $500,000 with expenditure requirements increasing each year thereafter. Upon
exercising its option, Agnico Eagle will have the right to earn an additional 20% interest by spending $6,000,000 over
another period of four years and completing a feasibility study or by spending $10,000,000 over a longer period of eight
years.  In August 2013 Agnico Eagle elected to terminate the agreement.
- 31 -
Nopalera Property.  The Nopalera property comprises three claims totaling 1,308.65 hectares; Nopalera, Nopalera II
and La Flor Del Trigo.
Oteros Property.  The Oteros property is comprised of three claims totaling 1,130.00 hectares: oteros, Esperanza and
Bufalo R2.
Corona Property.  The Corona property consists of six claims that total 850 hectares (2,100 acres): Corona, Corona II,
Corona  III,  Corona  Norte,  Corona  Sur  and  La  Esperanza.  Corona  along  with  the  El  Chamizal  property  have  been
optioned to Comstock Capital.  In May 2007 and amended October 2007 and June 2010, the Company optioned the
Corona and El Chamizal properties to a company which undertook to spend $500,000 and $200,000 on the respective
properties over a period of three years and issue 300,000 and 150,000 shares respectively to the Company over a
period of three years from when the company lists its shares on a stock exchange.  Comstock Metals Ltd. listed on the
TSX Venture Exchange in August 2011.  The Company has received notice from Comstock that it has spent in excess
of $1,000,000 at Corona and effective April 9, 2013 the Company and Comstock entered into a joint venture agreement
to further explore the property whereby Comstock shall act as the operator.  The Company is responsible for 40% of all
exploration costs going forward.  The Company was advised during 2014 that Comstock would no longer participate in
the joint venture, as such, the Company is responsible for 100% of the costs associated with the Corona Property.
- 32 -
La Cruz Property
The Company acquired its 100% interest in the seven Uruachic Mining Camp properties and the Chamizal Property as
a result of a default on a promissory held by Golden Goliath from Minera Uruachic S.A. de C.V. (“Minera Uruachic”).
  Minera  Uruachic  originally  purchased  the  claims  from  local  residents.    Minera  Uruachic  is  a  related  company  to
Golden Goliath in that it is controlled by J. Paul Sorbara, the President/Director of Golden Goliath and Daniel Nofrietta
Fernandez, a Director of Golden Goliath.
The La Cruz property has one claim, called La Cruz covering 90.00 hectares which was staked by the Company in
2006.  Preliminary surface mapping was completed by Golden Goliath, along with underground mapping and sampling
of some of the several old mine workings on the property.  The property gained the attention Pan American Silver, who
conducted at least two property examinations.  La Cruz was then optioned to the Mexican subsidiary of Pan American.
 An internal claim, called La Cruzada, was obtained directly by Pan American and was rolled into the agreement.
Under the terms of the option agreement, Pan American Silver Corp’s Mexican subsidiary, Minera Corner Bay S.A. de
C.V., has the right to earn a 60% interest in La Cruz by making cash payments totaling US$300,000 and spending
US$450,000  on  the  property  over  a  period  of  three  years.    The  property  will  consist  of:  the  Company’s  La  Cruz
Property;  additional  ground  staked  around  the  La  Cruz  Property;  and  the  La  Cruzada  Property  for  which  Pan
American’s subsidiary already has an option.  Golden Goliath will be responsible for 25% of the costs associated with
La Cruzada Property.  Upon Minera Corner Bay exercising its option, a 60/40 joint venture would proceed on the La
Cruz  and  newly  staked  grounds,  with  Pan  American  having  the  right  to  earn  an  additional  15%  by  completing  a
feasibility study.  This agreement has since been terminated with the La Cruz property being returned to the Company.
The  La  Cruz  Property,  which  is  not  in  the  Uruachic  Camp,  lies  on  the  extreme  eastern  edge  of  the  Sierra  Madre
Occidental.  The property hosts numerous old underground workings and dumps along a 1.5 kilometer trend.  The
workings and extensive dumps are associated with two parallel, strongly silicified and brecciated structures separated
by a distance of about 200 meters.  The structures strike Az 220º, dip 75º N, and average about two-meters to five-
meters  in  width  at  the  surface.    The  workings,  mostly  shafts,  appear  to  extend  from  25-meters  to  80-meters  and
preliminary mapping indicates that the structures widen at depth.  The main working area occurs on a hill that rises
about  250  meters  above  the  adjacent  plains.    A  principal  working,  adjacent  to  the  mojonera,  lies  about  75  meters
above the base of this hill and appears to be the lowest working level, and the top of the hill lies some 300 meters to
the south.
- 33 -
The age of the workings is uncertain, but they are not recent and it appears that no drilling has ever been done on the
ground.  A Company director first visited this property about 20 years ago and at that time asked a 70-year-old man
who was born in the local village of Tajirachic about the mines.  The local replied that they were already closed down
when he was a boy.  Subsequent claim owners (individuals, not companies) only worked the old dumps in a limited
way.
Preliminary work by the Company’s geologists included taking 17 chip samples across widths ranging from 1.0 meters
to 2.5 meters and averaging 1.75 meters.
Tertiary volcanic rocks underlie the La Cruz claim, with andesites being overlain by rhyolites and ignimbrites.  The
rocks are intensely fractured and silicified with fracture fillings of grey quartz.  Silver sulphide mineralization is present
along with iron and manganese oxides.  The fractures have predominant trends of north-south, Az 340 and Az 025 with
vertical dips and the working following the northeast trend.   A breccia zone that is about 3.5 meters wide on surface
characterizes the mineralized trend.  Preliminary examination of the old shafts has been conducted to a depth of 45
meters, but they appear to descend to about 80 meters.
The La Cruz property is located in the central part of Chihuahua State, approximately 1.5 hours drive south-southwest
of the city of Cuauhtemoc, and has good road access to within a few kilometers of the property.  The road follows an
arroyo for the last few kilometers, but this section can easily be rehabilitated.  Geographic coordinates for the mojonera
are Latitude 28º 02’ 52.14” and Longitude 107º 09’ 56.94”.
Chamizal Property
The Chamizal property consists of two claims, Chamizal Este and Chamizal Oeste, which cover an area of 689.00
hectares.
The Chamizal property, which is outside of the Uruachic camp and the Sierra Madre Occidental, has not had extensive
exploration work to date.  Surface and underground mapping, as well as preliminary geochemical sampling has been
conducted, but no geophysical surveys have been completed.  Chamizal along with the Corona property have been
optioned to Comstock Capital.
In May 2007 and amended April 2011, the Company optioned the Corona and El Chamizal properties to a company
which undertook to spend $500,000 and $200,000 on the respective properties over a period of three years and issue
400,000 (150,000 shares received) and 150,000 (25,000 shares received) shares respectively to the Company over a
period of two years.  In order to keep the option in good standing, Comstock must also pay $50,000 (received) and
issue 200,000 shares to the Company (received).  Comstock has advised the Company that it will no longer proceed
with the El Chamizal option and has returned a 100% interest in the Property back to the Company.
- 34 -
The Chamizal Property is not in the Uruachic Camp.  This property is part of a potentially very important massive play
located  85  kilometers  south-southwest  of  the  city  of  Chihuahua  in  central  Chihuahua  State.    This  region  hosts  the
famous Santa Eulalia and Naica mining districts which have carbonate hosted, massive Pb-Zn-Ag mineralization.  The
Santa Eulalia district, located 90 kilometres northeast of Chamizal, has a mining history dating back to the late 1500's.
 The Chamizal Property is underlain by the same limestone formation that hosts the mineralization at Santa Eulalia and
Naica,  and  has  old  mine  workings  in  both  the  northeast  and  southwest  portion  of  the  property.    The  southwestern
workings comprise two tunnels that total more than 400 meters in length and contain large stopes where replacement
style Pb-Zn-Ag mineralization has been mined.  Despite the presence of two sizable adits with stopes and one shaft
attesting to past mine production, there is no record of any drilling ever having been done on the Chamizal Property.
The Chamizal Property lies in central Chihuahua, approximately 80 kilometers west of the famous Naica Pb-Zn-Ag
mine, and about 80 kilometers southwest of the famous Santa Eulalia Mine.

Exploration efforts are conducted year-round and administrative/general expenses are generally not seasonal.  The
seasonally-higher fourth quarter losses in Fiscal 2013 primarily related to year-end write downs of mineral property
exploration costs of $2,178,691 in 2013.
Fiscal 2014 Ended August 31, 2014 vs. Fiscal 2013
Golden Goliath is a Canadian listed public company with its shares traded on the TSX Venture Exchange under the
symbol “GNG” as a Tier 2 company.
Golden Goliath is a junior exploration company with no revenues from mineral producing operations.  The Company’s
properties  are  all  located  in  the  State  of  Chihuahua,  Mexico.    Activities  include  acquiring  mineral  properties  and
conducting  exploration  programs.    The  mineral  exploration  business  is  risky  and  most  exploration  projects  will  not
become mines.  The Company may offer to a major mining company the opportunity to acquire an interest in a property
in return for funding by the major mining company, of all or part of the exploration and development of the property.  For
the funding of property acquisitions and exploration that the Company conducts, the Company does not use long-term
debt.  Rather, it depends on the issue of shares from the treasury to investors.  Such stock issues in turn depend on
numerous factors, important among which are a positive mineral exploration climate, positive stock market conditions,
a company’s track record and the experience of management.
Results from Operations
For the year ended August 31, 2014, the Company incurred a comprehensive loss $3,584,643 compared to $3,009,543
in the prior year and a comprehensive loss of $3,028,817 in the fourth quarter compared to a comprehensive loss of
$2,372,282 in the fourth quarter last year.  The significant differences between these periods include:
·
The most significant amounts in the periods under review are the write down of mineral property exploration costs of
$2,883,086  last  year  and  $2,178,691  in  the  prior  year.  It  should  be  noted  that  Company  continues  to  hold  all  the
properties despite the fact some were written down.  Management believes these properties still hold good exploration
potential.
·
Consulting fees the past year and quarters under review were significantly reduced.  For the year ended August 31,
2014 consulting fees were $52,542 compared to $111,764 in the prior year.  The Company has reduced the number of
consultants it has used.
·
In 2013 there was a realized gain on marketable securities of $44,105 from shares received as consideration for a
property option agreement compared to nil in 2014.
·
There was a reduction in investor relation expenses of $72,478 from the prior year to a total of $23,578 in 2014.
·
Travel costs were $9,396 less in the past year compared to 2013 as the Company reduced discretionary spending.
·
Wages and benefits decreased $10,469 for 2014 compared to the prior year due to staff reductions.  Subsequent to the
year end the Company has further greatly reduced its staffing.
As  of  August  31,  2014,  deferred  mineral  property  exploration  costs  totaled  $3,318,611  compared  to  $5,884,438  at
August 31, 2013.  During the year, the Company incurred a total of $317,259 in exploration expenditures mostly related
to taxes on all the properties and maintaining the existing exploration infrastructure in Uruachic.
- 36 -
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company has financed its operations almost exclusively through the sale of its common shares to investors and
will be required to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
The Company had working capital of $161,225 at August 31, 2014 compared to of $419,372 at May 31, 2014 and
$1,160,344  at  August  31,  2013.    The  Company’s  cash  and  short-term  investment  position  at  August  31,  2014  was
$105,407.
Fiscal 2013 Ended August 31, 2013 vs. Fiscal 2012

Results from Operations
For  the  year  ending  August  31,  2013,  the  Company  incurred  a  comprehensive  loss  $3,009,543  compared  to
$3,640,155 in the prior year.  In the fourth quarter of last year the comprehensive loss was $2,372,282 compared to a
loss of $172,806 in the third quarter.  The significant differences between these periods include:
·
The  most  significant  difference  in  the  past  quarter  was  the  write  down  of  mineral  property  exploration  costs  of
$2,178,691 compared to nil in the third quarter of last year.  However, this is comparable to the prior year when the
Company  wrote  down  $2,007,751  in  mineral  property  exploration  costs.    The  most  significant  write  down  was  the
Company’s Las Bolas property which was the subject to an option agreement with Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. last year
but terminated this past year.  It should be noted that Company continues to hold all the properties despite the fact
some were written down.  Management believes these properties still hold good exploration potential.
·
Stock based compensation fees were $777,347 in 2012 compared to nil in 2013.  The Company granted no stock
options in the past year.  While the Company granted the 2012 options at a premium to the market price, these charges
are a result of mandatory accounting practices which require a calculation using the Black-Scholes option valuation
model  to  expense  stock  options.    As  volatility  is  one  variable  in  the  calculation  of  this  non  cash  charge,  the  large
volatility of junior mining stocks has resulted in a large value to be expensed for stock options.
·
Consulting fees Of $111,764 versus $235,792 in 2012 were $124,028 less than last year as the Company focused on
capital  preservation,  while  continuing  to  hold  its  team  together  and  maintain  exploration  activities  to  advance  the
Company’s projects.
·
The Company had a gain of $9,531 compared to a loss last year of $14,356 on foreign exchange due to fluctuations in
the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso.
·
The Company had a realized gain on marketable securities of $44,105 compared to nil in the prior year as a result of
the increased price of the Company’s shareholdings in another public company.
·
Investor relations costs of $96,056 versus $81,514 in 2012 were $14,542 higher as the Company was actively trying to
raise money early in the year.  These costs have been reduced in the past quarters.
·
Wages and benefits costs of $258,717 versus $238,692 in 2012 were $20,088 higher mainly due to an increase in the
Mexican payroll tax.
- 37 -
As  of  August  31,  2013,  deferred  mineral  property  exploration  costs  totaled  $5,884,438  compared  to  $7,597,438  at
August 31, 2012.  During the year, the Company incurred a total of $494,935 in exploration expenditures mostly related
to  underground  rehabilitation  work  at  the  San  Martin  tunnel  and  property  maintenance  tax  payments.    $275,957  of
facilities and other in deferred exploration costs included such expenses as maintenance and rental of core shacks,
water truck and other miscellaneous expenses for work done on the properties.

Results from Operations
For the year ending August 31, 2012, the Company incurred a net loss $3,640,155 compared to $1,021,160 for the year
ending August 31, 2011.  In the fourth quarter the Company incurred a net loss of $2,380,315 compared to a net loss of

the fact they were written down.  Management believes these properties still hold good exploration potential.
·
Stock based compensation fees were $777,347 in 2012 compared to nil in 2011.  The Company granted no stock
option in its 2011 fiscal.  While the Company granted the 2012 options at a premium to the market price, these charges
are a result of mandatory accounting practices which require a calculation using the Black-Scholes option valuation
model  to  expense  stock  options.    As  volatility  is  one  variable  in  the  calculation  of  this  non  cash  charge,  the  large
volatility of junior mining stocks has resulted in a large value to be expensed for stock options.
·
A decrease in cash over last year is a result of ongoing exploration activities.  No financing activities were concluded
during the year.
·
Investor  relation  fees  increased  $43,272  during  the  past  year  compared  to  last  year  as  the  Company  prepared  a
corporate video and conducted a BNN marketing campaign during the year.
·
Consulting fees increased $43,864 during the past year compared to last year due to the Company retaining corporate
development expertise.
·
Office  and  general  fees,  rent  and  utilities,  travel  and  wages  and  benefits  decreased  slightly  this  past  year  as  the
Company focused on capital preservation, while continuing to hold its team together and maintain exploration activities
to advance the Company’s projects.
As  of  August  31,  2012,  deferred  mineral  property  exploration  costs  totalled  $7,597,438  compared  to  $8,981,467  at
August 31, 2011.  During the year, the Company incurred a total of $647,482 in exploration expenditures mainly on its

6.C.  Board Practices
All directors hold office until the next meeting of the shareholders of the Company unless they resign or are removed in
accordance with the Company’s Articles.  Senior Management are appointed to serve at the discretion of the Board of
Directors.  The Board of Directors and Committees of the Board schedule regular meetings over the course of the year.
The fundamental objective of the Board is to ensure that it operates in a fashion that maximizes shareholder value over
the long term.  The Board’s duties and responsibilities are all carried out in a manner consistent with that fundamental
objective.   The principal duty and responsibility of the Board is to oversee the management and operations of the
Company, with the day-to-day management of the business and affairs of the Company delegated by the Board to the
President/CEO and other Senior Management.
The  Board’s  responsibilities  include  overseeing  the  conduct  of  the  Company’s  business,  providing  leadership  and
direction  to  its  management,  and  setting  policies.    Strategic  direction  for  the  Company  is  developed  through  the
Board’s annual planning process.  Through this process, the Board adopts the operating plan for the coming year, and
monitors management’s progress relative to that plan through a regular reporting and review process.
The  Board  has  delegated  to  the  President/CEO  and  other  Senior  Management  responsibility  for  the  day-to-day
management of the business of the Company.  Matters of policy and issues outside the normal course of business are
brought before the Board for its review and approval, along with all matters dictated by statute and legislation requiring
Board review and approval.  The President/CEO and other Senior Management review the Company’s progress in
relation to the current operating plan at in-person and telephone-conference Board meetings.  The Board meets on a
regular basis with and without management present.  Financial, operational and strategic issues facing the Company
are reviewed, monitored and approved at the Board meetings.
6.C.1.  Terms of Office.  Refer to ITEM 6.A and ITEM 6.C.
6.C.2.  Directors’ Service Contracts.  No Disclosure Necessary
6.C.3.  Board Independence
The Board of Directors has adopted standards for determining whether a director is independent from management.
  The  Board  reviews,  consistent  with  the  Company’s  corporate  governance  guidelines,  whether  a  director  has  any
material relationship with the Company that would impair the director’s independent judgment.  The Board of Directors
has affirmatively determined, based on its standards, that the Messrs. David Moore, Frank Hogel, Andrew Robertson,
and Edward Sorbara are independent.
- 44 -
6.C.4.  Board meetings and committees; annual meeting attendance
During Fiscal 2014, the Board of Directors held five scheduled meetings.  For various reasons, Board members may
not be able to attend a Board meeting; all Board members are provided information related to each of the agenda items
before each meeting, and, therefore, can provide counsel outside the confines of regularly scheduled meetings.  No
director attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of: (1) the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors, while
he was a Director; and (2) the total number of meetings of committees of the Board of Directors on which the director
served.  Directors are encouraged to attend annual meetings of our stockholder; all but David Moore, Frank Hogel,
Andrew Robertson, and Edward Sorbara of the directors attended the February 2014 annual shareholders meeting.
The  Company  has  an  Audit  Committee,  which  recommends  to  the  Board  of  Directors  the  engagement  of  the
independent  auditors  of  the  Company  and  reviews  with  the  independent  auditors  the  scope  and  results  of  the
Company’s  audits,  the  Company’s  internal  accounting  controls,  and  the  professional  services  furnished  by  the
independent auditors to the Company.  The Company has an Audit Committee charter, adopted 9/1/2006.  The current
members  of  the  Audit  Committee  are:  Stephen  Pearce,  Andrew  Robertson  (independent),  and  Edward  Sorbara
(independent).  The Audit Committee met once during Fiscal 2014 and has met once during Fiscal 2015-to-date but
regularly communicate informally throughout the year.
The Company does not have an “audit committee financial expert” serving on its Audit Committee.  The Company’s
Audit Committee consists of two independent directors and the CFO/Secretary/Director, all of whom are both financially
literate and very knowledgeable about the Company’s affairs.  Because the Company’s structure and operations are
straightforward, the Company does not find it necessary to augment its Board with a financial expert.
6.C.5.  Code of Ethics
The Board has adopted “Code of Business Contact and Ethics” addressing various codes of conducts.  The Board of
Directors expects management to operate the business of the Company in a manner that enhances shareholder value
and is consistent with the highest level of integrity.  Management is expected to execute the Company’s business plan
and to meet performance objectives and goals.  In addition, the Board of Directors must comply with conflict of interest
provisions in Canadian corporate law, including relevant securities regulatory instruments, in order to ensure directors
exercise independent judgment in considering transactions and agreements in respect of which a director or executive
officer  has  a  material  interest.    During  Fiscal  2014  and  Fiscal  2015-to-date,  there  are  no  material  change  reports
relating to the conduct of any Directors or executive officers of the Company.
6.D.  Employees
As  of  11/30/2014,  the  Company  had  no  full-time  employees  and  four  part-time  unpaid  employees/consultants,
including the Senior Management; two of these employees are engaged in mineral exploration/development.  As of
8/31/2014 and 8/31/2013, the Company had four and ten employees, respectively, including the Senior Management.
 None of the Company's employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Stock Options
Incentive stock options are granted by the Company in accordance with the rules and policies of the TSX Venture
Exchange, the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia), including the number of common shares under option,
the exercise price and expiry date of such options, and any amendments thereto.  The Company adopted its current
formal written stock option plan (the “Stock Option Plan”) on 2/5/2006 and it is renewed annually at the Company’s
shareholder meeting each year.
The principal purposes of the Company’s stock option program are to (a) promote a proprietary interest in the Company
among  the  officers,  directors  and  employees  of  the  Company  and  its  affiliates,  (b)  retain  and  attract  the  qualified
officers,  directors  and  employees  the  Company  requires,  (c)  provide  a  long-term  incentive  element  in  overall
compensation, and (d) promote the long-term profitability of the Company.
Under  the  Stock  Option  Plan,  the  Company’s  board  of  directors  (the  “Board”)  may,  from  time  to  time,  designate  a
director or other senior officer or employee of the Company as administrator (the “Administrator”) for the purposes of
administering the Plan.  Currently, the Administrator is the Corporate Secretary.
The principal purposes of the Company’s stock option program are to (a) promote a proprietary interest in the Company
among  the  officers,  directors  and  employees  of  the  Company  and  its  affiliates,  (b)  retain  and  attract  the  qualified
officers,  directors  and  employees  the  Company  requires,  (c)  provide  a  long-term  incentive  element  in  overall
compensation, and (d) promote the long-term profitability of the Company.
The  Stock  Option  Plan  provides  that  stock  options  may  be  granted  to  directors,  senior  officers,  employees  and
consultants of the Company (and any subsidiary of the Company) and management-company employees.  For the
purposes of the Stock Option Plan, the terms “employees”, “consultants” and “management company employees” have
the meanings set out in TSX Venture Exchange Policy 4.4.  In addition, the term “director” is defined in TSX Venture
Exchange Policy Manual section 4.4 to include directors, senior officers and management company employees.
The Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance of stock options to acquire at any time up to a maximum of 10% of the
issued  and  outstanding  common  shares  of  the  Company  (subject  to  standard  anti-dilution  adjustments).    If  a  stock
option expires or otherwise terminates for any reason without having been exercised in full, the number of common
shares reserved for issuance under that expired or terminated stock option shall again be available for the purposes of
the Stock Option Plan.  Any stock option outstanding when the Stock Option Plan is terminated will remain in effect
until it is exercised or it expires.  The Stock Option Plan provides that it is solely within the discretion of the Board to
determine who should receive stock options and in what amounts, subject to the following conditions:
(a)
options will be non-assignable and non-transferable except that they will be exercisable by the personal representative
of the option holder in the event of the option holder’s death;
(b)
options may be exercisable for a maximum of five years from grant date;
(c)
options to acquire no more than 5% of the issued shares of the Company may be granted to any one individual in any
twelve-month period;(d)   options to acquire no more than 2% of the issued shares of the Company may be granted to
any one consultant in any twelve-month period;
(e)
options  to  acquire  no  more  than  an  aggregate  of  2%  of  the  issued  shares  of  the  Company  may  be  granted  to  an
employee  conducting  investor  relations  activities  (as  defined  in  TSX  Venture  Exchange  Policy  1.1),  in  any  twelve-
month period;
(f)
options held by an option holder who is a director, employee, consultant or management company employee must
expire  within  a  reasonable  period  of  time  after  the  option  holder  ceases  to  be  a  director,  employee,  consultant  or
management company employee;
(g)
options held by an option holder who is engaged in investor relations activities must expire within 30 days after the
option holder ceases to be employed by the Company to provide investor relations activities; and
(h)
in the event of an option holder’s death, the option holder’s personal representative may exercise any portion of the
option holder’s vested outstanding options for one year following the option holder’s death.

services to the Company including providing office space, office furniture, boardroom facilities, access to photocopier,

9.A.5.  Common Share Description
Registrar/Common Shares Outstanding/Shareholders
The Company's common shares are issued in registered form and the following information is taken from the records of
Computershare Investor Services Inc. [located at 510 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia Canada  V5K 1A1],
the registrar and transfer agent for the common shares.
The authorized capital of Golden Goliath consists of an unlimited number of common shares without par value.
Common Share Description
All  of  the  authorized  common  shares  of  the  Company  are  of  the  same  class  and,  once  issued,  rank  equally  as  to
dividends, voting powers, and participation in assets.  Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share
held of record on all matters to be acted upon by the shareholders.  Holders of common stock are entitled to receive
such dividends as may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors, in its discretion, out of funds legally
available therefore.
Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of common stock are entitled to receive pro rata
the  assets  of  Company,  if  any,  remaining  after  payments  of  all  debts  and  liabilities.    No  shares  have  been  issued
subject  to  call  or  assessment.    There  are  no  pre-emptive  or  conversion  rights  and  no  provisions  for  redemption  or
purchase for cancellation, surrender, or sinking or purchase funds.
Provisions as to the modification, amendment or variation of such shareholder rights or provisions are contained in the
British  Columbia  Business  Corporations  Act.    Unless  the  British  Columbia  Business  Corporations  Act  or  the
Company's Articles otherwise provide, any action to be taken by a resolution of the shareholders may be taken by an
ordinary resolution or by a vote of a majority or more of the shares represented at the shareholders' meeting.
The  Company's  Articles  and  the  British  Columbia  Business  Corporations  Act  contain  provisions,  which  require  a
“special  resolution”  for  effecting  certain  corporate  actions.    Such  a  “special  resolution”  requires  a  two-third  vote  of
shareholders  rather  than  a  simple  majority  for  passage.    The  principle  corporate  actions  that  require  a  “special
resolution” include:
a.
Transferring the Company's jurisdiction from British Columbia to another jurisdiction;
b.
Giving financial assistance under certain circumstances;
c.
Certain conflicts of interest by Directors;
d.
Disposing of all/substantially all of Company's undertakings;
e.
Removing Director before expiration of his term in office;
f.
Certain alterations of share capital;
g.
Changing the Company name; and
h.
Certain reorganizations of the Company.
There  are  no  restrictions  on  the  repurchase  or  redemption  of  common  shares  of  the  Company  while  there  is  any
arrearage in the payment of dividends or sinking fund installments.

a. Earn-In and Shareholders Agreement with Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited, for the exploration and development of the
Company’s Las Bolas and Los Hilos properties, dated 12/8/2011.  This agreement was terminated in August 2013.
10.D.  Exchange Controls
Canada  has  no  system  of  exchange  controls.    There  are  no  Canadian  restrictions  on  the  repatriation  of  capital  or
earnings  of  a  Canadian  public  company  to  non-resident  investors.    There  are  no  laws  in  Canada  or  exchange
restrictions affecting the remittance of dividends, profits, interest, royalties and other payments to non-resident holders
of the Company's securities, except as discussed in ITEM 10.E., “Taxation” below.
Restrictions on Share Ownership by Non-Canadians
There are no limitations under the laws of Canada or in the organizing documents of the Company on the right of
foreigners to hold or vote securities of the Company, except that the Investment Canada Act may require review and
approval by the Minister of Industry (Canada) of certain acquisitions of “control” of the Company by a “non-Canadian”.
 The threshold for acquisitions of control is generally defined as being one-third or more of the voting shares of the
Company.  “Non-Canadian” generally means an individual who is not a Canadian citizen, or a corporation, partnership,
trust or joint venture that is ultimately controlled by non-Canadians.
10.E  Taxation
The  Company  believes  the  following  is  a  brief  summary  of  all  material  principal  Canadian  federal  income  tax
consequences to a holder of common shares of the Company (a “U.S. Holder”) who deals at arm's length with the
Company, holds the shares as capital property and who, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the “Act”)
and the Canada – United States Income Tax Convention (the “Treaty”), is at all relevant times resident in the United
States, is not and is not deemed to be resident in Canada and does not use or hold and is not deemed to use or hold
the shares in carrying on a business in Canada. Special rules, which are not discussed below, may apply to a U.S.
Holder that is an insurer that carries on business in Canada and elsewhere.
U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to their particular circumstances.
Under the Act and the Treaty, a U.S. Holder of common shares will generally be subject to a 15% withholding tax on
dividends paid or credited or deemed by the Act to have been paid or credited on such shares.  The withholding tax
rate  is  5%  where  the  U.S.  Holder  is  a  corporation  that  beneficially  owns  at  least  10%  of  the  voting  shares  of  the
Company and the dividends may be exempt from such withholding in the case of some U.S. Holders such as qualifying
pension funds and charities.
In general, a U.S. Holder will not be subject to Canadian income tax on capital gains arising on the disposition of
shares of the Company unless (i) at any time in the five-year period immediately preceding the disposition, 25% or
more of the shares of any class or series of the Company’s capital stock was owned by (or was under option of or
subject to an interest of) the U.S. holder or persons with whom the U.S. holder did not deal at arm's length, and (ii) the
value of the Company’s common shares at the time of the disposition derives principally from real property (as defined
in the Treaty) situated in Canada.  For this purpose, the Treaty defines real property situated in Canada to include
rights to explore for or exploit mineral deposits situated in Canada, rights to amounts computed by reference to the
amount or value of production from such mineralization, certain other rights in respect of properties situated in Canada
and shares of a corporation the value of whose shares is derived principally from real property situated in Canada.

The  US  Internal  Revenue  Code  provides  special  anti-deferral  rules  regarding  certain  distributions  received  by  US
persons with respect to, and sales and other dispositions (including pledges) of stock of, a passive foreign investment
company.  A foreign corporation, such as the Company, will be treated as a passive foreign investment company if 75%
or more of its gross income is passive income for a taxable year or if the average percentage of its assets (by value)
that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income is at least 50% for a taxable year.  If a U.S. Holder holds
shares in any year in which the Company is a PFIC, that holder might be required to file Internal Revenue Service
Form 8621.
This summary does not address potential tax effects relevant to our Company or those tax considerations that
depend upon circumstances specific to each investor.  In addition, this discussion does not address the tax
consequences  that  may  be  relevant  to  particular  investors  subject  to  special  treatment  under  certain  U.S.
Federal income tax laws, such as dealers in securities, tax-exempt entities, banks, insurance companies and
non-U.S. Holders.  Accordingly, holders and prospective holders of our common shares should consult with
their  own  tax  advisors  with  respect  to  the  income  tax  consequences  to  them  of  purchasing,  owning  and
disposing of common shares in our Company.
10.F.  Dividends and Paying Agents
The Company has not declared any dividends on its common shares for the last five years and does not anticipate that
it will do so in the foreseeable future.  The present policy of the Company is to retain future earnings for use in its
operations and the expansion of its business.
Notwithstanding the aforementioned: the Company is unaware of any dividend restrictions; has no specific procedure
for the setting of the date of dividend entitlement; but might expect to set a record date for stock ownership to determine
entitlement;  has  no  specific  procedures  for  non-resident  holders  to  claim  dividends,  but  might  expect  to  mail  their
dividends in the same manner as resident holders.  The Company has not nominated any financial institutions to be
the potential paying agents for dividends in the United States.

ITEM 15.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures to
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  material  information  related  to  the  Company,  including  its  consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to senior management, including Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the Chief Financial
Officer (“CFO”), by others within those entities on a timely basis so that appropriate decisions can be made regarding
public disclosure.
We  carried  out  an  evaluation,  under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  our  management,  including  our
Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended) as August 31, 2014.  The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
the disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2014, were effective to give reasonable assurance that the
information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i)
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii)
accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Company’s management is responsible for designing, establishing and maintaining a system of internal controls
over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) to provide reasonable assurance that the financial
information prepared by the Company for external purposes is reliable and has been recorded, processed and reported
in an accurate and timely manner in accordance with GAAP.  The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that
management fulfills its responsibilities.  The Audit Committee fulfills its role of ensuring the integrity of the reported
information through its review of the interim and annual financial statements.  Management reviewed the results of their
assessment with the Company’s Audit Committee.
Because of its inherent limitations, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all
possible misstatements or frauds.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, Management has used the
Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework,  which  is  a  suitable,  recognized  control  framework  established  by  the
Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  (COSO).    Management  has  assessed  the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and concluded that such internal control over
financial reporting is effective as of August 31, 2014.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
The  Company's  management,  including  the  CEO  and  CFO,  does  not  expect  that  our  Disclosure  Controls  or  our
Internal Controls will prevent all error and all fraud.  A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.  Further, the design
of  a  control  system  must  reflect  the  fact  that  there  are  resource  constraints,  and  the  benefits  of  controls  must  be
considered relative to their costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
detected.  These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.  The design of any
system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can
be no assurance that any design will succeed achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,
control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due
to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Attestation Report of the Registered Accounting Firm
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding
internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Management’s  report  was  not  subject  to  attestation  by  the  Company’s
registered public accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that require the
Company to provide only management’s report in this Form 20-F Annual Report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There  were  no  changes  in  the  Company’s  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  occurred  during  the  period
covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.
There have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by
this  annual  report  that  have  materially  affected  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect  the  Company’s  internal
control over financial reporting with regard to deficiencies or material weaknesses other than the corrective actions to
ensure proper disclosure is included in the Company’s filings under the Exchange Act, including the Form 20-F Annual
Report.
ITEM 16.  RESERVED
ITEM 16A.  AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT
The Company does not have an “audit committee financial expert” serving on its audit committee.  The Company’s
Audit Committee consists of two independent directors and the CFO/Secretary, all of whom are both financially literate
and  very  knowledgeable  about  the  Company’s  affairs.    Because  the  Company’s  structure  and  operations  are
straightforward, the Company does not find it necessary to augment its Board with a financial expert.
ITEM 16B.  CODE OF ETHICS
The Board has adopted “Code of Business Contact and Ethics” addressing various codes of conducts.  The Board of
Directors expects management to operate the business of the Company in a manner that enhances shareholder value
and is consistent with the highest level of integrity.  Management is expected to execute the Company’s business plan
and to meet performance objectives and goals.  In addition, the Board of Directors must comply with conflict of interest
provisions in Canadian corporate law, including relevant securities regulatory instruments, in order to ensure directors
exercise independent judgment in considering transactions and agreements in respect of which a director or executive
officer  has  a  material  interest.    During  Fiscal  2013  and  Fiscal  2014-to-date,  there  are  no  material  change  reports
relating to the conduct of any Directors or executive officers of the Company.
ITEM 16C. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTIING FEES AND SERVICES
The  audit  committee  is  directly  responsible  for  the  appointment,  compensation  and  oversight  of  auditors;  the  audit
committee has in place procedures for receiving complaints and concerns about accounting and auditing matters; and
has the authority and the funding to engage independent counsel and other outside advisors.
The Audit Committee may delegate to one or more designated members of the Audit Committee the authority to grant
pre-approvals required by this policy / procedure.  The decisions of any Audit Committee member to whom authority is
delegated to pre-approve a service shall be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.
In accordance with the requirements of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules issued by the Securities and
Exchange  Commission,  we  introduced  a  procedure  for  the  review  and  pre-approval  of  any  services  performed  by
Morgan & Company, including audit services, audit related services, tax services and other services.  The procedure
requires  that  all  proposed  engagements  of  Morgan  &  Company  for  audit  and  permitted  non-audit  services  are
submitted to the finance and audit committee for approval prior to the beginning of any such services.
Fees,  including  reimbursements  for  expenses,  for  professional  services  rendered  by  Morgan  &  Company  to  the
Company are detailed below.

GOLDEN GOLIATH RESOURCES LTD.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)
- 59 -
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT OF
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Golden Goliath Resources Ltd.
(An exploration stage company)
Report on the consolidated financial statements
We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Golden  Goliath  Resources  Ltd.,  which
comprise  the  consolidated  statements  of  financial  position  as  at  August  31,  2014  and  2013,  and  the  consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three
year  period  ended  August  31,  2014,  and  a  summary  of  significant  accounting  policies  and  other  explanatory
information.
Management’s responsibility for the consolidated financial statements
Management  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements  in
accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  as  issued  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards
Board,  and  for  such  internal  control  as  management  determines  is  necessary  to  enable  the  preparation  of  the
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility
Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.    We
conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we comply with ethical
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free from material misstatement.
An  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the
consolidated  financial  statements.    The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgment,  including  the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
 In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair
presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control.  An
audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial
statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our audits is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Golden Goliath Resources Ltd. as at August 31, 2014 and 2013, and its financial performance and its cash flows for
each of the years in the three year period ended August 31, 2014 in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
Emphasis of matter
Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to Note 1 in the consolidated financial statements which describes
matters  and  conditions  that  indicate  the  existence  of  a  material  uncertainty  that  casts  substantial  doubt  about  the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

1.
NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN
Golden Goliath Resources Ltd. (the “Company”) was incorporated on June 12, 1996 under the Business Corporations
Act  of  British  Columbia,  Canada.    The  Company  is  a  public  company  listed  on  the  TSX  Venture  Exchange  (the
“TSX.V”),  trading  under  the  symbol  “GNG”.  The  address  of  the  Company’s  corporate  office  and  principal  place  of
business is Suite 711, 675 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  The Company’s principal
business activity is the acquisition and exploration of resource properties.
The Company is in the exploration stage and is in the process of evaluating its Mexican resource properties and has
not yet determined whether these properties contain reserves that are economically recoverable.  The recoverability of
amounts shown for exploration and evaluation assets are dependent upon the discovery of economically recoverable
reserves, confirmation of the Company’s interest in the underlying mineral claims, the ability of the Company to obtain
necessary financing to complete the development of the properties and upon future profitable production or proceeds
from  the  disposition  thereof.    Managements’  plan  in  this  regard  is  to  secure  additional  funds  through  future  equity
financings, which either may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going
concern. This assumes the Company will operate for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize its assets and
discharge  its  liabilities  in  the  normal  course  of  operations.  Accordingly,  they  do  not  give  effect  to  adjustments  that
would  be  necessary  should  the  Company  be  unable  to  continue  as  a  going  concern  and  therefore  be  required  to
realize its assets and liquidate its liabilities, contingent obligations and commitments other than in the normal course of
business and at amounts different from those in the financial statements. The Company has incurred operating losses
since inception, has no source of operating cash flow, minimal income from short-term investments, and there can be
no assurances that sufficient funding, including adequate financing, will be available to complete the exploration of its
mineral  properties  and  to  cover  general  and  administrative  expenses  necessary  for  the  maintenance  of  a  public
company. The ability of the Company to arrange additional financing in the future depends in part, on the prevailing
capital  market  conditions  and  mineral  property  exploration  success.  These  factors  cast  substantial  doubt  on  the
Company’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  Accordingly,  the  financial  statements  do  not  give  effect  to
adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be
required  to  realize  its  assets  and  liquidate  its  liabilities,  contingent  obligations  and  commitments  other  than  in  the
normal course of business and at amounts different from those in the financial statements.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION
a)
Statement of Compliance
These  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting
Standards  (“IFRS”)  as  issued  by  the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“IASB”)  which  the  Company  has
adopted in its annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended August 31, 2014. The significant
accounting policies presented in this note have been consistently applied in each of the years presented.
b)
Basis of Preparation
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for financial instruments
that have been measured at fair value. These consolidated financial statements have also been prepared using the
accrual basis of accounting, except for cash flow information.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (including
normal recurring accruals), considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION (Continued)
c)
Foreign Currencies
The  Company’s  reporting  currency  and  functional  currency  is  the  Canadian  dollar.    Transactions  in  United  States
(“US”) and Mexican (“MXN”) foreign currencies have been translated into Canadian dollars as follows:
·
Monetary items at the rate prevailing at the statement of financial position date;
·
Non-monetary items at the historical exchange rate;
·
Revenues and expenses at the average rate in effect during the applicable accounting period; and
·
Gains or losses arising on foreign currency translation are included in the statements of operations and comprehensive
loss.
d)
Significant Accounting Judgments and Estimates
The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  IFRS  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosures  of  contingent  assets  and
liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during  the
reporting  period.  The  preparation  of  financial  statements  also  requires  management  to  exercise  judgment  in  the
process of applying the accounting policies.
On  an  on-going  basis,  management  evaluates  its  judgments  and  estimates  in  relation  to  assets,  liabilities  and
expenses.  Management uses historical experience and various other factors it believes to be reasonable under the
given circumstances, as the basis for its judgments and estimates.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized
prospectively from the period in which the estimates are revised.  Actual outcomes may differ from those estimates
under different assumptions and conditions.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The following are the key estimate and assumption uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material
adjustment within the next financial year.
Impairment
Assets,  especially  exploration  and  evaluation  assets  are  reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts exceed their recoverable amounts.  The assessment of the carrying
amount often requires estimates and assumptions such as discount rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, future
capital requirements and future operating performance.
Share-based payment transactions
The Company measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the
equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.  Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions
requires determining the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the
grant of shares.  This estimate also requires determining the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including
the expected life of a share option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.  The assumptions
and model used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 10.

d)
Significant Accounting Judgments and Estimates (Continued)
Critical Judgments Used in Applying Accounting Policies
Title to mineral property interests
Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest, these procedures
do not guarantee the Company’s title.  Such properties may be subject to prior agreements or transfers and title may be
affected by undetected defects.
Exploration and evaluation expenditures
The application of the Company’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditures requires judgment in
determining  whether  it  is  likely  that  future  economic  benefits  will  flow  to  the  Company,  which  may  be  based  on
assumptions about future events or circumstances. Estimates and assumptions made may change if new information
becomes available. If, after the expenditure is capitalized, information becomes available suggesting that the recovery
of the expenditure is unlikely, the amount capitalized is written off in the statement of operations in the period the new
information becomes available.
Income taxes
Significant  judgment  is  required  in  determining  the  provision  for  income  taxes.    There  are  many  transactions  and
calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
  The  Company  recognizes  liabilities  and  contingencies  for  anticipated  tax  audit  issues  based  on  the  Company’s
current understanding of the tax law.  For matters where it is probable that an adjustment will be made, the Company
records  its  best  estimate  of  the  tax  liability  including  the  related  interest  and  penalties  in  the  current  tax  provision.
Management believes they have adequately provided for the probable outcome of these matters; however, the final
outcome may result in a materially different outcome than the amount included in the tax liabilities.
In addition, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets relating to tax losses carried forward to the extent there are
sufficient taxable temporary differences (deferred tax liabilities) relating to the same taxation authority and the same
taxable entity against which the unused tax losses can be utilized.  However, utilization of the tax losses also depends
on the ability of the taxable entity to satisfy certain tests at the time the losses are recouped.
Decommissioning liabilities
Judgment is required to determine if there are legal or constructive obligations to incur restoration, rehabilitation and
environmental  costs  when  there  is  an  environmental  disturbance  caused  by  exploration,  development  or  ongoing
productions  of  an  exploration  and  evaluation  asset.  When  it  is  determined  that  an  obligation  exists,  a  provision  is
recognized. The provision for decommissioning liabilities depends on estimates of current risk-free interest rates, future
restoration and reclamation expenditures and the timing of those expenditures.
3.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies set out below for the year ended August 31, 2014 have been applied consistently to all periods
presented in these consolidated financial statements.
a)
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Minera
Delta S.A. de C.V. of Mexico, and 4247 Investments Ltd. (inactive) of British Columbia, Canada. The subsidiaries are
fully  consolidated  from  the  date  of  acquisition,  being  the  date  on  which  the  Company  obtained  control,  and  will
continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are
prepared  for  the  same  reporting  period  as  the  Company,  using  consistent  accounting  policies.  Significant  inter-
company balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
b)
Financial Instruments and Risk Management
Financial assets
The Company classifies its financial assets into one of the following categories, depending on the purpose for which
the asset was acquired. The Company's accounting policy for each category is as follows:
Fair value through profit or loss - This category comprises cash, short term investments and financial assets including
derivatives acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. They are carried
in the statements of financial position at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations
and comprehensive loss.
Loans and receivables - These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are
not  quoted  in  an  active  market.  They  are  carried  at  amortized  cost  less  any  provision  for  impairment.    Significant
receivables are considered for impairment when they are past due or when other objective evidence is received that a
specific counterparty will default.
Held-to-maturity  investments - These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments
and fixed maturities that the Company's management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. These
assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. If there is objective evidence that the
investment is impaired, determined by reference to external credit ratings and other relevant indicators, the financial
asset  is  measured  at  the  present  value  of  estimated  future  cash  flows.  Any  changes  to  the  carrying  amount  of  the
investment, including impairment losses, are recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Available-for-sale - Non-derivative financial assets not included in the above categories are classified as available-for-
sale. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized directly in equity. Where a decline in the fair
value of an available-for-sale financial asset constitutes objective evidence of impairment, the amount of the loss is
removed from equity and recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Transaction costs associated with fair value through profit or loss financial assets are expensed as incurred, while
transaction costs associated with all other financial assets are included in the initial carrying amount of the asset.
All financial assets except for those at fair value through profit or loss are subject to review for impairment at least at
each reporting date. Financial assets are impaired when there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of
financial assets is impaired. Different criteria to determine impairment are applied for each category of financial assets,
which are described above.
Financial liabilities
The Company classifies its financial liabilities into one of two categories, depending on the purpose for which the asset
was acquired. The Company's accounting policy for each category is as follows:
Fair value through profit or loss - This category comprises derivatives, or liabilities acquired or incurred principally for
the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. They are carried in the statements of financial position at fair
value with changes in fair value recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Other  financial  liabilities  - This  category  includes  promissory  notes,  amounts  due  to  related  parties  and  accounts
payables and accrued liabilities, all of which are recognized at amortized cost.

Financial Instruments and Risk Management (Continued)
Financial liabilities (Continued)
The  Company  has  classified  cash  as  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  financial  assets.  Investments  in  marketable
securities are classified as available for sale. Other receivables and related party advances are classified as loans and
receivables.  Accounts  payable  and  accrued  liabilities  and  due  to  related  parties  are  classified  as  other  financial
liabilities. Management did not identify any material embedded derivatives, which require separate recognition and
measurement.
Disclosures  about  the  inputs  to  financial  instrument  fair  value  measurements  are  made  within  a  hierarchy  that
prioritizes the inputs to fair value measurement.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
Level 1
Level 2
Level 3
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either
directly or indirectly; and
Inputs that are not based on observable market data
Financial instruments are exposed to credit, liquidity and market risks. Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial
instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation. Liquidity risks is the risk
that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. Market risk is that the
fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk
comprises three types of price risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Credit  risk  and  liquidity  risk  on  amounts  due  to  creditors  are  significant  to  the  Company’s  statement  of  financial
position.  The  Company  manages  these  risks  by  actively  pursuing  additional  share  capital  issuances  to  settle  its
obligations  in  the  normal  course  of  its  operating,  investing  and  financing  activities.  The  Company’s  ability  to  raise
share capital is indirectly related to changing metal prices and the prices of gold and silver in particular. To mitigate this
market risk, management of the Company actively pursues a diversification strategy with property holdings focusing on
precious metals as well as base metals.
c)
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash includes cash on hand, cash held in trust and demand deposits.  Cash equivalents include short-term, highly
liquid  investments  that  are  readily  convertible  to  known  amounts  of  cash  which  are  subject  to  insignificant  risk  of
change and have maturities of three month or less from the date of acquisition, held for the purpose of meeting short-
term cash commitments rather than for investing or other purposes.  As at August 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company did
not have any cash equivalents.
d)
Comprehensive Income
Other comprehensive income represents the change in net equity for the period that arises from unrealized gains and
losses on available-for-sale financial instruments. Amounts included in other comprehensive income are shown net of
tax. Cumulative changes in other comprehensive income are included in accumulated other comprehensive income
which is presented as a category in equity.
e)
Exploration and Evaluation Assets
Exploration  and  evaluation  expenditures  include  the  costs  associated  with  exploration  and  evaluation  activities.
Exploration and evaluation expenditures are capitalized as incurred. Costs incurred before the Company has obtained
the legal rights to explore an area are recognized in profit or loss.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
e)
Exploration and Evaluation Assets (Continued)
Exploration  and  evaluation  assets  are  assessed  for  impairment  if  (i)  sufficient  data  exists  to  determine  technical
feasibility  and  commercial  viability,  and  (ii)  facts  and  circumstances  suggest  that  the  carrying  amount  exceeds  the
recoverable amount.
Once the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the extraction of mineral resources in an area of interest are
demonstrable, which management has determined to be indicated by a feasibility study, exploration and evaluation
assets attributable to that area of interest are first tested for impairment and then reclassified to mining property and
development assets.
As the Company currently has no operational income, any incidental revenues earned in connection with exploration
activities  are  applied  as  a  reduction  to  capitalized  exploration  costs  with  any  excess  accounted  for  as  a  gain  on
disposal.
Recoverability  of  the  carrying  amount  of  any  exploration  and  evaluation  assets  is  dependent  on  successful
development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively, sale of the respective areas of interest.  If it is determined
that  exploration  and  evaluation  assets  are  not  recoverable,  the  property  is  abandoned;  or  if  management  has
determined an impairment in value, the property is written down to its estimated recoverable amount.
It  is  management’s  judgment  that  none  of  the  Company’s  exploration  and  evaluation  assets  have  reached  the
development stage and as a result are all considered to be exploration and evaluation assets.
Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest, in accordance
with industry standards for the current stage of exploration of such properties, these procedures do not guarantee the
Company’s  title.  Property  may  be  subject  to  unregistered  prior  agreements  and  non-compliance  with  regulatory
requirements. The Company is not aware of any disputed claims of title.
f)
Property and Equipment
IFRS requires that assets be disaggregated into individual components for amortization purposes and revaluation of
property,  plant  and  equipment  to  fair  value  is  also  permitted.  The  Company  currently  tracks  individual  assets  with
distinct  useful  lives  and  depreciates  them  separately.  The  Company  elected  to  use  the  cost  method  and  not  the
revaluation  method  due  to  the  difficulty  in  determining  accurate  fair  value  information  and  the  effort  required  to
continually monitor fair values.
Equipment and vehicles are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives at
the following rates:
Equipment
Vehicles
10% - 30%
25%
g)
Employee Future Benefits
The  Company  is  subject  to  Mexican  statutory  laws  and  regulations  governing  employee  termination  benefits  and
accrues for employee future benefits based on management’s estimates of the expected payments.
These  benefits  consist  of  a  one-time  payment  equivalent  to  12  days  of  wages  for  each  year  of  service  (at  the
employee’s most recent salary, but not to exceed twice the legal minimum wage), payable to all employees.
Under  Mexican  Labour  Law,  the  Company  also  provides  statutorily  mandated  severance  benefits  to  its  employees
terminated under certain circumstances. Such benefits consist of a one-time payment of three months wages plus 20
days of wages for each year of service payable upon involuntary termination without just cause.
Employee future benefits are unfunded.

h)
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
Impairment tests on intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually at the financial
year-end.    Other  non-financial  assets,  including  exploration  and  evaluation  assets,  are  subject  to  impairment  tests
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.  Where the
carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs
to sell, the asset is written down accordingly.
Where it is possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the
asset’s  cash-generating  unit,  which  is  the  lowest  group  of  assets  in  which  the  asset  belongs  for  which  there  are
separately identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets.  The Company
has one cash-generating unit for which impairment testing is performed.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made.   Determining the recoverable
amount  requires  the  use  of  estimates  and  assumptions  such  as  long-term  commodity  prices,  discount  rates,  future
capital  requirements,  exploration  potential  and  operating  performance.  Changes  in  circumstances  may  affect  these
estimates and the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognized in the statement of operations, except to the extent they reverse gains previously
recognized in other comprehensive income or loss.
i)
Impairment of Financial Assets
At  each  reporting  date,  the  Company  assesses  whether  there  is  any  objective  evidence  that  a  financial  asset  or  a
group of assets is impaired.  A financial asset or group of financial assets is deemed to be impaired, if, and only if, there
is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that has occurred after the initial recognition of the
asset and that event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group of financial
assets.
j)
Share Capital
Non-monetary consideration
Agent’s  warrants,  stock  options  and  other  equity  instruments  issued  as  purchase  consideration  in  non-monetary
transactions other than as consideration for mineral properties are recorded at fair value determined by management
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the shares issued is based on the trading price of those
shares on the TSX.V on the date of the agreement to issue shares as determined by the Board of Directors. Proceeds
from unit placements are allocated between shares and warrants issued using the residual method.
Share-based compensation
The share option plan allows Company employees and consultants to acquire shares of the Company. The fair value
of options granted is recognized as an employee or consultant expense with a corresponding increase in equity. An
individual is classified as an employee when the individual is an employee for legal or tax purposes (direct employee)
or provides services similar to those performed by a direct employee.
The fair value is measured at grant date, and each tranche is recognized using the graded vesting method over the
period during which the options vest. The fair value of the options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. At each financial
position reporting date, the amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options
that are expected to vest.

j)
Share Capital (Continued)
In situations where equity instruments are issued to non‐employees and some or all of the goods or services received
by the entity as consideration cannot be specifically identified, they are measured at the fair value of the share‐based
payment. Otherwise, share‐based compensation is measured at the fair value of goods or services received.
Share Issuance Costs
Costs directly identifiable with the raising of share capital financing are charged against share capital. Share issuance
costs incurred in advance of share subscriptions are recorded as non-current deferred assets. Share issuance costs
related to uncompleted share subscriptions are charged to operations.
k)
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
Earnings (loss) per share are calculated based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The Company
uses the treasury stock method to compute the dilutive effect of options, warrants and other similar instruments. Under
this  method,  the  dilutive  effect  on  earnings  per  share  is  calculated  to  reflect  the  use  of  the  proceeds  that  could  be
obtained upon the exercise of options and warrants. It assumes that the proceeds would be used to purchase common
shares at the average market price during the period. Basic and diluted losses per share are equal as the assumed
conversion of outstanding options and warrants would be anti-dilutive.
l)
Income Taxes
Income tax expense comprises of current and deferred tax.  Current tax and deferred tax are recognized in net  income
 except  to  the  extent  that  it  relates  to  a  business  combination  or  items  recognized  directly  in equity or in other
comprehensive income or loss.
Current income taxes are recognized for the estimated income taxes payable or receivable on taxable income or loss
for the current year and any adjustment to income taxes payable in respect of previous years.  Current income taxes
are determined using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year-end date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized where the carrying amount of an asset or liability differs from its tax
base, except for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill and temporary differences
arising on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and at the
time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Recognition of deferred tax assets for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences is restricted
to those instances where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the  deferred  tax  asset
 can  be  utilized.  At  the  end  of  each  reporting  period,  the  Company  reassesses unrecognized deferred tax assets.
The Company recognizes a previously unrecognized deferred tax asset to the  extent  that  it  has  become  probable
 that  future  taxable  profit  will  allow  the  deferred  tax  asset  to  be recovered.

Decommissioning Liabilities (Continued)
A  legal  or  constructive  obligation  to  incur  restoration,  rehabilitation  and  environmental  costs  may  arise  when
environmental  disturbance  is  caused  by  the  exploration,  development  or  ongoing  production  of  a  mineral  property
interest. Such costs arising from the decommissioning of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to their net
present value, are provided for and capitalized at the start of each project to the carrying amount of the asset, as soon
as the obligation to incur such costs arises. A pre-tax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and the risks
specific to the liability are used to calculate the net present value of the expected future cash flows. These costs are
charged to the statement of operations over the economic life of the related asset, through depreciation expense using
either the unit-of-production or the straight-line method as appropriate. The related liability is progressively increased
each period as the effect of discounting unwinds, creating an expense recognized in the statement of operations.  The
liability is assessed at each reporting date for changes to the current market-based discount rate, amount or timing of
the underlying cash flows needed to settle the obligation.
Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage which is created on an ongoing basis during production are provided
for at their net present values and charged against profits as extraction progresses.
The Company has no material restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs as the disturbance to date is minimal.

The  Company  has  an  extensive  property  portfolio  of  mining  concessions,  acquired  mainly  through  staking,  in  the
Uruachic District of Mexico covering approximately 10,000 hectares. The Company has various net smelter returns on
specific claims forming a part of the Company’s properties. The net smelter returns range from 1% to 3%, which have
buyouts ranging from US$250,000 to US$2,000,000.
In May 2007 and amended April 2011, the Company optioned to Comstock Metals Ltd. (“Comstock”) the right to earn
up  to  a  75%  and  60%  interest  respectively  in  the  Corona  and  El  Chamizal  properties  in  exchange  for  Comstock
spending $500,000 and $200,000 on the respective properties before February 8, 2014, and issuing 300,000 (300,000
common  shares  received)  and  150,000  (25,000  common  shares  received)  common  shares  respectively  to  the
Company over a period of two years. In order to keep the option in good standing, Comstock paid $50,000 and issued
an additional 200,000 common shares to the Company.

EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION ASSETS (Continued)
The Company has received notice from Comstock that it has spent in excess of $1,000,000 at Corona and effective
April  9,  2013,  the  Company  and  Comstock  entered  into  a  joint  venture  agreement  to  further  explore  the  property
whereby Comstock will act as the operator. The Company is responsible for 40% of all exploration costs going forward.
 The Company has been advised that Comstock does not wish to proceed with the joint venture, as such the Company
is responsible for 100% of the Corona costs.
Comstock has advised the Company that it will no longer proceed with the El Chamizal option and has returned a
100% interest in the property back to the Company.
In December 2011, and as amended January 25, 2012, the Company signed an Earn-in and Shareholders Agreement
with  Agnico-Eagle  Mines  Limited  (“Agnico”)  for  the  exploration  and  development  of  the  Company’s  Las  Bolas/Los
Hilos  property.    Under  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  Agnico  has  the  right  to  earn  a  51%  interest  in  the  property  by
spending $5,000,000 on the property over a period of 5 years. The first year’s work commitment is a firm commitment of
$500,000  with  expenditure  requirements  increasing  each  year  thereafter.  Upon  fulfilling  the  commitments  for  51%
interest, they will have deemed to acquire 71% interest without further consideration.
In August 2013, Agnico has elected to terminate the agreement.
During the year ended August 31, 2014, $2,883,086 (2013 - $2,178,691) in deferred expenditures related to certain
mineral claims were written down. These write-downs were mainly related to the Company’s San Timoteo/Oro Leon
(2013 - Las Bolas/Los Hilos) Property.  A number of other smaller claims were written off which the Company will
continue  to  hold  but  which  are  not  viewed  as  priorities.  Management  does  not  currently  intend  to  conduct  any
exploration activities on these non core claims in the next year.

Nature and Purpose of Reserves
The  reserves  recorded  in  equity  on  the  Company’s  statements  of  financial  position  is  comprised  of  “Share-based
Payments  Reserve”  and  is  used  to  recognize  the  fair  value  of  stock  option  grants  prior  to  exercise,  expiry  or
cancellation and the fair value of other share-based consideration paid at the date of payment.
11.
LOSS PER SHARE
The Company calculates the basic and diluted loss per common share using the weighted average number of common
shares  outstanding  during  each  period  and  the  diluted  loss  per  share  assumes  that  the  outstanding  vested  stock
options and share purchase warrants had been exercised at the beginning of the year.
To compute diluted earnings per share, the average number of shares outstanding is adjusted for the number of all
potentially dilutive shares.  As of August 31, 2014, the Company had a total of 6,750,000 (2013 – 8,190,000; 2012 –
9,065,000) stock options outstanding.  As of August 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company also had a total of 11,988,888
warrants outstanding (2012 – Nil), of which 1,155,555 were potentially dilutive.  Dilutive options and warrants were not
included in the Company’s loss per common share calculation because the result was anti-dilutive.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)
There have been no transfers between levels 1 and 2, or transfers in or out of level 3 for the years ended August 31,
2014 and 2013.
Financial Instrument Risk Exposure and Risk Management
The Company is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks.  The Board of Directors
approves and monitors the risk management process.  The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to
reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Company’s competitiveness and flexibility. The types of risk
exposure and the way in which such exposure is managed is provided as follows:
Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to fulfil an obligation and cause the other party to
incur a financial loss. The Company’s credit risk to its financial asset is summarized below:
Cash
  Short term investments
  Marketable securities
  Accounts receivable
  Due from related parties
  Value-added taxes recoverable

783,952
48,875
12,281
36,121
92,734
The credit risk of cash and short-term investments is assessed as nominal as the counter party is major Canadian
financial institutions. The credit risk of accounts receivable and marketable securities is assessed as low. The carrying
amount of these financial assets is their maximum exposure to credit risk. The Company does not invest in asset–
backed commercial papers.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulties in meeting its financial obligations associated with
its financial liabilities as they fall due. The Company ensures that there is sufficient capital in order to meet short term
business requirements, after taking into account the Company’s holdings of cash.
As  of  August  31,  2014,  the  Company  does  not  have  sufficient  cash  and  highly  liquid  investment  on  hand  to  meet
current  liabilities  and  its  expected  administrative  requirements  for  the  coming  year.  The  Company  has  cash  of
$105,407 (2013 - $297,429), highly liquid investments of $Nil (2013 - $783,952) and total liabilities of $114,619 (2013 -
$107,600).  Accounts  payable  and  accrued  liabilities  of  $45,280  (2013  -  $45,381)  are  due  within  three  months.
Management has assessed liquidity risk as high.
Market Risk
The significant market risk exposures to which the Company is exposed are foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk,
and commodity price risk.
Foreign Currency Risk
The  Company  has  operations  in  Canada  and  Mexico  subject  to  foreign  currency  fluctuations.    The  Company’s
operating expenses are incurred in Canadian dollars and Mexican pesos, and the fluctuation of the Canadian dollar in
relation to this other currency will have an impact upon the profitability of the Company and may also affect the value of
the Company’s assets and the amount of equity.  The Company has not entered into any agreements or purchased any
instruments to hedge possible currency risks.

Based on the above net exposures as at August 31, 2014, and assuming that all other variables remain constant, a
10% change in the value of the Mexican peso against the Canadian dollar would result in an increase/decrease of
approximately $3,400 (2013 - $3,170) in loss from operations.  Based on the above net exposures as at August 31,
2014, and assuming that all other variables remain constant, a 10% change in the value of the US dollar against the
Canadian dollar would result in an increase/decrease of approximately $1 (2013 - $14,851) in loss from operations.
Interest Rate Risk
As at August 31, 2014, the Company has no significant exposure to interest rate risk through its financial instruments.
The Company's operations are in northern Mexico and are subject to various levels of political, economic and other
risks and uncertainties unique to Mexico. These risks and uncertainties may include: extreme fluctuations in currency
exchange  rates;  high  rates  of  inflation;  labor  unrest;  risks  of  war  or  civil  unrest;  expropriation  and  nationalization;
renegotiation  or  nullification  of  existing  concessions,  licenses,  permits  and  contracts;  illegal  mining;  corruption;
restrictions  on  foreign  exchange  and  repatriation;  hostage  taking;  and  changing  political  conditions  and  currency
controls. In addition, the Company may have to comply with multiple and potentially  conflicting regulations in Canada
and  Mexico,  including  export    requirements,  taxes,  tariffs,  import  duties  and  other  trade  barriers,  as  well  as  health,
safety and environmental requirements.  Changes, if any, in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in
Mexico may adversely affect the Company's operations. Operations may be affected in varying degrees by government
regulations  with    respect  to  matters  including  restrictions  on  production,  price    controls,  export  controls,  currency
controls or restrictions, currency  remittance, income and other taxes, expropriation of property, foreign  investment,
maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land  use, land claims of local people, water use and mine safety.
Failure  to comply strictly with applicable laws, regulations and local practices relating to mineral rights applications
and tenure could result in loss, reduction or expropriation of entitlements or the imposition of additional local or foreign
parties as joint venture partners with carried or other interests.
14.
CAPITAL DISCLOSURES
The Company was formed for the purpose of acquiring exploration and development stage natural resource properties.
 The directors determine the Company’s capital structure and make adjustments to it based on funds available to the
Company, in order to support the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties.  The directors have
not established quantitative return on capital criteria for capital management.
The Company is dependent upon external financing to fund future exploration programs and its administrative costs.
The  Company  will  spend  existing  working  capital  and  raise  additional  amounts  as  needed.    The  Company  will
continue to assess new properties and to seek to acquire an interest in additional properties if management feels there
is sufficient geologic or economic potential provided it has adequate financial resources to do so.
The  directors  review  the  Company’s  capital  management  approach  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  believe  that  this
approach, given the relative size of the Company, is reasonable. The Company’s objective when managing capital is
to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

characteristics of the underlying assets.  In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue
new shares through private placements, sell assets to reduce debt or return capital to shareholders.  There were no
changes to the Company’s approach to capital management during the year.  Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries
are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
