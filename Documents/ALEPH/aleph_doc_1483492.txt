Financial Condition and Results of Operations to (a) remove reference to an updated Technical Report, dated February 8, 2011, and (b) remove the inadvertent

Project.

as our Company’s audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended February 28, 2011. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. These

NOTE 2 – CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
In  December  2010,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  issued  Accounting  Standards  Update  (“ASU”)  2010-28,  “Intangibles,  Goodwill  and 
Other”. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of 
ASU 2010-28 during the period did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 
 
In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-29,  “Business Combinations”.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods 
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2010-29 during the period did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial 
position, cash flows or results of operations. 
 
NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these interim consolidated financial statements. 
 
Basis of Presentation 
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to U.S. GAAP applicable to exploration stage enterprises.(cid:160)
dollar, and the financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. 
 
The consolidated interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Mercer One Panama Corp. and Mercer 
Two Panama Corp.(cid:160)
 
Mineral Property Expenditures 
Mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized as intangible assets when purchased.(cid:160)
carrying  costs  for  impairment.(cid:160)
economically developed, costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserve. 
 
Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred. 
 
Estimated future removal and site restoration costs, when determinable, are provided over the life of proven reserves on a units-of-production  basis.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Costs, 
which  include  production  equipment  removal  and  environmental  remediation,  are  estimated  each  period  by  management  based  on  current  regulations,  actual 
expenses incurred, and technology and industry standards.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Any charge is included in exploration expense or the provision for depletion and depreciation during 
the period and the actual restoration expenditures are charged to the accumulated provision amounts as incurred. 
 
As of the date of these interim financial statements, the Company has not established any proven or probable reserves on its mineral properties and incurred only 
acquisition and exploration costs. 
 
Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest, according to the usual industry standards for the stage of 
exploration of such properties, these procedures do not guarantee the Company’s title.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Such properties may be subject to prior agreements or transfers and title 
may be affected by undetected defects. 
 
Asset Retirement Obligations 
The Company has adopted ASC 410, “Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations”, which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement 
obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. ASC 410 requires the Company to record a liability for the present value of the estimated site 
restoration  costs  with  corresponding  increase  to  the  carrying  amount  of  the  related  long-lived  assets.(cid:160)
(cid:160)The  liability  will  be  accreted  and  the  asset  will  be 
depreciated over the life of the related assets.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Adjustments for changes resulting from the passage of time and changes to either the timing or amount of the 
original present value estimate underlying the obligation will be made. There were no asset retirement obligations as at May 31, 2011.
(cid:160)At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Company assesses the

NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the period.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant areas requiring management ’s estimates and assumptions are the determination of 
the  fair  value  of  transactions  involving  common  stock  and  financial  instruments.  Other  areas  requiring  estimates  include  deferred  tax  balances  and  asset 
impairment tests. 
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
For the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.(cid:160)
and cash equivalents as of May 31, 2011 that exceeded federally insured limits. 
 
Net Income (Loss) per Common Share 
The  Company  computes  income  (loss)  per  share  in  accordance  with  ASC  260,  “Earnings  Per  Share”  which  requires  presentation  of  both  basic  and  diluted 
(cid:160) Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common 
earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations.(cid:160)
shareholders by weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential 
common shares outstanding during the period.(cid:160)
 
Fair Value Financial Instruments 
A fair value hierarchy was established that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.(cid:160)
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). 
 
The fair values of the financial instruments were determined using the following input levels and valuation techniques:
(cid:160)Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti -dilutive.
(cid:160)The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices

As at May 31, 2011, the fair value of cash and cash equivalents, amounts receivables, accounts payable, amounts due to related parties and promissory notes 
payable approximate carrying value due to their short maturities.
(cid:160)As a result, credit risk is considered insignificant.
Credit Risk 
Credit risk is the risk of an unexpected loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises primarily from 
the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and amounts receivable. The Company manages its credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents by dealing only 
with highly-rated US financial institutions.(cid:160)
(cid:160)As at May 31, 2011, amounts receivable was comprised of Harmonized Sales Tax receivable of $25,316 (February 28, 
2011 - $15,690).(cid:160)
 
Liquidity Risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.(cid:160)

(cid:160)Foreign currency risk is limited to the portion of the Company ’s business transactions denominated in currencies other than the US dollar.
NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
 
Current Risk 
The Company is exposed to currency risk on its acquisition and exploration expenditures on its Colombian properties since it has to convert US dollars raised 
through equity financing in US dollars to Colombian Pesos.(cid:160)
(cid:160)The Company ’s expenditures will be negatively impacted if the Colombian Pesos increases versus 
the US dollar. 
 
The majority of the Company’s cash flows and financial assets and liabilities are denominated in US dollar, which is the Company’s functional and reporting 
currency.(cid:160)
 
The Company monitors and forecasts the values of net foreign currency cash flow and balance sheet exposures and from time to time could authorize the use of 
derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts to economically hedge a position of foreign currency fluctuations.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Currently, the 
Company does not use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk. 
 
Other Risks 
Unless otherwise noted, the Company is not exposed to significant interest rate risk and commodity price risk. 
 
Income Taxes 
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax 
consequences  attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial  statement  carrying  amounts  of  existing  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  respective  tax 
(cid:160)Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in 
balances.(cid:160)
(cid:160)The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in 
which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled.(cid:160)
the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.(cid:160)
(cid:160)As at May 31, 2011, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards, however, due 
to the uncertainty of realization, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets resulting from these loss carryforwards. 
 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The  financial  statements  are  presented  in  U.S.  dollars.(cid:160)
liabilities  are  translated  to  their  U.S.  dollar  equivalents  using  foreign  exchange  rates  which  prevailed  at  the  balance  sheet  date.(cid:160)
translated at average rates of exchange during the period.(cid:160)
gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in results of operations. 
 
Stock-Based Compensation 
On June 1, 2006, the Company adopted ASC 718, “Compensation  – Stock Compensation”, which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for 
employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the 
award, and is recognized as an expense over the employees’ requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The Company adopted 
ASC 718 using the modified prospective method, which requires the Company to record compensation expense over the vesting period for all awards granted 
after the date of adoption, and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption. (cid:160)Accordingly, financial 
statements for the periods prior to January 1, 2006 have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share-based compensation. (cid:160)Adoption of 
ASC 718 does not change the way the Company accounts for share-based payments to non-employees, with guidance provided by ASC 505-50, “Equity-Based 
Payments to Non-Employees”. 
(cid:160)  
(cid:160)
(cid:160)In  accordance  with  ASC  830,  “Foreign Currency Matters”,  foreign  denominated  monetary  assets  and

(cid:160)
(cid:160)The following discussion contains forward -looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.(cid:160)
(cid:160)  
Item 2.(cid:160)
(cid:160)  
The following discussion of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations for the three months ended May 31, 2011 and 2010 
should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes for the three months ended May 31, 2011 and

(cid:160)Our actual results may differ materially 
from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to, those referred to under the heading “Risk 
Factors” below. 
(cid:160)  
Overview of Our Business 
(cid:160)  
We are currently engaged in the business of exploration of precious metals with a focus on the exploration and development of gold deposits in Colombia. As of 
the  date  of  this  quarterly  report,  our  mineral  interest  consists  of  an  option  agreement  on  an  exploration  stage  property  as  discussed  below.  We  have  not 
established any proven or probable reserves on our mineral property interest. There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on our 
property interest. Further exploration will be required before a final evaluation as to the economic and legal feasibility is determined with respect to our mineral 
property interest. At the present time, our primary property of interest is the Guayabales Property, Colombia as described below.

Title to Property and Underlying Option Agreement 
(cid:160)  
CMG, a Colombian legal entity, is the rightful owner of the concession contract #LH 0071-17, an exploitation license valid until March 28, 2032, that was registered 
on  March  28,  2008  by  INGEOMINAS  in  the  Department  of  Caldas  (registration  #HHXB  01).(cid:160)
(cid:160)As  described  above,  MGC,  a  privately -held,  Canadian  entity 
registered in British Colombia, entered into an Option Agreement “Underlying Option Agreement”  with CMG on March 4, 2010 to acquire a 100% interest in 
Guayabales. The Company entered into the Definitive Option Agreement with MGC as described above to acquire the 100% interest of Guayabales subject to the 
terms  of  the  Underlying  Option  Agreement.(cid:160)
(cid:160)No  surface  agreements  are  in  place;  however,  CMG  represents  and  warrants  reasonable  surface  access  to 
Guayabales in the Underlying Option Agreement and the Colombian Mining Code guarantees surface access. 
(cid:160)  
(cid:160)Obtaining a mining right does not transfer ownership of the mineral estate, but 
In Colombia, all mineral rights are the property of the government of Colombia.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Under 
creates a temporary right to explore and benefit from minerals in exchange for royalty payments so long as the mining title remains in good standing.(cid:160)
Colombian  mining  law,  foreign  individuals  and  corporations  have  the  same  rights  as  Colombian  individuals  and  corporations,  and  Colombian  governmental 
regulatory  bodies  are  specifically  prohibited  from  requiring  any  additional  or  different  requirements  than  would  be  required  of  a  Colombian  individual  or 
corporation. 
(cid:160)  
Subject to the Definitive Option Agreement as described above, the Company is responsible for all obligations established in the Underlying Option Agreement 
between MGC and CMG in order to complete the 100% acquisition of the Guayabales Property.(cid:160)
(cid:160)These obligations include cash payments; provision for allowing 
continued Limited Mining Rights as described below; property maintenance; and quarterly reports.(cid:160)
(cid:160)

(cid:160)  
(cid:160)
2.  Limited Mining Rights: The Company provides CMG with Limited Mining Rights, allowing the cooperative group of miners belonging to the entity to 
(cid:160)Operations are not to exceed 80 metric tonnes per day, providing that the mining operations are restricted 
(cid:160)The Company has the right to terminate this right to mine, by either

Technical Report 
(cid:160)  
We received a technical report (the “Technical Report”)  in accordance with the provisions of National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral 
Projects  (“NI  43-101”), of  the  Canadian  Securities  Administrators  for  the  Guayabales  Property,  which  is  located  in  the  Department  of  Caldas,  Colombia.  The 
complete technical report, which was authored by Dean D. Turner, C.P.G., a qualified person as defined in NI 43-101, was filed under our Company’s profile on the 
Canadian Securities Administrators public disclosure website, at www.sedar.com, on May 28, 2010.(cid:160)

(cid:160)

(cid:160)
(cid:160)
(cid:160)  
Plan of Operations 
(cid:160)  
Our Plan of Operations for the next twelve months is to pursue Phase I of the recommended exploration program on the Guayabales Property, as described in more 
detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 28, 2011, under “Item 1.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Business  – Mineral Properties – Guayabales Property, Colombia – 
Company’s Planned Exploration Program.” 
(cid:160)  
We have decided to reduce the work program for the next 12 months while we review our forward plan in depth and estimate we will spend about $1,000,000 over 
the next 12 months.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Further, we expect to spend approximately $300,000 in the next 12 months in office and general expenses and professional, consulting and 
management fees. 
(cid:160)  
Based on our current plan of operations as set forth above, we estimate that we will require approximately $1.3 million to pursue our plan of operations over the 
(cid:160)We will require additional financing to pursue our 
next twelve months.(cid:160)
plan of operations over the next twelve months.(cid:160)
(cid:160)There can be no assurance that we will obtain any additional financing in the amounts required or on terms 
favorable to us. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may have to re-evaluate or abandon our business activities and revise our plan of operations. 
(cid:160)  
We anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. However, we cannot provide investors with any 
assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our plan of operations going forward. In the absence of such 
financing, our business plan will fail. Even if we are successful in obtaining equity financing, there is no assurance that we will obtain the funding necessary to 
pursue our business plan. If we do not continue to obtain additional financing going forward, we will be forced to re-evaluate or abandon our plan of operations. 
(cid:160)  
We are an exploration stage company and have not generated any revenue to date.(cid:160)
Company for the periods indicated: 
(cid:160)
(cid:160)As at May 31, 2011, we had cash of $3,109 and a working capital deficit of $(2,051,174).(cid:160)

activity;
•   office and miscellaneous expenses of $77,613 (2010 – $31,747), which decreased between 2010 and 2011 due to foreign exchange gains on operations in
Colombia;
•   rent of $44,176 in 2011 (2010 - $14,399) which increased from 2010 to 2011 as we increased our activity on the Guayabales property; and

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
(cid:160)  
Our condensed interim financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. 
GAAP”)  applied  on  a  consistent  basis.(cid:160)
(cid:160)The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.  GAAP  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 
(cid:160)  
We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements.(cid:160)
(cid:160)In general, management ’s estimates are based on 
historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and 
circumstances.(cid:160)
(cid:160)  
Basis of Presentation 
(cid:160)  
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to U.S. GAAP applicable to exploration stage enterprises.(cid:160)
dollar, and the financial statements are presented in U. S. dollars. 
(cid:160)  
The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  Company  and  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  Mercer  One  Panama  Corp.  and  Mercer  Two 
Panama Corp.(cid:160)
(cid:160)  
Mineral Property Expenditures 
(cid:160)  
Mineral property acquisition costs are initially capitalized as tangible assets when purchased.(cid:160)
carrying  costs  for  impairment.(cid:160)
economically developed, costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserve. 
(cid:160)  
Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred. 
(cid:160)  
Estimated future removal and site restoration costs, when determinable are provided over the life of proven reserves on a units-of-production basis.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Costs, which 
include production equipment removal and environmental remediation, are estimated each period by management based on current regulations, actual expenses 
incurred,  and  technology  and  industry  standards.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Any  charge  is  included  in  exploration  expense  or  the  provision  for  depletion  and  depreciation  during  the 
period and the actual restoration expenditures are charged to the accumulated provision amounts as incurred. 
(cid:160)  
As  of  the  date  of  these  financial  statements,  the  Company  has  not  established  any  proven  or  probable  reserves  on  its  mineral  properties  and  incurred  only 
acquisition and exploration costs. 
(cid:160)  
Although the Company has taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest, according to the usual industry standards for the stage of 
exploration of such properties, these procedures do not guarantee the Company’s title.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Such properties may be subject to prior agreements or transfers and title 
may be affected by undetected defects. 
(cid:160)  
(cid:160)

(cid:160)
(cid:160)  
Asset Retirement Obligations 
(cid:160)  
The Company has adopted ASC 410, “Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations”, which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement 
obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. ASC 410 requires the Company to record a liability for the present value of the estimated site 
restoration  costs  with  corresponding  increase  to  the  carrying  amount  of  the  related  long-lived  assets.(cid:160)
(cid:160)The  liability  will  be  accreted  and  the  asset  will  be 
depreciated over the life of the related assets.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Adjustments for changes resulting from the passage of time and changes to either the timing or amount of the 
original present value estimate underlying the obligation will be made. There were no asset retirement obligations as at May 31, 2011. 
(cid:160)  
Use of Estimates 
(cid:160)  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the period.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant areas requiring management ’s estimates and assumptions are the determination of 
the  fair  value  of  transactions  involving  common  stock  and  financial  instruments.  Other  areas  requiring  estimates  include  deferred  tax  balances  and  asset 
impairment tests. 
(cid:160)  
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
(cid:160)  
For the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.(cid:160)
and cash equivalents as of May 31, 2011 and February 28, 2011 that exceeded federally insured limits. 
(cid:160)  
Net Income (Loss) per Common Share 
(cid:160)  
The  Company  computes  income  (loss)  per  share  in  accordance  with  ASC  260,  “Earnings  Per  Share”  which  requires  presentation  of  both  basic  and  diluted 
(cid:160)Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common 
earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations.(cid:160)
shareholders by weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential 
common shares outstanding during the period.(cid:160)
(cid:160)  
Financial Instruments 
(cid:160)  
The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities approximate their carrying values due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these 
financial instruments. 
(cid:160)  
Income Taxes 
(cid:160)  
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax 
consequences  attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial  statement  carrying  amounts  of  existing  assets  and  liabilities  and  their  respective  tax 
(cid:160)Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in 
balances.(cid:160)
(cid:160)The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in 
which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled.(cid:160)
the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.(cid:160)
(cid:160)As at May 31, 2011, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards, however, due 
to the uncertainty of realization, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets resulting from these loss carryforwards. 
(cid:160)  
(cid:160)
(cid:160)Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti -dilutive.

translated at average rates of exchange during the period.(cid:160)
gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in results of operations. 
(cid:160)  
Stock-Based Compensation 
(cid:160)  
On June 1, 2006, the Company adopted ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation”, which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for 
employee services. Under the provisions of ASC 718, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the 
award, and is recognized as an expense over the employees’ requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the equity grant). The Company adopted 
ASC 718 using the modified prospective method, which requires the Company to record compensation expense over the vesting period for all awards granted 
after the date of adoption, and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption. (cid:160)Accordingly, financial 
statements  for  the  periods  prior  to  January  1,  2006  have  not  been  restated  to  reflect  the  fair  value  method  of  expensing  share-based  compensation.  (cid:160)The 
adoption of ASC 718 does not change the way the Company accounts for share-based payments to non-employees, with guidance provided by ASC 505-50, 
“Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees”. 
(cid:160)  
Other Updates 
(cid:160)  
In December 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)  2010-28, “Intangibles, Goodwill and 
Other”. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of 
ASU 2010-28 during the period did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 
(cid:160)  
In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-29,  “Business Combinations”. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods 
within  those  years,  beginning  after  December  15,  2010.  The  adoption  of  ASU  2010-29  during  the  period  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company’s 
financial position, cash flows or results of operations. 
(cid:160)  
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
(cid:160)  
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, “Presentation of Comprehensive Income”.(cid:160)
(cid:160) This ASU presents an entity with the option to present the total of 
comprehensive  income,  the  components  of  net  income,  and  the  components  of  other  comprehensive  income  either  in  a  single  continuous  statement  of 
(cid:160)In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of other comprehensive 
comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.(cid:160)
(cid:160)This update eliminates the option to present the 
income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income.(cid:160)
components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity.(cid:160)
(cid:160)The amendments in this update do not change the 
items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.(cid:160)
(cid:160)As ASU 2011 -05 
relates only to the presentation of Comprehensive Income, the Company does not expect that the adoption of this update will have a material effect on its 
consolidated financial statements.

(cid:160)We will require additional financing in order to be able to fund our plan of operations.
(cid:160)  
Funding for Plan of Operations 
(cid:160)  
As set forth above under “Plan of Operations”, we anticipate that we will required approximately $1.3 million over the next twelve months to pursue our Plan of 
Operations.(cid:160)
(cid:160)  
Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments.(cid:160)
(cid:160)In connection with our business 
plan, management anticipates additional increases in exploration expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) exploration properties; and (ii) future exploration 
property acquisitions. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise 
additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in 
dilution to our current shareholders.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may 
not  be  available  upon  acceptable  terms,  or  at  all.  If  adequate  funds  are  not  available  or  are  not  available  on  acceptable  terms,  we  may  not  be  able  to  take 
advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 
(cid:160)  
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
(cid:160)  
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in 
financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 
(cid:160)  
Item 3.(cid:160)
(cid:160)  
As a “smaller reporting company” (as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K), our Company is not required to provide information required by this Item.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
(cid:160)  
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such 
information is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and principal financial officer, William Thomas, to allow for timely decisions regarding 
required disclosure.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for 
our Company. 
(cid:160)  
William Thomas, our principal executive and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in 
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of May 31, 2011. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that 
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 31, 2011.
