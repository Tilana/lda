Chief Executive, Jonathan Lewis said:
"Our industry continues to face very challenging conditions, with capital projects across natural
resources markets being delayed and cancelled in many parts of the world.
Despite this, we continue to benefit from the diversity of our platform and we remain on track to deliver
the operational guidance we gave at the beginning of the year.
I have initiated a wide-ranging review of the strategy, our organisation structure and cost base - which
we are now part-way through. I expect to update investors on these issues in the autumn."

Notes to editors:
Amec Foster Wheeler (www.amecfw.com) designs, delivers and maintains strategic and complex
assets for its customers across the global energy and related sectors.
Employing around 36,000 people in more than 55 countries and with 2015 revenues of £5.5 billion,

and distribution of derivative products - and in the mining, clean energy, power generation, pharma,
environment and infrastructure markets.
Amec Foster Wheeler offers full life-cycle services to offshore and onshore oil and gas projects
(conventional and unconventional, upstream, midstream and downstream) for greenfield, brownfield
and asset support projects, plus leading refining technology.
Amec Foster Wheeler shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange and its American
Depositary Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Both trade under the ticker AMFW.
Segmental review by business units
Americas
Americas is the largest business unit, with positions in each of our four markets: Oil and Gas, Mining,
Clean Energy, and Environment and Infrastructure.
We support our customers in consulting, through the EPC project lifecycle (including engineering,
procurement, project management and construction), into operations & maintenance, and remediation
and reinstatement.
Poor trading in the Oil & Gas business during the first half has required significant remedial action to
be taken. Senior management positions have been changed, and a consolidation of operating units
and office space has commenced. As a result, a non-cash impairment charge of £125m has also been
taken.

1 Non-IFRS measure (see 'Performance measures')
Revenue in Americas was £1,394 million (2015: £1,267 million), an increase of 10%. Excluding the
effect of currency movements, underlying revenue was up 7%. Significant growth in the Clean Energy
and Environment & Infrastructure sectors offset declines in Oil & Gas and Mining.
Trading profit fell by 23% to £64 million (2015: £82 million), the main impact was in Oil & Gas where
key contracts were delayed or cancelled by customers which caused a major decline in utilisation
rates in Houston. As a result trading margin was 4.6%, down by 190 basis points compared with
2015.
Oil & Gas projects currently underway include capital and sustaining capital projects at Kearl for
Imperial Oil, Conoco Phillips and Suncor and early stage work on a greenfield methanol plant for YCI.
In Latin America we continue to build our relationship through early stage project activity with PEMEX
in Mexico.  We are nearing the completion of our scope for K+S at Legacy, and although Mining
project activity remains subdued, we are currently working on a number of FEEDs.  In E&I we are
working on site remediation programmes for Honeywell and Duke.
We are working on a number of utility-scale solar projects, with 2016 set to be a record year. The
renewables market in the US is expected to attract new investment for the next few years, helped by
the extension of investment tax credits by the US Congress late last year. We have a strong pipeline
of these projects in the US with a range of customers, including Sempra, Dominion, Panoche Valley
and Georgia Power.

1 Non-IFRS measure (see 'Performance measures')
Revenue in NECIS rose by 3% to £759 million (2015: £736 million), primarily due to a higher level of
Oil & Gas activity in the North Sea, driven by major offshore hook ups.  Excluding the effect of
currency movements, underlying revenue was also up 3%.
Trading profit decreased by 21% to £55 million (2015: £70 million). Trading margin was 7.3%, down
220 basis points compared with 2015, reflecting last year's strong performance on contract close outs
and the ending of the NMP contract at Sellafield during the half.
Key UK North Sea projects worked on during the first half include 4 hook up and commissioning
projects, including Clair Ridge and Quad 204 for BP and Cygnus for Engie. Work has continued under
long-term brownfield contracts with Conoco Phillips, Nexen, Maersk, Marathon and Shell. In
Azerbaijan, work continues on Shah Deniz 2 for BP.
Clean Energy projects include reactor services support work for EDF's nuclear power stations in the
UK and ongoing clean-up work at the Sellafield site, as well as framework agreements with National
Grid and Scottish Power.

1 Non-IFRS measure (see 'Performance measures')
Revenue in AMEASE was 3% lower at £505 million (2015: £518 million). Weaker Oil & Gas revenues,
with growth in the Middle East impacted by project deferrals, was partially offset by stronger
performances from Mining and E&I. Excluding the effect of currency movements, underlying revenue
was down 6%.
Trading profit rose by 11% to £36 million (2015: £33 million) reflecting the continued benefits of the
integration of the legacy businesses in the region. Trading margin was 7.2%, up 90 basis points.
Key upstream Oil & Gas projects include providing asset support for ConocoPhillips' Bayu-Udan gas
facilities in the East Timor Sea and we are providing technical and project management services on
the Upper Zakum project for Zadco and for ADMA Opco at Umm Lulu. Downstream projects in Asia
include front end design for the expansion of the Dung Quat refinery in Vietnam for Binh Son Refining
Company and two work packages at ExxonMobil's new halobutyl rubber and hydrocarbon resins plant
in Singapore. In the Middle East downstream projects include supporting KNPC's new oil refinery at
Al Zour, delivering the propylene oxide plant at Jubail for Sadara Chemical Company. In Europe, we
are working on the revamp of ExxonMobil's refinery at Antwerp.
In Mining we continue to work on the Çőpler gold mine in Turkey, and are about to complete our
scope on the Husab uranium project in Namibia. US Government work includes the Space Fence
project in the Marshall Islands with Lockheed Martin and projects in Qatar and Afghanistan.
We have a strong pipeline for future projects, including in the Middle East and Africa for Oil & Gas and
emerging opportunities across the region for Clean Energy, evidenced by the encouraging order book
growth.

Global Power Group (GPG)
GPG has market-leading capabilities in the design, supply and erection of circulating fluidised bed
(CFB) boilers, auxiliary steam and air pollution control equipment including a wide range of
aftermarket products and services. Customers include utilities, independent power producers, and
industrial concerns.
GPG's recent results and medium term forecasts are well down on prior expectations giving rise to
another impairment in goodwill and intangible assets of £246m, and the book value is now £180m.
Further information can be found in note 10.
As previously announced GPG is undergoing a sale process. The Board expects that this process will
conclude in the coming months.

Revenue in GPG rose by 11% to £216 million (2015: £195 million), reflecting good progress in
projects in execution. On an underlying basis, revenue was up 6%.
Trading profit rose by 60% to £33 million (2015: £21 million). Trading margin rose 480 basis points to
15.4% in 2016, due to the successful conclusion of projects and the impact of cost saving measures.
The erection of the 4 x 550MWe ultra-supercritical CFB boilers at Samcheok in South Korea, the
largest CFB units in the world has continued to progress, and the plant is now undergoing trial
operations. We are currently working on four projects in Mexico, including the supply of two heat
steam recovery generators for Iberdrola and providing an arch fired steam generator at the Thai Binh
Thermal Power Plant in Vietnam.
Order in-take remains weak, and the pipeline of future work remains uncertain - with over US$500
million of work awarded for projects that are awaiting the go-ahead from customers (and therefore not
yet recorded in our order book).

Financing update
On 2 March we announced we had completed the refinancing of our main debt facilities by entering
into a new facility with a syndicate of 20 banks.  No capital repayments are required to be made until
2019 under the terms of the facility.
The facility is denominated in GBP. However, we have drawn down monies in a range of currencies
(including using swaps) to provide a natural hedge with our key operating currencies (GBP, EUR,
USD and CAD).
We have current credit ratings from Moody's (Ba1, negative outlook) and Standard & Poors (BB+,
negative outlook).
Cost savings update
The previously announced cost saving programme is on track, and we plan to deliver £130 million of
cost savings per annum by 2017. In the year to date we have taken an exceptional charge of £55
million.
Board changes
On 18 January we announced that Samir Brikho was stepping down as Chief Executive and leaving
the board with immediate effect.
On 27 April we announced the appointment of Dr Jonathan (Jon) Lewis, as Chief Executive Officer,
with effect from 1 June 2016. On the same day Ian McHoul ceased to be interim CEO, and reverted to
being CFO.
Roy Franklin joined the board as a non-executive director on 1 January 2016.
Strategy and disposals review
The disposal process for GPG is ongoing, and is expected to conclude in the coming months. Assets
held for sale on the balance sheet comprise our interests in an infrastructure asset and three power
generating assets. Together with GPG, the proceeds expected from these assets is c£300m.
Jon Lewis and his senior team have initiated a wide-ranging review of the strategy, organisation and
cost base which is expected to be completed in the autumn.  The project incorporates a review of our
portfolio of assets, with further candidates for disposal expected to be identified, with an aggregate
value of proceeds of at least £200m.
Therefore, the board continues to believe that disposals can deliver £500m of proceeds to reduce
leverage by June 2017.
Investor event
The senior management will be holding a series of presentations for investors and analysts on 15
November. Further details will be provided ahead of the event.
Outlook
For the full-year 2016, our trading result expectations are unchanged, including the benefit of forecast
weaker Sterling in the second half.
Second half like-for-like revenues will be down double-digit compared to last year's comparator, with
trading margins expected to be similar to the first half result this year.
Net debt is expected to be circa £1.1 billion at the year end, before proceeds from disposals, but
including the impact of weaker Sterling and anticipated higher restructuring costs.
Operating and financial review
Basis of preparation
Accounting policies
The condensed financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2016 have been prepared in
accordance with IAS 34 as adopted for use in the EU.  From the group's perspective, there are no
differences between IFRS as adopted for use in the EU and IFRS as issued by the IASB.
There have been no changes to the group's principal accounting policies during the six months ended
30 June 2016.
Adjusted performance measures
We report adjusted performance measures because they provide both management and investors
with useful additional information about the underlying trading performance of the business.
Adjusted performance measures used by the group are reconciled to the equivalent IFRS measures in
the section entitled 'Performance measures'.
Restatement
On 13 November 2014 (the acquisition date), the group acquired 95.3 per cent of the issued share
capital of Foster Wheeler AG.  Management had not finalised its assessment of the fair values of
certain of Foster Wheeler's assets and liabilities at the time that the 2015 interim financial statements
were completed, and as a result, the 2015 interim financial statements reflected the provisional
assessment of the fair values as at the acquisition date.
During the latter part of 2015, management completed the fair value assessment and the comparative
amounts for June 2015 shown in the Balance Sheet, Statement of Comprehensive Income and
Statement of Changes in Equity have been restated to reflect changes made to the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities recognised on the acquisition of Foster Wheeler, details of which are set out in
note 24 to the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts.
As the acquisition of Foster Wheeler AG in November 2014 represented more than 90% of Foster
Wheeler's issued share capital, the acquisition qualifies for merger relief under section 612 of the
Companies Act 2006 from crediting the share premium that arose on the new shares issued in
consideration for Foster Wheeler to a share premium account.  The balance sheet as at 30 June 2015
has been restated to present excess of the nominal value of the shares issued of £877m as a merger
reserve.
Continuing operations
Revenue
Revenue for the period at £2,842m was 7% higher than last year (six months ended 30 June 2015:
£2,664m).
Revenue increased by £127m in the Americas, by £23m in NECIS and by £21m in the Global Power
Group.  This was offset by a decline of £13m in AMEASE. Weakness in the Oil & Gas markets in the
Americas and AMEASE was offset by growth in Clean Energy, Mining and Environment &
Infrastructure.
Excluding the effect of currency movements, underlying revenue increased by 4%.
Administrative expenses
Administrative expenses were £741m (six months ended 30 June 2015: £250m), including
exceptional items, intangibles amortisation and impairment and asbestos-related items of £580m (six
months ended 30 June 2015: £83m).
Administrative expenses before intangibles amortisation and impairment, exceptional items and
asbestos-related items declined by £6m to £161m.
Corporate costs, which comprise the costs of operating central corporate functions and certain
regional overheads, were £3m lower at £22m (six months ended 30 June 2015: £25m).
(Loss)/profit before net financing expense
There was a loss before net financing expense of £414m (six months ended 30 June 2015: profit of
£83m) as a result of the impairment losses and exceptional items recognised in the period.
Amortisation and impairments
Intangible assets principally comprise goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that were recognised
in relation to acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortised but is subject to an annual impairment
test. There were a number of impairments recognised against goodwill and other assets which are
discussed below. Amortisation of intangible assets was £66m (2015: £65m).  During the period,
impairments of £440m were recognised of which £405m was recorded directly against goodwill and
intangible assets and £35m against assets classified as held for sale:
·        £246m - impairment of GPG goodwill and intangible assets.  During 2016, there has been a
further deterioration in the forecast results of the GPG business with further delays and project
cancellations and reduced bookings in the period.  This has resulted in a further impairment charge of
£246m (year ended 31 December 2015: £308m).
·        £125m - impairment of the Americas intangible assets.  During the first half of 2016 there was a
significant deterioration in the trading conditions and forecast outturn for the oil and gas business
based in Houston.  Management has impaired the ongoing value of the intangible assets in the light of
current trading conditions and uncertainty over prospects; resulting in a charge of £125m in the first
half.
·        £35m - impairment of two operations transferred to held for sale in the period, including £11m
transfer of goodwill attributable to the disposal group.
·        £34m - impairment of ERP systems which will be replaced with a scalable, global system.
Exceptional items
Pre-tax exceptional costs of £53m were incurred during the period (six months ended 30 June 2015:
£30m) of which £51m (six months ended 30 June 2015: £25m) are recorded in trading profit and £2m
(six months ended 30 June 2015: £5m) is recorded in net financing expense as follows:
·        costs of £55m in relation to the restructuring and integration costs (including severance, office
rationalisation, consultancy as well as IT and other costs);
·        £2m release of provisions no longer required
Asbestos-related items (net of insurance recoveries)
During the six months ended 30 June 2016, the group recognised net asbestos-related costs of £24m
(six months ended 30 June 2015: income of £3m) of which £21m (six months ended 30 June 2015:
income of £7m) related to the movement in the discount rate applied to the net asbestos-related
liabilities assumed on the acquisition of Foster Wheeler and is reported in trading profit.  In addition,
there was an asbestos-related interest expense of £3m (six months ended 30 June 2015: £4m) related
to the unwinding of the discount applied to the liability.

1 Non-IFRS measure (see 'Performance measures')
Trading profit fell by 6% to £177m (six months ended 30 June 2015: £188m). Trading profit in the
Americas fell by £18m with reduced utilisation in Houston following project delays and cancellations. 
Trading profit also fell by £15m in NECIS as the NMP joint venture at Sellafield came to an end and
2015 benefitted from successful project close outs.  Trading profit was £3m higher in AMEASE and
£12m higher in GPG which saw the benefits of cost savings and successful project close outs.
Net financing expense
The net financing expense was £40m (six months ended 30 June 2015: £26m) including bank interest
and finance lease interest payable of £29m. In H1 2016 the net financing expense also included
expenses of £5m associated with the cost of refinancing activities, £3m due to the unwinding of the
discount on the net asbestos-related liabilities, £1m amortisation of facility arrangement fees, and £2m
other items.
A net currency exchange loss of £92m (six months ended 30 June 2015: gain of £37m) was
recognised in the translation reserve in respect of foreign currency borrowings and derivatives held in
designated net investment hedging relationships. The exchange loss was principally caused by a
weakening of Sterling during the period.
Share of results of post-tax results of joint ventures
The group's share of joint ventures' post-tax profit for the period was £8m (six months ended 30 June
2015: £16m). Two of the Group's joint ventures are now classified as held for sale and so will cease
equity accounting.

There was a loss before tax of £446m (six months ended 30 June 2015: profit of £73m) after
impairment charges of £440m (2015: nil) intangibles amortisation of £66m (six months ended 30 June
2015: £65m), a net asbestos-related charge of £24m (six months ended 30 June 2015: credit of £3m),
exceptional charges of £53m (six months ended 30 June 2015: £30m) and the group's share of joint
ventures' tax expense of £3m (six months ended 30 June 2015: £5m). Adjusted profit before tax was
17% lower at £140m (six months ended 30 June 2015: £170m).
Taxation
Our tax policy is to manage our obligations in compliance with all relevant tax laws, disclosure
requirements and regulations.  We seek to ensure that our approach to tax and the tax payments that
we make in all territories in which we have operations is fully consistent with local requirements,
taking into account available tax incentives and allowances and is aligned with the group's wider
business strategy. We seek to develop good, open working relationships with tax authorities and to
engage with them proactively, recognising that tax legislation can be complex and may be subject to
differing interpretations.
The group's effective tax rate for the first six months of 2016 on continuing operations (including its
share of joint ventures' income tax expense but before exceptional items, intangibles amortisation and
impairment and asbestos-related items) was 21.1% (six months ended 30 June 2015: 22.3%). The full
year tax rate is expected to be in the range 21-22%.
During the first six months of 2016, there was a tax credit on exceptional items of £3m (including a tax
charge on exceptional items of discontinued operations of £1m) (six months ended 30 June 2015:
£6m, including tax on exceptional items of discontinued operations of £2m), and a tax credit of £27m
on intangibles amortisation and impairment (six months ended 30 June 2015: £12m).
The group's share of joint ventures' income tax expense was £3m (six months ended 30 June 2015:
£5m).
(Loss)/profit for the period from continuing operations
There was a loss for the period from continuing operations of £441m (six months ended 30 June 2015:
profit of £56m) after adjusting for intangibles impairment and amortisation of £506m (six months ended
30 June 2015: £65m), the net asbestos-related charge of £24m (six months ended 30 June 2015:
income of £3m), exceptional items of £53m (six months ended 30 June 2015: £30m), and income tax
credits on those items of £31m (six months ended 30 June 2015: £16m), adjusted profit for the period
was £111m (six months ended 30 June 2015: £132m).
(Loss)/earnings per share
Diluted loss per share was (112.7)p (six months ended 30 June 2015: EPS of 11.8p), comprising loss
per share of (115.8)p (six months ended 30 June 2015: EPS of 14.5p) from continuing operations and
an EPS of 3.1p (six months ended 30 June 2015: loss of 2.7p) from discontinued operations.
Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was 28.2p (six months ended 30 June 2015: 34.0p),
due to the reduction in trading profit in the period.
Dividend
The board has declared an interim dividend of 7.4p per share.  This will be paid on 4 January 2017 to
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 25 November 2016.
Commentary on the results of the operating segment is included in the segmental review on pages 3
to 6.
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations represent the residual assets and retained obligations of businesses sold in
prior years, including the UK conventional power business which was discontinued in 2013.
Discontinued operations generated a pre-tax trading profit before tax of £6m as a result of a provision
release on a completed contract (six months ended 30 June 2015: loss of £5m).  There was an
associated tax charge of £1m (six months ended 30 June 2015: credit of £1m) resulting in a post-tax
profit for the period of £5m (six months ended 30 June 2015: loss of £4m).
Discontinued operations included a pre-tax profit on disposals of £8m (six months ended 30 June
2015: loss of £8m) arising from the release of indemnity provisions no longer required following
favourable settlements and costs associated with businesses sold in prior years, there was an
associated tax charge of £1m (six months ended 30 June 2015: tax credit of £2m) giving a total post-
tax profit for the period of £12m (six months ended 30 June 2015: loss of £10m).
Cash flow
Trading cash flow
Trading cash flow of £125m was £41m higher than 2015 (2015: £84m), as a result of a stronger
working capital performance.
Cash conversion from trading profit was 71% (2015: 45%).
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure was £3m (2015: £9m).  Additionally, there were cash payments in respect of
computer software of £7m (2015: £15m) and proceeds from disposals of £1m (2015: £1m).
Acquisitions and disposals
There was a cash outflow of £5m in respect of acquisitions and disposals principally related to
settlement of liabilities relating to businesses disposed in prior years.  In the prior period, a cash
outflow of £56m principally related to the acquisition of the minority interest in Foster Wheeler in
January 2015 following the squeeze out merger.
Exceptional items
The cash outflow on exceptional items principally related to settlement of asbestos claims, integration
and restructuring costs.  In addition, £49m was paid during the period in settlement of the Longview
dispute.

Balance sheet
Goodwill and other intangibles
As at 30 June 2016, the carrying amount of goodwill was £2,185m (31 December 2015: £2,192m),
with the reduction during the year being an impairment of £214m recognised against the goodwill
attributable to the Global Power Group business and the allocation of £11m of goodwill to the disposal
group.  This was offset by exchange movements of £218m. See note 10 for further details.
As at 30 June 2016, the carrying amount of other intangibles was £648m (31 December 2015:
£833m), which comprised acquired identifiable intangible assets of £608m (31 December 2015:
£753m) and computer software of £40m (31 December 2015: £80m).  During the period there was an
impairment charge of £157m recognised against the customer relationship intangible assets arising
as part of the Foster Wheeler acquisition and allocated to the Americas and GPG and a £34m write off
of computer software.
Property, plant and equipment
As at 30 June 2016, property, plant and equipment amounted to £83m (31 December 2015: £127m),
with the reduction in the period due to the transfer of PPE (power generation assets) to held for sale
along with depreciation of £13m offset by exchange and other movements of £11m and capex
additions of £3m.
The Group holds the majority of the properties through which the group operates under operating
leases which are for varying periods and on differing terms.
Post-retirement benefits
The group has a number of defined benefit pension plans in a number of countries.  There were three
principal plans: two in the UK and one in the US. As at 31 December 2015, each of these plans was
closed to new entrants and the two legacy Foster Wheeler plans were also closed to future service
accruals.  Following an employee consultation exercise at the end of 2015, the Company confirmed
its intention to close its two main UK defined benefit pension schemes to future accrual from 1 April
2016 and replace them with a new defined contribution arrangement. The necessary Trustee
approvals have now been received, and all legacy defined benefit plans in the UK have now been
merged into the new arrangement.
As at 30 June 2016, there was a net deficit of £109m on the group's defined benefit pension plans (31
December 2015: surplus of £63m) with the movement in the period principally due to movements in
the discount rates applied to the liabilities.
Provisions
Provisions held at 30 June 2016 were £670m (31 December 2015: £664m).
During the six months ended 30 June 2016 provisions of £40m were utilised and £36m of provisions
no longer required were released to the income statement.  Additional provisions of £9m were created
and the asbestos provision increased by £21m as a result of changes in the discount rate applied to
the provision and there were exchange and other movements of £48m.

Details of the provisions held by the group are set out in note 11 to the accompanying financial
information.
Asbestos-related obligations
Certain of the company's subsidiaries in the UK and US are subject to claims by individuals who
allege that they have suffered personal injury alleged to have arisen from exposure to asbestos
primarily in connection with equipment allegedly manufactured by certain of our subsidiaries during
the 1970s or earlier.
As at 30 June 2016, the group recognised:
·      asbestos-related liabilities of £464m, which included estimates of indemnity amounts and defence
costs for open and yet to be asserted claims expected to be incurred in each year in the period to
2050; and
·      insurance recoveries of £127m
The net liability of £(337)m in respect of asbestos-related obligations is presented on the balance
sheet within other non-current receivables (£112m); trade and other receivables (£15m); trade and
other payables (£(39)m) and provisions (£(425)m).
There was a net cash outflow of £12m during H1 2016 due to the excess of forecast indemnity
payments and defence costs over insurance proceeds.
Investments
Following the impairment charges against goodwill and intangible assets, the carrying value of
subsidiary company investments held on the parent company balance sheet was reviewed and a
write down of £507m was charged against the merger reserve created on the acquisition of Foster
Wheeler.  This has no impact on distributable reserves.
Going concern
Based on internal forecasts and projections that take into account reasonably possible changes in the
group's trading performance, the directors consider that the group has adequate financial resources to
continue in operation for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the group's financial statements.
Performance measures
Profitability measures
We use three measures of profitability that are not recognised measures under IFRS: trading profit,
trading margin and adjusted profit before tax. As appropriate, we exclude the following specific items
in arriving at these measures: exceptional items, the amortisation and impairment of intangible assets,
and asbestos-related costs (net of insurance recoveries).  Exceptional items are items of income and
expense that are material by their size, incidence or nature and may include, but are not restricted to:
acquisition-related costs, restructuring costs, gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets, and
gains and losses on the disposal or closure of businesses. Acquisition-related costs may include
transaction costs (including external advisory, legal, valuation and other professional fees and
attributable internal costs), the amortisation of acquisition-related facility fees, payments to selling
shareholders that are accounted for as remuneration and changes in the fair value of contingent
consideration.
Trading profit
Trading profit represents profit before net financing expense excluding exceptional items, the
amortisation and impairment of intangible assets and asbestos-related costs (net of insurance
recoveries). Trading profit includes the group's share of the trading profit of joint ventures.

Principal business and strategic risks
The table below shows Amec Foster Wheeler's principal business and strategic risks. Each is specific
to the Group and could have a material impact on it. Actions have been taken to mitigate these risks
and these are also shown.
Risks
Geopolitical and economic conditions
Amec Foster Wheeler expects to derive the majority of its
revenues from Europe, the US and Canada and is therefore
particularly affected by political and economic conditions in those
markets.
Mitigation
Amec Foster Wheeler seeks to
maintain a balanced geographic
presence and, through acquisitions
and organic growth, will continue to
increase its exposure to other
attractive regions of the world.
Changes in general economic conditions may influence
customers' decisions on capital investment and/or asset
maintenance, which could lead to volatility in the development of
Amec Foster Wheeler's order intake. These may also lead to
change in the customer base, competition and in the way
The risk associated with economic
conditions resulting in a downturn
and affecting the demand for Amec
Foster Wheeler's services has been
addressed, as far as practicable, by
customers procure the services we provide. An increase in
competition for new contracts may lead to different, less
favourable contract terms and conditions.
Continuing and escalating unrest and insurgency activity in the
Middle East may have a negative impact on existing and future
opportunities in the region.
The UK's decision to leave the EU has brought about a period of
economic uncertainty that is likely to continue until after
separation takes place. This uncertainty may dampen investment
in an environment of negative market sentiment. There is also the
possibility of a second Scottish independence referendum which
would create further uncertainty, particularly in the North Sea oil
and gas sector. The decision of the UK to leave the EU may also
have a knock-on effect elsewhere in Europe as member states
consider their own futures in the Union.
Changes in commodity prices
A sustained and significant reduction in oil & gas or commodity
prices would have an adverse impact on the level of customer
spending in Amec Foster Wheeler's markets and consequently
represents a risk to organic growth.
The fall in oil prices has had an impact on the investment
behaviour of Amec Foster Wheeler customers in this sector, with
pressure on capital expenditure leading to a greater focus on
smaller projects and operating expenditure and an increase in
competition for new contracts.
Project delivery
Failing to maintain discipline and meet customer expectations on
project delivery could result in damage to reputation, loss of
repeat business and potentially lead to litigation and/or claims
against Amec Foster Wheeler.
seeking to maintain a balanced
business portfolio in terms of
geographies, markets, clients and
service offering/business model.
In light of continuing global
economic uncertainties, steps have
been taken to assess and monitor
any potential impact on Amec
Foster Wheeler's business
opportunities and address potential
increased supply chain and, more
broadly, counterparty risk.
The Strategy and Business
Development function is focussed
on realising the synergies across
our customers, markets,
geographies, service offerings and
relationships.
We will continue to monitor
developments resulting from the
UK's decision to leave the
European Union and develop
response strategies to mitigate risk
to Amec Foster Wheeler.
This risk is mitigated by maintaining
a balanced business portfolio of
geographies, markets, clients and
service offerings.
Improved efficiencies through
increased workflow between offices
and the effective use of centres of
excellence and High Value
Execution Centres.
The Project Delivery function
provides assurance, drives project
execution and supports the
development, training and
mobilisation of personnel to
enhance execution competencies.
In addition the system of globally
applied policies and procedures,
combined with comprehensive
management oversight, the risk
management process, project
reviews, internal audit, peer reviews
Risks
Lump sum contracts
Lump sum contracts carry different risks than
reimbursable contracts, with the contractor agreeing the
contract price at the start of the contract and accepting
the risk of cost overruns in completing the project.
Staff recruitment and retention
An inability to attract and retain sufficient high‑calibre
employees could become a barrier to the continued
success and growth of Amec Foster Wheeler.
Senior management departures or prolonged absences
could also adversely affect our ability to implement our
strategy and manage our operations efficiently.
Health, safety, security and environment
Amec Foster Wheeler is involved in activities and
environments that have the potential to cause serious
injury to personnel or damage to property or the
environment and damage to our reputation.
These activities may involve operations such as design,
construction, commissioning and decommissioning,
which have potential to cause serious environmental
damage, pollution and habitat destruction.
and customer feedback, mitigate the
risk to successful project delivery.
Mitigation
This risk is mitigated by having skills and
competencies fully aligned with the project
scope. It is further mitigated by having a
clear, delegated authority structure in place,
combined with the formal global mandatory
procedures relating to contracting principles
and the tender review process. In addition,
the Project Delivery function referred to in
the project delivery risk above, perform
reviews, provide assurance and drive
project execution.
This risk is mitigated with a clear Human
Resources strategy, which is aligned to the
business strategy and focused on attracting,
developing and retaining the best people for
the Group with succession planning as
appropriate. It is underpinned by an
employee framework which describes how
we manage our people consistently.
In addition, there is a continual review of
compensation and benefits to ensure sector
and geographic competitiveness and there
are localised recruitment teams capable of
recruiting large numbers into Amec Foster
Wheeler.
Amec Foster Wheeler Academy delivers
development activities to enhance delivery
and prepare employees for more advanced
roles.
In order to control risk and prevent harm,
Amec Foster Wheeler is focused on
achieving the highest standards of health,
safety and security management. This is
achieved through setting of an effective
policy and putting in place clear standards
which underpin our health, safety, security
and environmental management systems.
We have put in place processes to assure
that our systems work effectively throughout
the organisation and health and safety
performance is regularly reviewed against
agreed targets to facilitate continual
improvement.
Amec Foster Wheeler employs
environmental and engineering specialists
to support projects in implementing
comprehensive project management
planning at all stages of a project. These
processes are governed by appropriate
quality management systems and are
supported by risk identification tools aimed
at identifying and managing all aspects of
project environmental risk.
Environmental management systems are in
place to monitor and mitigate this risk.
Planned preventative maintenance
schedules are in place to further mitigate this
risk.
Appropriate controls are in place to mitigate
the risk of systems failure and data loss,
including systems back-up procedures, data
security breach response plan, disaster
recovery plans and globally distributed data
centres providing a secure and reliable
environment for hosting critical applications.
There is also appropriate virus protection,
malware detection and remediation, network
security controls and penetration testing and
encryption of mobile devices.
Mitigation
Amec Foster Wheeler has a number of
measures in place to mitigate the risk of a
substantive ethical breach and/or non-
compliance with laws or regulations,
including:
·      embedded policies and procedures;
·      Code of Business Conduct;
Environmental licences
Amec Foster Wheeler's build/own/operate facilities and
fabrication/manufacturing sites rely on maintaining
environmental licences to operate, which includes
protecting the environment and achieving legally
enforceable operating parameters. Failure to maintain
these standards may result in the revocation of all or part
of the licence and the suspension of operation, resulting
in criminal or civil action and/or financial risk to the
business. Failure to maintain assets and/or pollution
abatement equipment may result in a failure to meet
legally-binding objectives and targets for the operation.
Information technology (IT)
Amec Foster Wheeler is exposed to the risk that the IT
systems on which it relies fail and/or that sensitive data
held by the Group is lost due to ineffective data
governance or as a result of unauthorised access to
Amec Foster Wheeler systems or malware attacks.
Risks
Ethical breach
A substantive ethical breach and/or non-compliance with
laws or regulations could potentially lead to damage to
Amec Foster Wheeler's reputation, fines, litigation and
claims for compensation.
·      segregation of duties;
·      management oversight;
·      financial and operational controls;
·      independent whistle-blowing
mechanism;
·      appointment of ethics and compliance
officers;
·      anti-fraud and other internal audits;
·      legal team advice;
·      training programmes supporting the
Code of Business Conduct and Anti-bribery
and Corruption; and
·      oversight by the Health, Safety,
Security, Environmental and Ethics
committee of the board
This risk to Amec Foster Wheeler's pension
schemes is mitigated by:
·      maintaining a relatively strong funding
position over time;
·      taking advice from independent
qualified actuaries and other professional
advisers;
·      agreeing appropriate investment
policies with the trustees; and
·      close monitoring of changes in the
funding position, with reparatory action
agreed with the trustees in the event that a
sustained deficit emerges.
The established legacy team manages
these claims with internal and external legal
advice. The aim is to seek cost-effective
management of litigation and promote
commercially sensible settlements where
appropriate.
Amec Foster Wheeler has made provisions
for the legacy issues that are believed to be
adequate and is not aware of any other
current issues relating to disposed
businesses which are likely to have a
material impact. Specialist teams with the
appropriate knowledge are brought in as
Pensions
Amec Foster Wheeler operates a number of defined
benefits pension schemes, where careful judgement is
required in determining the assumptions for future salary
and pension increases, discount rate, inflation,
investment returns and member longevity. There is a risk
of underestimating this liability.
Legacy risks
Litigation and business claims from divested and non-
core businesses remain a risk to Amec Foster Wheeler.
Managing non-core legacy assets until divestment may
require skills that are not common to the rest of the
Company.
Ground contaminants remain at some former Amec Foster
Wheeler operational localities where the pollutant may
have been as a result of the Company's operations, or the
Company is responsible for its clean-up. There is a risk
that pollution may result in a risk to human health or the
environment. There is potential for civil and/or criminal
action against the Company for such pollutants.
Asbestos liability
The legacy Foster Wheeler business is exposed to
significant numbers of claims relating to alleged exposure
to asbestos. The quantum of these claims is actuarially
forecast each year and provisions are held against these
loss projections. However there is a risk that these loss
projections will be exceeded and the provisions could be
inadequate to meet the liabilities.
required.
In the case of any known contaminated
land, strategies have been developed to
minimise the risk posed by such
contaminated land, including asset
management and land remediation projects
and they remain under continuing review.
There is a dedicated in-house finance and
legal resource comprising a team of
specialist asbestos lawyers who manage
the claims, assisted by National Co-
ordinating Counsel (NCC) and local
counsel. A claims strategy has been
developed with the NCC and regular
reviews are undertaken.
The team monitors legal developments in
these claims and the strategy to deal with
them on a regular basis.
The quantum of these claims is actuarially
forecast each year and provisions are held
against the loss projections.
Risks
Financial - breach of covenant, counterparty and liquidity
If trading continues to deteriorate and sterling weakens
further as a result of the decision of the UK to leave the
European Union, Amec Foster Wheeler's Net Debt to
EBITDA covenant will come under pressure. A breach of
covenant without waiver from the banking group would
result in our debts becoming due and payable
immediately.
There is a risk if a counterparty is unable to repay
deposits, fund a loan in a committed loan relationship or
fund a position under forex arrangements.
The risk of being unable to generate sufficient cash from
operations to fund growth or to repay debt may be
compounded if sterling continues to weaken as a result of
the UK's decision to leave the EU. As we have drawings in
currency and our facilities are sterling denominated, this
may impact on our overall liquidity.
Mitigation
Amec Foster Wheeler is actively pursuing
the disposal of assets to significantly
reduce debt and improve leverage ratio.
In the event of a risk of breach of covenant
Amec Foster Wheeler would seek a waiver
from our banking group.
Counterparty risk is mitigated by limiting
the amount that can be invested with any
one counterparty. Such limits are
determined by ratings and a review of
other factors such as 5 year credit default
swap prices, economic and national
considerations.
Amec Foster Wheeler has
uncommitted/bilateral lines used for
performance bonds, letters of credit etc.
If sterling continues to weaken and liquidity
comes under pressure we would seek
additional top up funding from a limited
number of providers.
Bank ratings are regularly reviewed to
ensure security of counterparty for both
deposits and lending.

NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
1.      CORPORATE INFORMATION
The interim condensed accounts of Amec Foster Wheeler plc for the six months ended 30 June 2016
were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 9 August 2016.
Amec Foster Wheeler plc is a public limited company, which is listed on both the London Stock
Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange and incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The
principal activities of the company and its subsidiaries (the group) are described in note 3.
2.      PREPARATION OF INTERIM RESULTS
Basis of preparation
This condensed set of accounts has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial
Reporting', as adopted for use in the European Union. From the Group's perspective, there are no
differences between IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union and IFRS as issued by the
IASB.  As required by the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the
condensed set of accounts has been prepared applying the accounting policies and presentation that
were applied in the preparation of the company's published consolidated accounts for the year ended
31 December 2015.
The comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2015 are not the group's statutory accounts
for that financial year but are an extract from those accounts.  The statutory accounts for the year
ended 31 December 2015 have been reported on by the group's auditors and delivered to the
Registrar of Companies.  The report of the auditors was unqualified, did not include a reference to any
matters to which the auditors drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their report, and did
not contain statements under section 498 (2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.
The consolidated accounts for the year ended 31 December 2015 were prepared in accordance with
IFRS as adopted by the European Union and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 that are
applicable to Companies Reporting under IFRS.  There are no IFRS, IAS amendments or IFRIC
interpretations effective for the first time this financial year that have had a material impact on the
group. The accounts are presented rounded to the nearest million, however, all calculated numbers,
for example earnings per share, are calculated on the underlying numbers to one decimal place
precision.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, income and expenses.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based
on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future
periods.
Management considers that the most significant areas of judgement and estimation made in preparing
the consolidated financial statements arise in relation to the accounting for long-term contracts,
business combinations, defined benefit pensions and other retirement benefits and provisions
(including asbestos-related liabilities), in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible
assets and the fair values of assets and liabilities that are classified as held for sale.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)
2.      PREPARATION OF INTERIM RESULTS (continued)
Impairment of assets
The Group has a significant amount of intangible assets on its balance sheet. Goodwill arising on
acquisitions represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of
the assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is capitalised and subject to impairment review, both
annually and when there are indications that its carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment
loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The determination of carrying value involves significant judgements when allocating goodwill to the
cash generating units 'CGUs') expected to benefit from the acquisition. The estimation of the
recoverable amounts also requires significant judgements and estimates including the future cash
flows of the CGU, terminal growth rates and the appropriate rate at which to discount those cash flows.
See note 10 for further details of the impairment reviews performed during the year. The carrying
amount of the Global Power Group CGU has been reduced to its recoverable amount through
recognition of an impairment loss of £214m against goodwill.
Assets held for sale
In March 2016, the Group announced its intention to reduce net debt via the disposal of non-core
assets.  Assets and liabilities that meet the definition of held for sale as set out in IFRS 5 'Non-current
assets held for sale and discontinued operations' are presented separately on the consolidated
balance sheet and valued at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.  Judgement is
required in determining when an asset meets the IFRS 5 criteria of held for sale and certain
assumptions have to be made in relation to future disposal proceeds when estimating fair value less
costs to sell.  As at 30 June 2016, two equity accounted joint ventures and one subsidiary undertaking
are presented as held for sale.  Further details are provided in note 7.
Use of adjusted measures
Management uses adjusted performance measures including trading profit, adjusted profit before tax
and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Each of these measures is based on an IFRS measure of
profit but excludes specific items whose inclusion in the IFRS measure hinders the comparison of the
trading performance of our businesses from one period to another, with each other or with those of our
competitors.
Management has identified the following specific items that are excluded in arriving at these non-IFRS
measures: exceptional items; the amortisation and impairment of intangible assets; and asbestos-
related costs (net of insurance recoveries).
Management does not regard these non-IFRS measures as a substitute for, or superior to, the
equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and it should be noted that
they may not be comparable with similarly-titled measures used by other companies.
Restatement
On 13 November 2014 (the acquisition date), the Group acquired 95.3% of the issued share capital of
Foster Wheeler AG. Due to the relatively short period of time between the acquisition date and 30
June 2015, management had not finalised its assessment of the fair values of certain of Foster
Wheeler's assets and liabilities at the time that the Interim 2015 financial statements were completed,
and as a result, the Interim 2015 financial statements reflected the provisional assessment of the fair
values as at the acquisition date.
During the second half of 2015, Management had completed the fair value assessment of the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities recognised on the acquisition of Foster Wheeler. Details of which are
set out in the 2015 Annual reports and Accounts note 24.
The impact on the above compared to the restated December 2014 position is the recognition of an
additional exchange gain of £19m in the condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity for
the period ended 30 June 2015.
As the acquisition of Foster Wheeler AG in November 2014 represented more than 90% of Foster
Wheeler's issued share capital, the acquisition qualifies for merger relief under section 612 of the
Companies Act 2006 from crediting the share premium that arose on the new shares issued in
consideration for Foster Wheeler to a share premium account. The balance sheet as at 30 June 2015
has been restated to present the excess of the nominal value of the shares issued of £877m as a
merger reserve.
Going concern
The directors are satisfied that the group has adequate resources to operate for the foreseeable future
and, therefore, it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
accounts.  At 30 June 2016 the Group had net debt of £1,084m. In total, the Group had committed and
available banking facilities of £1,788m.
The Group has complied with all applicable covenant requirements and has assumed it will be able to
meet expected mandatory interest and repayment of its banking facilities in place.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)
3.      SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS
Amec Foster Wheeler designs, delivers and maintains strategic and complex assets for its customers
across the global energy and related sectors.
Segment information is presented on a consistent basis with the information presented to the Group
Leadership Team for the purposes of allocating resources within the group and assessing the
performance of the group's businesses.
The Group Leadership Team uses trading profit as the measure of the profitability of the group's
businesses. Trading profit is, therefore, the measure of segment profit presented in the group's
segment disclosures. Trading profit represents profit before net financing expense excluding
exceptional items; the amortisation and impairment of intangible assets; and asbestos-related costs
(net of insurance recoveries). Trading profit includes the group's share of the trading profit of joint
ventures.

On 3 August 2016, the Group signed a sale and purchase agreement related to one of the entities in
the disposal group.  The sale is subject to certain conditions but is expected to complete this year. 
Total disposal proceeds are expected to be circa £30m.
An impairment loss of £35m writing down the carrying amount of the disposal group to its fair value
less costs to sell has been included within the impairment charges recognised in the income
statement.  Further details are provided in note 4.
8.      EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic and diluted earnings per share are shown on the face of the income statement.  The calculation
of the average number of shares in issue has been made having deducted the shares held by the
trustees of the Employee Share Trust and those held in treasury by the company.  As the Group has
reported a basic loss per ordinary share from continuing operations, any potential ordinary shares are
anti-dilutive and so excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share.

The impairment loss of £405m recognised in the period includes £214m impairment of goodwill in
relation to the Global Power Group, impairments of £125m and £32m respectively against the
customer relationship intangible asset in the Americas and Global Power Group, and £34m
impairment of ERP systems that will be replaced with a global system in software.
The Group is required to test its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or
more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.  The review of goodwill for indications of impairment
by management is performed at the operating segment level, being the lowest level of cash-
generating units (CGU) monitored for goodwill purposes.
Global Power Group
During the first half of 2016, there has been a further deterioration in the forecast results of the Global
Power Group with further delays and project cancellations and reduced bookings in the period.  As a
result, impairment tests have been performed on the goodwill and intangible assets of the Global
Power Group CGU.
The recoverable amount of the Global Power Group has been based on value-in-use calculations
which use cash flow projections approved by management for 2016, 2017 and 2018.  For the
purposes of the calculation of the recoverable amount, the cash flow projections beyond the forecast
period include 5% growth in 2019 and 10% growth in 2020, following this a terminal growth rate of 3%
has been applied. This long-term growth rate is in line with long-term average growth rates for the
regions in which the CGU operates.
The carrying amount of the Global Power Group CGU has been reduced to its recoverable amount
through recognition of an impairment loss of £214m against goodwill and £32m against the customer
relationship intangible asset acquired with Foster Wheeler. These have been included in
administrative expenses in the income statement.  Any adverse changes in the key assumptions
would increase these impairment losses.  The recoverable amount of the Global Power Group CGU is
now £180m.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)
10.    INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)
Americas
During the first half of 2016, there has also been a significant deterioration in the trading conditions
and forecast outturn of the oil and gas business based in Houston. This was also considered to be an
indicator of impairment and impairment tests have been performed on the goodwill and intangible
assets allocated to the Americas CGU.
The recoverable amount of the Americas CGU has been based on value-in-use calculations which
use cash flow projections approved by management for 2016, 2017 and 2018.  For the purposes of
the calculation of the recoverable amount, the cash flow projections beyond the forecast period
include 5% growth in 2019 and 10% growth in 2020, following this a terminal growth rate of 3% has
been applied. This long-term growth rate is in line with long-term average growth rates for the regions
in which the CGU operates.  These impairment reviews identified an impairment in the carrying value
of the customer relationship intangible asset acquired with Foster Wheeler which has been fully
written off.  But, as the downturn in oil & gas has been offset by strong performance in the other
markets, no impairment is required, nor has been charged, in respect of the goodwill allocated to the
Americas CGU.
Other CGUs
There were no indicators of impairment in either the Northern Europe and CIS or the Asia, Middle
East, Africa and Southern Europe CGU's and so no impairment tests have been performed as at 30
June 2016.
11.    PROVISIONS

Cash, trade receivables and trade payables are excluded from this table because carrying value is a
reasonable approximation to fair value for all these assets and liabilities.
Fair values are determined using observable market prices (level 2 as defined by IFRS 13 'Fair Value
Measurement') as follows:
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)
12.    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)
Financial derivatives
Financial Derivatives are valued as follows:
·        The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the difference
between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the
contract using a risk-free interest rate; and
·        The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps is estimated by
discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using
market rates.
The Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by
reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. During the six months ended 30 June
2016, the six months ended 30 June 2015, and the year ended 31 December 2015 there were no
transfers into or out of level 2 fair value measurements.
All derivative fair values are verified by comparison to valuations provided by the derivative
counterparty banks. There are no material credit valuation adjustments (CVA) or debit valuation
adjustments (DVA) required on the derivatives outstanding at 30 June 2016, 30 June 2015 and 31
December 2015.
Borrowings
Bank loans are held at amortised cost.  Finance leases are valued at the net present value of the
future cash-flows using credit spreads and yield curves derived from market data.
On 1 March 2016, the Group entered into a new syndicated facility comprising of three tranches; a
three-year £650m term loan, a five-year £650m term loan and a five-year £400m revolving credit
facility. This new facility replaced the company's existing £377m revolving credit facility and the Foster
Wheeler acquisition facility of $2.26bn.
13.    CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Legal claims and actions
From time to time, the group is party to litigation involving clients and sub-contractors arising out of
project contracts. Such litigation includes claims or actions by and against the group for cancelled
contracts, for additional costs incurred in excess of contract provisions, as well as for back charges for
alleged breaches of warranty and other contract commitments. We have recognised provisions for
certain known or reasonably likely legal claims or actions against the group. We do not expect known
and reasonably likely legal claims or actions for which a provision has not been established to have a
material impact on the group's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Indemnities and retained obligations
We have agreed to indemnify certain third parties relating to businesses and/or assets that were
previously owned by the group and were sold to them. Such indemnifications relate primarily to
breach of covenants, breach of representations and warranties, as well as potential exposure for
retained liabilities, environmental matters and third party claims for activities conducted by the group
prior to the sale of such businesses and/or asset. We have established provisions for those
indemnities in respect of which we consider it probable that there will be a successful claim. We do
not expect indemnities or retained obligations for which a provision has not been established to have
a material impact on the group's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Guarantees
The group has guaranteed certain performance obligations in a refinery / electric power generation
plant located in Chile in which we hold a non-controlling interest.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS (continued)
13.    CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued)
Mount Polley
The Mount Polley mine is owned and operated by Mount Polley Mining Corporation, a subsidiary of
Imperial Metals Corporation, and is located near the town of Likely, British Columbia, Canada. On 4
August 2014, a tailings pond facility at the mine failed releasing large quantities of water and mine
tailings into the local environment. The dam was in the process of being raised (as part of its annual
raise) at the time of the failure. One of our subsidiaries, along with other parties, had various design
and quality assurance responsibilities associated with the development of this facility. Our subsidiary
was providing engineering services at the time of the breach, but did not perform the original design.
An Independent Review Panel, appointed by the government of British Columbia, issued a report on
30 January 2015 concluding that the cause of failure was shearing along a zone of weak soil along
with other contributory factors. On 17 December 2015, the Chief Inspector of Mines for B.C. issued a
report that for the most part agreed with the conclusions of the Independent Review Panel.  On 4 July
2016, Mount Polley Mining Corporation and Imperial Metals Corporation filed suit against our
subsidiary and others. It is management's opinion that its employees performed in a professional
manner consistent with the standard of care for a competent engineer on a project of this nature in BC.
In addition, the contract between our subsidiary and Mount Polley Mining Corporation contains
limitations of liability provisions that exclude claims for consequential damages and limit the
subsidiary's liability to the amount of professional fees charged, which were less than CDN$1m.
Amec Foster Wheeler has retained outside counsel to prepare and file a Response to Civil Claim in
the proceeding. Given the early stage of this matter, it is difficult to predict the likely outcome of this
proceeding. Mindful of the foregoing caveat, it is determined that it is possible but not probable that
there will be an outflow in respect of this issue, and it appears probable that if there is an outflow, it will
be limited to the CDN$1m prescribed in the contractual limitation of liability.
Tax planning
The Group undertakes tax planning which is compliant with current legislation and accepted practice.
Recent changes to the tax environment, including the OECD's project around Base Erosion and Profit
Shifting have brought into question the legitimacy of tax planning previously undertaken by
multinational entities. There have been several recent high profile tax cases against tax authorities
and large groups. The European Commission has opened formal investigations to examine whether
decisions by the tax authorities in certain European countries comply with European Union rules. We
are monitoring the outcome of these cases in order to understand whether there is any risk to the
Group. Based on the Group's current assessment of such issues, it is too early to speculate on any
areas of challenge and potential liabilities, and as a result, it is not currently considered probable that
these will be an outflow in respect of these issues.
14.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
During the six months ended 30 June 2016 there were a number of transactions with joint venture
entities.

15.    POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
As disclosed in the 2015 financial statements a provision has been established against potential
damages and costs relating to an engineering, procurement and construction project in the US.  On 2
August 2016, the client served a notice of default under the contract and initiated mediation in
accordance with a previously agreed protocol. We strongly disagree with the client's contentions in
the notice and will respond accordingly. Given the early stage of this matter it is difficult to predict the
outcome of any subsequent proceedings.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT OF THE DIRECTORS IN RESPECT OF THE HALF-YEARLY
FINANCIAL REPORT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2016
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
·        The condensed set of accounts has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial
Reporting' as adopted by the EU.
·        The interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by:
§  DTR 4.2.7R of the 'Disclosures and Transparency Rules', being an indication of important events
that have occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact on the condensed
set of accounts; and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months
of the year; and
§  DTR 4.2.8R of the 'Disclosure and Transparency Rules', being related party transactions that have
taken place in the first six months of the current financial year and that have materially affected the
financial position or performance of the entity during that period; and any changes in the related party
transactions described in the last annual report that could do so.

INDEPENDENT REVIEW REPORT BY ERNST & YOUNG LLP TO Amec Foster Wheeler plc
Introduction
We have been engaged by the company to review the condensed set of accounts in the half-yearly
financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2016 which comprises the condensed consolidated
Income Statement, condensed consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, condensed
consolidated Balance Sheet, condensed consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, condensed
consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related explanatory notes 1 to 15 that have been
reviewed.  We have read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report and
considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
information in the condensed set of accounts.
This report is made solely to the company in accordance with guidance contained in International
Standard on Review Engagements 2410 (United Kingdom and Ireland) 'Review of Interim Financial
Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity' issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the company, for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.
Directors' responsibilities
The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors.  The
directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the
Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.
As disclosed in note 2, the annual accounts of the group are prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union. The condensed set of accounts included in this half-yearly financial
report has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 'Interim Financial
Reporting', as adopted by the European Union.
Our responsibility
Our responsibility is to express to the company a conclusion on the condensed set of accounts in the
half-yearly financial report based on our review.
Scope of review
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (United
Kingdom and Ireland) 2410 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent
Auditor of the Entity' issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom.  A review
of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for
financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.  A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (United Kingdom and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that
we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.  Accordingly, we
do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed
set of accounts in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 30 June 2016 is not
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 as
adopted by the European Union and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's
Financial Conduct Authority.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This announcement contains a number of 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the US
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the group's financial condition, results
of operations and certain of the group's plans and objectives.
In particular, such forward-looking statements include statements with respect to:
·        our expectations regarding the group's financial and operating performance, including
statements contained within the business review and the outlook statements in this document, and the
performance of joint ventures, associates, other investments and newly acquired businesses;
·        intentions and expectations regarding the contracts entered into by the group or by third parties,
including new services, such as the supply of consultancy, engineering and project management
services;
·        expectations regarding the global economy and the group's operating environment, including
future market conditions and trends;
·        revenue and growth expected from Amec Foster Wheeler's business and its expectations with
respect to long term shareholder value growth;
·        our ability to acquire new contracts, expected growth prospects in and growth in its customers 
generally;
·        expected benefits associated with the acquisition of Foster Wheeler;
Forward-looking statements are sometimes, but not always, identified by their use of a date in the
future or such words as "will", "anticipates", "aims", "could", "may", "should", "expects", "believes",
"intends", "plans" or "targets". By their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently predictive,
speculative and involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on
circumstances that will occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual
results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
·        global economic conditions or other macroeconomic developments in the geographic regions
and markets in which the group operates, including fluctuations in exchange rates;
·        changes in commodity prices which may impact demand for the group's services;
·        the group's exposure to the risks associated with operating in emerging markets;
·        the failure to meet customer expectations on project delivery, which could result in damage to
reputation and/or loss of repeat business and potentially lead to litigation;
·        long term contracts which may be subject to early termination, variation or non-renewal
provisions;
·        projects included in the group's order book which may be delayed or cancelled;
·        lump sum contracts, which are subject to the risks associated with unanticipated modifications,
technical problems and delays;
·        the loss of senior management or difficulty in attracting and retaining appropriately skilled
personnel;
·        the failure to comply with health, safety and environmental laws;
·        the possibility of major safety incidents that can lead to reputational damage and increase
potential liabilities;
·        obligations and liabilities relating to the group's divested and non-core businesses;
·        the failure or security breaches of its information technology systems and/or data security; and
·        the failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations, economic sanction programmes
or other laws and regulations, which may result in the group becoming subject to fines or penalties
and the disruption of its business activities.
A review of the reasons why actual results and developments may differ materially from the
expectations disclosed or implied within forward-looking statements can be found under the heading
'principal business and strategic risks'. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements
attributable to the company or any persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety
by the factors referred to above. No assurances can be given that the forward-looking statements in
this document will be realised. Subject to compliance with applicable law and regulations, the
company does not intend to update these forward-looking statements and does not undertake any
obligation to do so.
