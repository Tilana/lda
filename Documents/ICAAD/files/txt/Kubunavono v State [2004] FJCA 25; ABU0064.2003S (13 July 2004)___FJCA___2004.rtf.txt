TRANSCRIPT OF ORAL JUDGMENT OF THE COURT

The Court per Eichelbaum JA:

The respondents have conceded that the appeal must succeed, although for a reason not advanced by the appellants. It is that owing to the absence of a delegation from the Disciplined Services Commission, the Commissioner of Prisons had no legal authority to remove any persons from the Prisons Service. We will make a declaration as sought but do not see any necessity for an order for reinstatement. By consent:

1.      
Appeal allowed;

2.      
Orders of Singh J made on 18 September 2003 be set aside;

3.      
In lieu thereof, make declaration that the decision of the Commissioner of Prisons of 3 March 2003 discharging the Applicants namely Viliame Kubunavono of Sulua Place Lot 168 Cunningham Stage 4, Pio Rikomai of Sele Road Caubati Housing, Ropate Baleiwaiyevo of Korovau Prison Compound Suva, Meli Tamani of Baulevu Nausori, Emosi Raika of Naboro Prison Compound and Kolinio Musuka of Nakasi, from the Prison Service is unlawful, void and of no effect;

4. Costs of proceedings before Singh J fixed at $ 500 plus reasonable disbursements as approved by the Registrar to be paid by the respondents;

5. No order as to costs of appeal.
