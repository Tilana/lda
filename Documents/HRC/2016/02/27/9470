<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report summarizes the human rights standards referenced or invoked in the policies 
of three types of business organization:  a cross-section of more than 300 companies from all 
regions of the world; 8 collective initiatives; and 5 socially responsible investment (SRI) indices.  
For each of the three types, we looked for indicators expressing or referencing rights included in 
the International Bill of Human Rights.  Also examined was the issue of whether the prescribed 
policies and practices include accountability mechanisms for companies, such as reporting 
requirements; whether they hold the companies&#8217; suppliers to any human rights standards; the 
extent to which they stipulate corporate engagement with external stakeholders; and the human 
rights instruments to which companies, collective initiatives, and SRI indices refer (see text of 
the report for instruments/sources referred to).  Finally, policies concerning bribery and 
corruption were examined, because they can and do impede the realization of human rights.  
The research led to the following overall findings. 
</p>
<p><b>Recognition of labour rights 
</b></p>
<p> Labour rights enjoy greater business recognition than any other human rights.  The most 
widely-recognized labour right is non-discrimination - recognized by 87 per cent of the 
companies included in the study.  It is followed by the right to a safe and healthy work 
environment; freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining; the prohibition on 
forced labour; and the prohibition on child labour. 
</p>
<p> European and North American businesses lead in their recognition of labour rights.  
Companies in the Asia and Pacific region follow closely behind the average, while 
Latin American firms trail in their recognition of almost all labour rights - the most significant 
lags being in the areas of non-discrimination, the abolition of forced and child labour, and the 
right to family life. 
</p>
<p> At a rate of 56 per cent, retail and consumer products firms lead in their recognition 
of the right to a minimum wage, exceeding the overall sample average by 20 per cent.  At 
37 per cent, financial service firms lead in recognizing the right to a family life - a rate almost 
double that of many sectors.  Infrastructure and utility companies lag in their recognition of 
numerous rights:  the prohibitions against forced and child labour; the right to a minimum wage; 
the right to rest and leisure; and the right to family life, with recognition reaching as low as 
11 per cent for some rights.  Financial services significantly trail in their recognition of the 
prohibitions against forced and child labour, at 20 per cent less than the average of other sectors. 
</p>
<p> Collective initiatives and SRI indices mirror the overall pattern of labour rights 
recognition. 
</p>
<p><b>Recognition of non-labour rights 
</b></p>
<p> Recognition of non-labour rights is less prevalent across the board.  At just under 
20 per cent, the right to privacy receives the widest support by companies, followed by security 
of the person, including freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p> North American and European firms lead in their recognition of the right to privacy 
and security of the person.  Extractive industries and retail and consumer products firms 
recognize security-related rights at slightly higher rates than other sectors, while information 
technology (IT) and retail companies recognize the right to privacy more than other sectors.  
Extractive industries, financial services, and pharmaceutical and chemical companies stand out 
for their recognition of the right to development. 
</p>
<p> There is a substantial difference in the recognition rates for non-labour rights between 
companies, collective initiatives, and SRI indices.  Company policies exhibit greater concern for 
the right to privacy than do the collective initiatives and SRI indices.  In part because of the 
sectors they represent, the collective initiatives we examined place a greater emphasis on 
freedom of movement and minority rights to culture, religious practice and language.  The 
manufacturing industry initiatives focus more on traditional labour rights, whereas the extractive 
sector places greater stress on indigenous rights and community relations.  The SRI indices 
exhibit a particular concern for indigenous rights, including the right to cultural life, the benefits 
of scientific progress, and protection of authorial interests.  Some SRI indices also show strong 
support for the right to development. 
</p>
<p> Some rights, such as the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and the 
right to seek asylum, receive little or no recognition from company policies, collective 
initiatives, or SRI indices. 
</p>
<p> The companies strongly emphasize their philanthropic contributions in areas covered by 
economic, social and cultural rights.  Many SRI indices use company philanthropic activities as 
an investment screen.  In contrast, the collective initiatives that were examined have no 
requirements that companies conduct philanthropic activities.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Accountability and external engagement 
</b></p>
<p> Company policies and practices, collective initiatives, and SRI indices all address human 
rights in reporting.  However, the manner in which individual companies report varies widely.  
In some cases the information is buried in complex websites, thereby limiting the effectiveness 
of reporting for internal as well as external purposes.  Furthermore, the use of external auditors 
or assurance processes to verify reported information is strikingly low.  Of the companies 
employing external verification methods, most are European. 
</p>
<p> The inclusion of some human rights standards in supply chain management is a common 
feature of company policies, collective initiatives, and SRI indices.  Policies vary widely, 
however.  Some require the entire supply chain to comply with the same broad range of human 
rights as the company itself.  Others only hold first-tier suppliers to such standards.  Some only 
require suppliers to adopt a limited number of rights, most often the prohibitions on child and 
forced labour. 
</p>
<p> North American and European companies lead in their inclusion of human rights 
standards in supply chain management - two thirds of the United States firms in the sample, and 
roughly 60 per cent of the Europeans include them.  Asia and Pacific and Latin American 
companies trail by more than 20 per cent.  Retail and consumer products firms lead in this regard 
by as much as 35 per cent over other sectors. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p> The SRI indices all use community consultation and engagement as a screening criterion, 
in contrast to fewer references to this process amongst companies and collective initiatives.  
Human rights impact assessments also receive the greatest support from the SRI indices. 
</p>
<p> A large number of companies reference anti-corruption, with the exception of 
Latin America, where only 21 per cent of companies report having anti-corruption policies.  
Several of the SRI indices also consider bribery and corruption issues.  In contrast, 
anti-corruption is not a major emphasis of the collective initiatives. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The resolution establishing the SRSG&#8217;s mandate asks him to identify and clarify 
standards of corporate responsibility and accountability with respect to human rights.  This 
request was not confined to legal standards that may impose direct or indirect obligations on 
companies, but was also meant to include the realms of social expectations and moral 
obligations.  A key indicator of the latter consists of the human rights standards that business 
itself adopts, triggered by its assessment of human rights-related risks and opportunities in the 
social and political environments in which it operates.  This report summarizes the human rights 
standards referenced or invoked by a cross-section of companies, collective initiatives, and 
socially responsible investment funds. 
</p>
<p>2. The present study complements the SRSG&#8217;s survey of the human rights policies and 
management practices of the Global Fortune 500 (FG500) companies.<b>1</b>  But it differs from that 
survey in three important respects.  First, it is based on actual documentation of such policies and 
practices rather than on questionnaire responses.  Second, it includes a broader cross-section of 
companies, including transnational and national companies domiciled in emerging markets and 
developing countries.  Third, it provides information about the human rights standards of 
business entities other than firms.  The two studies together comprise the most comprehensive 
analysis yet conducted on the subject of business and human rights. 
3. Part I of this report summarizes the publicly available information of more 
than 300 companies that have human rights policies and management practices in place - setting 
out how they address the broad spectrum of rights as evidenced in company reports, websites, 
codes of conduct, and general policies.  Part II identifies the human rights standards included in 
selected collective initiatives, both industry-based and multi-stakeholder.  And Part III examines 
the human rights criteria employed by SRI indices when selecting companies for investment. 
</p>
<p>4. For each of our three units of analysis - individual companies, collective initiatives, and 
SRI indices - we looked for indicators expressing or referencing rights included in the 
International Bill of Human Rights.<b>2</b>  We also examined whether the prescribed policies and 
practices include accountability mechanisms for companies, such as reporting requirements; 
whether they hold the companies&#8217; suppliers to any human rights standards; the extent to which 
they stipulate corporate engagement with external stakeholders; and the human rights

on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols.&#8221; </p>

</p>
<p>instruments to which companies, collective initiatives, and indices refer.  Finally, we examined 
policies concerning bribery and corruption because they can and do impede the realization of 
rights. 
</p>
<p>5. Two caveats should be noted.  First, it is possible that some companies do not make 
public all of their human rights-related policies and management practices, in which case they 
would have escaped our attention and the companies would not receive their due credit.  This is 
unlikely to affect collective initiatives or the SRI indices, which tend to display their policies 
prominently in the public domain.  Second, it is well beyond the scope of the present report to 
assess how effectively the stated policies and practices are actually implemented.  Thus, by 
&#8220;business recognition&#8221; of human rights we mean the policies and management practices 
described in publicly available sources. 
</p>
<p>6. Finally, some of the findings in this study differ from those in the SRSG&#8217;s FG500 
survey - the reported uptake of non-labor rights and accountability mechanisms by companies 
was higher in the survey than we found in the present research.  Two factors may explain the 
difference.  First, respondents to the FG500 survey tended to be &#8220;best in class,&#8221; leaders in 
corporate social responsibility including human rights, whereas the current study deliberately 
looked at a broader cross-section of firms - although still limited to those known to have human 
rights policies.  We cannot say with any degree of certainty whether these differences represent 
anything more than a time lag between OECD country-based firms and others.  Second, the 
FG500 survey was based on a questionnaire whereas the current research examined actual 
company policies.  Questionnaire responses may have been exaggerated or the actual policies 
may be poorly described or inaccessible in companies&#8217; publicly available sources of information, 
making it impossible for us to code them.  Nevertheless, the overall patterns reported in the two 
studies are consistent with one another: the discourse of human rights is making inroads into the 
corporate sphere. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  COMPANY POLICIES AND PRACTICES 
</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>7. Beyond the realm of legal compliance, the human rights policies and management 
practices that business adopts signal its understanding of what society expects of responsible 
corporate citizens.  This report summarizes the human rights standards for corporate 
responsibility and accountability that are referenced or invoked by a cross-section of companies, 
collective initiatives, and socially responsible investment funds.  Part I focuses on companies. 
</p>
<p>8. The report presents the results of a snapshot taken at one moment in time 
(June-July 2006); subsequent studies may well discover somewhat different patterns because 
this is a rapidly evolving field. 
</p>
<p><b>Our Sample 
</b></p>
<p>9. The sample of companies for this report was drawn from an original list of 
almost 500 firms that included: (i) the 103 Global Fortune 500 that responded to the SRSG&#8217;s 
questionnaire; (ii) the nearly 100 companies listed on the Business and Human Rights Resource </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p>Centre&#8217;s website as having human rights policies; and (iii) the 512 Global Compact (GC) 
companies that had submitted a Communication on Progress (CoP) for 2005 or later.  We chose 
these sources because there was every reason to expect that these companies would have 
publicly accessible human rights policies enabling us to document the standards they embodied.  
Once we eliminated multiple listings, we were left with nearly 500 companies. 
</p>
<p>10. The list became shorter for several reasons.  Language resource constraints meant that we 
were unable to include companies with information solely in Japanese, Russian, and Chinese - 
although companies from those countries that had English sources were included.  For the rest, 
we excluded companies for which we were unable to find information about their human rights 
commitments in any publicly accessible source.  Also, we generally included parent companies 
and excluded subsidiaries and holding companies to avoid duplicate recognition. 
</p>
<p>11. Our final sample consists of 314 companies from 5 regions: Africa, Asia and the Pacific, 
Europe, Latin America and North America.  It includes companies from some of the major 
emerging economies like the People&#8217;s Republic of China, India and Brazil.  We sorted the 
companies into 9 industry sectors: Extractive; Financial Services; Food and Beverage; Heavy 
Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Utilities; Information Technology, Electronics, and 
Telecommunications; Pharmaceutical and Chemical; Retail and Consumer Products; and a 
residual category (Other).  The following figures illustrate the composition of our sample by 
region and by sector.<b>3

</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  The percentage of companies from Latin America and Africa participating in the Global 
</p>
<p>Compact is slightly higher than in our sample.  Many of those companies have only recently 
joined the GC and have not yet submitted a CoP or devised their own means of reporting, and 
thus, they were excluded on the basis that they had little or no publicly available information. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Our Coding Method 
</b></p>
<p>12. We drew information about individual companies from the companies&#8217; websites; their 
Annual or Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report (if published separately); and 
their 2005 (or later) GC CoP where applicable.  As stated above, we looked only at publicly 
available information (with the exception of the responses to the SRSG&#8217;s questionnaire, which 
have been separately reported on by the SRSG).  Therefore, we were unable to include 
recognition of rights by companies that exists only as internal company policies or unpublished 
practices.  And as already noted, the scope of this study did not include the extent to which 
policies and practices are actually implemented. 
</p>
<p>13. We considered both formal policies as well as references to company &#8220;practice&#8221; in our 
searches.  We searched first for a specific human rights policy before considering other sources, 
such as corporate codes of conduct, human resources policies, and sustainable development 
commitments.  Many of the companies were members of CSR initiatives, ranging from the 
broadly applicable principles of the UNGC to the industry specific Voluntary Principles on 
Security and Human Rights.  We recorded membership but did not assume that membership 
entailed automatic recognition of the rights promoted by the initiative.  We also sought to reflect 
companies&#8217; level of support for particular rights by recording wherever possible the exact 
language used. 
</p>
<p>14. We codified support for a range of rights included in the UDHR, the ILO Core 
Conventions, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the Declaration on the Right 
to Development.  We also recorded company reporting practices and supply chain human rights 
requirements, as well as community consultation and impact assessment policies in relation to 
the companies&#8217; human rights commitments. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p>15. Because corporate philanthropy is not an explicit focus of this project (or the SRSG&#8217;s 
mandate), we only considered philanthropic programs when they were clearly linked to a human 
rights purpose (typically health, education or development).  We also included anticorruption 
policies and practices because of the potential for corruption to impede the realization of many if 
not all rights. 
</p>
<p>16. This section of the report first presents the human rights companies themselves 
recognize, including labor and non-labor human rights.  Next, we show how companies hold 
themselves, and their suppliers, accountable to their human rights standards by looking at 
reporting practices as well as supply chain management policies.  Third, external engagement by 
companies is measured through examination of community consultation practices, human rights 
impact assessments and philanthropic activity.  Anticorruption policies are considered next.  
Finally, we set out the sources that companies look to for guidance regarding human rights.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Labour Rights 
</b></p>
<p>17. Companies recognize labor rights with greater frequency than any other human rights.  
The highest rate of recognition is for non-discrimination, at almost 90 percent of all companies 
in our sample, and the lowest, for the right to family life, at just below 25 percent.  As shown in 
Figure 3, there is also strong recognition of the right to a safe work environment, followed by 
freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of forced or 
compulsory labor, and the abolition of child labor. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>A more detailed discussion follows. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p><b>Nondiscrimination 
</b></p>
<p>18. Almost 90 percent of the companies in our sample have a <i>nondiscrimination</i> policy.  
Over 90 percent of North American and European and over 80 percent of Asia &amp; Pacific 
companies have such a policy.  In contrast, Latin America lags with only 61 percent.  Four of the 
five African companies also have a nondiscrimination policy.  No significant sectoral variations 
were found. 
</p>
<p>19. Most companies make firm commitments to nondiscrimination in the workplace.  
Statements are made in absolute terms, using language like, &#8220;does not discriminate,&#8221; &#8220;employees 
are not subjected to discrimination&#8221;, and &#8220;will not [permit] or [tolerate].&#8221;  A small number of 
companies make less firm commitments, using the language &#8220;respects diversity&#8221; or &#8220;promotes 
nondiscrimination.&#8221; </p>
<p> Policies include commitments not to discriminate on the basis of: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Gender; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Disability; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ethnic or racial status; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Age; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Religion; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Caste; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Sexual orientation; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Union membership; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Political affiliation; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; HIV/AIDS status; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Parental status. 
</p>
<p>Notably, no company policy includes all dimensions; however, some companies do make a 
general commitment to nondiscrimination on all grounds. 
</p>
<p>20. Several companies have affirmative action policies related to people with disabilities, 
Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender individuals, ethnic minorities, the long-term 
unemployed, and women.  Some companies also use affirmative action to achieve supplier </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 15 
 
</p>
<p>diversity.  To support a diverse supplier base, one North American retailer has a &#8220;Minority and 
Women Business Development Program&#8221; to provide mentoring for minority general contractors. 
</p>
<p>21. Commitments to the <i>right to equality at work</i> (roughly 39 percent of the total sample) and 
the <i>right to equal pay for equal work </i>(roughly 23 percent) are frequently integrated into 
nondiscrimination policies or occur as separate statements alongside the policy.  Equal pay for 
equal work is often articulated as an &#8220;achievement based&#8221; or &#8220;merit based&#8221; pay scale - looking 
narrowly at performance to determine compensation. 
</p>
<p>22. One Swiss infrastructure and utility company makes a commitment to nondiscrimination 
that includes recognition of the right to equality at work and the right to equal pay for equal 
work: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;To offer equality of opportunity to all employees and not to engage in or support 
discrimination in hiring, compensation, access to training, promotion, termination or 
retirement based on ethnic and national origin, caste, religion, disability, sex, age, sexual 
orientation, union membership, or political affiliation.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Right to a Safe Work Environment 
</b></p>
<p>23. Around 75 percent of companies commit to the <i>right to a safe work environment</i>.  
At 86 percent, North American companies report safe work environment policies more 
frequently than any other region.  European companies are a close second at 79 percent, with 
Asia &amp; the Pacific at 67 percent, and Latin America at 46 percent.  No significant sectoral 
variations were found. 
</p>
<p>24. To address this right, companies use language like, &#8220;strives to provide&#8221; and &#8220;dedicated 
to&#8221; - possibly to avoid liability issues related to accident occurrences.  The following is a 
common example of what is found: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;it is our responsibility to provide safe and healthy working conditions.  [The Company] 
strives to prevent any injuries at work, both for our own employees and contractors.&#8221; 
Quote from a Dutch Chemical Company. 
</p>
<p>25. One Spanish Telecommunications Company stands out because of its use of health and 
safety committees, comprised of an equal number of workers and company representatives.  The 
committees monitor workplace conditions and routinely receive itemized reports on risks, 
including psychological and social risks. 
</p>
<p><b>Freedom of Association, Right to Collective Bargaining 
</b></p>
<p>26. Some 66 percent of the companies recognize both <i>freedom of association</i> and the <i>right to 
collective bargaining</i>.  Nearly 75 percent of European companies recognize both rights.  In 
contrast, 63 percent of North American companies and around 50 percent of companies from 
each of the remaining regions recognize these rights.  No significant sectoral variations were 
found. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>27. Companies almost always recognize the freedom of association and the right to collective 
bargaining in tandem.  Commitments are made using language like, &#8220;respects,&#8221; &#8220;allows,&#8221; 
&#8220;recognizes,&#8221; or &#8220;does not impede&#8221; with regard to these rights.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>28. In addition, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining are frequently 
recognized in broad terms, with no limitations.  Several companies even commit to the freedom 
to organize and bargain in the presence of local laws restricting the rights: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;In situations or countries in which the rights regarding freedom of association and 
collective bargaining are restricted by law, parallel means of independent and free 
organization and bargaining shall be facilitated.&#8221; (Quote from a German Retail 
Company.) 
</p>
<p>29. However, some companies narrow the rights.  For example, some limit recognition to the 
scope of national law or only recognize unions that represent a certain percentage of employees. 
</p>
<p><b>Abolition of Forced and Child Labour 
</b></p>
<p>30. Around 60 percent of the companies recognize the <i>prohibitions against orced and child 
labor</i>.  European and North American firms average around 65 percent recognition for both 
prohibitions, Asia &amp; Pacific companies around 50 percent, while 3 of the 5 African companies 
address the prohibitions.  In contrast, only 29 percent of Latin American companies mention the 
prohibitions against slavery and forced labor, and a mere 25 percent mention the abolition of 
child labor.  For all companies, the prohibitions are often recognized in concert.  Several also 
hold their supply chain to these prohibitions specifically. 
</p>
<p>31. Most sectors recognize the prohibitions between roughly 60-70 percent of the time; 
however, two sectors fall short: the Financial Services sector at around 40 percent, and 
Infrastructure &amp; Utility at around 45 percent.  In addition, even though the majority of retail 
sector companies recognize the prohibitions against forced and child labor, less than a quarter of 
Asia &amp; Pacific companies in this sector recognize the prohibition against child labor and only 
around 30 percent recognize the prohibition against forced labor. 
</p>
<p><i>Minimum age policies that support the prohibition against child labour 
</i></p>
<p>32. Almost 30 percent of companies also state a <i>minimum age policy</i> that further supports the 
prohibition against child labor.  By region, North American and European companies state the 
minimum age of employment around 30 percent of the time, with Asia &amp; Pacific companies 
following at 25 percent.  In contrast, Latin American companies only mention the minimum age 
of employment around 14 percent of the time.  Two of the five African companies also have 
such statements. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  To recognize Freedom of Association and the Right to Organize, companies merely are 
</p>
<p>required to not impede or frustrate the individual/collective exercise of these rights, versus 
actually providing the right as in the case of rights like the minimum wage. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>33. By sector, the Retail &amp; Consumer Products and Food &amp; Beverage sectors state 
the minimum age of employment most frequently, both with 42 percent of their companies 
having minimum age policies.  At the low end, only 14 percent of Pharmaceutical and Chemical 
companies and 11 percent of Infrastructure &amp; Utility companies have such policies. 
</p>
<p>34. Of those companies with a minimum age policy, many follow the standards of the ILO 
Minimum Age Convention.<b>5</b>  These companies often set the minimum age of employment at 15 
or 18 years of age or the &#8220;age of &#8230;the end of compulsory schooling.&#8221;  Other companies commit 
to the national law standard, which also frequently reflects the ILO standard.  A few companies 
specify the ILO Convention as their official policy. 
</p>
<p><b>Right to Minimum Wage, Including Decent Living 
</b></p>
<p>35. The <i>right to a minimum wage</i> is recognized by just 36 percent of the sample.  
At 46 percent and 40 percent respectively, North American and European companies address the 
right to a minimum wage more often than companies in other regions.  Asia &amp; Pacific companies 
address the right to a minimum wage at a rate of 29 percent, while Latin American companies 
follow closely behind at 25 percent recognition.  Two of the five African companies address the 
right.  By sector, Retail &amp; Consumer Products firms lead with 56 percent having policies 
addressing minimum wages.  The Extractive and Infrastructure &amp; Utility sectors trail 
at 27 percent and 20 percent respectively. 
</p>
<p>36. Companies vary greatly in their approach to a minimum wage.  While some make 
commitments to the national minimum wage, others commit to &#8220;fair compensation&#8221; or &#8220;adequate 
compensation&#8221; - almost always requiring a second inquiry into what &#8220;fair&#8221; or &#8220;adequate&#8221; would 
be.  In addition, some companies claim to follow the &#8220;industry standard,&#8221; which is also largely 
unidentifiable without further inquiry.  A few companies commit to exceed the local minimum 
wage.  At least two companies also expressly prohibit &#8220;illegal or unauthorized&#8221; deductions. 
</p>
<p>37. Very few companies express their commitment to a minimum wage in relation to the 
needs of employees.  The following policy is an atypical commitment that connects the two: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;To ensure that wages paid meet or exceed the legal or industry minimum standards and 
are always sufficient to meet basic needs of personnel and to provide some discretionary 
income.&#8221;  (Quote from a Swiss Engineering Company.) 
</p>
<p><b>Work/Life Balance 
</b></p>
<p><i>Right to Rest and Leisure, Including Holidays with Pay 
</i></p>
<p>38. The <i>right to rest and leisure</i> is recognized by approximately 30 percent of the companies.  
Recognition ranges from a high in North America of 38 percent to a low in Latin America 
of 21 percent.  While most sectors recognize the right to rest and leisure at rates in the 30 percent 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>range, the Infrastructure &amp; Utility Sector and Pharmaceutical &amp; Chemical sector are exceptions, 
at 14 percent and 23 percent respectively.  Companies frequently address the right in terms of 
maximum work hours and limitations on overtime.  Few companies discuss policies for paid 
holidays and vacation. 
</p>
<p>39. Of those discussing maximum work hours and overtime limitations, a Swedish appliance 
manufacturer stands out in its attempt to balance the ILO standard with national requirements 
and business needs: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;[The Company] recognizes the need for a healthy balance between work and free time 
for all employees.  Unless national regulations require a lesser maximum hours of work, 
and except under extraordinary business circumstances, employees shall not, on a 
regularly scheduled basis, be required to work a standard work week of more than 
48 hours per week or a total work week of more than 60 hours (including overtime).  
Except in extraordinary business circumstances, all workers shall be entitled to at least 
one day off in every seven day period.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>40. Of the few companies discussing other benefits, such as paid leave, a footwear and 
apparel company commits to provide workers with paid leave and holidays, the &#8220;greater of what 
is required by law or industry.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><i>Right to Family Life, Including Maternity Leave 
</i>41. Slightly under a quarter of the companies address family life in their policies.  Both 
European and Asia &amp; Pacific region companies recognize the right around 25 percent of the 
time.  In contrast, North American and Latin American firms address family life at a rate 
of 14 percent; none of the African companies mention family life in their policies.  By sector, 
Financial Service firms lead, at 37 percent recognition of the right to family life.  While other 
sectors follow closely and fall between 20-30 percent recognition, there are significant 
differences.  The Food &amp; Beverage sector marks the start of the bottom tier at 16 percent, with 
Infrastructure &amp; Utility companies following at 14 percent and Heavy Manufacturing companies 
at 11 percent. 
</p>
<p>42. Admittedly, detailed policies that illustrate commitments to family life are hard to find in 
public searches.  Companies with policies primarily discuss work and family life balance.  Many 
state that they &#8220;ensure,&#8221; &#8220;support,&#8221; and &#8220;encourage&#8221; a family life.  Of the few companies with 
more specific policies, most provide for benefits such as: maternity leave, parental leave, flex 
time, and condensed workweeks.  One company goes beyond this by providing assistance in the 
event of a serious illness of a family member.  Several companies also offer child care facilities 
on site. 
</p>
<p><b>Right to Work 
</b></p>
<p>43. Codification of support for the right to work is particularly difficult.  Under the ICESCR, 
the steps that states must take in ensuring the progressive realization of the right include the </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>provision of vocational training.  While over 50 percent of companies have policies dealing with 
training, most concern necessary on-the-job training, or promotion within the company, and 
cannot reliably be characterized as support for the right to work.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>44. Despite the company focus on training, a handful of European companies make broader 
commitments, which could be seen as supporting the right to work.  For example, in the event of 
restructuring, a few European companies commit to the protection of employees through 
redeployment.  One European company also commits itself to target, train, and help reintegrate 
the long-term unemployed into the workforce. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Non-Labour Rights 
</b></p>
<p>45. Recognition of non-labor human rights is far less common in company policies (see 
Figure 4), with the highest rate of recognition in this grouping at roughly 19 percent for the right 
to privacy.  Although we considered all non-labor rights appearing in the UDHR, ICCPR, 
ICESCR, and Declaration on the Right to Development, here we note only those with greater 
than 4 percent recognition by companies.  Because of the already low levels of recognition, 
sectoral and regional variations became statistically less meaningful but are addressed where 
interesting differences occur. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  Training policies of this type are slightly more prevalent in Europe, with 62 percent of 
</p>
<p>companies having a policy.  North American and Latin American firms mention training policies 
around 50 percent of the time, Asia &amp; Pacific Companies report training policies at a rate 
of 38 percent, and 2 of the 5 African companies report such policies. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.4

</p>
<p><b>Security of the Person 
</b></p>
<p>46. Around 16 percent of companies recognize the right to life, liberty, and security of the 
person and 13 percent recognize the freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment<i>.</i>  The slightly higher recognition of the right to life, liberty, and security of the person 
is due to a few companies that explicitly link their guidelines governing the behavior of their 
security forces, or prohibitions on involvement in armed conflict, to the right to life.  Also, 
several companies make a general commitment to &#8220;protect&#8221; the right to life. 
</p>
<p>47. In addition, policies that prohibit physical and/or mental harassment in the workplace 
were coded as support for both the <i>right to life, liberty, and security of the person </i>as well as the<i> 
freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.  </i>Such harassment policies 
account for the bulk of corporate recognition of these security-related rights. 
</p>
<p>48. North American and European companies have a higher rate of harassment policies than 
companies in other regions.  Thus, when these companies&#8217; harassment policies are combined 
with their other policies recognizing security-related rights, they score roughly 30 percent and 
16 percent, respectively, on the right to life, liberty and security of the person; and 25 percent 
and 14 percent, respectively, on freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading 
treatment.  Companies in the remaining regions recognize these rights less than 7 percent of the 
time, with only 1 of the 5 African companies have a policy that addresses the right to life, liberty, 
and security of the person and none address the freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or 
degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>49. The Extractive and Retail &amp; Consumer Products sectors have slightly higher rates of 
recognition of these rights relative to other sectors.  Thirty-one percent of extractive companies 
recognize the right to life, liberty, and security of the person and 20 percent recognize freedom 
from torture.  The latter could be due to the inclusion of 15 of the 16 extractive companies that 
are members of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights,<b>7</b> which &#8220;require&#8221; 
contracted security forces to not violate human rights.  Retail &amp; Consumer Products companies 
recognize both the right to life, liberty, and security of person and the freedom from torture 
approximately 25 percent of the time. 
</p>
<p>50. In the following policy, a Dutch international supermarket operator defines a safe work 
environment as one free from violence, threats, or intimidation, thereby simultaneously 
recognizing the right to a safe work environment and the security of the person: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;All [  ] Group Companies are committed to providing you with a safe and secure work 
environment.  A safe and secure work environment also means a workplace free from 
violence.  Threats (whether implicit or explicit), intimidation and violence have no place 
at any [  ] company and will not be tolerated.&#8221; 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>Other Civil/Political and Economic/Social Rights 
</b></p>
<p><i>Right to Privacy 
</i></p>
<p>51. Around 19 percent of companies recognize the <i>right to privacy</i>.  Regionally, 
over 20 percent of European and North American companies recognize the right while less than 
10 percent of companies address it in the remaining regions.  By sector, the right is most often 
recognized in the IT, Electronics &amp; Telecommunications and the Retail &amp; Consumer Products 
sectors, with 30 percent recognition in each.  In addition, companies in the Infrastructure and 
Utility sector recognize the right to privacy, but do not recognize any other non-labor rights. 
</p>
<p>52. Commitments to the right to privacy are made primarily in relation to employees and 
consumers.  Several IT, Retail, and Financial Services companies have stand-alone consumer 
privacy policies, while others have one policy for both employees and consumers. 
</p>
<p><i>Right to Development 
</i></p>
<p>53. Eleven percent of the companies address development in their policies and programs.  
While no regional disparities are apparent, three sectors concentrate on development more often 
than others.  Extractive and Pharmaceutical and Chemical Companies address development at a 
rate of 27 percent, and Financial Services at a rate of 18 percent.  The remaining sectors mention 
development related policies and programs at rates below ten percent.  Companies primarily 
&#8220;strive&#8221; and &#8220;aim&#8221; to promote development in the communities or countries in which they 
operate.  Some companies have specific programs that use their business expertise to support 
development efforts.  For instance, several Financial Services firms have favorable policies 
ranging from promoting small business and housing loans to third world debt relief. 
</p>
<p>54. A French heavy manufacturing company illustrates the most common commitment to 
development: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;[The Company] seeks to make a contribution to the economic, social and educational 
well-being of the communities in which it operates through local and sustainable business 
development, and by providing opportunities for employment, improvement to 
Infrastructure &amp; Utility, technology acquisition and training.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>55. One British extractive company goes further and indicates the percentage of expenditures 
to be used locally: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Using local suppliers and contractors is the most sustainable ways for us to encourage 
development in areas where we operate&#8230; At least a third of our expenditure will 
continue to be spent directly on a local basis, benefiting indigenous businesses and 
supporting the regional economy.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>56. As an example of the financial services sector&#8217;s approach to development issues, one 
Canadian bank partners with aboriginal communities to develop &#8220;agency&#8221; branches thought to 
fuel economic development: </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The agency works with a host [ ] branch to provide basic banking services.  Agency 
management decides on its own hours, language of service and business objectives, and it 
can reinvest the revenue it earns in the community.  This means community members no 
longer need to travel long distances to do their banking and more money stays in the 
community for economic development.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><i>Right to Social Security 
</i></p>
<p>57. Companies often commit to follow the national requirements for pensions and retirement 
funds, with only one company in our sample expressly stating that it goes beyond the legal 
minimum.  Additionally, three companies specifically mention that they provide for short and 
long-term disability payments, while another company provides a lump sum payment to 
employees exiting the company. 
</p>
<p><i>Right to Hold Opinions, Freedom of Information and Expression 
</i>58. While few companies commit to the <i>right to hold opinions, freedom of information and 
expression</i>, of those that do, most commit to &#8220;ensure,&#8221; &#8220;guarantee,&#8221; and &#8220;protect.&#8221;  Two 
companies qualify their policy: one guarantees protection within the bounds of the law and the 
other provides an exception for hate speech. 
</p>
<p>59. One South African extractive company commits to &#8220;[r]espect local communities &#8230; 
freedom to articulate their thoughts, concerns and anxieties about [its] operations.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><i>Right to Self-Determination, Including Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Right to Informed Consent 
</i>60. Extractive companies make more extensive commitments to indigenous communities 
relative to other sectors.  Commitments range from statements of &#8220;respect&#8221; for local 
communities and cultures to obtaining their free and informed consent. 
</p>
<p>61. The following policy guides a Chilean mining company in its relationships with 
indigenous communities.  The Company &#8220;commit[s]&#8221; to: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Respect Indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, customs and beliefs in all aspects of operations 
under national and international law; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensur[e] prior knowledge and to keep them informed; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Contribute to economic development of Indigenous communities; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Cooperate in preserving and disseminating Indigenous knowledge and culture; to 
encourage Indigenous employees to join. 
</p>
<p><i>Right to Physical and Mental Health 
</i></p>
<p>62. Companies generally have policies of some sort regarding the health of employees; 
however, these policies were not counted as recognizing a broader <i>right</i> <i>to health</i> because they 
constitute more of an employee benefit. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 23 
 
</p>
<p>63. Some policies do move closer toward recognizing a broader right to health.  One 
South African extractive company provides medical care to employees, contractors &#8220;and, to 
some extent, [ ] the <i>communities</i> in the areas where the group operates.&#8221;  The company also 
coordinates outreach HIV/AIDS programs with NGOs, other companies, and various levels of 
government in South Africa.  One Filipino Food &amp; Beverage company operates a hospital, not 
only for staff and their dependents, but also for emergency cases from the surrounding 
community. 
</p>
<p>64. For several companies, HIV/AIDS is a specific concern.  A Brazilian pharmaceutical 
company addresses it through the mechanism of Social Service Health Areas, serving both 
employees and the community: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Social Service and Health areas [   ] are responsible for assessing the needs of 
HIV/AIDS patients and for offering the necessary support to the collaborator and his/her 
family in terms of treatment and access to medication, transport, legal assistance and 
psychological support.  The company continuously observes the health conditions of 
HIV positive collaborators or those suffering from AIDS so as to keep them integrated 
and engaged in a kind of work appropriate to their condition.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><i>Right to Education 
</i></p>
<p>65. Companies acknowledge the<i> right to education</i> almost exclusively through philanthropic 
programs.  Nevertheless, one company does provide scholarships and other educational support 
to employees, suppliers, and partners, and another states that it &#8220;takes care of the school 
education of employees&#8217; children&#8221;.  The Brazilian operation of a Spanish Telecommunications 
company states that it &#8220;assures [that] employees&#8217; children under 18 years of age are in school.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><i>Right to Participate in Cultural Life, the Benefits of Scientific Progress, and Protection of 
Authorial Interests 
</i></p>
<p>66. Article 15 of the ICESCR groups together the rights to <i>1)</i> <i>participate in cultural 
life, 2) the benefits of scientific progress, and 3) the protection of authorial interests</i>.  However, 
companies often only address one part of the article and, if more than one part is addressed, the 
parts are typically handled in separate policy statements.  To illustrate, one North American 
Extractive addresses only part 1 of article 15 in its CSR Policy: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;We will identify and assess our contributions to social and cultural changes in the areas 
where we operate and develop appropriate strategies to respect the rights and cultures of 
local communities.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>A European Pharmaceutical company addresses two parts, part 2 &amp; 3 of Article 15.  However, it 
does so in separate statements, one in its human rights policy and the other in its research and 
development policy: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that all humanity should share in the benefits of science and will work to 
make that possible.&#8221; [Human rights policy] </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>&#8220;In the event that we do develop a commercial product using traditional knowledge, we 
will ensure a clear benefit is returned to the country of origin, for example through 
royalties or a share of net profits.&#8221; [Research and Development Policy] 
</p>
<p><i>Right to Adequate Food, Clothing, and Housing 
</i></p>
<p>67. Although the <i>right to adequate food, clothing, and housing</i> receives little attention, one 
American science and technology firm aims to use its intellectual property to improve nutrition 
and alleviate hunger. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;[The Company] will endeavor to be socially and culturally responsible as it shares 
knowledge and appropriate technology in developing economies to help improve food, 
nutrition and the quality of life.  [The Company] will seek to utilize its intellectual 
property in ways that help alleviate hunger.&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>C.  Accountability and External Engagement 
</b></p>
<p>68. To better understand how companies account for the above mentioned human rights 
commitments, we looked at: 1) how they report on their human rights standards and performance 
and 2) the degree to which they hold supply chains accountable to human rights standards.  In 
addition, we examined how companies address the human rights of communities through a 
review of community consultation practices, impact assessments and philanthropic activities.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>69. The following graphic presents the percentage of companies that report on human rights, 
have supply chain management policies addressing human rights, and engage in community 
consultations to address the rights of affected communities.<b> 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Accountability 
</b></p>
<p><i>Reporting 
</i></p>
<p>70. Nearly all companies report on their human rights performance in some form.  However, 
the quality and format of reporting varies greatly. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 25 
 
</p>
<p>71. With Global Compact companies being one of our main sources of information, roughly 
two thirds of the companies in our sample report on human rights through the GC CoP.<b>8</b>  The 
CoP describes company progress toward meeting the GC&#8217;s ten principles, including the two 
human rights principles.  The CoP is not intended to be a complete report of all company human 
rights activity, and a great deal of discretion is afforded the company when deciding what to 
include.  As a result, the contents of CoPs vary greatly.  Many companies simply commit to the 
GC principles in their CoP, report on labor rights alone, or on their human rights related 
philanthropic activity.  Very few report on progress toward non-labor human rights as they 
appear in the ICCPR, ICESCR, and UDHR. 
</p>
<p>72. Although they are few in number, the most comprehensive reports include specific 
policies, their effectiveness in quantitative and qualitative terms, current and future human rights 
aims, and some measurement for progress toward those aims.  Even then, however, reporting is 
typically focused on labor rights. 
</p>
<p>73. We found that companies producing annual reports using the Global Reporting 
Initiative&#8217;s (GRI) guidelines had the most accessible and comprehensive reports, as the GRI 
covers many of the labor rights and a number of the human rights considered in this study.  The 
GRI is the second most used reporting scheme in our sample, with almost 150 companies in our 
sample applying it.<b>9</b>  Also, even when they do not follow the GRI&#8217;s precise requirements, some 
companies state that they are inspired by its framework.  A number of other companies follow 
the GRI guidelines on environmental reporting only. 
</p>
<p>74. In addition to annual reports, a number of companies produce separate annual corporate 
citizenship or sustainability reports that address their human rights related policies and efforts.  
Again, these reports tend to focus on labor rights, philanthropic activities, and, in the case of a 
sustainability report, the company&#8217;s environmental performance. 
</p>
<p>75. Companies rarely use external auditors or other assurance processes to verify reported 
information; only 18 companies of the 314 report that they employ such measures.  Of those 
18 companies, 13 are European.  Where external verification takes place, the majority of 
companies use a private consulting firm.  However, one company is piloting a review of their 
annual sustainability report by an expert External Review Committee, which includes 
representatives from organizations like Transparency International and the Danish Institute for 
Human Rights. </p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>8
</b>  For a GC company to be included in our sample, they must have a CoP in the year 2005 or 
</p>
<p>later.  Therefore, the number of CoPs is roughly equivalent to the number of GC companies in 
the sample. 
<b>9

</p>
<p>new G3 guidelines are set for release in October 2006 and also available on the GRI website. </p>

</p>
<p><i>Supply Chain Management 
</i></p>
<p>76. Around 54 percent of companies report that they include human right standards in their 
supply chain management.  European and North American firms do so more frequently than 
others, at 67 percent and 59 percent respectively.  In contrast, 37 percent of companies from Asia 
&amp; the Pacific and 29 percent of Latin American companies address supply chain issues.  Two of 
five African companies also have such policies. 
</p>
<p>77. The Retail &amp; Consumer Products sector stands out from all the other sectors 
with 80 percent of its companies reporting some management of their supply chain.  Over half of 
the companies from most other sectors report on a system for managing human rights within 
their supply chain - IT, Electronics and Telecommunications (65 percent), Food &amp; Beverage 
(63 percent), Heavy Manufacturing (58 percent), Infrastructure and Utility (58 percent), and 
Pharmaceutical &amp; Chemical (55 percent).  The Extractive and Financial Services sectors are 
slightly lower (with 45 percent and 39 percent of companies respectively). 
</p>
<p>78. Despite the emphasis on promoting human rights standards through supply chain 
management, companies are not consistent in their expectations of suppliers.  Their 
commitments can range from &#8220;encourag[ing]&#8221; to &#8220;requir[ing]&#8221; suppliers to meet standards, and 
the actual human rights standards often are not expressed in detail. 
</p>
<p>79. Of the few companies that do elaborate on standards, most define them in Vendor Codes 
of Conduct or other guidelines that set out the parameters of specific rights, like the right to a 
minimum wage and freedom of association, and require that suppliers comply with the code.  
One British communications company expressly uses international standards to gauge supplier 
performance, stating that &#8220;we want working conditions in our supply chain to meet the standards 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation&#8221;. 
</p>
<p> Commitments are made in the following ways.  Companies either: 
</p>
<p> (1) Encourage the supply chain partners to meet human rights standards; 
</p>
<p> (2) Require adherence only to specific principles like the abolition of child and forced 
labor or the right to a safe work environment; or 
</p>
<p> (3) Require suppliers to adhere to the same standards as the company, or more 
broadly, human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>80. Finally, supply chain management systems seem to activate at two phases of the supplier 
relationship, the <i>time of tender </i>and the <i>time of contracting</i>.  A third alternative is the use of an 
<i>ongoing</i> <i>monitoring mechanism</i>; however, relatively few companies use monitoring as a means 
to manage their supply chain.  The following cases illustrate how these systems play out: 
</p>
<p><i> Time of Tender 
</i>81. When selecting a supplier, a French electric company factors whether the suppliers 
participate in the GC, stating that 60 percent of its suppliers currently are GC participants.  A few 
companies review the human rights performance of suppliers, and the reputation of the countries </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 27 
 
</p>
<p>where they operate before entering into agreements.  For example, an Italian extractive company 
states that &#8220;suppliers in countries with poor human rights records will be expected to provide 
evidence of their systems for safeguarding their employees&#8217; rights.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><i> Time of Contracting 
</i>82. Illustrating the promotion of human rights at the time of contracting, an American 
department store conglomerate states that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;All of the company&#8217;s vendors are required to sign written affirmations, agreeing to 
comply with the company&#8217;s [Vendor/Supplier] Code of Conduct, that are designed to 
protect workers in this country and abroad.  Among other things, the Code requires [the 
company&#8217;s] vendors to allow unannounced factory inspections for contractual 
compliance, as well as for compliance with laws and regulations dealing with child or 
forced labor and unsafe working conditions.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Many companies also reserve the right to terminate contracts in the case of human rights related 
breaches. 
</p>
<p><i> Ongoing Monitoring Mechanism 
</i></p>
<p>83. Companies in the sample primarily address monitoring at the time of contracting, where 
they reserve the right to monitor their supply chain through random and, in some cases, 
unannounced site visits.  Few companies indicate the regularity of such visits.  The following 
two examples are exceptions and represent a more ongoing monitoring process, inclusive of 
remediation procedures: 
</p>
<p>84. Although the combination of monitoring and remediation is rare, one Danish technology 
firm states that it maintains a database of supplier CSR performance.  The company utilizes a 
system of site visits and adjustment of factory conditions to maintain compliance.  Another 
company, a Chinese merchandise sourcing group, has a Social Compliance Program that requires 
every supplier to satisfy a &#8220;comprehensive social compliance evaluation&#8221; based on voluntary 
initiative SA8000 guidelines.  Results are shared with clients and, where needed, suppliers are 
put on a &#8220;comprehensive corrective action plan&#8221; with continued monitoring. 
</p>
<p>85. Another tool is the use of third party auditors.  One company from the sample partners 
with NGOs, while another partners with an industry association to conduct routine random audits 
of their suppliers.  Companies also participate in certain collective initiatives, such as the Fair 
Labor Association, which requires ongoing monitoring and auditing, including surprise visits by 
third parties. 
</p>
<p><b>External Engagement </b></p>
<p><i>Community Consultations, Including Impact Assessments 
</i></p>
<p>86. Around a quarter of the sample makes some commitment to consult with affected 
communities.  By region, European and North American companies commit to consultation most </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p>frequently, both at around 30 percent.  Only 18 percent of Latin American and 10 percent of Asia 
&amp; Pacific companies make such commitments.  No African companies mention community 
consultation. 
</p>
<p>87. Most companies that commit to community consultation do so by means of dialogue with 
stakeholders; only few go beyond dialogue and include some type of human rights impact 
assessments as part of the community consultation process.  Companies in the Financial Services 
and Extractive sectors stand out because they conduct or require impact assessments more 
frequently than those in other sectors. 
</p>
<p>88. In a typical illustration of the commitment to consult with affected communities, one 
German based construction company states: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;We integrate the local community into our daily work as much as possible ... including 
supporting the local economy ... or talking with communities about how to design 
construction projects such that the sites important to their cultural heritage are best 
preserved.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Another company, an American extractive, formalizes the community consultation practice 
through its use of &#8220;Community Advisory Councils,&#8221; which ensure ongoing community input. 
</p>
<p>89. Although impact assessments are relatively rare, one American automobile manufacturer 
commits to conducting an impact assessment to support &#8220;joint decision-making&#8221; with the 
community: </p>
<p>&#8220;The Community Impact Assessment and Engagement model uses data gathering and 
analysis to support joint decision-making by the community and the Company, thereby 
helping put community relationships on a more equal footing with more measurable 
business imperatives.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>90. Eleven Financial Services companies in our sample have signed on to the Equator 
Principles, which gauge the social and environmental impacts of projects.<b>10</b>  Other financial 
companies curb impacts by withholding investment in specific industries, such as defense, and 
genetically modified organism-related companies.  One Norwegian financial firm recognizes its 
power as an investor to influence company actions: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Company is in continual dialogue with companies suspected of acting contrary to 
the Global Compact or the OECD Guidelines ...  [The Company] uses its influence as an 
investor to attempt to guide companies in a positive direction, often in cooperation with 
other investors.  In certain cases, shareholder rights are used actively in order to influence 
companies.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 29 
 
</p>
<p>91. Finally, Extractive sector companies routinely make broad commitments to consultations, 
addressing the culture, health, and environmental concerns of surrounding communities.  Two 
policies provide for post-closure plans.  For example, one American extractive company 
commits to: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Work continuously to understand the culture of the host country and especially 
indigenous peoples; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Undertake social, cultural, and health studies; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Consult with local populations about important operational issues that will impact 
their communities; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Work with the host country&#8217;s government, the local people, and responsible NGOs to 
create and periodically update social integration and/or sustainable development plans 
for all operational sites; [and] 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Address the issue of economic and social viability of each operating area after 
cessation of operations. 
</p>
<p>A South African extractive specifically states that it aims to ensure &#8220;prompt delivery&#8221; of any 
benefits or protections agreed to with communities. </p>
<p><i>Philanthropic Programs 
</i></p>
<p>92. Most companies in our sample engage in some form of philanthropic activity, including 
cash giving, company managed community programs, partnership programs, in-kind support to 
charitable organizations, and encouragement and/or incentives for employees to engage in 
community work. 
</p>
<p>93. Companies in the sample overwhelmingly focus their philanthropic activity on education 
and health.  Education-related philanthropy ranges from support for the education of 
underprivileged populations to more specific issues like financial literacy.  Health-related 
philanthropy focuses on providing food and clean water in addition to health-related education.  
A number of companies also have specific projects addressing HIV/AIDS in their countries of 
operation. 
</p>
<p>94. Other companies relate their philanthropic activity to their business expertise.  A German 
media corporation states that &#8220;it is important to us that our commitment be sustainable and 
closely identifiable with our business expertise and core competencies&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>95. Additionally, some companies partner with NGO&#8217;s and governmental organizations.  A 
large Spanish utility company works with the ILO in youth employment programs throughout 
Latin America and commits to the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;in the case of particularly disadvantaged environments or communities [we] will 
endeavour to provide for urgent social needs that cannot be adequately met by other 
institutions.&#8221;<b> </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.4

</p>
<p><b>D.  Anticorruption 
</b></p>
<p>96. Bribery and corruption are often considered part of the human rights agenda since they 
are such significant impediments to the realization of rights, and many companies have adopted 
anti-bribery policies - almost 60 percent of the companies in our sample.  Accordingly, we 
included these policies in our study. 
</p>
<p>97. North American companies report their anticorruption policies most frequently, at a rate 
of 71 percent, with European companies slightly behind at 62 percent.  Almost half of 
the companies from Asia &amp; the Pacific have anticorruption policies, while Latin American 
companies report significantly lower rates at 21 percent.  Four of the five African companies 
have anticorruption policies.  There are slight sectoral differences.  At the high end, Extractive, 
Heavy Manufacturing, Pharmaceutical &amp; Chemical, and Retail &amp; Consumer Products firms state 
their policies on corruption at rates of 68-77 percent.  Not far behind, Food &amp; Beverage 
companies state their policy on corruption at a rate of 58 percent; the remaining sectors are IT &amp; 
Telecommunications and Financial Services, which both address anticorruption 50 percent of the 
time, and Infrastructure &amp; Utility companies, which address anticorruption 43 percent of the 
time. 
</p>
<p>98. Policies mainly prohibit the acceptance of &#8220;excessive&#8221; or &#8220;lavish&#8221; gifts, money, or 
special favors from business partners.  A few policies prohibit company contributions to political 
parties or candidates.  Others prohibit unethical business practices in general. 
</p>
<p>99. Several companies note that social amenities, reasonable entertainment, and other 
courtesies <i>may </i>be extended to customers, suppliers, or employees, reasoning that such nominal 
exchanges are beneficial to business.  A few companies also reserve space for &#8220;culturally 
appropriate&#8221; gifts, without defining what this would include.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>E.  Sources 
</b></p>
<p>100. Finally, we sought to determine what instruments or sources inform company human 
rights commitments.  Figure 6 summarizes the most frequently cited. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 31 
 
</p>
<p><b>The Global Compact 
</b></p>
<p>101. Sixty-seven percent of companies in the sample participate in the Global Compact (GC), 
a voluntary initiative based on ten principles covering human rights, labor, environment, and 
anticorruption.<b>11</b>  Of those companies, all regions are represented, with 4 African companies, 
49 Asia &amp; Pacific, 119 European, 24 Latin American, and 20 North American companies.  
North American GC participants are concentrated in two sectors, 6 in the IT, Electronics and 
Telecommunications sector and 6 in the Extractive sector. </p>
<p><b>Other Voluntary Initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>102. A range of other voluntary initiatives are cited by companies: SA8000, Transparency 
International, the Ethical Trading Initiative, the Business Social Compliance Initiative,<b>12</b> the 
Sullivan Principles, Fair Labor Association (FLA), the Extractive Industries Transparency 
Initiative (EITI), the Electronics Industry Code of Conduct (EICC), the International Council on 
Mining and Metals (ICMM), and the Kimberley Process.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>103. While there was generally no uniformity of citation or membership within individual 
sectors, companies in the Extractive and Financial Services sectors do stand out for their 
adherence to industry-specific initiatives. 
</p>
<p>104. Of the Extractive companies, 50 percent refer to the Voluntary Principles on Security and 
Human Rights (VPs), which aim to reconcile the need for security with the protection of human 
rights.  10 of the 12 North American extractive companies cite the VPs.  Slightly fewer European 
companies, 11 of 17, reference them.  Notably, not all companies that reference the Voluntary 
Principles are active participants in the initiative.<b>14</b>  In addition to the VPs, 4 extractive 
companies refer to their membership in the ICMM, 6 to the EITI and 4 to the Sullivan Principles. 
</p>
<p>105. In the Financial Services sector, 11 of the 38 companies in our sample cite the Equator 
Principles.<b>15</b>  Additionally, a significant number of companies commit to the UNEP/GC 
Principles for Responsible Investment.<b>16</b>

<p><b>11
</b>  The GC&#8217;s CoP database was a main data source, which accounts for the high reference to

</p>
<p><b>UDHR 
</b></p>
<p>106. At a rate of almost 50 percent, European companies reference the UDHR most 
frequently.  North American companies reference it at a rate of 36 percent.  In contrast, only 
20 percent from the Asia &amp; Pacific region and 11 percent of Latin American companies refer to 
the Declaration.  Two of the five African companies also reference it.  Companies typically 
&#8220;respect,&#8221; &#8220;support,&#8221; or &#8220;recognize&#8221; the UDHR. 
</p>
<p>107. Extractive, IT, and Financial Services companies cite the UDHR more frequently than 
companies in other sectors - 27 of 44 in the Extractive sector, 19 of 40 in IT, and 16 of 38 in 
Financial Services.  One French insurance firm states that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Although governments have the primary responsibility to promote, ensure the respect of 
and protect human rights, the Group, as an international enterprise, recognises its 
responsibility to promote and guarantee human rights, as set forth in the United Nations&#8217; 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>ILO 
</b></p>
<p>108. Forty percent of European companies reference the ILO.  North America comes second, 
referencing the ILO at a rate of 25 percent.  In contrast, only 7 percent of companies from 
Latin America, and 6 percent from Asia and the Pacific mention ILO standards.  Three of 
the 5 African companies in the sample also reference the ILO. 
</p>
<p>109. Sectorally, companies in the Extractive, IT, and Retail &amp; Consumer Products sectors cite 
the ILO most frequently.  Company commitments are generally framed as &#8220;support&#8221;, 
&#8220;recognition&#8221;, and &#8220;respect&#8221; for ILO standards.  Where companies commit to &#8220;comply&#8221; with 
ILO standards, they most often make a specific commitment to the Fundamental Rights at Work 
Convention or other well-known conventions, like the Convention Concerning the Minimum 
Age for Admission to Employment or Hours of Work conventions. 
</p>
<p>110. Illustrating an unusually high level of commitment, a German based retailer &#8220;assur[es]&#8221; it 
will meet ILO standards: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Company voluntarily commits itself to assuring, in all its subsidiaries, the terms of 
employment and working conditions recommended by the ILO&#8221;. </p>
<p><b>OECD Guidelines  
</b></p>
<p>111. Almost all of the companies citing the OECD Guidelines are European (29 of 34).  
Companies generally referred to the Guidelines as a whole and made no specific commitments to 
individual principles.  Demonstrating a typical level of commitment, one European 
pharmaceutical company states that it operates &#8220;in the spirit of&#8221; the Guidelines, while another 
company commits only to what it perceives as &#8220;relevant sections&#8221;, while failing to elaborate on 
what those are. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 33 
 
</p>
<p><b>ICCPR/ICESCR and Other United Nations Documents 
</b></p>
<p>112. Only four companies, all European, refer specifically to the ICCPR and ICESCR (where 
they were mentioned, they were mentioned together).  Three other companies cite the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, another company refers to the Convention on the 
Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, and one company cites the Rio Declaration on 
Environment and Development. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary - Part I 
</b></p>
<p>113. Even though labor rights enjoy the widest recognition by companies, it is nevertheless 
apparent that some regions and sectors lag in recognizing even the most fundamental labor 
rights.  For example, the prohibitions against forced and child labor are considered to be part of 
the four fundamental principles and rights at work;<b>17</b> however, the level of recognition of these 
prohibitions reaches as low as 25 percent by region and as low as 40 percent by sector.  
Moreover, apart from the almost 90 percent recognition of the right to nondiscrimination and the 
75 percent recognition of the right to a safe work environment, the remaining labor rights receive 
recognition from two thirds or fewer of the companies.  This can scarcely be deemed adequate 
for rights so evidently connected to employees, one of corporations&#8217; primary stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>114. Emerging markets, inclusive of Latin America and Asia and the Pacific, recognize labor 
rights less than North America and Europe, with gaps between emerging and developed markets 
reaching over 30 percent for some rights, including the right to a safe work environment, 
nondiscrimination, and the prohibitions against forced and child labor.  Although the Asia &amp; 
Pacific region trails North America and Europe, it follows more closely than Latin America in 
most instances.  Recognition of the right to a minimum wage and rights pertaining to work/life 
balance is low irrespective of region. 
</p>
<p>115. For non-labor rights, the low levels of recognition are striking.  Even for the most 
recognized rights, such as security related rights, the right to privacy, and the right to 
development, the levels of recognition do not go higher than 19 percent.  Admittedly, the little 
attention given to some rights seems logical.  For example, the right to a fair trial is not a right 
that companies will routinely, if ever, have an impact on.  Thus, it seems appropriate that the 
levels of recognition are low for this right.  However, this does not hold true for many other 
non-labor rights where a company&#8217;s potential impact is more evident. 
</p>
<p>116. In addition, company reporting on human rights commitments varies widely, ranging 
from reports solely on philanthropic activity to more detailed reports that use a human rights 
checklist like that provided by the GRI.  The inclusion of human rights standards in supply chain 
management also varies in approach and substance.  Furthermore, company engagement in 
community consultations is rare, and the use of human rights impact assessments even rarer. 
</p>

</p>
<p>117. When reviewing the human rights instruments referenced by companies, one can see the 
influence of certain sources on corporate recognition of rights.  For example, European 
companies reference the UDHR and ILO as much as 35 percent more than other regions.  Not 
surprisingly, European companies also recognize human rights at higher rates across the board.  
North America follows closely in its recognition of the UDHR and is on par with many of the 
patterns of rights recognition of European Companies.

<p>118. Finally, in addition to connections between sources referenced and rates of rights 
recognition, one can also see some connections between the rights recognized by collective 
initiatives and socially responsible indices and those recognized by companies.  Accordingly, 
Part II of this report reviews several collective initiatives, and Part III examines socially 
responsible investment indices.<b>

<p><b>II.  COLLECTIVE INITIATIVES 
</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>119. This section of the report considers voluntary collective initiatives.  Companies that sign 
up to them are expected to follow their human rights parameters and in some cases may be 
removed from membership if they do not.  Companies either devised or helped devise the criteria 
for membership.  Thus, the initiatives reflect the behavior that companies and other stakeholders 
believe are necessary for a corporation to operate ethically and according to international human 
rights standards. 
</p>
<p>120. The sample includes eight collective initiatives.  They were selected because they have 
been widely adopted within their respective industries.  We drew solely upon publicly available 
information when analyzing the collective initiatives.  The International Council of Toy 
Industries (ICTI), Worldwide Responsible Apparel Production (WRAP), Electronic Industry 
Code of Conduct (EICC), the Equator Principles, and the International Council on Mining and 
Metals (ICMM) are industry initiatives, meaning that they were initiated by industry members 
for their specific sectors.  Social Accountability 8000 (SA8000), the Ethical Trade Initiative 
(ETI), and the Fair Labor Association (FLA) are multi-stakeholder initiatives.  Each involves 
business and non-governmental organizations; SA8000 and the ETI include labor; the ETI and 
FLA were initiated with assistance by government; and the ETI continues to have governmental 
involvement. 
</p>
<p>121. The initiatives fall broadly into two categories.  The first, which includes WRAP, FLA, 
ETI, EICC, ICTI, and SA8000, focus on manufacturing.  All of the other initiatives in the sample 
address large-scale projects, such as infrastructure and natural resource extraction.  In this 
category, ICMM addresses mining practices, while the Equator Principles apply to project 
finance lenders.<b>18</b>

<p>122. In the realm of labor rights, the results of the collective initiative survey generally parallel 
the company survey, prohibiting child and forced labor, upholding the principle of 
non-discrimination, promising a safe and healthy workplace, and committing to respect freedom 
of association and collective bargaining.  Additionally, the collective initiatives show significant 
support for the right to a minimum wage and the right to rest and leisure.  The collective 
initiatives show greater recognition than the companies in the areas of civil, political, social, 
economic, and cultural rights.<b>19</b>  The two initiatives that focus on large-scale projects address 
indigenous rights and communication with the surrounding community in more depth. 
</p>
<p>123. The following is a brief description of the initiatives: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>EICC</b> (2004) - electronics industry - EICC is an industry initiative, composed of 
brand name electronics companies.  Members commit to following a voluntary code.  
EICC states that participants should apply the code and related management system to 
its next tier suppliers.  It does not require that the entire supply chain meet its 
standards, although it is considering changing this rule.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Equator Principles</b> (2003, revised 2006) - financial institutions - The Equator 
Principles are an industry initiative, formed by private financial institutions engaged 
in project finance.  Members commit not to lend to borrowers who do not comply 
with the Principles&#8217; environmental and social requirements.  The Equator Principles 
incorporate the International Finance Corporation&#8217;s (IFC) Performance Standards on 
Social and Environmental Sustainability.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>19
</b>  The rights in this report are ordered according to the prevalence with which the collective 
</p>
<p>initiatives recognized them.  The order in no way reflects upon the intrinsic importance of the 
rights. 
<b>20
</b></p>
<p>  This report references information that the initiatives have made available and free to the 
public.  EICC documents referenced through this report:  <i>Electronic Industry Code of Conduct,

<p>  Equator documents referenced throughout this report:  <i>The Equator Principles</i> (July 2006); 
<i>International Finance Corporation&#8217;s (IFC)</i> <i>Performance Standards on Social and 
Environmental Sustainability</i>.  The Equator Principles incorporate the IFC Performance 
Standards.  The Equator Principles require a lender bank to carry out an environmental and 
social assessment of the client project, followed by application of social and environmental 
standards.  The assessments are only for projects that have &#8220;potential significant adverse social 
or environmental impacts that are diverse, irreversible or unprecedented&#8221; or &#8220;potential limited 
adverse social and environmental impacts that are few in number, largely reversible and readily 
addressed through mitigation measures.&#8221;  The application of social and environmental standards 
is based upon the IFC Performance Standards.  The Standards only apply to non-OECD or 
non-high income OECD countries.  Projects must comply with the IFC Performance Standards 
unless the assessment shows a &#8220;justified deviation.&#8221;  This report discusses the Equator Principles 
in the cases that all its sections are applied, which depends on whether the company operates in 
an OECD country or is likely to have significant adverse impacts. </p>

</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>ETI </b>(1998) - Manufacturing Industries - ETI is composed of companies, NGOs, and 
trade organizations, and it is partially funded by the UK government.  It works to 
identify and promote good practices in code implementation, monitoring, and 
verification.  Member companies promise to implement its code of conduct 
throughout the supply chain and to terminate relations if violations persist.  ETI does 
not certify factories or companies.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>FLA</b> (1999) - Garment and Apparel Industries - The FLA incorporates multiple 
stakeholders, including business, NGOs, and universities.  FLA certifies external 
auditors, who in turn certify brands.  FLA companies commit to incorporate FLA 
standards throughout the supply chain.  FLA emphasizes the need to work with the 
supply chain to bring practices into compliance rather than simply ending the supplier 
relationship.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>ICMM</b> (2003) - Mining Industry - ICMM is an industry initiative, formed by 
15 major mining companies accounting for approximately 50 percent of the 
industry&#8217;s market capitalization.  Members agree to follow a common set of 
principles.  The principles focus on issues such as involuntary resettlement, 
community development, and communication with stakeholders.  They require 
members to &#8220;encourage&#8221; the supply chain to adhere to the same standards.<b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>ICTI</b> (now the ICTI Care Process) (1995) - Toy industry - ICTI was created by toy 
corporations, and its members are national trade associations and their member 
corporations.  ICTI members pledge to abide by the Principles of Business Conduct 
and require their suppliers to do so as well.  ICTI&#8217;s Care Process certifies external 
auditors, who in turn certify factories.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>SA8000</b> (Accreditation System launched 1997, Corporate Involvement 
Program 1999) - Multiple Industries - SA8000 incorporates multiple stakeholders, 
including NGOs, unions, and business.  It provides certification by independent 
auditors and helps companies implement compliant management systems.<b>26</b>

<p>&#8226; <b>WRAP </b>(2000) - Garment and Apparel Industries - WRAP is an industry initiative 
composed of trade associations and factories.  WRAP certifies external auditors, who 
in turn certify factories.  WRAP producers promise to incorporate WRAP standards 
throughout the supply chain.<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Labour Rights 
</b></p>
<p>124. In general, the labor rights that are most often recognized in the collective initiatives 
mirror those in the company surveys.  The most-cited labor rights, referred to by all eight 
initiatives, include: the right to non-discrimination in the workplace, the abolition of slavery and 
forced labor, and the right to a safe work environment.  Seven initiatives recognize the duty to 
abolish child labor.  The fairly frequent recognition of the right to freedom of association and 
collective bargaining (7 initiatives) is similar to the 50 percent recognition rate in the company 
survey. 
</p>
<p>125. The initiatives reflect some variation from the patterns found in the company survey.  
The collective initiatives are more likely to recognize a right to work, in a form going above and 
beyond vocational training.  Another difference emerges regarding the minimum wage.  The 
collective initiatives demonstrate more support than the companies for the right to a minimum 
wage, including a decent living, with 7 of 8 initiatives supporting the right, compared to around 
36 percent of the companies.  Finally, the collective initiatives evince greater support for the 
right to rest and leisure than the companies. </p>
<p><b>Nondiscrimination 
</b></p>
<p>126. All initiatives articulate a duty of <i>nondiscrimination</i>.  Policies on nondiscrimination 
range from simple statements not to discriminate (by three initiatives) to full listings (by five 
initiatives) of up to thirteen prohibited grounds for discrimination.  For example, the EICC&#8217;s 
extensive list of prohibited grounds includes union membership, marital status, pregnancy, 
sexual orientation, age, and disability, along with the more traditional criteria such as gender, 
race, and religion.  The EICC also forbids medical testing that could lead to discrimination. 
</p>
<p>127. Five initiatives support the right to <i>equality at work </i>and<i> equal pay for equal work</i>.  As 
seen earlier in the analysis of the company survey, these two rights often arise within the context 
of a broader non-discrimination policy.  For example, four initiatives forbid discrimination in 
hiring, remuneration, and promotion. 
</p>
<p><b>Right to a Safe Work Environment 
</b></p>
<p>128. All eight initiatives recognize the <i>right to a safe and healthy work environment.  </i>They 
address hazards, emergency response, and cleanliness, as well as providing potable water and 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>sanitary surroundings and housing.  The checklists and guidelines used to conduct compliance 
audits often incorporate greater detail, such as the minimum and maximum temperatures for 
specific workspaces or the square footage per person required for dormitories.<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Abolition of Forced and Child Labour 
</b></p>
<p>129. All eight initiatives recognize the prohibition on forced labor.  Regarding the <i>abolition of 
slavery and forced labor, </i>ICMM simply states that forced labor is not to be used.  The seven 
other initiatives use language that is more specific, mandating no forced, bonded, indentured, or 
involuntary prison labor.<b>29</b>  Three also state that employees cannot be forced to make a monetary 
deposit or leave identity cards when they commence employment, presumably because this can 
force them to remain on location. </p>
<p>130. Seven of eight initiatives support the <i>abolition of child labor.</i>  Four (WRAP, EICC, FLA, 
SA8000) require companies to use the highest age from the following choices:  1) the minimum 
age of employment under national law, 2) the age at which compulsory education ends under 
national law, or 3) the age 14-15.  SA 8000 even requires remediation of children found to be 
working in members&#8217; factories.  Companies &#8220;shall provide adequate support to enable such 
children to attend and remain in school until no longer a child.&#8221;  This requires companies to 
provide support for these children&#8217;s educations. 
</p>
<p>131. While the Equator Principles address the issue of child labor, they do not place an 
absolute prohibition on the practice: companies promise to follow local laws where applicable 
and to &#8220;not employ children in a way that is economically exploitative, or is likely to be 
hazardous or to interfere with the child&#8217;s education, or to be harmful to the child&#8217;s health or 
physical, spiritual, moral, or social development. 
</p>
<p>132. Five initiatives give a <i>minimum age for employment</i> (usually fourteen or fifteen years) 
that serves as a floor if national law provides a lower age. 
</p>
<p><b>Right to Minimum Wage, Including Decent Living 
</b></p>
<p>133. The six initiatives that focus on manufacturing support the <i>right to a minimum wage</i>.  
They either use national standards if they exist, or industry standards.  Two (SA8000 and ETI) 
also state that member companies must meet basic needs and provide some discretionary 
income.  The collective initiatives&#8217; emphasis on this right stands in contrast to the individual 
companies&#8217; relatively low recognition rate (around 30 percent).  Four initiatives (EICC, FLA, 
SA8000, ETI) forbid the use of punitive deductions from wages based on under-performance or 
failures to meet quotas.  ICMM uses weaker language, recognizing a duty to &#8220;ensure fair 
remuneration.&#8221;

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 39 
 
</p>
<p><b>Freedom of Association, Right to Collective Bargaining 
</b></p>
<p>134. Seven initiatives recognize <i>freedom of association</i> and the <i>right to organize and 
participate in collective bargaining</i>.  Three (SA 8000, ETI, Equator Principles) require that if no 
such right exists under national law the companies find an alternative means for workers to 
express their collective concerns.  The FLA recognizes the right and specifies that companies 
cannot use intimidation to prevent peaceful organizing.  Of the remaining two initiatives (both of 
which are industry developed), the ICTI requires companies to provide for the right to 
representation only if it is recognized under national law.  The ICMM&#8217;s recognition is even 
weaker, only requiring its members to &#8220;provide for the constructive engagement of employees on 
matters of mutual concern,&#8221; but without actually recognizing the right of association or 
collective bargaining. 
</p>
<p>135. The FLA also recognizes the political right to <i>freedom of assembly, </i>requiring that &#8220;the 
employer will not use force, or the presence of police or military, to intimidate workers, or to 
prevent peaceful organizing or assembly.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Work/Life Balance 
</b></p>
<p><i>Right to Rest and Leisure, Including Holidays with Pay 
</i></p>
<p>136. Five initiatives could be considered to support the <i>right to rest and leisure</i> because they 
require that workers be given one day out of seven as a holiday.  Most place limitations on the 
number of hours in the work week, based upon national standards or industry standards, or they 
declare maximum weekly hours, usually around 48.  Most initiatives also limit the hours of 
overtime.  However, holidays with pay are not mentioned. </p>
<p><i>Right to Family Life, Including Maternity Leave 
</i>137. Two initiatives support some aspect of the <i>right to a family life</i>.  One requires maternity 
leave (ICTI), and another (FLA) demands accommodation of pregnant women, although what 
such accommodation would entail is not spelled out thoroughly. </p>
<p><b>Right to Work 
</b></p>
<p>138. Both of the non-manufacturing initiatives issue statements strongly recognizing the <i>right 
to work</i>.  The ICMM principles stipulate that members &#8220;rehabilitate and reintegrate employees 
into operations following illness or injury, where feasible.&#8221;  The Equator Principles require that 
companies &#8220;provide additional targeted assistance (e.g. credit facilities, training, or job 
opportunities) and opportunities to improve or at least restore their income-earning capacity, 
production levels and standards of living to economically displaced persons whose livelihoods or 
income levels are adversely affected.&#8221;  Other initiatives address the issue of training.  However, 
training focuses more on successful implementation of the collective initiative, such as safety or 
human rights training, rather than furthering workers&#8217; long-term career prospects. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Non-Labour Rights 
</b></p>
<p>139. Generally, the collective initiatives recognize non-labor rights at a higher rate than the 
companies.  It is possible that some of these rights are buried in internal company policies and </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
page 40 
 
</p>
<p>were never unearthed in our company survey, which may help explain the discrepancy.  For 
example, recognition of the right to freedom of movement sometimes arises from collective 
initiative directives regarding the conditions of company-owned sleeping quarters.  Similar 
directives may well exist in internal policies for specific factories, or, on the other hand, 
companies may simply be less sensitive to the need to address non-labor rights than the 
collective initiatives. 
</p>
<p>140. To summarize, the findings differ from the company survey in the following ways.  The 
right to security of the person receives strong support among the initiatives.  All eight discuss 
freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.  Only 16 percent of the companies 
recognize the right.  Six initiatives recognize the right to freedom of movement, while the 
recognition rate from companies regarding this right is negligible.  Finally, the collective 
initiatives show a very low recognition rate for the right to privacy.  In contrast, this right is the 
most recognized non-labor right in the company survey. 
</p>
<p><b>Security of the Person 
</b></p>
<p>141. Seven of the eight initiatives recognize the <i>right to life, liberty, and security</i> <i>of person</i> 
through their support for the <i>freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment</i>. This finds expression in policies that forbid the use of corporal punishment, harsh and inhumane 
treatment, and psychological or verbal abuse, or other limitations on the actions of security 
guards. 
</p>
<p>142. Six initiatives require <i>freedom of movement</i> for employees, which can also be seen as 
supporting the right to life, liberty and the security of the person.  The policies of ICTI, ETI, 
FLA, SA8000, and WRAP address one of the following:  specify the right for workers to leave 
when their shift ends; prohibit companies from taking identity papers, work permits, or other 
deposits; forbid companies from requiring that workers live in company housing; or require that 
employees be able to quit their jobs upon reasonable notice.  The ICTI and the FLA also state 
that the company cannot control egress of employees from the workplace after their shift ends.  
The FLA provides that companies cannot use illegal or unreasonable searches to control 
workers&#8217; exercise of the right to freedom of association.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Other Civil/Political and Economic/Social Rights </b></p>
<p><i>Right to Physical and Mental Health 
</i></p>
<p>143. Four initiatives address the right to <i>physical and mental health, and access to medical 
services</i>.  The Equator Principles stipulate that the client owes a broad duty to the community:  
clients have a &#8220;responsibility to avoid or minimize the risks and impacts to community health, 
safety, and security that may arise from project activities.&#8221;  The other three initiatives recognize 
it only within the limited sphere of the workplace to address employee work-related illness or 
injury.  The FLA states, &#8220;Employers will ensure that women are not engaged in work that creates 
substantial risk to their reproductive health&#8221; and also mandates that pregnant women are not 
engaged in activities likely to damage their health.  This policy may also support the <i>right to 
marry and form a family</i>.  Two other initiatives, ICTI and EICC, require competent on-site 
medical services for emergencies or occupational injury or illness. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 41 
 
</p>
<p><i>Right to Participate in Cultural Life, the Benefits of Scientific Progress and Protection of 
Authorial Interests 
</i></p>
<p>144. Three initiatives recognize the <i>right to cultural life, the benefits of scientific progress, 
and protection of interests resulting from scientific, literary or artistic production. </i> The two 
initiatives oriented towards large-scale projects express strong policies on the right to cultural 
life, especially in the context of indigenous peoples.  The ICMM requires that its members 
&#8220;respect the culture and heritage of local communities, including indigenous peoples.&#8221;  It also 
has a stronger, although not easily measurable, policy for engagement with minority 
communities, demanding that members &#8220;ensure&#8230;that minorities and other marginalized groups 
have equitable and culturally appropriate means of engagement.&#8221;<b>30</b>  The Equator Principles 
require companies to gain consent in order to use community cultural knowledge for commercial 
purposes: &#8220;where a project proposes to use the cultural resources, knowledge, innovations, or 
practices&#8221; of indigenous peoples or local communities for commercial purposes, the client 
cannot proceed unless it informs the communities, successfully negotiates with them and 
&#8220;provides for fair and equitable sharing of benefits from commercialization of such knowledge, 
innovation, or practice, consistent with their customs and traditions.&#8221;<b>31</b>  SA8000 simply forbids 
interference with tenets or practices based on membership in various groups.<b>32</b> </p>
<p><i>Minority Rights to Culture, Religious Practice, and Language 
</i></p>
<p>145. The three initiatives that express support for the <i>right to cultural life, the benefits of 
scientific progress, and protection of interests resulting from scientific, literary, or artistic 
production </i>also support<i> minority rights to culture</i>, <i>religious practice, and language</i>.  The similar 
recognition rates may be because recognition of the duty to protect products of a culture usually 
is linked to the right to practice that culture and maintain it without exploitation. 
</p>
<p><i>Right to Development 
</i></p>
<p>146. Two initiatives appear to acknowledge a <i>right to development</i>.  ICMM members pledge 
to &#8220;contribute to the social, economic, and institutional development of the communities in 
which we operate&#8221; and &#8220;work with governments, industry&#8230;to achieve appropriate and effective 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>30
</b>  It is interesting that while the ICMM has stronger policies than the other initiatives in the 
</p>
<p>areas of community engagement and indigenous and minority rights, its recognition of labor 
rights such as freedom of association is weaker than that other initiatives. 
<b>31
</b></p>
<p>  IFC Performance Standard 8 also recognizes a broader duty to protect places of cultural 
heritage:  &#8220;the client will protect and support cultural heritage by undertaking internationally 
recognized practices for the protection, field-based study, and documentation of cultural 
heritage.&#8221; 
<b>32
</b></p>
<p>  Additionally, SA8000 has language supporting minority cultural rights: &#8220;Shall not interfere 
with the exercise of rights of personnel to observe tenets or practices, or to meet needs relating to 
race, caste, national origin, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, union membership, or 
political affiliation.&#8221; </p>

</p>
<p>public policy, laws, regulations and procedures that facilitate the mining, minerals, and metals 
sector&#8217;s contribution to sustainable development within national sustainable development 
strategies.&#8221;  Members are also encouraged to enter into &#8220;partnerships with governments and 
non-governmental organizations to ensure that programmes (such as community health, 
education, local business development) are well designed and effectively delivered.&#8221; The 
Equator Principles demand some developmental duties in the context of resettlement: &#8220;the client 
will provide opportunities to displaced persons and communities to derive appropriate 
development benefits from the project.&#8221;<i> 
Right to Self-Determination 
</i>147. The Equator Principles provide some recognition of the <i>right to self-determination, 
including indigenous peoples&#8217; right to informed consent.  </i>The Equator Principles not only 
require that companies &#8220;respect and preserve the culture, knowledge and practices of indigenous 
peoples&#8221; but also that they &#8220;ensure the development process fosters full respect for the dignity, 
human rights, aspirations, cultures and natural resource-based livelihoods of indigenous 
peoples.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><i>Right to Adequate Food, Clothing, and Housing 
</i></p>
<p>148. Only one initiative explicitly or broadly recognizes a duty to provide <i>adequate food, 
clothing, and housing</i>.  In the case of involuntary resettlement, the Equator Principles require 
that companies provide adequate housing with security of tenure.  Five other initiatives demand 
that if companies provide accommodation or lunchrooms, they must meet certain basic standards 
of decency.<b>33 
</b></p>
<p><b>C.  Accountability and External Engagement </b></p>
<p>149. The collective initiatives strongly support reporting, including of human rights standards 
in supply chain management, and community consultation.  The ICMM and the Equator 
Principles, both codes applicable to the extractive industries, have more detailed policies 
regarding community relations and impact assessments. </p>
<p><b>Accountability </b></p>
<p><i>Reporting 
</i></p>
<p>150. All the initiatives require reporting in some form.  The key issues include whether the 
entity producing the report is internal or external; who created the standards for the report; and 
whether reporting is public or internal. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>33
</b>  For example, the EICC requires that &#8220;Workers are to be provided with clean toilet facilities, 
</p>
<p>access to potable water and sanitary food preparation and storage facilities.  Worker dormitories 
provided by the Participant or a labor agent are to be clean, safe, and provide emergency egress, 
adequate heat and ventilation and reasonable personal space.&#8221; </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 43 
 
</p>
<p>151. Four initiatives rely on external, independent auditors (ICTI, FLA, WRAP, SA8000).  
Four initiatives use voluntary codes where companies are engaged in self-reporting (ICMM, ETI, 
EICC, Equator).  However, the ICMM is in the process of developing an external assurance 
process. 
</p>
<p>152. Two initiatives incorporate external standards for reporting.  The ICMM uses the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI), and Equator uses the IFC&#8217;s Performance Standards.  The other 
initiatives create the standards used for their members&#8217; reporting. 
</p>
<p>153. The Equator Principles, SA8000, FLA, and ICMM call for public reporting by members.  
The other initiatives only require internal reports.  The FLA has a more fluid approach to public 
reporting, which involves posting online tracking charts that depict compliance problems of 
individual factories on a rolling basis.<b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>154. Four initiatives, EICC, FLA, ETI, and the Equator Principles, also require the creation of 
a grievance mechanism for employees or community members.  This mechanism should allow 
them to report violations of the code without reprisal.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p><i>Supply Chain Management 
</i></p>
<p>155. Five of the initiatives (ICTI, ETI, SA 8000, FLA, WRAP) address the human rights 
performance of members of the supply chain.  Four of these initiatives (ICTI, SA 8000, FLA, 
and WRAP) certify factories in the supply chain or monitor a brand&#8217;s supply chain and certify 
the brand.  EICC indicates that it may eventually require that the entire supply chain meet its 
standards.  ICMM only &#8220;encourages&#8221; suppliers to adopt its principles and practices.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>External Engagement </b></p>
<p><i>Community Consultations, Including Impact Assessments<b> 
</b></i></p>
<p>156. Two initiatives require impact assessments and community consultation.  The ICMM 
requires impact assessments carried out with the help of the community: &#8220;Consult with interested 
and affected parties in the identification, assessment and management of all significant social, 
health, safety, environmental and economic impacts associated with [their] activities&#8221; and create 
systems for such interaction.  The Equator Principles require that the party developing the project 
has &#8220;consulted with project affected communities in a structured and culturally appropriate 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>34
</b>  See FLA, http://www.fairlabor.org/all/transparency/reports.html. 
</p>
<p><b>35
</b>  Arguably, the ICMM does as well, as it requires that &#8220;appropriate systems are in place for 
</p>
<p>ongoing interaction with affected parties.&#8221;  However, it does not contain language prohibiting 
reprisal. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
page 44 
 
</p>
<p>manner.&#8221;  In addition, the Equator Principles also usually mandate a social and environmental 
assessment.<b>36</b>  On a similar note, when indigenous communities might be impacted by a project, 
the company must develop the action plan with their participation. 
</p>
<p>157. Two other initiatives focus on community engagement.  The FLA recommends that 
companies consult regularly with the community, specifically with local organizations, and elicit 
input from them about working conditions.  The EICC &#8220;encourages&#8221; companies to engage with 
the community. 
</p>
<p><i>Philanthropic Programs 
</i></p>
<p>158. In contrast to the company survey, the initiatives do not generally focus on philanthropy. 
</p>
<p><i>Environmental Standards Related to Human Rights 
</i></p>
<p>159. Five of the initiatives require member companies to comply with certain environmental 
standards that extend beyond safe working conditions.  Three (EICC, ICMM, Equator Principles) 
arguably link environmental practices to the protection of the right to health.  EICC posits that 
&#8220;adverse effects on the community, environment and natural resources are to be minimized while 
safeguarding the health and safety of the public.&#8221;  ICMM companies must &#8220;advance 
understanding of the properties of metals and minerals and their life-cycle effects on human 
health and the environment&#8221; and &#8220;seek continual improvement of our environmental 
performance.&#8221;  The Equator Principles also link protecting the environment to the right to health: 
to &#8220;avoid or minimize adverse impacts on human health and the environment by avoiding or 
minimizing pollution from project activities.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Anticorruption 
</b></p>
<p>160. Anticorruption is not a significant focus of the collective initiatives.  Only the EICC 
forbids the taking of bribes.  ICMM requests companies to &#8220;implement policies and practices 
that seek to prevent bribery and corruption.&#8221;  The other initiatives do not mention corruption, 
perhaps because anticorruption is not part of human rights and labor conventions, despite its 
impact on the enjoyment of these rights.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>E.  Management and Implementation Systems 
</b></p>
<p>161. In most cases, the collective initiatives provide detailed provisions regarding their 
expectations for management systems and policies to support implementation of the initiative&#8217;s 
code.  Some, such as EICC, include this in the code itself.  For others, such as the FLA and ICTI, 
the management requirements appear primarily in supplemental auditing codes or guidelines.  
Because the collective initiatives provide much greater detail than the companies regarding 
implementation and management systems, some basic management elements needed to 
successfully implement a voluntary human rights code emerge from the initiatives.  This 
information is depicted in Table 1, below.

<p><b>F.  Sources 
</b></p>
<p><b>ILO 
</b></p>
<p>162. Of the major international human rights conventions, the collective initiatives most 
frequently reference the ILO core conventions (4 initiatives).  Some initiatives commit &#8220;to 
respect&#8221; the ILO conventions (ETI, SA8000, plus ICTI in the context of child and forced labor).  </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
page 46 
 
</p>
<p>Another uses ILO standards as a reference to create its code (EICC).  Two initiatives (ICTI, 
SA8000) specifically promise to respect the Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor and 
Minimum Age Convention. 
</p>
<p><b>Other International Conventions 
</b></p>
<p>163. SA8000 states that members shall respect the Convention on the Elimination of all 
Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(CRC).  None refer to the ICCPR or ICESCR. 
</p>
<p><b>UDHR 
</b></p>
<p>164. Two initiatives mention the UDHR.  The EICC uses it as a reference document to form 
its code, while SA8000 demands that members respect its principles. </p>
<p><b>Global Compact, OECD Guidelines and Other Voluntary Initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>165. Non-UN sources appear in the publicly available documents of two initiatives.  EICC 
lists a wide variety of sources it used as references to create its code, such as the Global Compact 
and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, but specifically notes that this does not 
mean that EICC companies adopt them.  The Equator Principles incorporate the IFC&#8217;s 
Performance Standards on Social and Environmental Sustainability. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary - Part II 
</b></p>
<p>166. In sum, the collective initiatives show greater recognition of labor rights than civil, 
political, social, economic, and cultural rights.  The prohibitions on child and forced labor, the 
principle of non-discrimination, the right to a safe workplace, and respect for freedom of 
association and the right to collective bargaining receive particularly strong support. 
</p>
<p>167. Additionally, civil and political rights such as the right to life, liberty, and security of 
person, freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and freedom of 
movement receive substantial support.  The support levels for the right to life and freedom from 
torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment and freedom of movement are significantly 
higher than the recognition rate in the company survey. 
</p>
<p>168. The manufacturing initiatives are particularly thorough in the area of labor rights.  The 
extractive and project finance initiatives focus more on relations with the community and 
indigenous populations.  In contrast to the company policies reviewed in Section I of this report, 
the collective initiatives also spell out the actions needed for effective implementation in far 
greater detail, including management structures and policy-making, which provide potential 
models for companies attempting to implement CSR measures. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT INDICES 
</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>169. Socially responsible investment (SRI) funds emerged as a niche product to appeal to a 
certain subset of investors who are particularly concerned with social and environmental issues.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 47 
 
</p>
<p>That concern gradually is becoming more mainstreamed - most rapidly in the area of 
climate change and its attendant risks, but broader social and human rights challenges as 
potential corporate risks are not far behind.  In one signal of the increased interest in this 
area, institutional investors worth more than $5 trillion officially support the Principles 
for Responsible Investment, agreeing to consider social, environmental, and corporate 
governance factors when they invest.<b>37</b>  Thus, to discover what human rights criteria the 
socially responsible segment of financial markets believes are relevant for firms, we also 
examined a sample of SRI market indices.  The sample focuses on SRI indices rather than 
on SRI funds because most SRI funds use SRI indices to develop their investment 
portfolios.  We only considered publicly available information regarding the practices of 
SRI indices, which may not reflect the full range of criteria that the indices use when selecting 
companies. 
</p>
<p>170. SRI indices first evaluate companies using traditional financial analysis.  Then they 
screen for compliance with certain social, ethical, human rights, and environmental standards as 
defined by each index.  Some indices also automatically screen out certain sectors, such as 
tobacco or firearms manufacturers.  This information enables investors to ensure that their 
investments go to what they regard as socially responsible or sustainable companies.<b>38</b>  SRI 
funds, large institutional investors, mutual fund managers, and individuals can select their 
companies from an SRI index. 
</p>
<p>171. Human rights criteria are one of several considerations for the SRI.  Some SRIs require 
that companies meet a minimum level of adherence to human rights.  However, most of the SRIs 
do not publicly state whether recognition of a specific human right, such as the prohibition on 
child labor, is an absolute requirement.  Thus, there is no publicly stated absolute requirement 
that a company abide by specific human rights, although a company&#8217;s practices must show 
overall respect for human rights.  Also, a company which just meets the minimum SRI standard 
for human rights practices might still be included in a portfolio because of very positive practices 
in other areas, such as environmental standards or strong corporate governance.  This differs 
from the less flexible approach of the collective initiatives, which often mandate adherence to 
specific human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>172. The sample includes five social investment indices:  the Dow Jones Sustainability 
World Index (DJSI), the Financial Times Stock Exchange 4 Good Index (FTSE4 Good), the 
Calvert Social Index, the Ethibel Sustainability Index Global, and the Domini Social Equity

</p>
<p>Index.<b>39</b>  These particular indices were selected because they are well-known and commonly 
used by the SRI community of investors.  One SRI institution may maintain several SRI indices 
for different regions and sectors. 
</p>
<p>173. The results from the SRIs are similar to those of the company survey and collective 
initiatives.  Labor rights receive more mention than other areas of human rights.  Freedom of 
association, the right to organize and participate in collective bargaining, the principle of 
non-discrimination in the workplace, and the right to a safe and healthy work environment 
receive particularly strong support, followed by the prohibition of child labor and forced labor 
and the right to a minimum wage.  The right to family life appears quite frequently in the SRI 
criteria.  In the area of social, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, the SRIs reflect 
greater concern for indigenous rights to participate in cultural life and the benefits of scientific 
progress and the right to development compared to the results of the company and collective 
initiative surveys.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>174. The following is a brief description of the indices: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Calvert Social Index </b>was established in June 2000:  The Calvert Social Index is 
a broad-based rigorously constructed benchmark for measuring the performance of 
large-cap and mid-cap US-based socially responsible companies.  Calvert starts by 
taking the 1,000 largest companies in the US, representing stocks listed on the 
New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ-AMEX.  As of September 2006, the 
Calvert Social Index encompassed 641 large, US-based socially responsible 
companies.<b>40</b>  The Calvert Social Index Fund uses a replication index method, 
investing in each stock in the Index in about the same proportion as represented in the 
Index itself.  The Calvert Social Index Fund includes exclusionary criteria to 
automatically reject certain sectors, such as companies substantially involved in the 
production of alcohol, tobacco, gambling operations, and weapons.<b>41</b>  The Calvert 
Social Index Fund conducts a full social audit of the company based on: governance 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>39
</b>  The analysis in this report considers the criteria used by a particular index company.  It does 
</p>
<p>not distinguish between the different indices created by one company.  For example, Dow Jones 
has devised the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability 
North America Index.  While companies generally use the same criteria for their indices, if there 
were a right considered by one index and not the other, that right would still be counted in this 
report.

<p>  Calvert Social Index Fund Fact Sheet, September 2006. 
<b>41
</b></p>
<p>  KLD (the company that devised Domini&#8217;s investment screens) defines an exclusionary screen 
as:  &#8220;A social or environmental criterion that, if not satisfied, eliminates companies for 
consideration for an investment universe.&#8221; </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 49 
 
</p>
<p>and ethics, the environment, workplace conditions, community relations, product 
safety and impact, human rights, and indigenous peoples&#8217; rights.<b>42</b>  A company must 
meet Calvert&#8217;s minimum criteria in each of these areas to be eligible for investment 
by Calvert&#8217;s social funds.<b>43</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Domini Social Equity Index</b> (1991) is made up of the stocks of 400 companies 
that are selected using social and environmental criteria.  KLD Research &amp; Analytics, 
Inc. developed the screens for the index.  The index first screens out companies with 
significant direct revenues from tobacco, alcohol, or the operation of gambling 
institutions, and companies with significant direct revenues from or ownership of 
nuclear power plants.  Domini then uses qualitative screens to identify companies 
with positive profiles, considering performance in the areas of community, diversity, 
employee, relations, environment, human rights, and product safety and usefulness.  
Poor performance in one of these realms does not necessarily prohibit investment if 
the company scores well in other qualitative screening areas.<b>44 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Dow Jones Sustainability Indices </b>(1999)<b> </b>include the leading 
sustainability-driven companies worldwide.  Dow Jones, STOXX Limited and SAM 
Group work together to devise a series of indices, which are based on economic, 
environmental and social criteria.  The Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) 
currently comprise global, European, Eurozone, North American and US indices.  
The number of companies included varies by index.  DJSI does not use 
pre-determined exclusionary screens for any sectors.  It does use a series of screens 
that include economic, environmental, and social criteria.  The social criteria 
encompass a number of human rights standards.<b>45</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Ethibel Sustainability Index</b> (2002) consists of 162 companies that meet 
Ethibel&#8217;s sustainability criteria.  The Ethibel Sustainability Index (ESI) is comprised 
of four regional indexes: ESI Global, ESI Americas, ESI Europe, and ESI Asia 
Pacific.  Ethibel does not use any exclusionary screens.  Instead, Ethibel uses a &#8220;best 
of class&#8221; approach, which means that it selects companies in a sector or region that

<p>best meet its criteria; a company is selected if it performs well compared to its 
peers.<b>46</b>  Ethibel considers a company&#8217;s internal and external environmental and 
ethical policies.<b>47 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The FTSE4Good Index </b>(2001) is a stock market index.  It measures the performance 
of companies that meet globally recognized corporate responsibility standards and 
thereby facilitates investment in those companies.  FTSE4Good divides the 
FTSE4Good Index into several more benchmark indices covering the globe, Europe, 
the US, Japan, and the UK.  FTSE4Good utilizes exclusionary screens to avoid 
producers of tobacco, nuclear weapons or whole weapons systems manufacturers, 
owners and operators of nuclear power plants, and companies involved in extraction 
and processing of uranium.  Then FTSE4Good uses social screens to identify 
companies with positive social, environmental, human rights, supply chain, and 
anti-bribery practices.<b>48</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Labour Rights 
</b></p>
<p>175. All five indices consider freedom of association, the right to organize and participate in 
collective bargaining, the principle of non-discrimination in the workplace, the right to a safe and 
healthy work environment, and the right to family life.  The prohibition of child labor and forced 
labor, the right to a minimum wage, and equality at work receive support from four indices.  
Three indices address the right to rest and leisure.  Two indices consider the right to equal 
remuneration for equal work.  The right to work, including vocational training, receives limited 
support from all five indices in the context of employee training and staff development. 
</p>
<p>176. The recognition of labor rights generally follows the pattern that the company survey and 
collective initiatives portrayed.  However, the right to family life receives especially high 
consideration from the SRI indices compared to the collective initiatives and companies. 
</p>
<p><b>Nondiscrimination 
</b></p>
<p>177. All five indices consider <i>nondiscrimination</i> when rating companies.  DJSI, FTSE4Good, 
and Ethibel look for the existence of company policies or performance indicators that enforce the 
</p>

<p><b>46
</b>  KLD defines best of class as follows:  &#8220;An approach to constructing screened portfolios 
</p>
<p>which permits inclusion of companies on the basis of their records as the best in their industries.  
Its purpose is to gain diversification or to minimize beta in comparison to an unscreened index.  
This technique necessarily involves inclusion of companies that social investors would otherwise 
exclude.&#8221;

</p>
<p>right.  Calvert and Domini use a different approach, looking not only for policies but for positive 
evidence of nondiscrimination such as women employed in upper management positions.  For 
example, Calvert also analyzes issues in nondiscrimination such as pay, promotion, tenure, 
benefits and training.<b>49</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Right to a Safe Work Environment 
</b></p>
<p>178. All five indices recognize the <i>right to a safe work environment</i>.  Most measure this 
through the existence of policies, programs, and performance, such as accident rates.  DJSI uses 
compliance with the ILO&#8217;s Safe Work code of practice as a measuring tool.  The other four look 
for actual evidence of good workplace safety practices, such as accident rates.  Calvert also 
considers company standards and policies to address workplace violence. </p>
<p><b>Freedom of Association, Right to Collective Bargaining 
</b></p>
<p>179. All five indices consider <i>freedom of association</i> and the <i>right to organize and participate 
in collective bargaining</i>.  DJSI and Calvert look at whether the company allows association and 
collective bargaining as defined by the ILO, while FTSE4Good requires &#8220;freedom of association 
and collective bargaining&#8221; but does not define them.  Ethibel, Domini, and Calvert also consider 
the quality of the company&#8217;s relationship with unions.  For example, for U.S. companies with 
union representation, Calvert avoids companies with egregious National Labor Relations Board 
(NLRB) determinations or a pattern of anti-union practices.  Ethibel looks at &#8220;the degree to 
which the employee/trade union(s) representatives are recognized as a dialogue partner&#8221; and the 
&#8220;presence of formal consultation bodies.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Right to Work 
</b></p>
<p>180. The provision of vocational training may not indicate a purposeful recognition of the 
<i>right to work</i>.  All five indices narrowly support the right to work as it pertains to provision of 
vocational training and employee development.  However, only three indices (DJSI, Ethibel, and 
Domini) employ broader criteria that can be seen as supporting the right to work.  DJSI considers 
the extent to which the company has laid off workers.  Ethibel evaluates &#8220;the extent to which the 
company creates and maintains employment.&#8221;  Domini once looked at whether a company laid 
off its workers, but, in recognition of the current state of the manufacturing industries in the 
Unites States, currently considers &#8220;the best commitment management can now make is to invest 
in the education and training of its employees to assure their lifetime employability at one firm 
or another.&#8221;  Domini also prefers companies that invest in community-based groups who work to 
provide skills to welfare recipients. </p>
<p><b>Work/Life Balance 
</b></p>
<p>181. All five SRI indices (DJSI, FTSE4Good, Domini, Ethibel, and Calvert) look positively 
on policies that promote the <i>right to family life</i>.  Calvert looks for family-friendly programs.  
DJSI, FTSE4Good and Domini specifically mention maternity and paternity leave.  FTSE4Good

</p>
<p>also favors companies with flexible working arrangements and family benefits, such as flexible 
working time, childcare support, job sharing, career breaks, or maternity or paternity pay beyond 
the legal requirements.  Ethibel appears to support the right to family life through a broad 
statement that it considers whether job flexibility &#8220;takes into account the needs and expectations 
of the employees.&#8221;  Domini also screens for whether the company supports &#8220;programs and 
activities aimed at single parent or dual-career families.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Abolition of Forced and Child Labour 
</b></p>
<p>182. Four out of the five indices (Calvert, Domini, DJSI, FTSE4Good) consider the 
<i>prohibitions on forced and child labor</i> to some degree.  Calvert states that &#8220;companies that use 
child labor or forced labor, discriminate against certain employees, repress independent trade 
unions, abuse the rights of indigenous peoples, or fail to provide safe and healthy work 
environments are essentially violating internationally recognized basic human rights&#8221; and avoids 
including them.  Other indices are less explicit.  Domini notes that &#8220;stories of child labor, prison 
or bonded labor, and abusive working conditions have horrified the American public&#8230;Given the 
concern of social investors about the issue, [Domini] has sought to provide information on 
controversies when available.&#8221;  Domini then notes that, due to the difficulty in obtaining 
consistent data, Domini more often addresses these issues through shareholder advocacy or other 
channels.  With respect to company supply chains, FTSE4Good looks for a policy or code 
clearly based on the ILO Conventions on Forced and Child Labor, while Calvert requires 
supplier codes of conduct that include prohibitions on forced and child labor as minimum 
standards for approving investments in certain industries, such as apparel and footwear 
manufacturers. 
</p>
<p><b>Right to Minimum Wage, Including Decent Living 
</b></p>
<p>183. Four indices (Ethibel, Calvert, Domini, FTSE4Good) support the <i>right to a minimum 
wage</i>.  Ethibel, Calvert, and Domini look for sustainable or &#8220;fair&#8221; wages.  Additionally, 
FTSE4Good queries whether a company&#8217;s supply chain meets the ILO standards for wages.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Non-Labour Rights 
</b></p>
<p>184. <i>Index recognition of non-labor rights indicates some contrasts to the collective initiatives 
and company surveys.  Three indices consider the right to self-determination, right to participate 
in cultural life and the benefits of scientific progress, the right to life, liberty, and security of 
person, and the right to be free from torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.  Three 
indices also scrutinize company contributions to the right to development, preferring companies 
that contribute to the communities in which the company works, and even suggesting that it rises 
to the level of a duty.  A smaller number of initiatives support economic and social rights, 
including the right to food, clothing, and housing, the right to health, and the right to social 
security.  Two initiatives refer to the right to a remedy and the right to freedom of information 
and expression. 
</i></p>
<p>185. <i>The right to security of the person receives significant support, in a manner similar to the 
collective initiatives.  This results from screening based on the right to be free from torture, and 
cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.  In contrast to the collective initiatives, the SRI indices 
do not discuss the right to freedom of movement. </i></p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 53 
 
</p>
<p>186. <i>The SRI indices place slightly more emphasis on the right to self-determination and the 
right to the benefits of scientific progress and authorial interests than the collective initiatives.  
They also highlight these rights significantly more than the company survey.  The SRI indices 
show particular support for the rights of indigenous peoples.  The SRI indices also use stronger 
language pertaining to the right to development and the duties of corporations to contribute to 
the communities in which they operate.  Well-designed philanthropic programs that serve the 
development needs of the community also receive particular attention. 
<b></b></i><b>Security of the Person 
</b></p>
<p>187. Three indices (DJSI, Calvert, Domini) scrutinize whether a company protects its 
workforce from <i>torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  </i>The language used to 
address the issue varies, but all of the indices generally look for freedom from abuse.  DJSI looks 
for a policy on the security of staff.  Calvert encourages companies to develop standards to 
address workplace violence.  Less directly, Domini mentions employee harassment and abuse as 
a labor concern.  As these policies are intended to protect the physical integrity of individuals, 
they also implicate the <i>right to</i> <i>life, liberty, and security of the person</i>. 
<b>Other Civil/Political and Economic/Social Rights 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Right to Development 
</i></p>
<p>188. <i>Three indices (Domini, Ethibel, Calvert) use language pertinent to the </i>right to 
development.  <i>Domini states that &#8220;corporations have an obligation to give back to the 
communities from which they draw their resources, both human and natural.&#8221; Similarly, Ethibel 
considers whether companies &#8220;contribute to the realisation of sustainable trade relations and to 
the local socio-economic development.&#8221;</i>  <i>Calvert and Domini articulate an expectation that 
corporations contribute to disadvantaged segments of society.  Calvert claims that &#8220;responsible 
corporate citizens make significant contributions to the quality of life of local communities&#8221; and 
it prefers &#8220;firms with innovative and well-developed programs that target often-neglected 
communities, including low-income and minority populations.&#8221;  On a related note, Domini 
&#8220;makes a special effort to invest in financial institutions that channel funds to those not 
adequately served by the mainstream financial community, and to serve those without adequate 
access to capital, financial services, and economic education.&#8221;</i> 
<i>Right to Self-determination, Including Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Right to Informed Consent  
</i>189. <i>Three indices (Calvert, Domini, FTSE4Good) screen based on company recognition of 
the </i>right to self-determination, including indigenous peoples&#8217; right to informed consent<i>.  Calvert 
&#8220;seeks to invest in companies that&#8230;adopt and implement guidelines that...may encompass, 
among others, respecting the human rights and self-determination of indigenous peoples and 
securing prior informed consent in any transaction, including the acquisition and use of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; property.&#8221; According to Domini, &#8220;The indigenous peoples&#8217; social screen 
seeks to distinguish companies that respect the land, sovereignty, culture, human rights, and 
intellectual property of indigenous peoples.&#8221;  Domini defines a responsible process of 
consultation to include informed prior consent.  FTSE4Good articulates a more general 
criterion of &#8220;a stated commitment to respecting indigenous peoples&#8217; rights.&#8221; </i></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/35/Add.4

</p>
<p><i>Right to Participate in Cultural Life, the Benefits of Scientific Progress, and Protection of 
Authorial Interests</i> 
</p>
<p>190. <i>Three indices (Calvert, DJSI, Domini) survey whether a company respects the rights of 
host countries or indigenous populations to</i> benefit from scientific progress and protection of 
authorial interests.  <i>The indices are more specific about the duty to protect the intellectual and 
cultural property of indigenous peoples than either the companies or the collective initiatives.  In 
keeping with their policies on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, Calvert and Domini screen based on 
whether companies expropriate the intellectual property of indigenous peoples, which is often 
knowledge that is linked to their cultural practices.  Calvert notes, &#8220;Companies fail Calvert&#8217;s 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights criteria because they&#8230;extract biological resources without sharing 
the economic benefits with resident indigenous peoples.&#8221;  DJSI require a company to &#8220;indicate 
how your company shares the benefits of accessing genetic resources with the host country.&#8221;</i> 
<i>Right to Physical and Mental Health 
</i></p>
<p>191. Three indices (DJSI, Calvert, Domini) refer to the <i>right to health</i>, although the 
articulation of the right is limited in scope and inconsistent in application between companies.  
For example, DJSI considers whether the company gives medical care for employee families, but 
does not extend the duty to provide medical care to the broader community.  Calvert analyzes the 
degree to which a company&#8217;s line of business improves human health on society, looking for 
&#8220;companies that produce or market goods and services that enhance the health or quality of life 
for consumers.&#8221;  Domini tries to avoid investing in companies involved in a major product safety 
controversy, which it defines as &#8220;one in which products pose widespread risks to human health.&#8221; </p>
<p><i>Right to Social Security 
</i></p>
<p>192. Two indices (Domini and DJSI) consider whether a company has contributed to the <i>right 
to social security</i> in the form of pensions or retirement benefits.  Domini considers retirement 
programs obligatory: &#8220;if a company is not adequately providing for its employees&#8217; retirement, it 
is not fulfilling one of its basic obligations to society.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><i>Right to Education 
</i></p>
<p>193. Only one index (Domini) favors companies that invest in <i>education</i>, although it is not 
expressed as a corporate duty.  Domini states: &#8220;We seek to invest in companies that have 
exceptionally positive community relations programs, particularly those that&#8230;support 
systematic public school education.&#8221; </p>
<p><i>Right to Adequate Food, Clothing and Housing 
</i></p>
<p>194. Domini screens favorably if a company helps provide <i>housing</i>.  Domini notes: 
&#8220;Affordable housing is one of the most basic needs that a society can provide for its citizens.&#8221;  It 
also favors companies that invest in affordable housing.  Calvert considers whether companies 
provide or support affordable housing under the community relations screen. </p>

 page 55 
 
</p>
<p><i>Right to Equal Recognition and Protection under Law, Including Right to Effective National 
Remedies 
</i></p>
<p>195. One index (Domini) seems to support <i>effective national remedies</i> that target human 
rights violations.  In the US Supreme Court case <i>Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain</i>, Domini signed an 
<i>amicus</i> brief in support of the Alien Torts Claims Act, which Domini terms &#8220;an important tool 
for holding human rights violators accountable.&#8221;  As part of its social analysis of companies, 
Calvert also closely reviews national remedies that target human rights violations, such 
as ATCA. 
</p>
<p><i>Right to Hold Opinions, Freedom of Information and Expression 
</i>196. Domini actively supports the right to <i>freedom of information and expression</i>.  Domini 
issued a joint statement of investors calling on Internet businesses to respect freedom of 
expression.  Domini does not explicitly state that it screens on this basis, but the joint statement 
indicates that the right is a concern for the index.  Similarly, Calvert has engaged in extensive 
advocacy related to company impact on the right to free speech on the internet, especially in 
China. </p>
<p><b>C.  Accountability and External Engagement 
</b></p>
<p><b>Accountability 
</b></p>
<p><i>Reporting 
</i></p>
<p>197. Four of the indices (Calvert, DJSI, Ethibel, FTSE4Good) consider whether a company 
reports on its human rights policies and practices and whether such reports are made public.  
DJSI also looks for an internal, confidential reporting mechanism for employees to comment on 
labor or human rights-related issues.  As discussed below, Calvert prefers companies who report 
according to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). </p>
<p><i>Supply Chain Management 
</i></p>
<p>198. All five indices address human rights conditions in supply chains, although FTSE4Good 
limits scrutiny to specific types of companies.  Four seem to consider supply chain and supplier 
management regardless of the industry.  For example, Calvert &#8220;seeks to invest in companies that 
create and implement codes of conduct that cover their entire scope of operations.&#8221;  Similarly, 
Ethibel analyzes the degree to which a company makes efforts &#8220;to avoid violations of 
international conventions on human and labour rights by its suppliers and subcontractors.&#8221;  
However, FTSE4Good limits scrutiny of supply chain practices to &#8220;high risk&#8221; companies.  
FTSE4Good also assumes that if a company has signed onto the FLA, ETI, or SA8000, 
its supply chain meets the necessary labor standards.  Like the other issues involved in this 
report, supply chain management is not an absolute requirement, but instead one factor 
considered when selecting companies. </p>

</p>
<p><b>External Engagement </b></p>
<p><i>Community Consultations, Including Impact Assessments 
</i></p>
<p>199. All five indices review a company&#8217;s community consultations or relations.  Four (DJSI, 
Domini, FTSE4Good, and Calvert) require a human rights risk assessment or prior community 
permission for activities.  DJSI and FTSE4Good both require &#8220;feedback from stakeholders&#8221; 
(DJSI) or &#8220;positive relationships&#8221; (FTSE4Good) with communities, along with a pre-project 
human rights impact assessment.  Domini discusses the need for quality consultation with 
indigenous communities, which includes prior informed consent to corporate activities.  Ethibel 
only address community relations, not risk or impact assessments.  Ethibel considers whether a 
company is &#8220;freely engaged in stakeholder dialogue,&#8221; and Calvert looks for companies with 
&#8220;solid relationships with the local community in which they operate.&#8221;  In addition, Calvert&#8217;s 
indigenous peoples&#8217; and  human rights criteria include strong community consultation 
provisions. </p>
<p><i>Philanthropic Programs 
</i></p>
<p>200. All five indices (DJSI, Domini, Ethibel, FTSE4Good<i>, and Calvert</i>) evaluate company 
philanthropic giving to the community.  Domini&#8217;s language raises it to the level of a duty:  
&#8220;for-profit corps have a particular opportunity and obligation to give back to the communities 
that support them.&#8221;  Ethibel, FTSE4Good, and DJSI analyze the amount and type of corporate 
giving.  FTSE4Good looks for companies that make charitable donations in excess of &#163;50,000.  
Two indices examine the quality of the philanthropic programs.  For example, Ethibel considers 
the societal impact of the projects supported, while DJSI queries whether a company has a 
system in place to &#8220;systematically measure the impact&#8221; of its contributions in order to further 
strengthen its philanthropic/social investment strategy.  Calvert&#8217;s community relations criteria 
includes an assessment of philanthropic programs, as well as innovative giving programs that 
help to support nonprofit organizations, provide financial support for disadvantaged 
communities, and employee volunteer programs. </p>
<p><b>D.  Anticorruption 
</b></p>
<p>201. <i>Three indices (Calvert, DJSI, FTSE4Good) analyze company anti-bribery and 
anticorruption policies or practices.  FTSE4Good and DJSI scrutinize whether a company has 
relevant policies in place.  Calvert looks at the company&#8217;s policies, programs, and actual 
compliance records with respect to bribery and corruption.<b></b></i><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>E.  Sources 
</b></p>
<p><b>ILO 
</b></p>
<p>202. The SRI indices refer most frequently to the International Labor Organization (ILO) 
Conventions, mentioned by all five indices. 
</p>
<p><b>UDHR 
</b></p>
<p>203. Four SRI indices (Calvert, DJSI, Domini, FTSE4Good) mention the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 57 
 
</p>
<p><b>OECD Guidelines 
</b></p>
<p>204. Three SRI Indices (DJSI, Domini, FTSE4Good) mention the OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises.  Domini uses the ICCPR to define &#8220;self-determination.&#8221;  The SRI 
indices draw on these sources either by querying whether a company has voiced support for an 
international instrument, or by utilizing the standards set forth in the instrument as a measuring 
tool for companies.  Following the first approach, FTSE4Good looks for company endorsements 
of the ILO Core Conventions, while DJSI favors recognition of the Tripartite Declaration of 
Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy.  Calvert follows the second 
approach.  Calvert&#8217;s workplace criteria are based on &#8220;internationally recognized rights, as 
defined in the basic conventions of the International Labor Organization.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Other Voluntary Initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>205. Other sources appear occasionally.  Calvert favors companies that report in accordance 
with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and considers whether companies are active in FLA 
or SA8000.  FTSE4Good considers membership in the GC as a positive indicator for labor 
standards.  FTSE4Good also assumes signatories to the Voluntary Principles on Security and 
Human Rights have sufficient policies regarding security staff.  FTSE4Good uses membership in 
voluntary initiatives such as the FLA, ETI, and SA8000 as a means to assume that a particular 
company&#8217;s supply chain complies with ILO core labor standards.  FTSE4Good also used the 
FLA, ETI, and SA8000 to develop its criteria for supply chains.  This suggests that the voluntary 
initiatives are taken as a serious indicator of compliance by some SRI indices. 
</p>
<p><b>Summary - Part III 
</b></p>
<p>206. The SRI indices reflect many of the same human rights concerns as the collective 
initiatives and individual companies.  Once more, labor rights receive significant support, 
particularly freedom of association, the right to organize and participate in collective bargaining, 
the principle of non-discrimination in the workplace, the right to a safe and healthy work 
environment, the prohibition of child labor and forced labor, the right to a minimum wage, 
equality at work, and the right to family life. 
</p>
<p>207. In the area of civil and political rights, three indices consider the right to 
self-determination, the right to participate in cultural life and the benefits of scientific progress, 
the right to life, liberty, and security of person, and the right to be free from torture or cruel, 
inhuman, or degrading treatment.  Three indices scrutinize company contributions to the right to 
development, preferring companies that contribute to the communities in which the company 
operates, and even suggesting that this rises to the level of a moral duty. 
</p>
<p>208. Some of the SRI indices also equate membership in voluntary initiatives with positive 
human rights behavior.  Two of the SRI indices prefer membership in voluntary initiatives such 
as the FLA or the GC, and one assumes a company&#8217;s supply chain is in compliance if it is a 
member of certain voluntary collective initiatives.  In sum, the SRI indices follow the same 
general pattern as the companies and collective initiatives, but with a greater emphasis on 
indigenous peoples and development.<b> </b></p>

</p>
<p><b>IV.  CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p>209. This report has examined the human rights policies and management practices of a 
cross-section of business entities: companies from all regions of the world, collective initiatives, 
and SRI indices.  Business recognition of human rights is indicative of what the business 
community itself believes society expects with regard to such standards.  Any overall assessment 
needs to depart from the baseline fact that only a few years ago the present report could not have 
been written because there would have been little to write about.  Human rights are a fluid and 
rapidly changing domain of corporate activity.  This also may account for the strong regional 
differences we found: European and North American firms clearly are &#8220;in the lead&#8221; in most 
respects, with firms based in emerging market countries lagging behind - but globally 
competitive emerging market firms may yet turn out to lag merely temporarily.  Significant 
sectoral differences exist even among North American and European firms, and this pattern of 
variation is likely to hold across other regions as well. 
</p>
<p>210. Widespread expression of human rights norms within company policies and reports 
suggests that business is responding to public expectations for it to respect human rights.  
However, this sense of obligation is not expressed consistently.  The content of the human rights 
recognized is often unclear and can lead to very different levels of specificity, commitment, and 
accountability.  It may be appropriate that companies do not address some human rights in detail 
because they are too far removed from situations in which they could affect those rights.  
However, other omissions are less explicable in those terms.  This uneven pattern of uptake 
suggests that companies may be unsure which human rights they should recognize, and of the 
meaning of certain rights.  Moreover, while there is some congruence between the obligations 
expressed by individual companies versus collective initiatives and SRI indices, substantial 
differences also exist, again possibly suggesting confusion regarding corporate responsibility for 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>211. Companies, collective initiatives, and SRI indices all show the highest recognition levels 
for labor rights - which, apart from criminal law, generally are also the most firmly ensconced in 
international and national law.  The most frequently recognized labor rights include the right to 
non-discriminatory treatment, the right to a safe and healthy work environment, freedom of 
association and the right to collective bargaining, the prohibition on forced labor, and the 
prohibition on child labor. 
</p>
<p>212. Non-labor rights receive significantly less attention.  For non-labor rights, the recognition 
rate by companies is lower than for the collective initiatives and SRI indices.  Non-labor rights 
that are recognized include the right to privacy; the right to security of the person, including 
freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment; freedom of movement; 
indigenous rights, including the right to cultural life, the benefits of scientific progress, and 
protection of authorial interests; and minority rights to culture.  The recognition of these latter 
rights varies significantly, however, depending on whether one looks at the companies, collective 
initiatives, or SRI indices.  Some fundamental rights - the right to peaceful assembly, for 
example, which might include protestors at the gates of a company that has been unresponsive to 
community concerns - receive virtually no recognition from any company, collective initiative, 
or SRI indices. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/35/Add.4 
 page 59 
 
</p>
<p>213. Accountability and external engagement policies also vary greatly.  The research on 
company practices found extensive use of reporting, but the form and detail of the reporting is 
highly inconsistent.  While most companies in the sample report on human rights in some 
fashion, many of the reports do not clearly articulate identifiable and measurable standards.  In 
some instances, companies follow their own reporting format; in others they use international 
reporting standards, such as the GRI.  Sometimes, human rights reporting is integrated into 
company annual reports, while in other cases it stands alone as a separate document.  Needless to 
say, the reporting form is less important than its substance, but some forms of reporting simply 
fail to link company policy commitments meaningfully to identifiable company practices. 
</p>
<p>214. The extent to which companies hold their supply chains to human rights standards and 
the mechanisms they use to do so also differ significantly - in the rights addressed, the level of 
commitment expressed, and the processes used to verify that those rights are not violated.  Some 
companies insist that it is essential for them to enforce certain core rights in their supply chain; 
others express their commitments in far looser terms.  The extent of company obligations to 
respect and consult with local communities, especially indigenous populations, also ranges 
widely, from no commitment, to a commitment to dialogue, to a commitment to dialogue based 
on formal impact assessments.  The extractive sector, collective initiatives, and SRI indices more 
often address the issue of community consultation, although even they present differing views on 
the role of dialogue and informed consent. 
</p>
<p>215. Two main conclusions emerge from these patterns of practice. 
</p>
<p>216. First, while companies clearly recognize some responsibility for the human rights impact 
of their operations, our study finds a widespread lack of certainty regarding which rights pertain 
to corporations.  Social pressure and market mechanisms are sending signals to companies, but 
they are insufficiently precise and consistent.  Some companies will always want to do more than 
others, but at the moment, beyond the domain of labor rights, there appears to be only limited 
common understanding of the range of human rights that apply to companies. 
</p>
<p>217. Second, beyond workplace issues companies similarly lack shared understandings of any 
hierarchy of duties they may have and to whom they may have them.  Many of the policies they 
have adopted are phrased in language that makes it difficult for the company itself, let alone the 
public, to measure performance against commitments.  As a result, companies committed to 
human rights themselves often are the losers.  They may be unable adequately to monitor their 
performance, defeating a primary purpose of their policy; and they may get little external credit 
for admirable things they do. 
</p>
<p>218. In sum, business recognition of human rights has increased significantly in recent 
years - and this study shows that progress is not limited merely to a handful of leading global 
firms.  However, greater efforts are required to clarify the expected business role and, of course, 
to expand rapidly the pool of companies and collective initiatives embracing commitments to 
human rights.
