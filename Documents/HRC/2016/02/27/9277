<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-6/1 on 
human rights violations emanating from Israeli military attacks and incursions, in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, in which the Council requested the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to report to the Council, at its seventh 
session, on the progress made in the implementation of that resolution. 
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution S-6/1, the Council expressed grave concern at the repeated Israeli military 
attacks carried out in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, 
which resulted in loss of life and injuries among Palestinian civilians, including women and 
children; called for urgent international action to put an immediate end to the grave violations 
committed by the occupying Power, Israel, in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including the 
series of incessant and repeated Israeli military attacks and incursions therein and the siege of the 
occupied Gaza Strip; demanded that the occupying Power, Israel, lift immediately the siege it 
had imposed on the occupied Gaza Strip, restore continued supply of fuel, food and medicine 
and reopen the border crossings; called for the immediate protection of the Palestinian civilians 
in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in compliance with human rights law and international 
humanitarian law; and urged all parties concerned to respect the rules of human rights law and 
international humanitarian law and to refrain from violence against the civilian population. 
</p>
<p>3. In the present report, the High Commissioner assesses the implementation of the resolution 
for a one-month period, from the day that it was adopted on 24 January 2008. In accordance with 
resolution S-6/1, the High Commissioner provides the general context of the situation and 
focuses on the situation in and around Gaza, particularly in the context of its closure and of 
violence against the civilian population, during the period from 24 January to 24 February 2008. 
She also addresses the related issue of freedom of movement in the West Bank and provides 
recommendations to the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p>4. On 25 January 2006, elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council were held in the 
West Bank and Gaza. The Hamas movement won the elections over the Fatah movement, 
which had dominated the Palestinian institutions until then. Ismail Haniyeh of Hamas became 
Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority. Shortly thereafter, the international community, 
supported by the Quartet, redirected international aid from the Palestinian Authority to the 
United Nations and humanitarian agencies. Israel imposed economic sanctions, including by 
withholding tax revenues it collected on imports, and introducing additional restrictions on the 
movement of goods to, from and within the Palestinian territory. Israel declared that sanctions 
would be lifted only when the new Palestinian Government renounced violence, recognized 
Israel and accepted previous agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. 
</p>
<p>5. In March 2006, Fatah refused to join the new Palestinian Authority Government; later 
in 2006, supporters of the two groups clashed in both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. 
However, on 8 February 2007, Hamas and Fatah signed the Mecca Agreement, sponsored by the 
Government of Saudi Arabia. After a short period of calm, armed clashes escalated between </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>security forces and armed groups loyal to Hamas and Fatah throughout the period of March to 
May 2007, despite the Agreement. Some 350 people were reportedly killed and more 
than 2,000 injured in the first half of 2007 as a direct result of Palestinian internal armed 
clashes.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>6. By 14 June 2007, Hamas forces and armed groups attacked and seized Fatah-controlled 
Palestinian Authority security installations and government buildings in the Gaza Strip. After a 
three-day siege, the security and military intelligence headquarters of the Palestinian Authority 
were taken over by Hamas. On 14 June, President Mahmud Abbas dismissed the Government of 
Prime Minister Haniyeh, declared a state of emergency, established an emergency government 
based in the West Bank and appointed Finance Minister Salam Fayyad as Prime Minister. Hamas 
refused to recognize the emergency government and set up a Hamas de facto administration in 
the Gaza Strip, whose legitimacy has never been recognized by the international community. 
</p>
<p>7. Following the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank-based cabinet formed 
by President Abbas gained widespread international support. The European Union and the 
United States of America normalized ties and resumed direct aid to the West Bank. Israel agreed 
to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenues it had seized, while tightening the 
economic and trade blockade of the Gaza Strip. 
</p>
<p>8. The European Union suspended the few aid projects it still maintained in the Gaza Strip, 
while Israel prevented the European Union border assistance mission at the Rafah crossing from 
operating, citing security reasons, resulting in the Rafah crossing being mostly closed ever since. 
Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia declared that the West Bank-based cabinet was the sole 
legitimate Palestinian Government. 
</p>
<p>9. While the Hamas Government in the Gaza Strip faced international diplomatic and 
economic isolation, efforts by the international community, in particular the Quartet, to support 
and strengthen the West Bank cabinet led, on 27 November, to the organization of the Annapolis 
Conference. At the Conference, President Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert agreed 
to resume negotiations by the end of 2007. In addition, the two sides agreed to work 
continuously to reach a two-State solution by the end of 2008, a commitment that was repeated 
on the occasion of United States President George Bush&#8217;s visit to Jerusalem on 9 January 2008. 
The visit was preceded by an agreement between the Israeli Prime Minister and the Palestinian 
President to create negotiation teams to address the five core issues of the conflict: settlements, 
Jerusalem, refugees, security and borders. 
</p>
<p>10. In the section below, the High Commissioner examines violations committed by three 
actors: the State of Israel as the occupying Power; the Palestinian Authority; and the de facto 
authorities of the Gaza Strip under the effective control of Hamas. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>III.  PROGRESS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RESOLUTION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Closure of Gaza 
</b></p>
<p><b>General situation 
</b></p>
<p>11. Following the Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip in June 2007, Israel closed its borders 
with Gaza to exports and severely limited imports. The declaration of Israel of Gaza as a &#8220;hostile 
territory&#8221;, on 19 September 2007, resulted in a further reduction of the supply of fuel and 
electricity to the Strip. Israel has explained the declaration and its decision to restrict the 
movement of people and goods (notably fuel and electricity) by referring to the duty of the 
Government of Israel to protect the lives of its citizens, declaring that no Government could be 
expected to fail to react when its towns and cities were subjected to deliberate bombardment 
from a neighbouring territory.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>12. As a result of the restrictions, all six crossings into the Gaza Strip have been opened only 
sporadically since June 2007. All crossings were completely closed on 18 January. During the 
reporting period, the Sufa crossing was opened on average five days per week, but only 40 to 
50 truck loads per day were allowed through. The Karni crossing was open on average one day 
per week, but only one of 34 lanes was operating to allow the passage of animal feed and grains. 
Erez remained open for international humanitarian workers and medical evacuations. Nahal Oz 
was open on average six days per week to allow the passage of limited quantities of fuel. No 
goods crossed Kerem Shalom from 24 January onwards.<b>3</b> Rafah, on the border with Egypt, has 
been almost completely closed since June 2007. On 23 January, Palestinian militants destroyed 
several parts of the wall dividing Gaza and Egypt in the town of Rafah. Hundreds of thousands 
of Gazans crossed the border seeking food and supplies. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 
ordered his troops to allow the Palestinians in, but to ensure that they did not take weapons back. 
The border was resealed on 3 February. 
</p>
<p>13. With few exceptions, all legitimate trade with Gaza virtually came to a halt as a result of 
the closure of the crossings into Gaza, which had devastating effects on the economy and on 
livelihoods before and during the reporting period. The isolation of Gaza, the regular military 
incursions and the lack of effective coordination between the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah 
and Hamas authorities in Gaza resulted in shortages of food, medical and relief items, spare parts 
for critical health and water sanitation installations, materials for humanitarian projects and raw 
materials for commerce and industry in Gaza. According to the Under-Secretary-General for

</p>
<p>Humanitarian Affairs, only 10 per cent of the amount of goods that entered Gaza a year ago were 
being permitted to enter by 15 February 2008. As a result, the Gaza Strip was on the brink of a 
humanitarian disaster.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>14. With regard to access to fuel and electricity, several factors prior to the reporting 
period led to a significant reduction in the availability of electricity, including the bombing, 
on 28 June 2006, of the six transformers of the Gaza Strip power plant and the restrictions of fuel 
supplies to Gaza, which began on 28 October 2007 in the context of sanctions designed to 
pressure Palestinian militants into stopping launching rockets and mortars from Gaza into Israel. 
The situation became more critical on 19 January, when Israel decided to impose a total cut on 
fuel supplies to the Strip in response to a series of rocket attacks by Palestinian militants against 
southern Israel over several days. On 20 January, the main power plant in Gaza completely shut 
down. On 22 January, Israel once again allowed fuel and medical supplies into Gaza.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>15. On 30 January 2008, the Israeli High Court of Justice rejected a petition against the Israeli 
plan to reduce the supply of electricity and fuel to the Gaza Strip, which had already been in 
force for several months.<b>6</b> Following the Israeli High Court ruling, on 7 February, the Ministry 
of Defense ordered the Israel Electricity Company to reduce its supply to Gaza by around 
0.5 megawatts per day. The cut was less than the 1.5 megawatts originally proposed, but still 
compounded the existing shortfall of 60 megawatts per day. 
</p>
<p>16. According to the Israeli Ministry of Defense, electricity cuts to Gaza were made in 
response to the continued and indiscriminate firing of rockets from Gaza into Israel. The 
Ministry also declared that the economic sanctions were part of a policy of &#8220;economic warfare as 
a life-saving alternative to large-scale ground operations&#8221;. The Ministry further argued that the 
only obligation of Israel to the civilian population in Gaza was to avoid a humanitarian crisis, 
and that it was up to the authorities in Gaza to prioritize the distribution of electricity, with

</b>  While the Court confirmed that the State of Israel was obligated to act against terrorist 
</p>
<p>organizations in the framework of the law and in accordance with the provisions of international 
law, and to refrain from intentionally harming the civilian population of the Gaza Strip, it found 
that, &#8220;in light of all the information presented before [the Court] with regard to the supply of 
electricity to the Gaza Strip, we are of the opinion that the amount of industrial diesel that the 
State declared that it intends to supply, as well as the electricity supplied on an ongoing basis 
through the electrical lines from Israel, are sufficient to meet the essential humanitarian needs of 
the Gaza Strip at this time&#8221;, High Court ruling 9132/07, para. 22. (Unofficial translation into

 <p> 
</p>
<p>priority to humanitarian needs. According to the Ministry of Defense, the authorities in Gaza 
could ensure that electricity reached homes and hospitals but not workshops, where rockets were 
produced.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Impact on the enjoyment of human rights 
</b>17. During the reporting period, the above-mentioned restrictions on the movement of people 
and goods had a negative effect on the Gaza Strip population&#8217;s enjoyment of a wide range of 
their human rights, notably their economic, social and cultural rights, but also the rights to life 
and human dignity and their freedom of movement. 
</p>
<p>18. The electricity shortages had a significant effect on the Gazans&#8217; right to an adequate 
standard of living during the reporting period. According to the Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs, in the period from 18 to 24 January, power cuts, which were frequent 
prior to 19 January, were extended in duration to 12 hours per day everywhere in Gaza, except 
Rafah.<b>8</b> Access to electricity is an important component of the rights to adequate housing and an 
adequate standard of living, and also has a serious impact on other rights such as the right to 
water, food and an adequate standard of health. 
</p>
<p>19. As concerns the right to water, during the second half of January almost half of the 
population of Gaza of 1.4 million had no access to running water.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>20. With regard to the right to food, as a result of the closure and restrictions, during the 
reporting period, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated that 
80 per cent of Gazans lived beneath the poverty line and depended on food aid from international 
organizations. In January 2008, the World Food Programme (WFP) was unable to provide any 
food to 10,000 of its beneficiaries and a further 50,000 received only a part of their monthly 
allocation. While 1.1 million Gazans are provided with food by WFP and the United Nations 
Relief and Works Agency for Palestine and Refugees in the Near East, only 7.6 per cent of them 
received 100 per cent of their calorie requirements; the rest relied on the commercial market to 
supplement their diets. However, the lockdown of Gaza led to a further reduction of stocks in the

</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  The right to water is essential for securing an adequate standard of living, particularly since it 
</p>
<p>is one of the most fundamental conditions for survival. The right to water is also inextricably 
linked to the right to the highest attainable standard of health and rights to adequate housing and 
food. See general comment No. 15 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
para. 3. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>commercial sector, and meat, frozen fish and vegetables were rarely available in shops.<b>10</b> It 
should be noted that the right to food is not primarily about food aid; it is rather about being able 
to feed oneself through an adequate livelihood. 
</p>
<p>21. Regarding the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health, the World Health Organization highlighted, in January, a serious shortage of 
essential drugs and increasing difficulties for patients requiring emergency care not available in 
Gaza to leave the Strip, sometimes resulting in the death of the patients concerned. A Palestinian 
human rights organization documented four cases of patients who died between 29 January and 
19 February as a result of not being able to travel abroad to seek needed medical attention or 
owing to their referral for treatment outside the Gaza Strip being delayed or denied.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>22. According to an Israeli human rights organization, on 27 January, a patient who had 
obtained an exit permit to be treated in an Israeli facility was arrested at the Erez crossing. 
On 30 January, another patient was released by Israeli security after a 10-hour-long 
incommunicado interrogation.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p>23. Moreover, power cuts forced hospitals to suspend operations in order to ensure emergency 
services; children, who make up 56 per cent of the population in Gaza, were at risk of health 
problems related to contaminated water and non-functioning sanitation and heating systems. 
During the reporting period, hospitals relied on emergency generators to maintain normal 
services. As at 4 February, all 12 hospitals of the Palestinian Ministry of Health were functioning 
at full capacity; however, none of the primary health-care facilities had received any fuel. The 
provision of diagnostic and dental services was interrupted in primary health-care facilities, 
which had no functioning generators during hours of electricity outage. The facilities that 
provide immunization services and did not have generators transferred vaccines to other facilities 
with functioning generators to prevent breaking the cold chain of the vaccines. According to 
Ministry of Health officials, 49 of 57 ambulances from the emergency department stopped 
working owing to the lack of fuel during the third week of February. Without fuel, hospital 
generators and vital equipment such as incubators would have to shut down. 
</p>
<p>24. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that, without power, the 
Coastal Municipalities Water Utility, the Gaza water authority, could not pump and distribute 
water nor process sewage; for that reason, it had no choice but to release waste water into the sea 
at a rate of 40 million litres per day. According to the Office for the Coordination of

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Humanitarian Affairs, from 18 to 24 January, 30 million litres of raw sewage water were 
released into the sea per day, creating risks for both public health and the environment. 
</p>
<p>25. During the reporting period, schools in Gaza reopened after the winter break, although the 
scarcity of fuel and power forced many institutions to operate without heating and electricity. 
Students also lacked basic materials, including chalk and textbooks, as a result of the restrictions 
on the entry of goods, negatively affecting their right to education. 
</p>
<p>26. According to academic and media sources, corroborated by Palestinian mental health 
practitioners during the period, a large proportion of the population in the Gaza Strip 
suffered from various levels of permanent anxiety, fear and tension, or showed symptoms of 
post-traumatic stress disorders. Evidence showed that a large percentage of children in the Gaza 
Strip were no longer able to perform their school and family duties; moreover, many suffered 
from psychosomatic pain. Signs of fear, anger, anxiety and sleeping disorders were also apparent 
among the children. 
</p>
<p>27. The closure of Gaza also affected the inhabitants&#8217; freedom of religion or belief by 
preventing them from worshipping at some of the most sacred Muslim and Christian sites, such 
as the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and the Church of 
the Nativity in Bethlehem. 
</p>
<p>28. Under article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, collective punishment of civilians 
under occupation is categorically prohibited: &#8220;No protected person may be punished for an 
offence he or she has not personally committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures of 
intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited.&#8221; The International Committee of the Red Cross has 
clarified in its authoritative commentary on article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention that &#8220;the 
concept of collective punishment must be understood in the broadest sense: it covers not only 
legal sentences but sanctions and harassment of any sort&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>29. The blockade of Gaza by Israel was recently condemned by the international community 
and humanitarian agencies as constituting collective punishment. On 19 February 2008, the 
Secretary-General stated that it was vital that Israel cease actions of collective punishment and 
allow all legitimate and necessary humanitarian and commercial supplies to reach the 
population.<b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>30. The negative effects on the enjoyment of human rights resulting from the Israeli closure of 
Gaza were in some cases exacerbated by actions by other parties. On 7 February, at least 
10 trucks with humanitarian aid sent to the Gaza Strip by the Jordanian Red Crescent Society 
were confiscated by Hamas security forces allegedly because the aid was addressed to the rival

<p><b>B.  Violence against the civilian population 
</b></p>
<p><b>Background 
</b></p>
<p>31. Israeli security forces continued military incursions into Gaza and the West Bank 
throughout 2007. According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 
392 Palestinians were killed in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory (91 in the West Bank, 301 in Gaza); in addition, 1,180 Palestinians were injured in the 
West Bank and 661 in the Gaza Strip. During the same period, 13 Israelis were killed and 
322 injured. The Office also reported that, from mid-June to 25 December, 632 Qassam rockets 
and 921 mortar shells were fired from Gaza.<b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>32. In January 2008, the situation escalated: as at midday 22 January, as hostilities continued, 
around 70 Palestinians and 1 Ecuadorian kibbutz worker had been reported killed, 23 on 15 
and 16 January alone. On 15 and 16 January, in Gaza, five Palestinian civilians were killed 
during operations of the Israeli army and another three died when an Israeli aircraft fired a 
missile at their car, an incident that Israel declared was a mistake. On 18 January, a Palestinian 
civilian woman was killed and around 30 civilians injured, including several children, when an 
Israeli air strike targeted an empty building of the Ministry of the Interior. Israeli military 
operations also continued in the West Bank. From the beginning of the year until midday 22 
January, Palestinian militants fired around 230 mortar shells and 110 rockets into the northern 
Negev, including the cities of Sderot and Ashkelon. 
</p>
<p><b>Operations of Palestinian militants during the period from 24 January 
to 24 February 2008 
</b></p>
<p>33. During the reporting period, one Israeli was killed due to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
On 4 February, a suicide bomb attack took place in a shopping mall in the southern Israeli city of 
Dimona; one civilian woman was killed and several other people sustained injuries. While 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>14
</b>  A similar incident took place on 10 February in the West Bank, when Palestinian security 
</p>
<p>forces prevented the distribution of humanitarian assistance through a civil society organization 
allegedly affiliated to Hamas. At least in this last case, the humanitarian agency was able to 
negotiate with Palestinian Authority officials the release of the goods and the resumption of 
distribution to its beneficiaries.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>condemned by the Palestinian Authority, a number of Palestinian factions hailed the attack 
and responsibility for the bombing was claimed by various Palestinian military groups.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>34. At the time of writing, reliable statistics had not been published for the period 
from 24 January to 24 February 2008. It is however estimated that Palestinian militants fired 
hundreds of mortar shells and around 210 rockets, the majority of which of the <i>Qassam</i> type, 
into the western Negev, including the cities of Sderot and Ashkelon. Though most of the rocket 
and mortar attacks carried out by Palestinian militants were indiscriminate, some of the 
short-distance mortar shells reportedly targeted Israeli military installations or personnel located 
just across the border. Some 10 Israelis sustained injuries as a result of rockets and mortar shells 
fired by Palestinian militants and many Israeli residents of Sderot and the western Negev, 
including children, suffered from shock. On 8 and 9 February, more than 40 rockets were fired at 
the western Negev. One of the rockets landed in central Sderot, seriously injuring two brothers, 
one of whom, an eight-year old boy, lost a limb in the attack. 
</p>
<p>35. The firing of rockets and mortars by Palestinian militants against Israeli civilian targets is a 
clear violation of international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b>Israeli military operations during the period from 24 January to 24 February 2008 
</b></p>
<p>36. During the reporting period, Israeli security forces conducted at least 9 military incursions 
into Gaza and 106 into various locations of the West Bank. 
</p>
<p>37. Some 41 Palestinians, including two children, were reportedly killed due to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a decrease when compared to the first three weeks of 2008. 
</p>
<p>38. The number of wounded also decreased; approximately 88 Palestinians, 
including 12 children and 11 women, were injured as result of operations by Israeli security 
forces in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. 
</p>
<p>39. Palestinian human rights organizations documented several cases of Israeli military 
operations that resulted in the death of civilians. On 7 February, an Israeli ground-to-ground 
missile landed in the courtyard of an agricultural school in Beit Hanoun in the Gaza Strip. The 
missile hit the structure when teachers and students were entering the school; one teacher was 
killed and two students were injured. An Israeli human rights organization called for an 
investigation into the death on 7 February of a mentally disabled Palestinian man who had been 
wounded by the Israeli Defence Forces during an arrest operation in the West Bank town of 
Qabatiya. According to Palestinian health sources, on 17 February, a civilian was killed and 
several others were injured during clashes between Palestinian militants and undercover troops 
of the Israeli Defence Forces backed by aircraft and tanks in the southern Gaza Strip. On 
18 February, a 10-year old boy was shot and killed during armed clashes between Palestinian 
militants and the Israeli Defence Forces near Deir el-Balah, inside the Gaza Strip.

</b>  The armed wing of Hamas claimed responsibility for a Palestinian suicide bombing. The 
</p>
<p>Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine also claimed 
responsibility for the attack. <i>Haaretz</i>, 4 February 2008. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>40. The Israeli policy of targeted killings of Palestinian militants and security personnel 
continued. According to Palestinian human rights organizations, a total of 18 Palestinian 
militants and security personnel were killed while they were not directly taking part in hostilities; 
of these, 16 were allegedly killed in Gaza and 2 in the West Bank. In different incidents, on 
5 February, seven police officers of the de facto Hamas authorities in Gaza were killed and eight 
others injured when a ground-to-ground missile was fired at their station in Abassan village in 
the Gaza Strip. On 23 February, three Palestinians were killed in an Israeli army missile strike in 
the northern Gaza Strip. No militant group immediately claimed them as members. An Israeli 
army spokesman stated that ground forces had attacked a squad that was on its way to fire mortar 
shells into Israel.<b>17</b> During the reporting period, at least three Palestinian civilians were allegedly 
killed as an indirect result of such operations. 
</p>
<p>41. According to Israeli media sources, the Government of Israel was working towards the 
establishment of a panel to investigate targeted killing operations that involved the death of 
civilians. The same sources reported that that decision was in line with the Israeli High Court 
ruling of December 2006, which called on the Government of Israel to investigate any incident 
leading to the death of civilians, under the condition that the incidents occurred after the date of 
the ruling. In spite of this, the Israeli State Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the Military Advocate 
General recently rejected a request by an Israeli human rights organization to investigate six such 
incidents in the Gaza Strip in the past two years.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>42. With regard to Israeli military operations, it should be noted that, while Israel has a right to 
defend itself, disproportionate use of force is prohibited under international humanitarian law. 
Israel, as the occupying Power, bears a special responsibility under international human rights 
and humanitarian law to protect the civilian population and civilian installations in Gaza. 
</p>
<p><b>Other incidents, including intra-Palestinian violence, during the period from 24 January 
to 24 February 2008 
</b></p>
<p>43. The violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict added to the already critical situation in both 
the Gaza Strip and West Bank that had resulted from the closure imposed by Israel and the 
breakdown of law and order. Several incidents were reported involving unidentified armed 
groups in Gaza. The state of institutions continued to deteriorate, especially in Gaza, as the 
population increasingly relied on informal mechanisms of dispute resolution. Local clans and 
families have formed militias and vigilante squads to protect their affiliates. 
</p>
<p>44. On 3 February, a 16-year-old Palestinian was killed by a stray bullet while he was 
travelling with his father in Gaza City. On 15 February, unidentified militants broke into the 
building of the Young Men&#8217;s Christian Association in the centre of Gaza City. The militants 
damaged the administration office and blew up the library. According to different sources, as at 
mid-February, 23 violent incidents had been recorded during operations by the Palestinian 
security forces against Hamas affiliates in the West Bank. One incident resulted in the death of

<p>one person. On 24 February, Hamas security forces entered the Prisoners Association in Deir 
El Balah, in the Gaza Strip, confiscating official documents and assets. One Palestinian was 
killed during clashes with the Egyptian border police at the Rafah crossing. 
</p>
<p>45. According to a number of witnesses, on 15 February, a powerful blast went off in the home 
of a senior Jihad military leader in Bureij Camp in the Gaza Strip. The militant was killed along 
with his wife, three of his sons and three neighbours. According to an official from the 
Palestinian Ministry of Health, as result of the explosion, at least 40 people were wounded, 12 of 
them critically, including one of the militant&#8217;s daughters. The house was totally destroyed and 
six nearby homes were also badly damaged. The cause of the blast was still undetermined at the 
time of writing. Two Palestinian human rights organizations have called for an investigation into 
the incident. 
</p>
<p>46. On 22 February, a Hamas affiliate died in the custody of the Palestinian intelligence 
service in Ramallah. Members of his family, citing reports from fellow detainees, alleged that he 
had been tortured. The Hamas affiliate had been arrested a week earlier. The Palestinian 
President and the Palestinian Legislative Council announced two separate investigations into the 
death, which came among repeated complaints by Hamas-affiliated detainees of ill-treatment by 
the Palestinian Authority security forces. In a statement published in Palestinian newspapers, the 
Palestinian Authority intelligence service said that the Hamas affiliate had complained of chest 
and abdominal pains and had been examined by a hospital doctor two days before his death. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Situation in the West Bank 
</b></p>
<p>47. The section below focuses on the issue of freedom of movement. Restrictions on the 
movement of Palestinians continued in the West Bank, where measures associated with the 
Wall,<b>19</b> the Israeli checkpoints established within the West Bank and the extended curfews 
severely limited freedom of movement. The route of the Wall, the settlements, the closure 
regime and associated controls severely damaged the social and economic structures of the 
West Bank, contributed to increased aid reliance, poverty and unemployment and had a serious 
impact on the enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the population 
both before and during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p>48. Since 2002, the Government of Israel has been constructing the Wall, which it states is a 
security measure to protect Israeli civilians from Palestinian militant attacks. It consists of 
8-metre-high concrete walls, ditches, trenches, wire fences, patrol roads and barbed wire. The 
Wall does not follow the 1949 armistice line - &#8220;the Green Line&#8221; - but significantly veers 
eastwards into the heart of the West Bank. In January 2008, 57 per cent of the total length of the

</p>
<p><b>19
</b>  As concerns the issue whether to use the term &#8220;wall&#8221;, &#8220;barrier&#8221;, or &#8220;security fence&#8221;, the 
</p>
<p>present report uses &#8220;wall&#8221;, which is the term used by the International Court of Justice, which in 
its advisory opinion stated that &#8220;the &#8216;wall&#8217; in question is a complex construction, so that that term 
cannot be understood in a limited physical sense. However, the other terms used, either by Israel 
(&#8220;fence&#8221;) or by the Secretary-General (&#8220;barrier&#8221;), are no more accurate if understood in the 
physical sense. In this opinion, the Court has therefore chosen to use the terminology employed 
by the General Assembly.&#8221; International Court of Justice advisory opinion, para. 67. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>projected barrier (723 km) was completed. It is estimated that, when the structure is finalized, 
around 80 per cent of it will be inside West Bank territory. This has created closed areas: 
10.1 per cent of West Bank and East Jerusalem land lies between the Wall and the Green Line. 
Once the Wall is completed, a total of 49,400 West Bank Palestinians living in 38 villages will 
be included in these areas. 
</p>
<p>49. Coupled with the difficulty of movement caused by checkpoints and the requirement of 
permits and identity cards, the construction of the Wall in the West Bank affected thousands of 
Palestinians both before and during the reporting period. Owing to the Wall, agricultural land, 
houses, water sources, schools, and health-care clinics that belong to Palestinians had either been 
confiscated or are now out of reach for their owners. 
</p>
<p>50. In its advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice concluded that the Wall severely 
impeded the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to self-determination, and was 
therefore a breach of the obligation of Israel to respect that right.<b>20</b> It also found that the Wall 
deprived a significant number of Palestinians of the freedom to choose their residence and that it 
impeded the liberty of movement of the inhabitants of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.<b>21</b> The 
Wall and its associated regime were also found to impede the exercise by the persons concerned 
of the rights to work, health, education and an adequate standard of living, as proclaimed in the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and in the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. Moreover, the International Court of Justice found a violation of articles 49 
and 53 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. In sum, according to the Court, the Wall gravely 
infringed a number of rights of Palestinians residing in the Occupied Palestinian Territory that 
could not be justified by military exigencies or by the requirements of national security and 
order.<b>22</b> The Court therefore concluded that Israel was obliged to put an end to the violation of its 
international obligations and that it should therefore dismantle the parts of the Wall situated 
within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It also concluded that Israel had the obligation to 
make reparation for the damage caused to all natural and legal persons concerned.<b>23</b> No steps 
towards the fulfilment of these obligations were taken by Israel during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p>51. During the reporting period, over 560 blockages of various sorts prevented ordinary 
Palestinians from enjoying their right to freedom of movement within the West Bank. According 
to a Palestinian human rights organization, on 13 February, the Israeli Defence Forces closed 
dozens of roads and agricultural roads with large boulders and earth barriers. Checkpoints were 
erected or re-established on main roads, especially in the northern West Bank and around 
Nablus. According to the organization, very strict measures were implemented at the 
checkpoints, including banning people under 35 years of age from the northern West Bank from 
moving between governorates, and occasionally inside the same governorate.

</p>
<p>52. On 14 February, international humanitarian organizations reported that the village of 
Beit Ummar in the South Hebron region had been under curfew of the Israeli Defence Forces for 
several days and that the army had declared it a closed military zone. According to the same 
organizations, the Israeli Defence Forces distributed leaflets stating that a week-long curfew was 
to be enforced. Seven streets inside the village were closed off during the curfew, and a store at 
the entrance of the village, adjacent to a military watchtower, was demolished. On the same day, 
a 5-day curfew of the northern West Bank town of Azzoun, near Qalqilyah, came to an end. 
Although town residents were allowed to walk in the streets, roadblocks barring movement to a 
neighbouring Palestinian village and to a major road remained in place. According to 
United Nations sources, the Israeli Defence Forces distributed leaflets in Azzoun threatening 
village residents that, if youngsters did not stop throwing stones at Israeli settler vehicles 
travelling near the village, they would carry out arrests, close the main entrance to the village, 
close the shops and open fire on stone throwers. Following further incidents of stone throwing, 
the Israeli Defence Forces reimposed the curfew for one day on 16 February. On 18 February, 
the main entrance of the village was closed with earth mounds and wires. 
</p>
<p>53. In relation to the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and 
mental health, according to medical sources, on 14 February, a Palestinian woman who was 
refused access to an ambulance at an Israeli checkpoint died in her village in the West Bank. 
Local witnesses said that the husband of the woman pleaded with soldiers at the Jarushiya 
checkpoint near the town of Tulkarem to let his wife get to an ambulance waiting to take her to a 
Palestinian hospital but was ignored. A source of the Israeli Defence Forces said that the soldiers 
at the checkpoint were unaware of the woman&#8217;s circumstances because her family had not 
informed the local military coordination office for humanitarian cases of the ambulance&#8217;s arrival. 
</p>
<p>54. On 27 January, following her recent visit to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief expressed her concern over the fact that 
Muslims and Christians were impeded from worshipping at some of their most holy sites 
because of an elaborate system of permits, visas, checkpoints and the Wall, declaring that the 
intrusive restrictions were disproportionate to their aim and discriminatory and arbitrary in their 
implementation.<b>24</b> In addition to impeding access to places of worship, the restrictions also 
prevented a number of Palestinians from gathering during marriages and funerals, which 
constitute important religious events for both Muslims and Christians. 
</p>
<p>55. In 2007, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination also expressed its 
deep concern at the Wall, checkpoints, restricted roads and permit systems, which targeted a 
particular national or ethnic group, and which have created hardship and have had a highly 
detrimental impact on the enjoyment of human rights by Palestinians, in particular their right to 
freedom of movement, family life, work, education and health.<b>25</b>

</b>  Statement by the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Asma Jahangir,

freedom of access to the holy places that came under its control following the 1967 war; see 
International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Wall, paras. 149-154.

<p>  CERD/C/ISR/CO/13, para. 34. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>In view of the grave and worsening human rights situation in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, the protection of both Palestinian and Israeli civilians requires 
immediate action by all parties and the international community. 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>First, all parties to the conflict should immediately cease all actions violating 
international human rights and humanitarian law.  
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>Second, Israel, the Palestinian Authority</b> <b>and the de facto Government of the Gaza 
Strip under the effective control of Hamas should establish accountability mechanisms 
providing for law-based, independent, transparent and accessible investigations of alleged 
breaches of international human rights and humanitarian law in accordance with their 
respective obligations. Such investigations must hold perpetrators to account and provide 
redress to victims where violations of law are found to have occurred. Existing mechanisms 
which lack impartiality, accessibility or transparency should be replaced by accountability 
mechanisms that meet international standards. In order to bring about a change in 
approach in the use of force, and thus ensure compliance with international law, such an 
effective system of accountability, the inclusion of personal accountability where 
negligence, recklessness or intent is established is indispensable. Such investigations should 
be established urgently and without delay, in particular to address allegations of grave 
breaches of international humanitarian law and serious violations of international human 
rights law, such as indiscriminate attacks and incursions, indiscriminate firing of rockets 
or mortars, suicide bombings, targeted killings and torture.  
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>Third, the international community should actively promote the implementation of 
the decisions, resolutions and recommendations of international accountability mechanisms 
such as the Security Council, the International Court of Justice</b> <b>and the United Nations 
human rights mechanisms, including treaty bodies and special rapporteurs.  
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Closure of Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The 1.4 million people of Gaza live under the most abhorrent conditions. The current 
human rights crisis in Gaza is man-made, and urgent action by all parties is required to 
end the closure and the suffering which has resulted from the deprivation of their human 
rights. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>Israel must cease all action violating international human rights and humanitarian 
law obligations and in particular the prohibition of collective punishment. The de facto 
Government in Gaza under the effective control of Hamas should take all measures within 
its power to minimize the negative effects of the siege on the enjoyment of human rights by 
Gazans, and ensure that all action which violates the rights of both Palestinian and Israeli 
civilians ceases, notably the indiscriminate firing of rockets into Israel. The Palestinian 
Authority</b> <b>should take all measures in its power to alleviate the situation. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Peace process 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>Throughout negotiations on final status issues, full account should be taken of 
international legal obligations, as well as General Assembly and Security Council 
resolutions and the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice</b> <b>on the Wall. 
International human rights and humanitarian obligations cannot, as a matter of principle 
and in practice, be subject to political negotiations. The international community should 
take action to ensure that all such standards and decisions are met and implemented.
