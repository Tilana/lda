JUDGMENT

I have reviewed the evidence called on the trial, and I have directed myself in accordance with the summing up I gave the assessors today. I find that the verdict of the assessors was not perverse. It was open to them to reach such a conclusion on the evidence. I accept their verdict.

I therefore find the 1st Accused guilty for 1st and 2nd Count as charged, 2nd Accused on all three Counts as charged, 3rd Accused on all 3 Counts. I convict accordingly, 1st Accused is acquitted only on the 3rd Count.
