(a) Issuer: Devon OEI Operating, L.L.C.
(b) Includes approximately $48 million principal amount of privately placed notes.
(c) Issuer: Devon Energy Corporation.
(d) Per $1,000 principal amount.
(e) The Total Consideration (as defined below) for Maximum Tender Offer Notes (as defined
below) validly tendered prior to or at the Early Tender Date (as defined below) and accepted

inclusive of the Early Tender Payment (as defined below).
Issuer: Devon Financing Company, L.L.C.
(f)
This announcement does not contain the full terms and conditions of the tender offers, which are
contained in the offer to purchase dated August 4, 2016 and the related letter of transmittal and
notice of guaranteed delivery.
The tender offers consist of offers on the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase,
dated August 4, 2016, and the related letter of transmittal and notice of guaranteed delivery (as
they may each be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Tender Offer Documents”),
including the offers to purchase for cash (i) any and all (the “Any and All Tender Offers”) of the
8.250% notes due 2018 and the 6.300% notes due 2019 listed in the first table above (the “Any
and All Notes”), and (ii) up to an aggregate principal amount of the 2.250% notes due 2018, the
7.500% notes due 2027, the 7.875% debentures due 2031, the 7.950% debentures due 2032, the
4.000% notes due 2021 and the 5.600% notes due 2041 listed in the second table above
(collectively, the “Maximum Tender Offer Notes”) that will not result in the aggregate amount that
all holders of Maximum Tender Offer Notes are entitled to receive, excluding accrued and unpaid
interest, for their notes that are validly tendered and accepted for purchase in the tender offers
(each such tender offer, a “Maximum Tender Offer”) to exceed the Aggregate Maximum
Repurchase Amount. The “Aggregate Maximum Repurchase Amount” is $1,200,000,000 less the
aggregate Total Consideration for the Any and All Notes validly tendered and accepted for
purchase in the Any and All Tender Offers. The Company refers investors to the Tender Offer
Documents for the complete terms and conditions of the Any and All Tender Offers and Maximum
Tender Offers.
The Aggregate Maximum Repurchase Amount will not be determined until the aggregate Total
Consideration payable for the Any and All Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase by
the Company in the Any and All Tender Offers is determined. The Any and All Tender Offers will
expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 10, 2016, unless extended or earlier
terminated (such time and date, as the same may be extended, the “Any and All Tender
Expiration Date”). Holders of Any and All Notes must validly tender and not validly withdraw their
Any and All Notes prior to or at the Any and All Tender Expiration Date to be eligible to receive
the Total Consideration.
The Maximum Tender Offers will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on August 31, 2016,
unless extended or earlier terminated (such date and time, as the same may be extended, the
“Maximum Tender Expiration Date”). Holders of Maximum Tender Offer Notes must validly tender
and not validly withdraw their Maximum Tender Offer Notes prior to or at 5:00 p.m., New York
City time, on August 17, 2016, unless extended or earlier terminated (such date and time, as the
same may be extended, the “Early Tender Date”) to be eligible to receive the Total
Consideration, which is inclusive of an amount in cash equal to the amounts set forth in the
second table above under the heading “Early Tender Payment” (the “Early Tender Payment”).
Holders of Maximum Tender Offer Notes who validly tender their Maximum Tender Offer Notes
after the Early Tender Date but prior to or at the Maximum Tender Expiration Date will be eligible
to receive an amount equal to the Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Payment (the
“Late Tender Offer Consideration”). The Early Tender Payment is not applicable to the Any and
All Tender Offers.
All Maximum Tender Offer Notes tendered prior to or at the Early Tender Date will have priority
over Maximum Tender Offer Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date. Subject to applicable
law, the Company may increase or decrease any Aggregate Maximum Repurchase Amount in its
sole discretion.
Any and All Notes may be validly withdrawn at any time prior to or at 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on August 10, 2016, unless such date and time is extended or earlier terminated by the
Company, but not thereafter. Maximum Tender Offer Notes may be validly withdrawn at any time
prior to or at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 17, 2016, unless such date and time is
extended or earlier terminated by the Company, but not thereafter.

The “Total Consideration” for each $1,000 principal amount of each series of Securities validly
tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the applicable tender offers will be determined
in the manner described in the Tender Offer Documents by reference to a fixed spread specified
for such Securities (the “Fixed Spread”) specified in the tables above plus the yield to maturity
based on the bid-side price of the applicable U.S. Treasury Reference Security specified in the
tables above at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 10, 2016, in the case of the Any and All
Tender Offers, and at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 18, 2016, in the case of the
Maximum Tender Offers, in each case unless extended or earlier terminated.
Holders will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on Securities validly tendered and
accepted for purchase from the applicable last interest payment date up to, but not including, the
date the Company makes payment for such Securities, which date is anticipated to be (i) August
11, 2016 (the “Any and All Settlement Date”), in the case of the Any and All Tender Offers, (ii)
August 19, 2016 (the “Maximum Tender Early Settlement Date”), in the case of the Maximum
Tender Offer Notes tendered prior to or at the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase
pursuant to a Maximum Tender Offer, and (iii) September 1, 2016 (the “Maximum Tender Final
Settlement Date” and together with the Any and All Settlement Date and the Maximum Tender
Early Settlement Date, the “Settlement Dates”), in the case of the Maximum Tender Offer Notes
tendered after the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Maximum
Tender Offer. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company intends to make payment on Any and All
Notes tendered by the guaranteed delivery procedures on August 15, 2016, but accrued interest
will cease to accrue on the Any and All Settlement Date for all Any and All Notes accepted in the
Any and All Tender Offers, including those tendered by the guaranteed delivery procedures.
Devon Energy will fund the tender offers with the net proceeds from previously completed asset
sales and financing transactions. The tender offers are being made to reduce the Company’s
outstanding debt, including the debt of its subsidiaries.
The tender offers are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions specified in the
Tender Offer Documents but the tender offers are not subject to minimum tender conditions.
Following the completion of the tender offers, the Company or its affiliates may purchase
additional Securities in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through tender or
exchange offers, or otherwise, or the applicable issuer may redeem Securities that the issuer is
permitted to redeem pursuant to their terms. The Company is not obligated to redeem any
Securities that are not tendered and accepted in the tender offers.
