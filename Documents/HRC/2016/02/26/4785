the protection of and assistance to internally displaced persons, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Commends</i> the Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights 
of internally displaced persons for the activities undertaken to date, for the catalytic role

medication or shelter, and issues pertinent during their reintegration, including, in
