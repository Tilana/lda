MISCELLANEOUS JURISDICTION

MISCELLANEOUS ACTION NO: HAM0002 OF 2004S

STATE

v.

SENITIKI ROQARA

Hearing: 30th January 2004
Ruling: 30th January 2004

Mr. B. Solanki for State
Respondent - In Person

RULING

The State applies for leave to appeal out of time. The Respondent objects but in the course of objection he says that his plea was equivocal. It seems to me that it is in his interests that I consider the nature of the plea in an appeal.

Further a probation order for a series of robbery with violence convictions is so unusual that the State has shown that there are merits in the appeal. Finally the appeal is only slightly out of time.

Leave granted. Appeal to be filed by 6/2/04 and to take normal course.
