<p><b>  Mission to the United Arab Emirates</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance visited the United Arab 
Emirates (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Ras Al Khaimah) from 4 to 8 October 2009. 
 At the end of his visit, the Special Rapporteur concluded that the United Arab 
Emirates is a unique country where non-nationals represent the vast majority of the 
population and where nationals are a minority in their own country. In the last decades, the 
influx of foreign workers which has significantly contributed to the building of the country, 
has also created tremendous challenges for the Emirati society, in terms of national identity, 
social integration and capacity for absorption. While the Government has taken 
commendable initiatives in recent years to address some of the numerous challenges, the 
Special Rapporteur believes that much remains to be done in terms of legislation, policies 
and their effective implementation, as well as in terms of human rights education. 
</p>
<p> In this report, the Special Rapporteur addresses issues related to the definition of the 
Emirati national identity and the granting of citizenship; the living and working conditions 
of unskilled foreign workers, in particular construction and domestic workers; the 
vulnerable situation of stateless persons; human trafficking; the educational policy; and the 
legal and institutional human rights framework to fight racism, racial discrimination,

<p>xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur formulates several recommendations, including the 
following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; He recommends the holding of a public debate on the question of the definition of 
national identity. This debate could be held by the Federal National Council and 
could be complemented by a more open setting allowing Emirati citizens and 
members of foreign communities to convey their concerns in a constructive manner. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; He recommends that valid applications for citizenship by individuals who have 
lawfully lived in the country for a certain period of time be reviewed and processed 
by the authorities in a non-discriminatory manner.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; In the context of global economic crisis, he urges the Government to take necessary 
steps, including legislative ones, to address issues relating to, inter alia, the severe 
risk of exploitation of unskilled foreign workers under the sponsorship system, the 
confiscation of their passports, the prohibition to constitute trade unions and their 
contracted debts with labour recruitment agencies. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; He recommends that priority be given to finding a definitive and equitable solution 
to the situation of stateless individuals in order to ensure that they have adequate 
access to health, education, social services and employment, and that they receive 
non-discriminatory treatment with regard to administrative procedures and the 
administration of justice.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; He recommends that the Government reconsider its actual educational policy, so as 
to ensure that public educational institutions are de facto open to all children, 
including non-nationals.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; He recommends that the constitutional provisions restricting certain human rights to 
Emirati nationals be revised so as to extend human rights protection to all 
individuals residing in the country, including non-nationals.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance visited the United Arab 
Emirates (Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah) from 4 to 8 October 2009. He held 
meetings with authorities from the executive, legislative and judicial branches. Given the 
federal structure of the United Arab Emirates and the scope of competences of the 
Emirates, the Special Rapporteur conducted meetings both at the federal and Emirates 
level. A list of official meetings held during the visit is contained in the annex. 
</p>
<p>2. Apart from the agenda with the Government and State institutions, the Special 
Rapporteur also had meetings with representatives of civil society, including community 
members, academics and other organizations and individuals.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his sincere gratitude to the Government of 
the United Arab Emirates for its cooperation and openness throughout the visit. He also 
wishes to convey his deep appreciation to all representatives of civil society that cooperated 
with him throughout the visit. The Special Rapporteur was particularly honoured to be the 
first special procedures mandate holder invited to visit the country. He hopes that many 
more special procedures will follow after his visit and the one undertaken by the Special 
Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography in October 
</p><p>2009.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General background 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political structure 
</b></p>
<p>4. The United Arab Emirates was established in 1971 as a federal State consisting of 
seven Emirates: Abu Dhabi (capital), Dubai, Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, Ajman, Umm al-
Qiwain and Fujairah. The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates stipulates that the 
Federation exercises its sovereignty inside the international borders of the member 
Emirates, while the member Emirates exercise their sovereignty over all matters for which 
the Federation does not have competence under the Constitution. Islam is the official 
religion and Arabic is the official language. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Demographic and ethnic composition 
</b></p>
<p>5. Based on information from the Federal National Council Committee of Foreign 
Workers and the Ministry of Labour, the total population residing in the United Arab 
Emirates, including nationals and non-nationals, is currently estimated around 6 million. 
Among foreign nationals, Indians would constitute the largest group (29.2 per cent), 
followed by Pakistanis (20.8 per cent) and Bangladeshis (8.3 per cent). Members of other 
Asian communities, including China, the Philippines, Thailand, Korea, Afghanistan and 
Iran would make up approximately 16.6 per cent of the total population. Expatriates from 
Europe, Australia, North Africa, Africa and Latin America would make up 8.3 per cent of 
the overall population. More detailed and precise figures should be available following the 
general census due to be held in April 2010.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12576 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>6. According to the official figures provided in 2006 by the United Arab Emirates,1 
more than 65 per cent of the population live in the Emirates of Abu Dhabi and Dubai and 
the Emirati nationals account for approximately 21 per cent of the population. The Special 
Rapporteur notes however that, according to the aforementioned figures and some of his 
interlocutor&#8217;s views, the Emirati nationals may in reality account for less than 17 per cent 
of the total population residing in the country.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that the United Arab Emirates is 
therefore a unique country where non-nationals constitute the vast majority of the 
population and where nationals represent a minority in their own country. The influx of 
foreign workers, which has been supported by the Government to satisfy the demands of a 
fast-growing economy in the last three decades, has deeply modified the demographic 
balance within society. With more than 180 nationalities represented on its soil, the United 
Arab Emirates has undoubtedly become one of the most culturally diverse countries on 
earth.  
</p>
<p><b> C. International human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>8. At the international level, the United Arab Emirates is a State party to the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. The United Arab Emirates is however neither a 
party to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families, nor to the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights and to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>9. The United Arab Emirates has ratified a number of fundamental International 
Labour Organization conventions, including Conventions No. 29 (1930) concerning Forced 
or Compulsory Labour; No. 100 (1951) concerning Equal Remuneration for Men and 
Women; No. 105 (1957) concerning the Abolition of Forced Labour; No. 111 (1958) 
concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation; No. 138 (1973) 
concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment and No. 182 (1999) concerning 
the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child 
Labour. However, the United Arab Emirates has not ratified the fundamental International 
Labour Organization Conventions No. 87 (1948) concerning the Freedom of Association 
and Protection of the Right to Organise and No. 98 (1949) concerning the Right to Organise 
and to Bargain Collectively.  
</p>
<p>10. According to the recent report submitted by the United Arab Emirates to the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination,2 the Constitution makes it clear 
that a treaty which has been ratified pursuant to a federal decree and published in the 
Official Gazette carries the force of law and has the status of a State law, if the decree on 
accession, or ratification, provides that the treaty shall enter into force on the date of 
publication in the Official Gazette. In this way, the treaty becomes a State law which the 
Cabinet and relevant minister are bound to enforce.

</p>
<p><b> D. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with authorities from the executive, 
legislative and judiciary branches, both at the federal and Emirates level, in order to obtain 
their views concerning racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in 
the United Arab Emirates, the adequacy of the existing legal and institutional human rights 
framework and the programmes and policies adopted by the authorities to fight these 
problems. Additionally, meetings with representatives of civil society were organized. 
</p>
<p>12. In order to assess the main challenges that lie ahead in the fight against racism and 
xenophobia in the United Arab Emirates, the Special Rapporteur brought to the attention of 
the authorities some key concerns expressed by representatives of civil society. He also 
relied on concluding observations and recommendations made by the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Universal Periodic Review of the Human 
Rights Council. In this regard, he aimed to better understand the Government&#8217;s responses to 
those challenges and, in addition, how it identified existing problems and devised solutions 
thereto. The conclusions and recommendations in this report are based on these rich 
exchanges with United Arab Emirates-based interlocutors and the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
own analysis. He hopes that they will contribute to finding concrete ways and means of 
addressing the challenges raised in this report in an effective and human rights-compliant 
manner.  
</p>
<p>13. Chapter III of this report examines the legal and institutional human rights 
framework of the United Arab Emirates to combat racism. Chapter IV addresses a number 
of key issues in the fight against racism, presenting the views shared with the Special 
Rapporteur both by government officials and civil society. Finally, the conclusions and 
recommendations of the Special Rapporteur are presented in chapter V.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and institutional human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Constitutional provisions 
</b></p>
<p>14. Parts two and three of the Constitution of the United Arab Emirates contain 
provisions of particular relevance to the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. These include 
article 14 which states that &#8220;Equality, social justice, ensuring safety and security and 
equality of opportunity for all citizens shall be the pillars of the society&#8221;; article 25 which 
prescribes that &#8220;All persons are equal before the law, and there shall be no discrimination 
among citizens of the Federation on grounds of origin, ethnicity, religious belief or social 
status&#8221;; and article 40 which affirms that &#8220;Foreigners in the Federation enjoy the rights and 
freedoms recognized in the applicable international covenants, treaties and conventions to 
which the Federation is a party and incur the corresponding obligations.&#8221; In addition, other 
human rights relating to, inter alia, education, medical care, employment, freedom of 
movement, freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of assembly, prohibition of forced 
labour, are also guaranteed by the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>15. While expressing his appreciation that a range of human rights are protected by the 
Constitution, the Special Rapporteur is concerned by the fact that some fundamental human 
rights are granted to Emirati citizens, but not to non-citizens residing on the United Arab 
Emirates territory. For instance, the above-mentioned articles 14 and 25 specifically refer to 
rights granted to Emirati citizens. In addition, article 19 stipulates that &#8220;Medical care and 
means of prevention and treatment of diseases and epidemics shall be ensured by the 
community for all citizens&#8221;; article 26 prescribes that &#8220;Personal freedom is guaranteed to all 
citizens&#8221;; article 29 states that &#8220;Freedom of movement and residence is guaranteed to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12576 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>citizens, subject to the limits laid down by law&#8221;; and according to article 34, &#8220;Every citizen 
is free to choose his own occupation, profession or trade, subject to the limits laid down by 
law and having due regard for the legislation regulating certain professions and trades.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>16. International human rights law makes it clear that only a limited number of rights 
may be made dependent on citizenship, including the right to enter and reside permanently 
within the territory of a State and the right to be protected by the State when one is outside 
its territory. Moreover, in its general recommendation No. 30 (2004) on discrimination 
against non-citizens, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination recalled 
that although some rights, such as the rights to participate in elections, to vote and to stand 
for election, may be confined to citizens, human rights are, in principle, to be enjoyed by all 
persons. Differential treatment based on citizenship or immigration status will therefore 
constitute discrimination if the criteria for such differentiation are not applied pursuant to a 
legitimate aim, and are not proportional to the achievement of this aim.  
</p>
<p>17. Consequently and in line with the recent concluding observations of the Committee 
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination,3 the Special Rapporteur would like to strongly 
recommend that the aforementioned constitutional provisions relating to, inter alia, safety, 
security, equality of opportunity, medical care, non-discrimination before the law, personal 
freedom, freedom of movement as well as the right to chose one&#8217;s occupation, trade or 
profession, be equally guaranteed to non-citizens. It is indeed of crucial importance in a 
country like the United Arab Emirates where non-citizens represent the vast majority of the 
population, that all individuals enjoy the same human rights without discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Specific legislation prohibiting racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p>18. While the Constitution contains provisions referring to the human rights principles 
of equality and non-discrimination,4 the Special Rapporteur was informed during his 
mission that there is no specific legislation prohibiting racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance in the United Arab Emirates. The Government 
conveyed its views that existing legislation, including the Federal Act No. 2 of 2008 
concerning public welfare associations and institutions and the Federal Printing and 
Publications Act No. 15 of 1980, were sufficient to prevent and combat racism. In response 
to questions raised by the Special Rapporteur, the Government nonetheless alluded to the 
possibility to compile in the future all relevant provisions and to enact one consolidated 
legislative act relating to racism. There are however no concrete proposals being currently 
discussed by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>19. In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to refer to paragraph 68 of the 
Durban Programme of Action which urges States &#8220;to adopt and implement, or strengthen, 
national legislation and administrative measures that expressly and specifically counter 
racism and prohibit racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, whether 
direct or indirect, in all spheres of public life, in accordance with their obligations under the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>20. In addition, the Special Rapporteur would like to recall that in accordance with 
article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, States parties &#8220;[s]hall declare an offence punishable by law all 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 See CERD/C/UAE/CO/17, para. 11. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 These principles, which are embodied in articles 14 and 25 of the Constitution, seem nonetheless to 
</p>
<p>apply only to citizens of the United Arab Emirates.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.10-12576 
</p>
<p>dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial 
discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or 
group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance 
to racist activities, including the financing thereof&#8221;. States parties shall also &#8220;declare illegal 
and prohibit organizations, and also organized and all other propaganda activities, which 
promote and incite racial discrimination, and shall recognize participation in such 
organizations or activities as an offence punishable by law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>21. In conformity with the above-mentioned human rights standards, the Special 
Rapporteur is of the view that the Government should consider adopting a specific 
legislative act on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. The 
specific law on human trafficking5 adopted by the Government in 2006 constitutes a good 
example in that regard. The benefits of a single legislative act include specific reporting, 
reviewing and enforcement mechanisms, as well as specific funding, which usually allows 
for more effective policies against racism. The enactment of a single legislative act also 
clearly demonstrates the State&#8217;s political commitment in the fight against racism. Moreover, 
it allows enhanced visibility and accessibility of the law for civil society, thereby enabling 
individuals to resort to the law in an easier and more effective manner.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Institutional human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>22. While there exists at present no national human rights institution in the United Arab 
Emirates, the Special Rapporteur was encouraged to learn that since December 2008 the 
Government had taken steps to implement voluntary commitments and recommendations 
made in the framework of the Universal Periodic Review. These include the initiation of a 
study on human rights institutions in various countries to help the United Arab Emirates 
establish its own national institution, in line with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p>23. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur was particularly impressed by the human 
rights strategy designed by the Dubai Community Authority Development, which is 
responsible for setting up and developing frameworks for social development in Dubai. 
This governmental institution, which aims at reaching out to all individuals within the 
society, including non-nationals residing in Dubai, will most probably help raise awareness 
about human rights and instil a human rights culture in Dubai. Therefore, the Special 
Rapporteur very much hopes that such a local institution could be turned in the near future 
into a full-fledged and Paris Principles-compatible national human rights institution 
covering all seven Emirates with an oversight mandate, including the monitoring of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  
</p>
<p>24. In the aftermath of his mission, the Special Rapporteur was informed about the plans 
in Dubai to build a human rights village consisting of five domes addressing different 
human rights issues and which should be accessible to all. He very much welcomes this 
initiative which will help raise awareness and educate people about human rights.

<p>GE.10-12576 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b> IV. Main challenges in the fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. National identity and the granting of citizenship 
</b></p>
<p>25. The United Arab Emirates is today one of the largest recipient countries of foreign 
workers and has as such become one of the most multicultural countries on earth. It is 
therefore a unique country where nationals are a numerical minority in their own country. 
The influx of foreign workers, which has been encouraged by the Government to satisfy the 
demands of a fast-growing economy, has significantly contributed to the building of a 
prosperous country. Yet, it has also created tremendous challenges for the Emirati society 
in terms of national identity, social integration and capacity for absorption.  
</p>
<p>26. Throughout the mission of the Special Rapporteur, the question of the definition and 
preservation of Emirati national identity was often put forward. There are indeed serious 
concerns among Emirati citizens that this significant influx of foreign workers, both skilled 
and unskilled, has somehow altered the national identity of the country. Emirati citizens are 
of the view that the immigration policy ought to be controlled more firmly in order to allow 
for a better selection of people entering the country and above all to preserve the main 
features of the Emirati society, which were sometimes referred to as Arab and Islamic. 
Fears were expressed that the country may one day be taken over by foreign workers, in 
particular by Indians and Pakistanis, who constitute approximately 50 per cent of the total 
population. In addition, there was also resentment expressed against Western expatriates 
who are granted most managerial posts and are therefore better remunerated than Emirati 
citizens.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur believes that these concerns, if unaddressed in a timely and 
open manner by the Government, could alter the peaceful coexistence of the great variety of 
ethnic and national groups residing in the country. This could indeed lead to generalized 
resentment against foreigners in the United Arab Emirates and thus to overt xenophobic 
attitudes.  
</p>
<p>28. This question has links to, inter alia, the granting of citizenship and related rights. 
While the granting of citizenship and the privileges attached thereto remain within the 
domestic jurisdiction of each State, it is always desirable that a clear, consistent and 
transparent policy be put in place. In addition, bearing in mind that human rights are, in 
principle, to be enjoyed by all persons, a fair and just balance should be reached between 
rights conferred to nationals and those conferred to non-nationals. At present, given the fact 
that non-citizens are allowed to reside in the United Arab Emirates only if they are in 
possession of a valid contract of employment, some individuals have found themselves in a 
vulnerable situation upon loss of employment, in spite of the fact that they were born and 
raised in the United Arab Emirates. In addition, it would appear that persons who have 
lawfully lived in the country for fairly long periods of time have nonetheless been unable to 
qualify for Emirati citizenship. Among some of them, it was felt that not belonging to the 
ethnic group of the majority of nationals of the United Arab Emirates or not adhering to the 
official religion was a distinct disadvantage preventing them from obtaining citizenship.  
</p>
<p>29. Given the unique nature of the United Arab Emirates, the Special Rapporteur is of 
the view that the current policy on the granting of citizenship and related rights ought to be 
reconsidered in line with relevant international law, so as to ensure non-discrimination on 
the grounds of race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin. As reaffirmed by the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in its general recommendation No. 
30 (2004), States parties should &#8220;ensure that particular groups of non-citizens are not </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> GE.10-12576 
</p>
<p>discriminated against with regard to citizenship or naturalization, and to pay due attention 
to possible barriers to naturalization that may exist for long-term or permanent residents&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>30. Moreover, upon reception of reports indicating that the policy on the granting of 
citizenship differs significantly according to the Emirate in which the individuals reside, the 
Special Rapporteur would like to call for a full harmonization of the policy in this area in 
the seven Emirates. While there is of course no easy solution to these delicate issues, it is 
more than ever urgent and necessary to hold an open debate on the definition of the national 
identity, as well as on the granting of citizenship and related rights.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Construction and domestic workers 
</b></p>
<p>31. The rationale of the free market economy in the United Arab Emirates has to a large 
extent determined the employment areas in which certain foreign communities work and 
has therefore determined their social status. The Special Rapporteur was for instance 
informed that a large majority of construction workers come from South Asia. He was also 
told that most domestic workers usually come from South Asia, South-East Asia, and also 
from certain African countries. Managerial positions are however most often held by 
Western expatriates. This has led to a situation where wages and other benefits of 
employment mirror the national or ethnic origin of each individual. It was for instance 
alleged that a maid from the Philippines would earn more than a maid from Ethiopia or Sri 
Lanka, who would in turn earn more than a Bangladeshi maid.  
</p>
<p>32. While these economic differences between national or ethnic groups do not stem 
from a deliberate governmental policy, some representatives of civil society are nonetheless 
of the view that this economic differentiation is backed up by a range of practices affecting 
particular groups among unskilled foreign workers and therefore affecting particular ethnic 
or national groups. Thus, during the preparatory stages of his mission, the Special 
Rapporteur received numerous allegations of human rights abuses and violations suffered 
by unskilled foreign workers, in particular by construction and domestic workers who 
constitute the large majority within this category.  
</p><p>33. While the mandate of the Special Rapporteur does not specifically relate to foreign 
workers, it is nonetheless concerned with discrimination on the grounds of colour, descent, 
national or ethnic origin preventing individuals to enjoy, inter alia, the right to equal 
treatment before the tribunals and all other organs administering justice; the right to leave 
any country, including one&#8217;s own, and to return to one&#8217;s country; the rights to work, to free 
choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work, to protection against 
unemployment, to equal pay for equal work, to just and favourable remuneration; the right 
to form and join trade unions; the right to housing; as well as the right to public health, 
medical care, social security and social services. As a consequence, the living and working 
conditions of construction and domestic workers, which constituted major issues of concern 
during the Universal Periodic Review and the examination of the seventeenth periodic 
report submitted by the United Arab Emirates to the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination, were also raised in nearly all meetings held by the Special 
Rapporteur during his mission. 
</p>
<p>34. Virtually all the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors, including governmental officials 
and representatives of civil society, suggested that the situation had much improved in 
recent years. The Special Rapporteur was indeed provided with numerous examples of 
commendable initiatives taken by the Government in order to address the manifold and 
long-standing human rights violations suffered by construction and domestic workers in 
their daily life. These include the setting up of accessible channels for foreign workers to 
submit complaints to the Ministry of Labour; language and financial assistance to file 
lawsuits in court; the setting up of the &#8220;Wages Protection System&#8221; enabling private sector </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12576 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>institutions to pay workers&#8217; wages via banks and allowing the Ministry of Labour to verify 
the timely and full payment of wages; the increasing number of inspections and follow-up 
visits carried out at labour and accommodation sites; the enhancement of transportation 
means for workers between their accommodation and working sites; as well as the 
introduction in April 2007 of a standard employment contract for domestic workers.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur also would like to welcome the enactment of Ministerial 
resolution No. 335 of 2008 which states that labourers should not stay under the sun during 
the hottest hours in July and August; working hours for labourers should not exceed eight 
working hours daily; working sites should provide cold drinking water and juices, cooling 
devices, shades protecting from the sun, as well as first aid kits; and that companies 
breaking Ministerial resolution No. 335 shall be penalized.6 
</p>
<p>36. In addition, the Special Rapporteur would like to highlight the adoption of a 
&#8220;Manual of the General Criteria for the Workers&#8217; Accommodations&#8221; by the Federal Council 
of Ministers in its Decision No. 13 of 2009. The manual includes a set of standards to be 
applied in the next five years by employers in accommodation complexes and should 
therefore support the ongoing enhancement of housing conditions for construction workers. 
In this context, the Special Rapporteur very much welcomes the near completion of the 
sewage system in Sonapur (Dubai), as well as the plans to build a sewage system to ease 
the growing sewage problems in the industrial area of Al Qoz (Dubai) which have caused 
health hazards to some of the 150,000 workers living there.  
</p>
<p>37. Yet the Special Rapporteur would like to recall that construction and domestic 
workers still face a number of significant difficulties. These include the sponsorship or 
&#8220;kafala&#8221; system which places foreign workers, in particular those who are unskilled, in a 
highly dependent relationship vis-&#224;-vis their employer and at severe risk of exploitation. 
Indeed, at present, foreign workers&#8217; legal ability to enter, live and work in the United Arab 
Emirates depends on a single employer. This system makes it extremely difficult for 
foreign workers to escape from this dependency after entering the country or beginning 
employment. Although foreign workers are entitled to transfer their contracts to another 
company if they file a lawsuit against their employer or if their wages are not paid on time, 
in practice, it seems complicated to do so.  
</p>
<p>38. The withholding of passports is another issue of concern since it prevents the 
enjoyment of one&#8217;s right to leave any country, including one&#8217;s own, and to return to one&#8217;s 
country. Despite the fact that it was officially acknowledged as an illegal practice,7 the 
confiscation of passports of unskilled foreign workers continues to be widely resorted to by 
employers in order to prevent workers from absconding, to ensure that they cannot change 
employers and to obstruct them from filing a complaint. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed that in fact the system of sponsorship described above gives employers incentives 
to confiscate passports since the employers may be fined if their workers are discovered 
working for other employers.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur also received reports indicating that unskilled foreign 
workers were afraid to form trade unions or to go on strike due to the risk of being fired or 
deported.8 There are indeed no specific domestic laws protecting the right of workers to 
organize and to bargain collectively or to freedom of association. There are therefore no

<p>

 It must be noted that some of the provisions of Ministerial resolution No. 335 were already included

</p>
<p>trade unions or other independent entities defending workers&#8217; rights and as a result, the 
Government and the private sector are the sole entities deciding on labour-related issues.  
</p>
<p>40. Another issue raised by representatives of civil society related to the contracted 
debts with labour recruitment agencies in the countries of origin, which often compel 
unskilled foreign workers to work for months or years simply to pay off their loans. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn about the conclusion of several 
Memoranda of Understanding with countries of origin of foreign workers. These include 
pilot projects where workers are followed-up in the various stages of their moves between 
the country of origin and the United Arab Emirates.  
</p>
<p>41. The questions of physical assaults and verbal abuse against domestic workers, as 
well as excessive hours of work, lack of pay and days of rest, were also often put forward. 
In addition, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention was drawn to the fact that domestic workers 
cannot benefit from legal protection, since they are explicitly excluded from Federal Law 
No. 8 of 1980 on regulation of labour relations.9 He was also told that policies regarding 
domestic workers differ in each Emirate; while in some Emirates, it is compulsory to have 
domestic workers insured and provided with a contract of employment,10 other Emirates are 
allegedly more lenient in this regard.  
</p>
<p>42. While the Special Rapporteur received assurances from several Ministries that the 
aforementioned issues are under serious consideration and review by the relevant 
authorities, he would strongly urge the Government, particularly in the context of the global 
economic crisis which puts construction and domestic workers in a situation of enhanced 
vulnerability, to act swiftly to ensure that their rights are protected. In this regard, he 
particularly welcomes the efforts being made to draft and debate new labour legislation and 
hopes that a new legislation offering enhanced protection will enter into force as soon as 
possible. Similarly, the Special Rapporteur was encouraged to learn that the Ministry of 
Interior was working on a draft legislation concerning domestic workers. He recommends 
that the Government continue to enhance the effective implementation of existing laws 
related to the treatment of unskilled foreign workers. 
</p>
<p>43. In addition to the above, the Special Rapporteur would like to encourage the 
Government to take into account the fact that foreign workers, including construction and 
domestic workers, referred to as &#8220;temporary contractual workers&#8221; &#8212; and not as &#8220;migrant 
workers&#8221; &#8212; by all government officials, often remain in the country for many years, if not 
decades. Thus, in order to foster a stable and inclusive society where everyone can 
contribute to the building of the United Arab Emirates, the Special Rapporteur believes that 
a more secure and durable relationship ought to be cultivated between foreign workers and 
their host country.

 According to article 3 of Federal Law No. 8 of 1980 on regulation of labour relations, &#8220;The

 In its seventeenth periodic report to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the 
</p>
<p>United Arab Emirates announced the introduction of a standard employment contract for domestic 
workers and persons of similar status, which entered into effect on 1 April 2007. Accordingly, this 
contract &#8220;regulates the work of persons in these categories based on the nature of the work and tasks 
undertaken, granting these workers the right to adequate rest breaks and medical treatment and care in 
accordance with the health regulations in force in the State. Wages are set by agreement between the 
two parties&#8221;. See CERD/C/ARE/12-17, paragraphs 132&#8211;134. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12576 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p><b> C.  Stateless persons 
</b></p>
<p>44. The situation of stateless persons or &#8220;Bidoons&#8221;, as they are commonly called in the 
United Arab Emirates, was raised in previous interactions between the Government and 
United Nations bodies and mechanisms. It was also often raised by the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors throughout his visit, thereby indicating that this issue continues 
to raise significant human rights concerns.  
</p>
<p>45. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur noted that the definition of the term 
&#8220;Bidoons&#8221; seemed to vary according to his interlocutors. Indeed, while &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; was 
sometimes referred to as a generic term including all persons without identification 
documents, it was also used in a narrower sense to only refer to persons who had been 
residing on the territory of the United Arab Emirates before independence in 1971 but had 
never obtained proper identification documents since then. Some interlocutors also used the 
term &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; to refer to people who had arrived after 1971 from neighbouring countries 
without identification documents during the Islamic revolution in Iran or the Iran-Iraq war. 
Following meetings held with &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; living in the United Arab Emirates, the Special 
Rapporteur understood that the term &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; actually includes Arabic-speaking 
individuals without recognized identification documents who have a genuine feeling of 
belonging to the United Arab Emirates, either because they were born on its territory before 
or after 1971, or because they had been raised on its soil and had no feeling of belonging to 
any other country.  
</p>
<p>46. Although his official interlocutors seemed to suggest that &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; do not carry 
any proper identification documents with them, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
emphasize that the &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; he met during his mission are actually in possession of 
passports. These passports, which clearly indicate that the concerned individuals were born 
on the territory of the United Arab Emirates, were issued by one of the seven Emirates, 
before the Federation was formed in 1971. These passports had been renewed by local 
authorities &#8212; each Emirate could reportedly still issue national passports until 2003 &#8212; a 
number of times following the independence in 1971. However, at some point, the 
authorities ceased doing so, thereby leaving these individuals in a vulnerable status of 
statelessness.  
</p>
<p>47. In the first years following independence in 1971, the situation of &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; seemed 
relatively unproblematic. It has however become a matter of great concern since the Emirati 
nationals have found themselves to be a minority in their own country and that the granting 
of citizenship has become a sensitive issue due to the privileges attached thereto.11 Indeed, 
the Special Rapporteur was informed that due to their statelessness, &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; suffer 
significant discrimination with regard to, inter alia, access to health, education and social 
services, employment, administrative procedures, as well as the administration of justice. 
The level of socio-economic discrimination seems however to vary significantly according 
to the Emirate in which the &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; reside.  
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur was for instance informed of a case where a stateless 
pregnant woman was refused entry into a public hospital, due to the fact that she did not 
possess a valid health card. Whereas health cards delivered to &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; used to be valid 
for four years and could be renewed without too much difficulty, their validity has now 
been reduced to one year only and the authorities sometimes allegedly refuse to renew 
them. Another case which was reported relates to the refusal by a public school to accept a 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11
  Emirati citizens are entitled to free land, free education, free health care, subsidized food and 
</p>
<p>gasoline, no-interest home loans for married Emirati male citizens, as well as up to US$ 19,000 for 
their wedding costs.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> GE.10-12576 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bidoon&#8221; child, although all his siblings had been previously allowed access to the same 
school. The school administration allegedly argued that they could not accept &#8220;Bidoon&#8221; 
children anymore. The Special Rapporteur also received reports indicating that &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; 
are prohibited from working in the federal administration. They can indeed only obtain 
low-level positions in local administrations, where they earn as much as 10 times less than 
their Emirati colleagues holding similar positions. Moreover, &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; cannot receive 
social aid by the Ministry of Social Affairs, since only Emirati citizens and foreign workers 
residing in the country with their families12 can benefit from it. &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; would at present 
also appear to be refused issuance of civil registration documents, such as birth, marriage 
and death certificates, as well as driving licences. The Special Rapporteur was also 
informed about the fact that &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; often get harsher sentences than other offenders for 
the same kind of crimes. 
</p>
<p>49. Some &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; have tried to obtain citizenship for many years, if not decades. In 
spite of the fact that they were born on the territory of the United Arab Emirates and that 
they have never lived in any other country, they still have not been granted citizenship. 
Instead, the authorities have allegedly suggested that they go to the Comoros, obtain the 
Comorian nationality and then return to live legally in the United Arab Emirates with their 
newly acquired Comorian nationality. Among the &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; who have not been granted 
citizenship, it was felt that the naturalization of stateless individuals who are perceived as 
Persians, for instance, was more difficult than for those individuals perceived as belonging 
to the ethnic group of the majority of nationals of the United Arab Emirates (see the 
discussion above on the granting of citizenship, paragraphs 28&#8211;30).  
</p><p>50. The Special Rapporteur was nonetheless encouraged to learn about initiatives taken 
by the Government to deal with the situation of &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; living in the United Arab 
Emirates. As such, he welcomes the adoption of Ministerial Decision No. 167 of October 
2006 which requested the conduct of a census of persons entitled to nationality and thereby 
triggered the start of a registration process resulting in the naturalization of 1,294 stateless 
individuals.13 The setting up in September 2008 of a special committee on the status of 
stateless persons which is to assess the case of every &#8220;Bidoon&#8221; and provide citizenship for 
those who are eligible also resulted in the naturalization of 51 stateless individuals. 
According to information received until May 2009, 1,500 &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; have now had their 
situation regularized.  
</p>
<p>51. While the efforts made by the Government to regularize the situation of &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; 
should be commended, much remains to be done, in particular when reports indicate that 
discrimination against &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; has increased in the last years. According to figures used 
by the Government, 8,500 cases are still pending. However, the Special Rapporteur noted a 
significant discrepancy between official figures and those quoted by representatives of civil 
society, concerning the total number of &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; residing in the United Arab Emirates. 
While government officials estimate that there are approximately 10,000 &#8220;Bidoons&#8221;, 
representatives of civil society are of the view that there are at least 100,000 &#8220;Bidoons&#8221;, if 
not more, thereby implying that more than 85,000 individuals still remain in a vulnerable 
status of statelessness. According to government officials, the reasons for this discrepancy 
stems from the fact that many people try to obtain the privileges and benefits attached to 
Emirati citizenship and therefore abuse the authorities by pretending that they are 
&#8220;Bidoons&#8221;, although they may be citizens of a neighbouring country. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>12
  Unskilled foreign workers (see discussion above, paragraphs 31&#8211;43) do not belong to the category of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;foreign workers residing in the country with their families&#8221;; they indeed come to the United Arab 
Emirates unaccompanied by their families, due to their inability to provide means of subsistence to 
their families.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>13
  See CERD/C/ARE/12-17, paragraph 98. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12576 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>52. While recognizing that there may be cases of abuses which impede the process of 
identification of &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; who are entitled to citizenship, the Special Rapporteur takes the 
view that more efforts are needed from the Government to ensure that due process of law is 
accorded to stateless individuals. He would like to recall that the right to a nationality is a 
fundamental human right which is proclaimed in unequivocal terms by the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and which should be guaranteed without discrimination on 
the grounds of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, in accordance with the 
International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Moreover, as stated 
by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in its general comment No. 
30 (2004), States parties should &#8220;take into consideration that in some cases denial of 
citizenship for long-term permanent residents could result in creating disadvantages for 
them in access to employment and social benefits, in violation of the Convention&#8217;s anti-
discrimination principles&#8221;. It is as such necessary to examine and swiftly process the 
applications for citizenship which have been pending for years and sometimes decades, in 
order to protect these individuals from further discrimination.  
</p>
<p>53. In addition to the above, the Special Rapporteur was informed about the 
impossibility for Emirati women married to foreign nationals to pass their nationality to 
their children14 and about the reservations made by the United Arab Emirates to article 9 of 
the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women15 and to article 7 of 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child.16 As a result, children born to Emirati women 
and foreign nationals may become stateless when the father cannot pass it to his children 
under the legislation of his country or when the father is unwilling or unable to register 
children with his national authorities because there is no accessible diplomatic 
representation or because he has died or separated from the rest of the family before doing 
so. Furthermore, despite article 2 (d) of Federal Law No. 17 of 1972 concerning nationality 
and passports which prescribes that &#8220;A child born in the State or abroad to a national 
mother by law and of unknown father or stateless&#8221; is deemed a citizen by law, some of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s interlocutors indicated that in reality when Emirati women marry 
stateless individuals, their children become stateless and may thus be subject to 
discriminatory acts.  
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur would like to refer to article 7 of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child which prescribes that &#8220;The child shall be registered immediately after 
birth and shall have [&#8230;] the right to acquire a nationality&#8221; and that States parties &#8220;shall 
ensure the implementation of these rights in accordance with their national law and their 
obligations under the relevant international instruments in this field, in particular where the 
child would otherwise be stateless&#8221;. Article 8 of the same Convention also states that 
&#8220;States parties undertake to respect the right of the child to preserve his or her identity, 
including nationality, name and family relations as recognized by law without unlawful 
interference&#8221;. Consequently and in line with the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination&#8217;s assertion that States parties should &#8220;reduce statelessness, in particular 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>14
  In accordance with article 2 (c) of the Federal Law No. 17 of 1972 concerning nationality and 
</p>
<p>passports, &#8220;Shall be deemed a citizen by law [&#8230;] (c) a child born in the State or abroad to a national 
mother by law and whose affiliation to the father is not legally established&#8221;. This implies that a child 
born in the State or abroad to a national mother by law and whose affiliation to the father is legally 
established cannot be deemed a citizen by law.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>15
  Article 9 of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women grants women equal 
</p>
<p>rights with men with respect to nationality of their children. Considering the acquisition of nationality 
an internal matter which is governed by national legislation, the United Arab Emirates made a 
reservation and does not consider itself bound by this article.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16
  The United Arab Emirates is of the view that the acquisition of nationality is an internal matter, and 
</p>
<p>one that is regulated and whose terms and conditions are established by national legislation. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.10-12576 
</p>
<p>statelessness among children, by, for example, encouraging their parents to apply for 
citizenship on their behalf and allowing both parents to transmit their citizenship to their 
children&#8221;,17 the Special Rapporteur would like to recommend that the Government consider 
amending the legislation, so that Emirati women are able to pass their nationality to their 
children. He also recommends that the Government review its practice with regard to the 
implementation of the Federal Law No. 17 of 1972 concerning nationality and passports, so 
as to prevent that children born to Emirati women and stateless men become stateless and 
thereby subject to discrimination. Moreover, he calls upon the United Arab Emirates to 
withdraw its reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women and to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p><b> D.  Human trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>55. Another issue of concern raised during the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission relates to 
human trafficking. The victims of human trafficking into the United Arab Emirates come 
from foreign countries, mainly from Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. This problem 
therefore presents an international challenge and the Special Rapporteur would like to 
highlight the complex nexus between gender and ethnic origin. All the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
interlocutors were in agreement that the victims of human trafficking, who are women and 
girls in virtually all cases, suffer grave human rights violations and are among the most 
vulnerable individuals in this society.  
</p>
<p>56. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur was impressed by the initiatives taken by the 
Government to address this issue and to rehabilitate women and girls who have been 
trafficked into the country. The Federal Law No. 51 of 2006 on combating human 
trafficking crimes, which provides the legal basis to the National Committee on Human 
Trafficking, is a welcome step to combat this phenomenon. Likewise, the setting up of 
shelters both by the Government and other individuals or organizations for women and 
children victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation is extremely helpful to 
provide them with suitable accommodation, social, legal, psychological, medical, 
educational and vocational support.  
</p>
<p>57. While significant efforts have been undertaken since 2006 to counter human 
trafficking, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that much remains to be done in order to 
bring to justice those responsible for such criminal activities. Moreover, he would like to 
emphasize that a clear distinction ought to be made between women who engage 
voluntarily in prostitution &#8212; which is prohibited by law in the United Arab Emirates &#8212; 
and those who are trafficked into the country, so that the latter may not be treated as 
criminals, but rather as victims, when caught by law enforcement officials. Consequently, 
the Special Rapporteur would like to encourage the Government to continue treating human 
trafficking as a matter of priority and keep in constant review the legal and administrative 
measures necessary to eradicate this scourge.  
</p>
<p><b> E.  Education 
</b></p>
<p>58. Education is undoubtedly one of the most efficient tools to create a cohesive and 
tolerant society, where all children may be taught, and experience for themselves, how 
diverse ethnic, national or religious groups can coexist in a peaceful manner. As such, the 
public school system should reflect and promote the social and cultural diversity existing in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>17
  See Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination&#8217;s general recommendation No. 30 (2004) 
</p>
<p>on discrimination against non-citizens. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12576 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>the country. The Special Rapporteur strongly believes that the future of all societies will be 
determined in schools. It is therefore of utmost importance that policies concerning access 
to public school are designed in a way to instil a long-lasting and genuine mentality of 
understanding and respect towards cultural diversity and equal opportunities for all in any 
society.  
</p>
<p>59. Although most foreign workers who live in the United Arab Emirates are 
unaccompanied by their families, there remains a significant number of them residing in the 
country with their families. This has created tremendous challenges to the Emirati public 
education system, both in terms of capacity of absorption and social integration. In view of 
the inability of the public education system to absorb the large number of foreigners and the 
language barrier, the Special Rapporteur was informed by government officials that foreign 
communities have the right to establish their schools with their own curriculum. The 
government officials explained that given the temporary nature of foreigners&#8217; stay in the 
United Arab Emirates, these private schools allow foreign children to quickly readapt to 
their national education system when they return to their respective countries of origin.  
</p>
<p>60. In most cases, these private schools are established with the support of the 
Government providing foreign communities with land and other subsidies allowing for their 
construction and maintenance. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the generous support 
provided to foreign communities&#8217; schools and acknowledges that these private schools 
enable foreign communities to maintain a strong link with their countries of origin. He also 
understands the fact that a large majority of parents prefer sending their children to their 
communities&#8217; schools, so that the children can speak and study in their native language. 
</p>
<p>61. As a result of the educational policy described above, Emirati children, and other 
Arabic-speaking children whose parents work in the public sector, are enrolled in the public 
school system, whereas all other foreign children are enrolled in their respective 
communities&#8217; schools, without much permeability between these two parallel school 
systems. While the Special Rapporteur was informed that there exists no legislation 
specifically prohibiting the access to public schools for foreign children who do not speak 
Arabic, he received reports indicating that it is de facto impossible for them to join the 
public education system. The Special Rapporteur believes that such educational policies are 
hampering effective social integration of foreigners into Emirati society. These policies also 
reflect the authorities&#8217; views that foreigners do not come to the United Arab Emirates to 
have a new home and start a new life, but that they rather come to work for a few years, 
before returning to their respective countries of origin.  
</p>
<p>62. Although the Special Rapporteur recognizes that at present there may not be 
numerous requests from non-Arabic speaking parents to send their children to Emirati 
public schools, he nonetheless would like to recommend the authorities to open up the 
public education system to non-Arabic speaking foreigners, as done by the Emirati 
Universities about a decade ago. Indeed, whereas the Universities used to be reserved for 
Emirati citizens, they now accept foreign students, thereby facilitating close interaction 
between Emirati and foreign students. In a similar manner and in line with general 
recommendation No. 30 (2004) of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination which states that States parties should &#8220;ensure that educational institutions 
are open to non-citizens&#8221;, the Special Rapporteur would like to recommend that the 
authorities reconsider the current educational policies, so as to offer the choice to foreign 
children who do not speak Arabic to integrate into the public school system.  
</p>
<p><b> V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The United Arab Emirates is a unique country where non-nationals represent 
the vast majority of the population. The influx of foreign workers which has </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> GE.10-12576 
</p>
<p><b>significantly contributed to the building of the country has also created tremendous 
challenges for Emirati society, in terms of national identity, social integration and 
capacity for absorption. While the Government has taken commendable initiatives in 
recent years to address some of these numerous challenges, much remains to be done 
in terms of legislation, policies and their effective implementation, as well as in terms 
of human rights education and awareness-raising. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to make the following recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  On national identity and the granting of citizenship 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>The Special Rapporteur is of the view that a public debate on the question of 
the definition of national identity might help defuse tensions and ensure the peaceful 
coexistence of the great variety of ethnic and national groups residing in the country. 
This debate could be held by the Federal National Council and could be 
complemented by a more open setting (public conference or seminar) allowing 
Emirati citizens to convey their concerns and find equitable solutions to this 
important issue. Members of foreign communities who constitute the great majority of 
the population in the country should also be invited to contribute constructively in 
such a public debate.  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>While the granting of citizenship and the rights and privileges attached thereto 
remain within the domestic jurisdiction of each State, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government reconsider its current policy on the granting of 
citizenship in line with international law. In addition, bearing in mind that human 
rights are, in principle, to be enjoyed by all persons, a fair and just balance should be 
reached between rights conferred to nationals and those conferred to non-nationals. It 
is also necessary to ensure that valid applications for citizenship by individuals who 
have lawfully lived in the United Arab Emirates for a certain period of time be 
reviewed and processed in a non-discriminatory manner. The policy in this area ought 
to be fully harmonized in all seven Emirates, so that individuals are guaranteed equal 
treatment in the whole country when applying for citizenship.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  On construction and domestic workers 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The Special Rapporteur was told by virtually all his interlocutors that the living 
and working conditions of unskilled foreign workers had much improved in recent 
years thanks to commendable initiatives taken by the Government. Nonetheless, the 
Special Rapporteur believes that significant efforts are still needed to remedy the 
manifold and long-standing human rights violations suffered by unskilled foreign 
workers, including construction and domestic workers. In the context of the global 
economic crisis, he urges the Government to take necessary steps, including legislative 
ones, to address issues relating to, inter alia, the severe risk of exploitation of unskilled 
foreign workers under the sponsorship system, the confiscation of their passports, the 
prohibition to constitute trade unions and their contracted debts with labour 
recruitment agencies. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn about steps undertaken to review 
Federal Law No. 8 of 1980 on regulation of labour relations. He recommends that the 
proposed draft amendments be publicly circulated &#8212; as was done in February 2007 
&#8212; so that relevant stakeholders, including civil society representatives, may convey 
their suggestions to the authorities about the draft law. Once adopted, the Special 
Rapporteur hopes that the effective implementation of the revised law will offer 
enhanced protection to all workers. In particular, he recommends that the revised law 
include provisions aiming at protecting the right to establish trade unions, in 
accordance with international human rights standards.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12576 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>While the Special Rapporteur was encouraged to learn about initiatives aiming 
to protect domestic workers, such as the introduction of a model contract, he strongly 
recommends the Government to regulate the work of domestic workers with a new 
specific legislation that provides no less protection than that provided in Federal Law 
No. 8 of 1980 on regulation of labour relations and which is in conformity with human 
rights standards or to extend protection of the existing Federal Law No. 8 of 1980.  
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>In line with general recommendation No. 30 (2004) of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government take necessary steps to address xenophobic attitudes and behaviour 
towards non-citizens and to promote a better understanding of the principle of non-
discrimination in respect of the situation of non-citizens. Such steps could include 
awareness-raising campaigns underlining the positive contribution to the building of 
the United Arab Emirates by foreign workers, in particular by unskilled ones. This 
could also help foster a more secure and durable relationship between foreign 
workers, who often remain in the United Arab Emirates for decades, and their host 
country.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  On stateless individuals 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The situation of stateless individuals or &#8220;Bidoons&#8221;, as they are commonly called 
in the United Arab Emirates, was a matter of great concern throughout the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s mission. While recognizing that recent initiatives have been launched by 
the Government in order to regularize the status of approximately 1,500 &#8220;Bidoons&#8221;, 
the Special Rapporteur expresses his grave concerns at the high number of &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; 
who still remain in a vulnerable status of statelessness. He therefore recommends that 
priority be given to finding a definitive, humane and equitable solution to the situation 
of &#8220;Bidoons&#8221; in order to ensure that their human rights are protected and that they 
have adequate access to health, education, social services and to employment, and that 
they receive non-discriminatory treatment with regard to administrative procedures 
and the administration of justice.  
</b>71. <b>The Special Rapporteur also emphasizes that the right to a nationality is a 
fundamental human right which should be guaranteed without discrimination on the 
grounds of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. Consequently, he 
recommends that the Government examine and swiftly process the applications for 
citizenship by stateless individuals which have in some cases been pending for years, if 
not decades. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Concerning the impossibility for Emirati women married to foreign nationals 
to pass their nationality to their children, the Special Rapporteur recommends that 
the Government consider reviewing its legislation in order to prevent that these 
children become stateless in some cases. He also recommends the Government to 
review its practice with regard to implementation of article 2 (d) of Federal Law No. 
17 of 1972 concerning nationality and passports so as to prevent the perpetuation of 
statelessness from generation to generation. In addition, he recommends that the 
reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
and to the Convention on the Rights of the Child be withdrawn. </b> 
</p>
<p><b>  On human trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government continue its efforts 
in the fight against human trafficking, in particular by bringing to justice those 
involved in such criminal activities. He also recommends that all necessary measures 
be taken by the Government in order to ensure that victims of human trafficking are </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/14/43/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.10-12576 
</p>
<p><b>identified as such and therefore not treated as criminals when caught by law 
enforcement officials.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  On education 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Taking into account the fact that education is one of the most efficient tools to 
create a cohesive, inclusive and tolerant society, where the positive contribution of 
diversity can be taught, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government 
reconsider its current educational policy, so as to ensure that public educational 
institutions are de facto open to all children, including to non-nationals.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  On the legal and institutional framework to fight racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>Due to the United Arab Emirates federal structure and the large measure of 
independence left to each Emirate, the Special Rapporteur believes that one of the key 
challenges for the implementation of anti-racism commitments in the United Arab 
Emirates is to successfully involve the Emirates, where the locus of political power 
often lies. Despite the commitments on human rights at the federal level, it is at the 
level of the Emirates that the fight against racism and xenophobia, as well as the 
effective implementation of anti-discrimination provisions, takes place. The Special 
Rapporteur therefore believes that it is necessary to ensure that local authorities are 
aware of federal human rights commitments. He also recommends that all related 
laws and policies be harmonized in the country, so as to ensure that all individuals are 
treated in a non-discriminatory manner and offered equal human rights protection in 
the seven Emirates.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>In light of general recommendation No. 30 (2004) of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination and of its recent concluding observations 
(CERD/C/UAE/CO/17, para. 11), the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
constitutional provisions restricting certain human rights to Emirati nationals be 
revised so as to extend human rights protection to all individuals residing in the 
United Arab Emirates, including non-nationals.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>As stated by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in its 
recent concluding observations (CERD/C/UAE/CO/17, para. 12), &#8220;racial 
discrimination or the potential for racial discrimination exists in all societies&#8221;. Thus, 
while taking into account that provisions relating to the principles of equality and 
non-discrimination do exist in various domestic legislative acts, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends the Government to adopt a specific legislation on racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, which would clearly 
demonstrate the State&#8217;s political commitment in the fight against racism and allow for 
enhanced visibility and accessibility of the law for civil society, thereby enabling 
individuals to resort to the relevant provisions in an easier and more effective manner.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>In order to strengthen the existing institutional human rights framework, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government establish a national human 
rights institution with a robust oversight mandate, including the monitoring of racism, 
racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. Such a national human 
rights institution may help to contribute to awareness-raising on human rights 
challenges in the United Arab Emirates.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur also recommends that the United Arab Emirates 
accede to core international human rights instruments that contain provisions 
reaffirming the fundamental human rights principles of non-discrimination and 
equality. These include the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural </b></p>
