</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
</p>
<p>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Geneva Conventions 
</p>
<p>of 12 August 1949 and the Protocols Additional thereto of 1977, and other relevant instruments 
</p>
<p>of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, as well as the Vienna 
</p>
<p>Declaration and Programme of Action,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing </i>the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of civil, 
</p>
<p>political, economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> article 32 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 
</p>
<p>and Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, which recognizes the 
</p>
<p>right of families to know the fate of their relatives, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> that article 33 of Additional Protocol I provides that the parties to an armed 
</p>
<p>conflict shall search for the persons who have been reported missing, as soon as circumstances 
</p>
<p>permit,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>further</i> the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
</p>
<p>Enforced Disappearance, adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 61/177, in which 
</p>
<p>article 24 (2) sets out the right of victims to know the truth regarding the circumstances of the 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearance, the progress and results of the investigation and the fate of the 
</p>
<p>disappeared person, and sets forth State party obligations to take appropriate measures in this 
</p>
<p>regard, and the preamble reaffirms the right to freedom to seek, receive and impart information 
</p>
<p>to that end,  
</p>
<p><i> Taking</i> <i>into account</i> resolution 2005/66 of the Commission on Human Rights and Council 
</p>
<p>decision 2/105 on the right to the truth,  </p>

<p>                                                
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>the reports of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights on the right to the truth (E/CN.4/2006/91, A/HRC/5/7) and its significant 
</p>
<p>conclusions related to the right to know the truth about gross violations of human rights and 
</p>
<p>serious violations of international humanitarian law,  
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that adequate steps to identify victims should also be taken in situations not 
</p>
<p>amounting to armed conflict, especially in cases of massive or systematic violations of 
</p>
<p>human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through 
</p>
<p>action to combat impunity (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/20/Rev.1, annex II) and taking note with 
</p>
<p>appreciation of the updated version of those principles (E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1),  
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> that the Human Rights Committee<b>1</b> and the Working Group on Enforced or 
</p>
<p>Involuntary Disappearances (E/CN.4/1999/62) have recognized the right of the victims of gross 
</p>
<p>violations of human rights and the right of their relatives to the truth about the events that have 
</p>
<p>taken place, including the identification of the perpetrators of the facts that gave rise to such 
</p>
<p>violations,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i>, in cases of gross violations of human rights and serious violations of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law, the need to study the interrelationship between the right to the 
</p>
<p>truth and the right to access to justice, the right to obtain effective remedy and reparation, and 
</p>
<p>other relevant human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> the importance for the international community to endeavour to recognize the 
</p>
<p>right of victims of gross violations of human rights and serious violations of international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law, and their families and society as a whole, to know the truth regarding such 
</p>
<p>violations, to the fullest extent practicable, in particular, the identity of the perpetrators, the 
</p>
<p>causes and facts of such violations, and the circumstances under which they occurred, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing also</i> that it is important for States to provide appropriate and effective 
</p>
<p>mechanisms for society as a whole and, in particular, for relatives of the victims, to know the 
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>Government, within the framework of each State&#8217;s domestic legal system, 
</p>
<p><i> Convinced </i>that States should preserve archives and other evidence concerning gross 
</p>

</p>
<p>effective remedy in accordance with international law,

</p>
<p>other non-judicial mechanisms such as truth and reconciliation commissions, that complement

</p>
<p>humanitarian law, and appreciates the elaboration and publication of the reports and decisions of 
</p>
<p>these bodies; 
</p>
<p> 3.<i> Encourages</i> the States concerned to disseminate, implement and monitor 
</p>
<p>implementation of the recommendations of non-judicial mechanisms such as truth and

</p>
<p>judicial mechanisms; 
</p>
<p> 4.<i> Encourages</i> other States to consider establishing specific judicial mechanisms and, 
</p>
<p>where appropriate, truth and reconciliation commissions to complement the justice system, to 
</p>
<p>investigate and address gross violations of human rights and serious violations of international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law;  </p>

<p>page 4 
 
 5.<i> Encourages</i> States to provide requesting States the necessary and appropriate 
</p>
<p>assistance regarding the right to the truth by means of, among other actions, technical 
</p>
<p>cooperation and exchange of information concerning administrative, legislative and judicial and 
</p>
<p>non-judicial measures, as well as experiences and best practices that have as a purpose the 
</p>
<p>protection, promotion and implementation of this right;  
</p>
<p> 6.<i> Encourages </i>all States that have not done so to consider signing, ratifying or acceding 
</p>
<p>to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; 
</p>
<p> 7.<i> Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
</p>

</p>
<p>practices for the effective implementation of this right, including, in particular, practices relating 
</p>
<p>to archives and records concerning gross violations of human rights with a view to create 
</p>
<p>guidelines on protecting archives and records concerning gross human rights violations, and 
</p>
<p>programmes for the protection of witnesses and other persons involved in trials connected with 
</p>
<p>such violations;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Also requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a report, to be 
</p>
<p>presented to the Council at its fifteenth session, on the use of forensic experts in case of gross 
</p>
<p>violations of human rights with a view to identifying trends and best practices in this regard;

</p>
<p>thirteenth session; 
</p>
