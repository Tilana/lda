mineralization, a geological grid map will be produced to lay out an extensive 'in fill' 
drill program to define a potential mineable ore body. Once an ore body is defined by 
these drill programs, a Feasibility Report will be produced to prepare and perform an 
application to all Nevada regulatory agencies for mining operation permits which will

accepted In the United States of America applicable to a going concern. At April 30, 2011, the
Company has no revenues to date, has accumulated losses of $265,063 since inception of the
exploration stage on May 1. 2006 and a working capital deﬁcit of $376,683 and expects to incur
further losses in the development of its business, all of which cast substantial doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to continue to provide for the
Company‘s capital needs during the year ending April 30. 2012 by issuing debt and equity securities
and by the continued support of its related parties (see Note 3). The ﬁnancial statements do not
include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or
amounts and classiﬁcation of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue in existence. There is no assurance that funding will be available to continue the Company’s
business operations.
Accounting Method
The Company has prepared the accompanying ﬁnancial satements in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for year-end ﬁnancial information using the
accrual method of accountlng. The Company has elected an April 30 year end.

basis. The effect of this action has been reﬂected retroactively in the accompanying ﬁnancial
statements.

(c) Exploratory Costs
Since the Company is deemed to be in the exploration stage. all sampling. metallurgical,
engineering, contractor costs. and efforts to obtain mineral rights have been charged to expense
as incurred.
(d) Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share
The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ACS 260. Earnings per Share,
which requires presentation of both basic and diluted loss per share ("EPS") on the face of the
statement of operations. Basic EPS ls computed by dividing net loss available to common
shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
(denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period including stock options. using the treasury stock method.
convertible preferred stock. and convertible debt, using the if—converted method. In computing
diluted EPS. the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares
assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes
all potentially dilutive common shares if their effect is antidilutive. At April 30. 2011 there were no
potentially dilutive instmments outstanding.
(e) Revenue Recognition
Revenues from the sale of products will be recorded when the product is shipped. title and risk of
loss have transferred to the purchaser. payment terms are ﬁxed or determinable and payment is
reasonably assured Revenues from service contracts will be recognized when performance of
the service Is complete or over the term of the contract.
(f) Foreign Currency Translation
The Company’s ﬁnancial instruments and reporting currency is the United States dollar.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign Currencies are translated in accordance
with A30 830. Foreign Currency Translation Matters. using the exchange rate prevailing at the
balance sheet date. Gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency
denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income.
(9) Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income tax using the asset and liability method in accordance with
A50 740. Income Taxes. The asset and liability method proVIdes that deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the ﬁnancial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and
tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently
enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that Is
believed more likely than not to be realized.

(h) Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the ﬁnancial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current ﬁcts, historical
experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that aie not readily apparent from other sources.
The actual results experience by the Company may diff material and adversely from the
Company's estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and
the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.
(i) Financial Instruments
Pursuant to A80 82°. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures and A50 525, Financial
Instruments, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use
of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value using a hierarchy based on the level of
independent, objective evidence when measuring fair value using a hierarch based on the level
of independent. objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A ﬁnancial
instruments categorization With the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input
that is signiﬁcant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy prioritized the inputs into three
levels that may be used to measure fair value.
Level 1
Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are
observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets With insufﬁcient volume or
infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which signiﬁcant
inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by. observable data.
Level 3
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable Inputs to the valuation
methodology that are signiﬁcant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
The Company's ﬁnancial instmments consist principally of cash, accounts payable, and amounts
due to related parties. The fair value of the Company’s cash equivalents, when applicable, is
determined based on “Level 1" inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets. During the years ended April 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company estimates that
the carrying values of all of its ﬁnancial instruments approximate their fair values due to the
nature or duration of these instruments.

4. Deferred Taxes
Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for
deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred
liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences
between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by the valuation allowances when, in the opinion of management, it Is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are adjusted for the effects of Changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
Net deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of April 30, 2011 and 2010'
April 30, April 30,
2011 201 D
Deferred tax asset: NOL carryover $ 285,000 $ 292,000
Deferred tax liabilities _ _
Valuation allowance (285.000) 292 000)
The income tax provision differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the Canada
corporate and British Columbia corporate Income tax rates of 19% to pretax income from continuing
operations for the years ended April 30, 2011 and 2010 due to the following:
April 30, April 30.
2011 2010
Book loss $ (14,500) $ (17,500)
Valuation allowance 14.500 17 500
$ - $ -
At April 30, 2011. the Company had net operating loss carry fomards of approximately $1,502,500
that may be offset against future taxable income from the year 2012 through 2031. No tax beneﬁt
has been reported in the April 30, 2011 ﬁnancial statements since the potential tax beneﬁt ls offset by
a valuation allowance of the same amount.
The Company has adopted the Income Tax topic ofthe FASB A80 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes Included in the balance at April 30, 2011, are no tax positions for which the ultimate
deductibility is uncertain. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and
penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibillty period would not affect the annual effective tax
rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest accmed related to unrecognized tax beneﬁts in interest
expense and penalties in operating expenses
