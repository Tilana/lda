<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 16/15, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to prepare a study on the 
participation of persons with disabilities in political and public life, in consultation with 
relevant stakeholders, including States, regional organizations, including regional 
integration organizations, United Nations agencies, the Special Rapporteur on disability of 
the Commission for Social Development of the Economic and Social Council, civil society 
organizations, including organizations of persons with disabilities, and national human 
rights institutions. The Council also requested that the study be made available on the 
OHCHR website, in an accessible format, prior to the nineteenth session of the Council. 
</p>
<p>2. OHCHR sent a note verbale to Member States and letters to intergovernmental 
organizations, non-governmental organizations, national human rights institutions, the 
Inter-Parliamentary Union and the Special Rapporteur on disability of the Commission for 
Social Development requesting responses to a set of questions related to the thematic study. 
The questionnaire was also sent to United Nations human rights field presences. The annex 
to the present document contains a full list of respondents. All submissions are available on 
the OHCHR website.1 
</p>
<p><b> II. Political rights: normative content 
</b></p>
<p>3. Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes and 
protects the right of every citizen to take part in the conduct of public affairs, the right to 
vote and to be elected and the right to have access to public service. The list of political 
rights contained in this provision is based on article 21 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights.  
</p>
<p>4 Political rights have also been set down in a number of other international human 
rights conventions, including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Racial Discrimination (art. 5 (c)), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women (arts. 7 and 8) and the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (art. 41). 
At the regional level, political rights have been included, inter alia, in the first Protocol to 
the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 
(art. 3), the American Convention on Human Rights (art. 23) and the African Charter on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights (art. 13). 
</p>
<p>5. In paragraph 1 of its general comment No. 25 (1996) on the right to participate in 
public affairs, voting rights and the right of equal access to public service, the Human 
Rights Committee emphasized that article 25 &#8220;lies at the core of democratic government 
</p>
<p>based on the consent of the people&#8221;. In contrast with other human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms, which are ensured to all individuals within the territory and subject to the 
jurisdiction of the State, most international and regional human rights treaties only 
recognize political rights for &#8220;citizens&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>6. Although only the rights set out in article 25 constitute political rights sensu stricto, 
a number of other rights are of fundamental importance for the democratic decision-making 
process. Broadly speaking, political freedoms &#8211; such as freedom of opinion, expression, 
information, media, assembly and association &#8211; may also be understood as political rights. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 See www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Disability/Pages/StudyPoliticalAndPublicLife.aspx. </p>


<p>Citizens may take part in the conduct of public affairs by exerting influence through public 
debate and dialogue with their representatives or through their capacity to organize 
themselves. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to vote and to be elected 
</b></p>
<p>7. The right to vote is arguably the most important political right. Genuine periodic 
elections are essential to ensure the accountability of representatives for the exercise of the 
legislative or executive powers vested in them. Such elections must be held at intervals 
which are not unduly long and which ensure that the authority of government continues to 
be based on the free expression of the will of electors.  
</p>
<p>8. No citizen can be hindered or restricted de jure or de facto in the enjoyment of 
political rights on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. However, restrictions to 
the exercise of political rights are permissible, provided that they are established by law and 
based on objective and reasonable criteria. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to participate in the conduct of public affairs 
</b></p>
<p>9. Participation in the conduct of public affairs, referred to in article 25 (a) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, is a broad concept that relates to the 
exercise of legislative, executive and administrative powers. It covers all aspects of public 
administration, and the formulation and implementation of policy at international, national, 
regional and local levels. It also covers participation in public debates and peaceful 
demonstrations. The allocation of powers and the means by which individual citizens 
exercise the right to participate in the conduct of public affairs should be established by the 
constitution and other laws.  
</p>
<p>10. The right to participate in the conduct of public affairs can be exercised &#8220;directly or 
through freely chosen representatives&#8221;. Citizens participate directly in the conduct of public 
</p>
<p>affairs when they exercise power as members of legislative or executive bodies, when they 
choose or change their constitution or decide public issues through a referendum or another 
electoral process. Participation through freely chosen representatives is exercised mainly 
through the exercise of voting rights. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to have access to public service 
</b></p>
<p>11. Subparagraph (c) of article 25 deals with the right and the opportunity of citizens to 
have access, on general terms of equality, to public service positions. This provision 
permits farther-reaching restrictions than those allowable for the right to vote and be 
elected. In addition to the &#8220;reasonable&#8221; restrictions permissible for all political rights, 
</p>
<p>access to public service is moreover guaranteed only &#8220;on general terms of equality&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, States parties are not precluded from placing conditions on access to public 
service, such as minimum age, level of education, standard of integrity or special 
qualifications. 
</p>
<p>12. To ensure access on general terms of equality, the criteria and processes for 
appointment, promotion, suspension and dismissal must be objective and reasonable. 
Affirmative measures may be taken in appropriate cases to ensure that there is equal access 
to public service for all citizens. </p>


<p><b> III. Participation in political and public life by persons with 
disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>13. Article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities sets out the 
rights of persons with disabilities in their participation in political and public life. It requires 
that States parties to the Convention guarantee political rights to persons with disabilities 
and adopt all appropriate measures to ensure that they enjoy these rights on an equal basis 
with others.  
</p>
<p>14. This provision encompasses a broad notion of participation in political and public 
life. At one level, it refers to political participation in terms of the right to vote and be 
elected (art. 29 (a)). This right is of crucial importance for ensuring equality of opportunity 
for persons with disabilities and their full and effective participation and inclusion in 
society. Through its exercise, persons with disabilities assert their individual autonomy, 
which includes the freedom to make one&#8217;s own choices, and their right to be recognized as 
persons before the law.  
</p>
<p>15. Under article 29, persons with disabilities have not only the right, but also the 
&#8220;opportunity&#8221; to vote and be elected. This sets up a duty on States parties to guarantee, 
</p>
<p>though the adoption of positive measures, that all eligible persons have the actual 
opportunity to exercise their voting rights. Consequently, it is not enough to extend formal 
voting rights to persons with disabilities; States are also required to ensure that persons with 
disabilities are truly able to make use of their right to vote, for example by making polling 
stations accessible to wheelchair users, facilitating the use of assistive voting devices to 
enable persons with visual impairments to vote independently, or allowing persons with 
disabilities to be assisted in voting by a person of their choice.  
</p>
<p>16. As with all positive obligations to fulfil human rights, States have a margin of 
appreciation in identifying the measures which should be adopted to ensure that persons 
with disabilities have an actual opportunity to participate in the conduct of public affairs of 
their country on an equal basis with others. Where this is not realized, mere passivity on the 
part of the State would, however, constitute a violation of the right of persons with 
disabilities to participate in political and public life on an equal basis with others. 
</p>
<p>17. In broader terms, article 29 (b) requires States parties to the Convention to take 
appropriate steps to promote an enabling environment in which persons with disabilities 
can effectively and fully participate in the conduct of public affairs, without discrimination 
and on an equal basis with others.  
</p>
<p>18. As is the case for article 25 of the Covenant, article 29 does not explain what a full 
and effective participation in &#8220;political and public life&#8221; or &#8220;in the conduct of public affairs&#8221; 
</p>
<p>would entail. However, the ordinary meaning of article 29 leaves no doubt that persons 
with disabilities are entitled to participate in all aspects of political and public life of their 
country. Participation in political and public life is not only an objective in itself, but also a 
prerequisite for the effective enjoyment of other rights. Through involvement in law and 
policy reform in the area of disability, persons with disabilities and their representative 
organizations have the chance to make changes in society and to improve legislation and 
policies in the areas of health, rehabilitation, education, employment, access to goods and 
services, and any other aspect of life. 
</p>
<p>19. In order to facilitate an effective participation of persons with disabilities in the 
conduct of public affairs, article 29 (b) imposes a duty on States to adopt positive measures 
to encourage the active involvement of persons with disabilities in non-governmental 
organizations and associations concerned with public and political life, and in political 
parties, as well as the forming and joining of organizations of persons with disabilities 
(DPOs) at the local, regional, national and international levels.  </p>


<p>20. In its broadest sense, participation is a theme that runs throughout the whole 
Convention. Full and effective participation and inclusion in society are included in the list 
of general principles that guide the interpretation and implementation of the entire 
Convention, cutting across all issues (art. 3 (c)). These concepts mean that society, both in 
its public and in its private dimensions, is organized to enable all people to take part fully in 
all its spheres.  
</p>
<p>21. Being fully included in society means that persons with disabilities are recognized 
and valued as equal participants. Their needs are understood as integral to the social and 
economic order and not identified as &#8220;special&#8221;. To achieve full inclusion, an accessible, 
</p>
<p>barrier-free physical and social environment is necessary. Linked to the concept of 
participation and inclusion is that of universal design, which requires the consideration of 
the needs of all members of society during the design of products, environments, 
programmes and services, so as to ensure that no adaptation or specialized design are 
required later on (art. 2). 
</p>
<p>22. Article 4 of the Convention, which lists the general obligations undertaken by States 
parties to ensure and promote the full realization of all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms by persons with disabilities, includes an obligation to consult and involve persons 
with disabilities and their representative organizations in the development and 
implementation of legislation and policies to implement the Convention, as well as in 
decision-making processes affecting their lives and their full participation and inclusion in 
society (art. 4, para. 3).  
</p>
<p>23. States parties must also ensure that persons with disabilities and their representative 
organizations are involved and participate fully in monitoring the implementation of the 
Convention at the national level (art. 33, para. 3). States are also invited to give due 
consideration to the duty to consult closely and to involve actively persons with disabilities 
in the nomination of experts to the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
(art. 34, para. 3). 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Article 29 and its interdependence with other Convention 
rights 
</b></p>
<p>24. Participation in political and public life is closely related to and dependent upon the 
implementation of other Convention provisions, including: 
</p>
<p> (a) Article 4, para. 1 (b), which requires States parties to take all appropriate 
steps, including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and 
practices that constitute discrimination against persons with disabilities; 
</p>
<p> (b) Article 9, which imposes an obligation to adopt adequate measures to ensure 
that persons with disabilities have access, on an equal basis with others, to information and 
communications, including information and communications technologies and systems; 
</p>
<p> (c) Article 12, which reaffirms the right of persons with disabilities to 
recognition everywhere as persons before the law and to enjoy legal capacity on an equal 
basis with others in all aspects of life;  
</p>
<p> (d) Article 19, which recognizes the right of persons with disabilities to full 
inclusion and participation in their community; 
</p>
<p> (e) Article 21, which calls for the adoption of all appropriate measures to 
facilitate access to information, whether provided through public or private entities, in 
accessible formats, and the use of sign languages, Braille, and other accessible means, </p>


<p>modes and formats of communication in official interactions (for instance, political 
broadcast). 
</p>
<p><b> V. Main issues concerning the effective realization of the rights 
of persons with disabilities to participate in political and 
public life 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Universal suffrage 
</b></p>
<p>25. The concept of universal suffrage lies at the core of modern democracies. It consists 
of the extension of the right to vote to adult citizens (or subjects) as a whole. The first 
movements toward universal suffrage occurred in the early nineteenth century, and focused 
on extending voting rights to all male citizens, regardless of property requirements or other 
measures of wealth. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the focus of the 
universal suffrage movement became the removal of voting restrictions against women. In 
this process, the understanding of democracy changed to such an extent that the exclusion 
of certain groups of individuals based on grounds such as race, colour or sex would 
represent today an obvious violation of the principle of universal suffrage.  
</p>
<p>26. Article 25 (b) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes 
the right of every citizen &#8220;to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall 
</p>
<p>be by universal and equal suffrage&#8221;. A certain contradiction can be seen between the 
</p>
<p>principle of universal &#8211; i.e. unlimited &#8211; suffrage in this provision and the authorization, in 
the chapeau of article 25, to provide for reasonable restrictions (&#8220;without unreasonable 
</p>
<p>restrictions&#8221;).2 However, this incongruence can be explained by the fact that at the time the 
Covenant was adopted, most States viewed restrictions on the right to vote for individuals 
belonging to certain groups or categories &#8211; including aliens, children and juveniles, persons 
lacking legal capacity and convicted criminals &#8211; as not representing a violation of universal 
suffrage.  
</p>
<p>27. In assessing the compatibility of these restrictions with the principle of universal 
suffrage, the Human Rights Committee affirmed that any conditions which apply to the 
exercise of voting rights should be based on &#8220;objective and reasonable criteria&#8221;. It may be 
reasonable, for example, to require a higher age for election or appointment to particular 
offices than for exercising the right to vote, while restrictions of the right to vote on the 
ground of physical disability would constitute a violation of article 25. The Committee also 
held that in its view, &#8220;established mental incapacity may be a ground for denying a person 
the right to vote or to hold office&#8221;.3 
</p>
<p>28. The legal landscape has changed dramatically since the adoption of the Human 
Rights Committee&#8217;s general comment in 1996. Today, it may be argued that the majority of 
voting restrictions &#8220;are no longer compatible with the prohibition of discrimination in 
</p>
<p>articles 2, para. 1, and 25 or with the present-day understanding of democracy&#8221;.4 This holds 
true, in particular, with regard to limitations of the right to vote and stand for election on the 
basis of psychosocial or intellectual disabilities.  
</p>

 3 General comment No. 25, para. 4.   
 4 Nowak, <i>UN Covenant </i>(footnote 2 above), p. 577.  </p>


<p>29. Article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires 
States parties to guarantee to persons with disabilities the equal and effective enjoyment of 
political rights, including the right to vote and be elected. This provision does not foresee 
any reasonable restriction, nor does it allow any exception for any group of persons with 
disabilities. Therefore, any exclusion or restriction of the right to vote on the basis of a 
perceived or actual psychosocial or intellectual disability would constitute &#8220;discrimination 
</p>
<p>on the basis of disability&#8221; within the meaning of article 2 of the Convention.  
</p>
<p>30. It may be argued that such restriction is not based on disability itself, but rather on a 
lack of legal capacity. Such an argument would be, however, inconsistent with the 
provisions of article 12, paragraph 2, of the Convention, which recognizes that persons with 
disabilities enjoy legal capacity &#8220;on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life&#8221;. This 
</p>
<p>provision does not provide any exception. It only requires States parties to take appropriate 
measures &#8220;to provide access by persons with disabilities to the support they may require in 
exercising their legal capacity&#8221; (art. 12, para. 3). Consequently, deprivation of legal 
</p>
<p>capacity based on a perceived or actual mental illness or psychosocial disability may 
constitute a violation of the obligations set out in article 12. 
</p>
<p>31. Recent developments in the jurisprudence of international and regional human rights 
mechanisms and bodies support the argument that restrictions of the right to vote and stand 
for election on the basis of a psychosocial or intellectual disability are not consistent with 
modern human rights standards on disability. 
</p>
<p>32. The European Court of Human Rights has dealt with the issue of automatic 
disenfranchisement of a person with mental health problems in the case <i>Kiss v. Hungary</i>.5 
Diagnosed with manic depression and placed under partial guardianship, the applicant was 
excluded from the electoral register pursuant to the Hungarian Constitution, which contains 
an absolute voting ban for people under guardianship. Relying on article 3 of the first 
Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights (right to free elections), he 
complained that his disenfranchisement constituted an unjustified deprivation of his right to 
vote. The Court could not accept an absolute bar on voting rights applied to any person 
under partial guardianship irrespective of his or her actual faculties. It affirmed that the 
State had to provide weighty reasons when applying a restriction on fundamental rights to a 
particularly vulnerable group in society, such as persons with psychosocial disabilities. The 
Court concluded that the imposition of an automatic, blanket restriction on the franchise of 
those under partial guardianship amounted to a violation of article 3 of the first Protocol. 
</p>
<p>33. The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, Thomas 
Hammarberg, welcomed this &#8220;landmark ruling&#8221;. He noted that the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities stipulates that State authorities &#8220;shall recognize that 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of 
life&#8221;. Noting that the very purpose of the Convention is to promote, protect and ensure the 
</p>
<p>full and equal enjoyment of all human rights by all persons with disabilities, he stated that 
this leaves no room for procedures in which judges or medical practitioners would assess 
the voting competence of a person and then give a green light &#8211; or not. &#8220;As we do not test 
that capability for someone without disabilities, this would amount to blatant 
discrimination&#8221;.6     
</p>
<p>34. On 16 November 2011, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe 
adopted a recommendation on the participation of persons with disabilities in political and 
public life (CM/Rec(2011)14). Building upon the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
</p>
<p>  
 5 European Court of Human Rights, <i>Alajos Kiss v. Hungary</i>, Application No. 38832/06, 20 May 2010.   
 6 Statement by Thomas Hammarberg, &#8220;Persons with disabilities must not be denied the right to vote&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>22 March 2011. Available from https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1763941&amp;Site=COE. </p>


<p>Disabilities, the recommendation calls for European governments to &#8220;ensure that their 
legislation overall does not discriminate against persons with disabilities in political and 
public life&#8221;. It also affirms that &#8220;all persons with disabilities, whether they have physical, 
sensory, or intellectual impairments, mental health problems or chronic illnesses, have the 
right to vote on the same basis as other citizens, and should not be deprived of this right by 
any law limiting their legal capacity, by any judicial or other decision or by any other 
measure based on their disability, cognitive functioning or perceived capacity&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>35. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has dealt with the issue of 
disenfranchisement of persons with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities in its 
concluding observations on the initial reports of Tunisia (CRPD/C/TUN/1) and Spain 
(CRPD/C/ESP/1). With regard to Tunisia, the Committee recommended &#8220;the urgent 
</p>
<p>adoption of legislative measures to ensure that persons with disabilities, including persons 
who are currently under guardianship or trusteeship, can exercise their right to vote and 
participate in public life, on an equal basis with others&#8221; (CRPD/C/TUN/CO/1, para. 35). In 
other words, it called for the reinstatement of the right to vote for persons who are currently 
deprived of their right to vote.  
</p>
<p>36. In its concluding observations on Spain, the Committee made the link between 
deprivation of legal capacity and the right to vote more explicit. It expressed concerns that 
the right to vote of persons with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities can be restricted if 
the person concerned has been deprived of his or her legal capacity, or has been placed in 
an institution. The Committee further noted that this deprivation appeared to be &#8220;the rule 
and not the exception&#8221;, as evidenced by the number of persons with disabilities who have 
</p>
<p>been denied their right to vote in the State party, and regretted &#8220;the lack of information on 
</p>
<p>standards of evidence or grounds, and criteria used by judges when depriving persons of 
their right to vote&#8221; (CRPD/C/ESP/CO/1, para. 47).  
</p>
<p>37. The Committee recommended &#8220;that all relevant legislation be reviewed to ensure 
that all persons with disabilities, regardless of their impairment, legal status or place of 
residence, have the right to vote and participate in public life on an equal basis with others&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>It also requested Spain to amend the law which currently allows the denial of the right to 
vote based on individualized decisions taken by a judge, so as to ensure that all persons 
with disabilities have the right to vote (ibid., para. 48). 
</p>
<p>38. The responses to the questionnaire show that in many countries, the right to political 
participation continues to be linked to the legal capacity of the individual. Some States have 
an automatic or quasi-automatic exclusion provision in their legal systems. They deny the 
right to political participation to all persons under a protective measure, such as a partial 
and plenary guardianship, regardless of their actual and/or individual level of functional 
ability or whether they have an intellectual disability or a mental health problem. In other 
countries, the capacity of persons with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities to vote is 
subject to an individual assessment carried out by a medical practitioner or by a judge of 
the individual&#8217;s actual ability to vote.  
</p>
<p>39. Only a small number of countries have lifted all restrictions on the political 
participation of persons with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities. Austria, for example, 
has lifted all restrictions on the right of persons with disabilities to vote and be elected, and 
persons with psychosocial and intellectual disabilities are allowed to exercise their political 
rights on an equal basis with others.7 Canada has also eliminated legal restrictions at the 
</p>
<p>  
 7  According to article 26, paragraph 5 of the Austrian Constitution, a person can only be deprived of his 
</p>
<p>or her right to vote and to be elected in the case of a criminal conviction. </p>


<p>federal levels, although some restrictions continue to exist at the provincial level.8 In the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Electoral Administration Act 
2006 abolished the common law rule that a person with mental health conditions lacks legal 
capacity to vote.9  
</p>
<p>40. Some countries are currently reviewing their legislation on legal capacity in order to 
ensure its consistency with the provision of article 29. In the Czech Republic, for example, 
the reform of the guardianship system is currently under way and will be introduced in the 
new Civil Code. The Government of Mexico also intends to review its legislation and 
practice on the deprivation of legal capacity so as to ensure that persons with disabilities 
fully enjoy their human rights, including political rights, on an equal basis with others. 
</p>
<p>41. A limited number of countries continue to maintain in their legislation provisions 
that exclude other categories of persons with disabilities from the exercise of the right to 
vote. However, responses to the questionnaire show that these exceptions are progressively 
being lifted as a result of the ratification of the Convention. In Argentina, for example, Law 
No. 26.571 of December 2009 has abrogated the provision of the National Electoral Code 
that excluded illiterate deaf persons from the exercise of the right to vote. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to stand for elections and to effectively hold office 
</b></p>
<p>42. As is the case for the right to vote, in many countries the right to be a candidate in 
elections continues to be linked to the legal capacity of the individual. Consequently, 
persons under full or partial legal guardianship lose both the right to vote and the right to be 
elected. Such exceptions are usually based on decisions taken by a court of law declaring 
that the person is unable, in view of his or her mental conditions, to understand the nature 
and significance of his or her action. In some cases, a person under guardianship cannot be 
a candidate in elections, even if he or she may exercise the right to vote. In France, for 
example, persons under guardianship or curatorship retain, in principle, the full enjoyment 
of the right to vote, but cannot exercise any elective function (art. L200 of the Electoral 
Code).  
</p>
<p>43. These limitations reflect an outdated and discriminatory approach to persons with 
disabilities and their role in society which is inconsistent with the obligations arising from 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Unlike article 25 of the 
Covenant, article 29 does not mention any permissible ground for excluding or restricting 
the exercise, on an equal basis with others, of the right of persons with disabilities to stand 
as candidates in political elections. Therefore, any such restriction would constitute a 
violation of articles 2, 12 and 29 of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>44. The replies to the questionnaire show that only in a limited number of countries can 
persons with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities participate as candidates in elections 
on an equal basis with others. In the United Kingdom, for example, there are no restrictions 
on the right of persons with disabilities to be elected.10 
</p>
<p>  
 8 In Quebec, for example, persons under curatorship cannot vote or run for office in provincial, 
</p>
<p>municipal and school elections.  
 9 Persons with mental health conditions are eligible to vote, including those in psychiatric hospitals, 
</p>
<p>unless they have been detained under certain sections of the Mental Health Act 1983 and are therefore 
unable to understand the voting procedure or are convicted criminal offenders.  
</p>
<p> 10 In February 2011, the Government announced its intention to repeal Section 141 of the Mental Health 
Act 1983 which set the process by which Members of Parliament were required to vacate their seats if 
they had a mental health condition and were authorized to be detained under mental health legislation 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>45. In order to ensure that persons with disabilities are able to exercise their right to 
stand for elections, to effectively hold office and perform all public functions at all levels of 
government, the Convention requires States parties to adopt all appropriate measures, 
including the use of assistive and new technologies, to guarantee that persons with 
disabilities can effectively and fully participate in political and public life on an equal basis 
with others (art. 29 (a) (ii)).  
</p>
<p>46. This provision clearly recognizes that States parties are required to do much more 
than merely abstain from taking measures which might have a negative impact on the right 
of persons with disabilities to stand for elections. The elimination of active discrimination 
against persons with disabilities in the field of political and public life is not per se 
sufficient to ensure their equal and effective enjoyment of political rights. In addition to the 
negative obligation of refraining from discriminatory actions and practices against persons 
with disabilities, States parties are also required to adopt positive measures, including 
reasonable accommodation as defined in article 2 of the Convention, to overcome the 
obstacles that de facto prevent persons with disabilities from exercising their right to be 
elected on an equal basis with others.  
</p>
<p>47. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities shed some light on this 
issue in its concluding observations on the first periodic report of Spain. In order to 
guarantee the effective enjoyment of the right of persons with disabilities to effectively hold 
office and perform all public functions at all levels of government, the Committee 
recommended that all persons with disabilities who are elected to a public position be 
provided with all required support, including personal assistants (CRPD/C/ESP/CO/1, para. 
48). 
</p>
<p>48. The replies to the questionnaire provide some examples of the measures adopted by 
the respondent States to implement the right of persons with disabilities to participate as 
candidates in elections. These measures include the identification and elimination of 
obstacles to physical accessibility (e.g. architectonic barriers that prevent or limit the access 
of persons with physical disabilities to public buildings), the development and 
implementation of minimum standards and guidelines for the accessibility of public 
buildings, the provision of information in accessible formats (e.g. Braille and in forms that 
are easy to read and understand) in buildings and other facilities open to the public, and the 
promotion and use of new technologies, including information and communications 
technologies, mobility aids, devices and assistive technologies, suitable for persons with 
disabilities.  
</p>
<p>49. In May 2011, the Government of the United Kingdom organized a consultation on 
access to elected office for disabled people. The consultation document put forward six 
concrete proposals for providing additional support for persons with disabilities seeking 
elected positions as Members of Parliament, councillors or other elected officials, 
including: developing awareness-raising programmes to encourage the active participation 
of persons with disabilities in the conduct of public affairs; organizing training and 
development opportunities to support the involvement of persons with disabilities in 
political life; and establishing an Access to Elected Office Fund to support disability-related 
costs.11  
</p>
<p>50. Article 5, paragraph 4, of the Convention deals with the adoption of affirmative 
action as a means to eliminate discrimination and achieve equality of opportunities for 
</p>
<p>  
for a period of six months or more. Although these provisions had never been used, Section 141 was 
felt to be symptomatic of an outdated attitude towards mental illness which was out of touch with the 
modern understanding of mental health. 
</p>
<p> 11 See www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/equalities/public-political-equality/access-response/. </p>


<p>persons with disabilities. It provides that specific measures which are necessary to 
accelerate or achieve de facto equality of persons with disabilities are not to be considered 
discrimination under the terms of the Convention. Some of the respondents to the 
questionnaire, for example Burkina Faso, reported that their national legislation provides 
for the establishment of quotas to ensure an adequate representation of persons with 
disabilities in legislative, executive or judicial bodies. The Government of Mexico is 
considering amending the Federal Code of Electoral Institutions and Procedures in order to 
encourage political parties to establish quotas for persons with disabilities in electoral lists. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Accessible elections 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities lists a number of 
measures that States parties are required to take in order to ensure that persons with 
disabilities can exercise their right to vote on an equal basis with other citizens. According 
to article 29 (a), such measures include, inter alia: 
</p>
<p> (a) Ensuring that voting procedures, facilities and materials are appropriate, 
accessible and easy to understand and use; 
</p>
<p> (b) Protecting the right of persons with disabilities to vote by secret ballot;  
</p>
<p> (c) Allowing assistance in voting, where necessary and at the express request of 
the person concerned, by a person of one&#8217;s own choice. 
</p>
<p>52. The aim of these measures is to remove the barriers that prevent persons with 
disabilities to exercise their right to vote and participate in elections. These barriers range 
from a lack of awareness about the right to vote to inaccessible information about elections 
and physical barriers at polling stations. In order to remove these barriers, article 29 calls 
for the implementation of practices which improve access to voting and electoral 
participation. Failure to guarantee accessibility by means of reasonable accommodation and 
universal design, as defined in article 2 of the Convention, would infringe the right to 
political participation of persons with disabilities and the principle of equality and non-
discrimination (art. 5). 
</p>
<p>53. The replies to the questionnaire show that many States have adopted a wide range of 
legislative and policy measures to remove existing physical barriers and improve the 
accessibility of voting stations. These measures aim at ensuring that voting stations have 
wheelchair access, proper lighting and sufficiently wide doorways and corridors to facilitate 
the circulation of wheelchair users. They also require that appropriate parking spaces be 
reserved as close as possible to the polling station. Persons with disabilities should be 
provided, at their request, with a list of accessible polling stations. Some States organize 
regular training opportunities for all officials responsible for elections, as well as for those 
responsible for operating and supervising polling stations. Such trainings often include 
information on how to interact with persons with different impairments and how to support 
them in the exercise of the right to vote.  
</p>
<p>54. Some of the respondent States have taken steps to ensure that information on 
political affairs &#8211; and in particular information on elections, voter registration, modalities of 
voting and accessibility of voting procedures, ballots and facilities &#8211; is available in various 
forms (including sign language, Braille, audio, electronic and easy-to-read and understand 
versions), and largely disseminated in advance. In Finland, for example, both the election 
guide and the list of candidates for the parliamentary elections of 2011 were available in 
Braille. In France, the <i>Conseil Su</i>p&#233;rieur de l&#8217;A<i>udiovisuel</i> (Supreme Audiovisual Council) 
adopted a recommendation on 7 November 2006 aimed at facilitating access to electoral 
information in an accessible format through the use of subtitles and sign language. </p>


<p>55. In their replies, some States reported on information campaigns, media advertising, 
guides and awareness-raising initiatives to sensitize persons with disabilities to participate 
in political and public life. During the latest political elections, for example, Ecuador 
organized the campaign entitled &#8220;You have the right to vote&#8221; to encourage the registration 
of persons with disabilities in the voters&#8217; list and their actual participation in the election 
process. States also provided information on the measures they have adopted to ensure that 
ballot papers are available in accessible formats (for instance, large-print versions for 
persons who are partially sighted or tactile voting devices for persons with visual 
impairments).  
</p>
<p>56. When persons with disabilities cannot exercise their right to vote independently, the 
majority of respondent States allow them to be accompanied by a person of their choice, for 
example in the voting booth when casting their vote. The assistant is required to help the 
person concerned to express his or her decision, and not to take the decision in his or her 
place.  
</p>
<p>57. Finally, many States provided information on alternative ways of voting, such as 
electronic voting, mobile polling stations, postal voting, voting by proxy and advance 
voting, available in accordance with their legislation. In some cases, it appears from their 
replies that the measures adopted are not consistent with the obligations arising from article 
</p><p>29.  
</p>
<p>58. Alternative ways of voting should be used only in cases where it is not possible, or it 
is extremely difficult, for persons with disabilities to vote in polling stations like everyone 
else. However, in some countries they represent the general practice. For example, some 
States allow persons with disabilities only to vote from their cars or at special polling 
stations for persons with disabilities in lieu of improving accessibility of existing polling 
stations. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Participation of persons with disabilities in political and public life 
</b></p>
<p>59. The measures adopted by States parties to facilitate the participation of persons with 
different forms of impairment, the procedures followed to enable the participation of 
persons with disabilities through their representative organizations in decision-making 
processes, and the measures adopted to ensure that that such participation is full, effective 
and meaningful vary from one country to the other.  
</p>
<p>60. In some countries, measures to support the inclusion of persons with disabilities in 
political and public life are part of national strategies or programmes on disability. Some 
countries allocate financial resources to national disability organizations to promote their 
participation in the activities of relevant Government bodies and advisory boards, and have 
established national councils on disability or similar consultative bodies to provide advice 
to the Government on issues relating to disability. In some countries, for example in 
Norway, there are also local and regional advisory councils on disability issues.  
</p>
<p>61. States are also required to facilitate the involvement and full participation of civil 
society, in particular persons with disabilities and their representative organizations, in 
monitoring the implementation of the Convention at the national level (art. 33, para. 3). The 
replies to the questionnaire show that States parties to the Convention have adopted a 
number of measures to implement this provision, such as granting financial or other 
assistance to DPOs, including persons with disabilities in independent monitoring bodies 
established pursuant to article 33, paragraph 2, and establishing appropriate procedures for 
integrating persons with disabilities and their representative organizations in the monitoring 
process. Most of the respondent States also declared that they had consulted with persons </p>


<p>with disabilities and DPOs in the preparation of their reports to the Committee on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (art. 35). 
</p>
<p><b> E. Monitoring, data collection and indicators 
</b></p>
<p>62. The collection and maintenance of appropriate information, including statistical and 
research data, is important to formulate and implement policies to give effect to the 
Convention (art. 31), including the provision on participation in political and public life. 
Through the collection of data and statistics it is possible to identify where barriers to the 
political participation of persons with disabilities lie. Appropriate information, bearing in 
mind ethical principles in the collection and use of statistics, can also help identify persons 
requiring support in order to exercise their political rights. 
</p>
<p>63. In some States, national authorities collect statistics on disability, for example in 
relation to education, benefits and rehabilitation available to persons with disabilities. 
However, only a few respondent States collect statistical information on the inclusion of 
persons with disabilities in political and public life. Canada provided statistical information 
on political participation of persons with disabilities in the most recent federal elections.  
</p>
<p>64. Some of the respondents are planning to start collecting data on the political 
participation of persons with disabilities in the near future. Australia, for example, is 
currently developing a set of indicators to monitor progress against the national disability 
strategy, which includes the political participation of persons with disabilities as one of its 
policy areas. In Germany, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs will include 
data on the participation of persons with disabilities in political and public life in its next 
report, which will be published towards the end of 2012. 
</p>
<p><b> F. International cooperation to support the participation of persons with 
</b></p>
<p><b>disabilities in political and public life 
</b></p>
<p>65. In accordance with the Convention, States parties recognize the importance of 
international cooperation and its promotion in supporting national efforts for the full 
realization of the rights of persons with disabilities (art. 32).12 International cooperation can 
occur between and among States or in partnership with relevant intergovernmental 
organizations and civil society organizations, in particular organizations of persons with 
disabilities. International cooperation is to be directed towards &#8220;the realization of the 
purpose and objectives of the present Convention&#8221; (art. 32, para. 1). Since the purposes and 
</p>
<p>objectives of the Convention are &#8220;to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities&#8221; 
(art. 1, para. 1), international cooperation represents an important instrument to support the 
realization of political rights of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>66. Only a limited number of States have developed specific cooperation programmes 
aimed at promoting the participation of persons with disabilities in political and public life. 
The Australian Agency for International Development, for example, has provided direct 
support for more inclusive elections in a number of countries, including Indonesia, Papua 
New Guinea and the Philippines. The majority, however, do not support any specific 
cooperation programmes relating to the political participation of persons with disabilities. A 
</p>
<p>  
 12 See the Thematic study by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on 
</p>
<p>the role of international cooperation in support of national efforts for the realization of the rights of 
persons with disabilities (A/HRC/16/38).  </p>


<p>number of States have provided information on programmes and projects that at least 
indirectly aim at promoting political rights of persons with disabilities. The Canadian 
International Development Agency, for instance, sponsors a number of projects that aim at 
reducing the impact of poverty on the most marginalized groups, including persons with 
disabilities. 
</p>
<p>67. In 2011, the Human Rights Section of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding 
Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL) prepared a public report on the rights of persons with 
disabilities, which focused, inter alia, on the political participation of persons with 
disabilities. In view of the forthcoming 2012 general elections, the report identifies the 
obstacles for participation of persons with disabilities in elections and recommends the 
adoption of a number of measures to overcome these obstacles. In 2012, the Human Rights 
Section of UNIPSIL will organize a series of workshops on the participation of persons 
with disabilities in elections. It will also organize media campaigns on the rights of persons 
with disabilities, which will also touch upon their participation in political and public life. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities heralds a new era for 
the political participation of persons with disabilities. Article 29 requires States 
</b></p>
<p><b>parties to guarantee to persons with disabilities political rights and the opportunity to 
</b></p>
<p><b>enjoy them on an equal basis with others. This provision does not foresee any 
</b></p>
<p><b>reasonable restriction, nor does it allow any exception. Article 12, which recognizes 
</b></p>
<p><b>that persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all 
</b></p>
<p><b>aspects of life, also does not provide for any exception to the principle, and only 
</b></p>
<p>requires States parties to take appropriate measures &#8220;to provide access by persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities to the support they may require in exercising their legal capacity&#8221;. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> It can be concluded that in accordance with the Convention, exclusion or 
restriction of political rights of persons with disabilities on the basis of disability may 
</b></p>
<p>constitute &#8220;discrimination on the basis of disability&#8221; within the meaning of article 2 of 
</p>
<p><b>the Convention and is contrary to the Convention. 
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> In the majority of countries that responded to the OHCHR questionnaire, 
persons with psychosocial and intellectual disabilities continue to be deprived of their 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to vote and be elected on the basis of constitutional or legal provisions that link 
</b></p>
<p><b>their political rights to legal capacity. Such restrictions may be inconsistent with the 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations that States parties have undertaken under articles 2, 12 and 29 of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention, and should be eliminated as a matter of priority from national legislation 
</b></p>
<p><b>and practices, in accordance with article 4, paragraph 1 (a) and (b), of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention. In order to ensure that persons with psychosocial or intellectual 
</b></p>
<p><b>disabilities exercise their right to vote and be elected on an equal basis with others, 
</b></p>
<p><b>States parties should adopt all appropriate measures, in line with article 12, 
</b></p>
<p><b>paragraph 3 and 29 (a) (iii), to provide persons with disabilities with the support they 
</b></p>
<p><b>may require, including the assistance of a person of their own choice, in exercising 
</b></p>
<p><b>their political rights. 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights should be 
interpreted and applied taking into account the developments in the areas of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights of persons with disabilities. In the light of these developments, the Human 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rights Committee should consider reviewing its general comment No. 25 (1996) on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>right to participate in public affairs, voting rights and the right of equal access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>public service, so as to reflect the progressive evolution of international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>law in this field. </b></p>


<p>72.<b> The replies to the questionnaire provide a number of positive examples of the 
efforts undertaken by States to ensure that persons with disabilities can exercise their 
</b></p>
<p><b>voting rights on an equal basis with others. However, they also show that in many 
</b></p>
<p><b>countries persons with disabilities continue to encounter a number of physical and 
</b></p>
<p><b>communication barriers, ranging from inaccessible polling stations to the lack of 
</b></p>
<p><b>information in accessible formats, that prevent or limit their equal and effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation in the conduct of public affairs. Much more needs to be done to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>the equal and effective enjoyment of political rights by all persons with disabilities.  
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> Article 29 (a) (iii) requires States parties to adopt appropriate measures to 
allow persons with disabilities who cannot exercise their right to vote independently to 
</b></p>
<p><b>be assisted in voting by a person of their own choice. In their replies, States have 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided several examples of the assistance that persons with disabilities can obtain in 
</b></p>
<p><b>order to exercise their right to vote. In particular, they listed a number of alternative 
</b></p>
<p><b>ways of voting, such as postal voting or voting at special polling stations, that have 
</b></p>
<p><b>been developed and implemented to facilitate the political participation of persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>with disabilities.  
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> The appropriateness of these measures should always be assessed against the 
general obligation to include persons with disabilities in all aspects of society and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>promote their independence, autonomy and dignity. Alternative ways of voting should 
</b></p>
<p><b>only be used in cases where it is not possible, or it is extremely difficult, for persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>with disabilities to vote in polling stations, like everyone else. General reliance on 
</b></p>
<p><b>voting assistance and alternative voting as a way to ensure the political participation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of persons with disabilities would not be consistent with the general obligations 
</b></p>
<p><b>undertaken by States parties under articles 4 and 29 of the Convention. </b></p>
