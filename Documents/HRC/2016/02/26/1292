<p><b>  26/5  Elimination of discrimination against women 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the  
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted on 25 
June 1993 by the World Conference on Human Rights, the Programme of Action of the 
International Conference on Population and Development, adopted on 13 September 1994, 
the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, adopted on 15 September 1995 by the 
Fourth World Conference on Women, and their review conferences in 2005 and 2010, the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted on 8 September 2001 by the World 
Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, 
and the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference, adopted on 24 April 2009, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> General Assembly resolution 66/130 of 19 December 2011, 
Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000 and Human Rights Council 
resolutions 15/23 of 1 October 2010, 20/6 of 5 July 2012 and 23/7 of 13 June 2013 on the 
elimination of discrimination against women, and 20/4 of 5 July 2012 on the right to a 
nationality: women and children, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> that international human rights treaties, including the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender and include guarantees 
</p>

<p>to ensure the enjoyment by women and men, and girls and boys, of their civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights on a basis of equality, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that the full, equal and effective participation of women of all ages in 
all spheres of life on an equal basis with men is essential for the full and complete 
economic, political and social development of a country and for achieving lasting solutions 
to global challenges, and that gender equality and the empowerment of women benefit 
women, men, girls and boys and society as a whole, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful </i>of the fact that the elimination of discrimination against women and girls 
requires the consideration of their specific socioeconomic context, and recognizing that 
laws, policies, customs and traditions that restrict their equal access to full and effective 
participation in development processes and economic and social life are discriminatory, and 
that the non-participation of women in decision-making contributes to the feminization of 
poverty and hampers sustainable development and economic growth, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful also</i> of the gender gaps in salaries, social security, pensions, decision-
making and access to resources, capital and financial services, the burden of unpaid care 
work and the concentration of women in higher numbers than men in the informal sector, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the challenges still faced by all countries throughout the world to 
overcome inequality between men and women, and the need to intensify efforts to eliminate 
all forms of discrimination against women and girls throughout the world,  
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing and deeply regretting</i> that many women and girls face multiple forms 
of discrimination and are still subject to significant disadvantage as the result of 
discriminatory laws and practices, and that de jure and de facto equality has not been 
achieved, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> by the widespread persistence of various forms of violence 
against girls and women of all ages, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the work undertaken by the United Nations Entity for Gender 
Equality and the Empowerment of Women, the Commission on the Status of Women, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the special procedures 
mandate holders of the Human Rights Council and other relevant United Nations bodies, 
funds, agencies and mechanisms to eliminate discrimination in law and in practice 
throughout the world, and noting the work undertaken by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that gender responsiveness is an essential part of the role played by 
national human rights institutions as established by the principles relating to the status of 
national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles) 
adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 48/134 of 20 December 1993, 
</p>
<p><i>Underscoring</i> that periods of economic and financial crisis pose additional 
challenges to the advancement of women&#8217;s equal participation and representation in 
economic, political and social spheres, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the work undertaken by the Working Group on the issue of 
discrimination against women in law and in practice, and takes note with appreciation of its 
report,1 in which it focused on discrimination against women in economic and social life; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>2. <i>Affirms</i> that realizing human rights requires the full, effective and meaningful 
participation of women in all aspects of economic and social life, on an equal footing with 
men; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Calls upon</i> States to include, as appropriate, special or positive action 
measures to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women in economic and 
social life as part of a comprehensive system-wide approach of non-discrimination and 
equality of opportunity and treatment; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Also</i> <i>calls upon</i> States to promote the rights of women and girls and to 
support their empowerment by adopting, as appropriate, a coherent set of gender-responsive 
social and economic policies directed at the family, the workplace and the marketplace, and 
by addressing poverty and social exclusion in order to overcome the structural barriers and 
inequalities they face and thereby to ensure their long-term and sustainable participation in 
economic and social life; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Further calls upon</i> States to promote reforms, the effectiveness of 
institutional mechanisms and good governance, and to accelerate the implementation of 
legal frameworks and policies directed towards achieving equality and the elimination of all 
forms of discrimination against women and girls, including nationality laws; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Emphasizes</i> that the prohibition of discrimination against women on grounds 
of sex, pregnancy, maternity, parenthood or care work should be enforced for all women in 
all areas of work, including in the informal sector;  
</p>
<p>7. <i>Requests</i> States to take measures to overcome the barriers to women&#8217;s 
economic opportunities resulting from maternity and the disproportionate burden of unpaid 
care work in order to permit choice by women and men as to how they allocate work and 
family duties and in order to enable the complementarity of work and family between 
women and men;  
</p>
<p>8. <i>Urges</i> States to take measures to reduce informal work for women, with a 
focus on female participation in economic life and by increasing women&#8217;s economic 
opportunities, particularly in formal employment, in order to promote gender equality; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Recommends</i> that States support women&#8217;s entrepreneurship, including 
through training, the dissemination of information and the provision of credit and saving 
facilities, and by securing women&#8217;s equal rights over resources to ensure women&#8217;s equality 
and well-being;  
</p>
<p>10. <i>Also recommends</i> that States promote and protect women&#8217;s rights by 
providing women with access to social security over the course of their life cycle; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Calls upon </i>States to analyse and evaluate the impact of the economic and 
financial crisis from a gender perspective, and to ensure that the principles of gender 
equality and the empowerment of woman are reflected also in State-led initiatives to sustain 
and expand the economic recovery, which can provide opportunities to tackle patterns of 
gender inequality and discrimination;  
</p>
<p>12. <i>Calls for</i> gender equality, the empowerment of women and human rights of 
women and girls to be reflected as a stand-alone goal and to be integrated and 
mainstreamed through, inter alia, targets and indicators, into all sustainable development 
goals in the post-2015 development agenda;  
</p>
<p>13. <i>Calls upon</i> States to take concrete steps towards eliminating all forms of 
discrimination against women and girls, directed to achieve gender equality and the 
empowerment of women at all levels of economic and social decision-making processes, 
especially during economic and financial crises, and to engage women in State-building; </p>


<p>14. <i>Stresses</i> the need to accelerate efforts to eliminate all forms of violence 
against women and girls, including in economic and social life, such as gender-based 
violence and sexual harassment against women in the public arena, such as in public 
transport and services, workplaces, educational institutions and cyberspace, to combat 
impunity, and to guarantee access to appropriate civil remedies and redress that take into 
account multiple, intersecting and aggravated forms of discrimination;  
</p>
<p>15. <i>Reaffirms</i> the importance of the right to education as key to the 
empowerment of women and girls and for ensuring equality and non-discrimination, and 
the need for the elimination of discriminatory laws and practices that prevent girls from 
completing their education; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Calls upon</i> States and encourages institutions of global economic governance 
and business to promote women&#8217;s equal access to decision-making positions and processes, 
and encourages them to appoint and promote women staff members in order to guarantee 
women&#8217;s full participation; 
</p>
<p>17. <i>Urges</i> Governments to recognize the important role the media can play in the 
elimination of gender stereotypes and, to the extent consistent with freedom of expression, 
increase women&#8217;s participation in and access to all forms of media, and to encourage the 
media to increase public awareness of the Beijing Platform for Action, the Millennium 
Development Goals, gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; 
</p>
<p>18. <i>Recognizes</i> that the work done by civil society organizations, in particular 
independent women&#8217;s civil society organizations, is crucial to promoting full equality in all 
aspects of economic and social life and eliminating violence against women and girls, 
including women human rights defenders, and that they therefore require support for their 
sustainability and growth; 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to cooperate with and assist the Working Group in its 
task, to supply all necessary available information requested by it and to give serious 
consideration to responding favourably to its requests to visit their country to enable it to 
fulfil its mandate effectively; 
</p>
<p>20. <i>Invites</i> relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, treaty 
bodies within their respective mandates and civil society actors, including non-
governmental organizations, as well as the private sector, to cooperate fully with the 
Working Group in the fulfilment of its mandate, and requests the Working Group to 
continue its cooperation with the Commission on the Status of Women, including by 
participating in its work, and reporting, on request; 
</p>
<p>21. <i>Requests</i> the Working Group to continue to work on its thematic priorities, 
namely, political and public life, economic and social life, family and cultural life, and 
health and safety, and to dedicate specific attention to good practices that have contributed 
to mobilizing society as a whole, including men and boys, in the elimination of all forms of 
discrimination against women and girls; 
</p>
<p>22. <i>Takes</i> <i>note with appreciation</i> of the intention of the Working Group to focus 
its next report on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in practice in family 
and cultural life; 
</p>
<p>23. <i>Requests</i> the Working Group, in the discharge of its mandate, to offer support 
to States&#8217; initiatives to address multiple forms of discrimination against women and girls 
when implementing their obligations as State parties to relevant international human rights 
treaties with regard to civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, and related 
commitments, where applicable; </p>


<p>24. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this issue in conformity with its  
annual programme of work.
