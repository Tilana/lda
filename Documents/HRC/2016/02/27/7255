<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 26/2, requested the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>to dedicate the 2015 annual supplement to his quinquennial report on capital punishment to 
</p>
<p>the consequences arising at various stages of the imposition and application of the death 
</p>
<p>penalty on the enjoyment of the human rights of those facing the death penalty and other 
</p>
<p>affected persons.  
</p>
<p>2. On behalf of the Secretary-General, in March 2015, the Office of the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights sent notes verbales to various stakeholders, including 
</p>
<p>States, international, regional and intergovernmental bodies, national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions and non-governmental organizations, requesting relevant information to enable 
</p>
<p>the Secretary-General to prepare his report. Information received has been included in the 
</p>
<p>present report to the extent possible.1  
</p>
<p>3. The Secretary-General draws the attention of the Human Rights Council to his ninth 
</p>
<p>report on capital punishment and implementation of the safeguards guaranteeing protection 
</p>
<p>of the rights of those facing the death penalty (E/2015/49), which finds that the marked 
</p>
<p>trend towards abolition and restriction of the use of capital punishment in most countries 
</p>
<p>continues. Attention is also drawn to other recent reports outlining various human rights 
</p>
<p>consequences of the use of the death penalty.2 
</p>
<p>4. The present report examines possible consequences of the imposition and 
</p>
<p>application of the death penalty on the enjoyment of various human rights, including human 
</p>
<p>dignity, the right to life, the right to freedom from torture or other cruel, inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment or punishment, the right to a fair trial and the right to equality and non-
</p>
<p>discrimination. It also examines the impact on the enjoyment of human rights by children of 
</p>
<p>parents who are sentenced to death or executed, and other individuals associated with 
</p>
<p>sentenced persons. It further examines the human rights consequences of the lack of 
</p>
<p>transparency in the imposition and application of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Consequences of the imposition and application of the death 
penalty on the enjoyment of the human rights of those facing 
the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human dignity  
</b></p>
<p>5. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 provides that recognition of the 
</p>
<p>inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family 
</p>
<p>is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. The dignity of the human 
</p>
<p>person is inherent in any right protected by international human rights law. Dignity lends 
</p>
<p>real meaning to human rights, and as such is inherent in any right protected by international 
</p>
<p>human rights law.  
</p>
<p>6. In the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, which was adopted in 1989, States 
</p>
<p>parties recognize that abolition of the death penalty contributes to enhancement of human 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 All submissions are on file with the Secretariat and available for consultation. 
</p>
<p> 2 See A/63/293 and Corr.1, A/65/280 and Corr.1, A/67/226, A/69/288, A/HRC/18/20, A/HRC/21/29, 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/24/18, A/HRC/27/23, E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3, A/HRC/10/44, A/67/275 and A/67/279. </p>


<p>dignity. Furthermore, the General Assembly has justified, in resolutions adopted during the 
</p>
<p>past eight years and supported by an increasing majority of Member States, its calls for a 
</p>
<p>moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty, by stating that the 
</p>
<p>use of the death penalty undermines human dignity (see resolutions 62/149, 63/168, 65/206, 
</p>
<p>67/176 and 69/186). In its guidelines on the death penalty, the European Union considers 
</p>
<p>that the death penalty constitutes a serious violation of human rights and human dignity.3 
</p>
<p>The Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries stated that the death penalty is an 
</p>
<p>intolerable and inhuman attack on human dignity and a violation of human rights.4 Forty-
</p>
<p>two member States of the Council of Europe also pointed out that &#8220;the death penalty is an 
</p>
<p>intolerable affront to human dignity, and goes hand in hand with numerous violations of the 
</p>
<p>human rights of the condemned and their families&#8221;.5  
</p>
<p>7. In their submissions relating to the present report, as well as policy statements issued 
</p>
<p>at various forums, several States referred to human dignity as a key argument for the 
</p>
<p>abolition of the death penalty. For instance, Albania stated that &#8220;this kind of punishment is 
</p>
<p>not compatible with human rights principles and constitutes a direct insult to human 
</p>
<p>dignity&#8221;; Canada viewed that &#8220;the death penalty is incompatible with respect for human 
</p>
<p>dignity and the value of human life&#8221;; the Holy See explained that its abolitionist position is 
</p>
<p>&#8220;framed within the proper ethical context of defending the inviolable dignity of the human 
</p>
<p>person and the role of the legitimate authority to defend in a just manner the common good 
</p>
<p>of society&#8221;; Namibia indicated that &#8220;the death penalty undermines human dignity, which is 
</p>
<p>inherent to every human being&#8221;; Portugal noted that &#8220;it opposes the death penalty in all 
</p>
<p>circumstances, as it represents an irreversible loss of the right to life and a gross violation of 
</p>
<p>human rights, and it is an unjustified attack on human dignity&#8221;; and the United Kingdom of 
</p>
<p>Great Britain and Northern Ireland expressed the view that &#8220;the death penalty undermines 
</p>
<p>human dignity&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>8. The constitutions of several countries stipulate that the death penalty undermines 
</p>
<p>human dignity. For instance, the Constitution of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire recognizes the need to 
</p>
<p>respect human dignity and prohibits &#8220;any punishment leading to the deprivation of human 
</p>
<p>life&#8221;. The Constitution of Finland states that &#8220;no one shall be sentenced to death, tortured or 
</p>
<p>otherwise treated in a manner violating human dignity&#8221;. The Interim Constitution of Nepal 
</p>
<p>provides that &#8220;every person shall have the right to live in dignity, and no law shall provide 
</p>
<p>for the death penalty&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>9. A significant number of national courts have also referred to human dignity in 
</p>
<p>relation to the death penalty. In <i>Gregg v. Georgia</i>, Justice Brennan of the Supreme Court of 
</p>
<p>the United States of America filed a dissenting opinion stating that &#8220;the fatal constitutional 
</p>
<p>infirmity in the punishment of death is that it treats members of the human race as 
</p>
<p>nonhumans, as objects to be toyed with and discarded. It is thus inconsistent with the 
</p>
<p>fundamental premise of the Clause that even the vilest criminal remains a human being 
</p>
<p>possessed of common human dignity&#8221;.6 The Canadian Supreme Court has recognized that 
</p>
<p>capital punishment constitutes a serious invasion of human dignity, and several judges 
</p>
<p>expressed the opinion that the death penalty &#8220;is the supreme indignity to the individual, the 
</p>
<p>ultimate corporal punishment, the final and complete lobotomy and the absolute and 
</p>

<p>irrevocable castration&#8221;.7 The Hungarian Constitutional Court has held that capital 
</p>
<p>punishment imposes a limitation on the essential content of the fundamental rights to life 
</p>
<p>and human dignity, eliminating them irretrievably. The Court stressed the relationship 
</p>
<p>between the rights to life and dignity, and the absolute nature of these two rights, which 
</p>
<p>together were the source of all other rights.8 In the <i>Makwanyane </i>case, the South African 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Court found that the death penalty was unconstitutional and observed that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;the rights to life and dignity are the most important of all human rights and the source of 
</p>
<p>all other personal rights &#8230; By committing ourselves to a society founded on the 
</p>
<p>recognition of human rights we are required to value these two rights above all others. And 
</p>
<p>this must be demonstrated by the State in everything that it does, including the way it 
</p>
<p>punishes criminals&#8221;.9  
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to life  
</b></p>
<p>10. Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the 
</p>
<p>right to life, liberty and security of person, while article 6 (1) of the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights provides that every human being has the inherent right to life, 
</p>
<p>which is to be protected by law, and that no one is to be arbitrarily deprived of his life. In 
</p>
<p>its general comment No. 6 (1982) on the right to life, the Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>described the right to life as the supreme right. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
</p>
<p>summary or arbitrary execution referred to it as &#8220;the ultimate metaright, since no other right 
</p>
<p>can be enjoyed without it&#8221; (see A/67/275, para. 12) and &#8220;the most important and basic of 
</p>
<p>human rights. It is the fountain from which all human rights spring. If it is infringed, the 
</p>
<p>effects are irreversible&#8221; (see E/CN.4/1983/16, para. 22). 
</p>
<p>11. More than 40 years ago, in December 1971, the General Assembly, in its resolution 
</p>
<p>2857 (XXVI), stated that in order fully to guarantee the right to life, provided for in 
</p>
<p>article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the main objective to be pursued 
</p>
<p>was that of progressively restricting the number of offences for which capital punishment 
</p>
<p>might be imposed, with a view to the desirability of abolishing that punishment in all 
</p>
<p>countries. The international move towards abolition gained new impetus with the adoption 
</p>
<p>in 1989 of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, which to date has been ratified 
</p>
<p>by 81 States. 
</p>
<p>12. The drafters of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights already 
</p>
<p>paved the way towards the abolition of the death penalty in 1966 by mentioning the death 
</p>
<p>penalty as an exception to the right to life, which should in no way be &#8220;invoked to delay or 
</p>
<p>to prevent the abolition of capital punishment&#8221; (art. 6 (6)) and by establishing stringent 
</p>
<p>conditions under which it could be used. Trends with regard to the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>stringent conditions contained in article 6 (2&#8211;5) can be gleaned from recent quinquennial 
</p>
<p>and annual reports of the Secretary-General on the use of the death penalty (see, for 
</p>
<p>example, E/2010/10 and E/2015/49). 
</p>
<p>13. The Council of Europe has adopted two instruments prohibiting the use of capital 
</p>
<p>punishment: protocols No. 6 (1983) and No. 13 (2002) to<b> </b>the European Convention for the 
</p>
<p>Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, concerning the abolition of the 
</p>
<p>death penalty. Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union also 
</p>
<p>provides that no one shall be condemned to the death penalty, or executed. The Protocol to

<p>the American Convention on Human Rights to Abolish the Death Penalty was adopted in 
</p>
<p>1990. While the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, which was adopted in 
</p>
<p>1981, does not make any specific reference to the death penalty, the African Commission is 
</p>
<p>in the process of developing an optional protocol to the Charter on the abolition of the death 
</p>
<p>penalty in Africa.  
</p>
<p>14. About half of the 102 countries and territories in the world that, to date, have 
</p>
<p>abolished the death penalty for all crimes, enshrined its prohibition in their constitutions, 
</p>
<p>often making explicit the link with the rights to life and physical integrity.10 For instance, 
</p>
<p>the Constitution of Armenia states that &#8220;everyone shall have a right to life&#8221;, and &#8220;no one 
</p>
<p>shall be condemned to the death penalty or executed&#8221;; the Constitution of the Plurinational 
</p>
<p>State of Bolivia provides that &#8220;every person has the right to life and physical, psychological 
</p>
<p>and sexual integrity&#8221; and &#8220;the death penalty does not exist&#8221;; the Constitution of Cambodia 
</p>
<p>holds that &#8220;everybody shall have the right to life, freedom and personal security. Capital 
</p>
<p>punishment is prohibited&#8221;; the Constitution of Colombia stipulates that &#8220;the right to life is 
</p>
<p>inviolable&#8221; and &#8220;there will be no death penalty&#8221;; the Constitution of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire states 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;the rights of the human person are inviolable&#8221; and &#8220;any punishment leading to the 
</p>
<p>deprivation of human life is forbidden&#8221;; the Constitution of Honduras states that &#8220;the right 
</p>
<p>to life is inviolable, and the death penalty is prohibited&#8221;; and the Constitution of Kyrgyzstan 
</p>
<p>states that &#8220;everyone shall have an inalienable right to life&#8221; and &#8220;no one may be arbitrarily 
</p>
<p>deprived of life; the death penalty is prohibited&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>15. Furthermore, several national courts have found the death penalty to violate the right 
</p>
<p>to life. The Albanian Constitutional Court abrogated the death penalty as incompatible with 
</p>
<p>its 1998 Constitution, stating that &#8220;the death penalty is a denial of the right to life and 
</p>
<p>constitutes inhuman and cruel punishment&#8221;.11 The Hungarian Constitutional Court declared 
</p>
<p>that the death penalty violates the &#8220;inherent right to life&#8221; provided under article 54 of the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s Constitution, and thereby abolished the death penalty for all crimes in Hungary.12 
</p>
<p>The Constitutional Court of Lithuania declared that the Criminal Code provision on the 
</p>
<p>death penalty contradicted the Constitution, which stipulates that the right to life shall be 
</p>
<p>protected by law.13 The South African Constitutional Court also used the right to life 
</p>
<p>argument as reasoning for declaring that the death penalty violated the Constitution.14 The 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Court of Ukraine declared the death penalty unconstitutional and the laws 
</p>
<p>providing for it void, by referring to the right to life. It noted that, unlike the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Ukrainian Constitution does not explicitly allow 
</p>
<p>for the death penalty as an exception to the right to life.15 Several other States have also 
</p>
<p>referred to the right to life as key for the abolition of the death penalty (see, for example, 
</p>
<p>A/63/293, para. 17 and A/HRC/27/26, para. 25).16  
</p>
<p>16. With regard to States in which the death penalty is still used, international human 
</p>
<p>rights law, including article 6 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights, &#8220;imposes stringent requirements that must be met for judicial killing not to be 
</p>
<p>regarded as an arbitrary deprivation of life and therefore unlawful&#8221; (see A/67/275, 
</p>
<p>para. 13). Article 6 (2) of the Covenant requires that, in countries that have not yet 
</p>
<p>abolished the death penalty, the application of the death penalty be limited to the &#8220;most 
</p>
<p>

<p>serious crimes&#8221;. This term has been interpreted to mean that the death penalty should only 
</p>
<p>be applied to the crime of intentional killing. The Human Rights Committee has repeatedly 
</p>
<p>stressed that the use of the death penalty for drug-related crimes does not meet the threshold 
</p>
<p>of the most serious crimes.17 However, the death penalty continues to be applied in 33 
</p>
<p>countries or territories for drug-related crimes. Some States also continue to use the death 
</p>
<p>penalty for other crimes or acts not involving intentional killing, such as consensual sexual 
</p>
<p>acts, economic and political crimes, robbery, blasphemy, witchcraft and sorcery. 
</p>
<p>17. The Human Rights Committee has also concluded that mandatory death sentences 
</p>
<p>are not compatible with the most serious crimes. According to the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee, laws that impose the death penalty without any possibility of the defendant&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>personal circumstances or the circumstances of the particular offence being taken into 
</p>
<p>account constitute violations of the right to life under the Covenant.18 The Inter-American 
</p>
<p>Court of Human Rights19, the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights20 and the 
</p>
<p>national courts in Bangladesh,21 India,22 Kenya23, Malawi24 and Uganda25 have also declared 
</p>
<p>that the mandatory death penalty is incompatible with the right to life. 
</p>
<p>18. The prohibition of executions for crimes committed by persons under the age of 18 
</p>
<p>is provided in several international and regional human rights treaties, in particular in 
</p>
<p>article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 37 of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child. The prohibition on the execution of pregnant 
</p>
<p>women is also set out in article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights. In its resolution 69/186, the General Assembly calls on all States not to impose 
</p>
<p>capital punishment for offences committed by persons below 18 years of age, on pregnant 
</p>
<p>women or on persons with mental or intellectual disabilities. Moreover, in its resolution 
</p>
<p>1989/64, the Economic and Social Council recommended that States establish a maximum 
</p>
<p>age beyond which a person may not be sentenced to death or executed.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to a fair trial  
</b></p>
<p>19. The death penalty may be carried out only pursuant to a final judgement rendered by 
</p>
<p>a competent court after a legal process that provides all possible safeguards to ensure a fair 
</p>
<p>trial, at least equal to those contained in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights, including the right of anyone suspected of, or charged with, a crime 
</p>
<p>for which capital punishment may be imposed to adequate legal assistance at all stages of 
</p>
<p>the proceedings.  
</p>
<p>20. In July 2007, the Human Rights Committee adopted its general comment No. 32 
</p>
<p>(2007) on article 14: right to equality before the courts and tribunals and to a fair trial,

<p>which details State parties&#8217; obligations under article 14 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, and reaffirms that scrupulous respect of the guarantees of a fair 
</p>
<p>trial is particularly important in trials leading to the imposition of the death penalty, and 
</p>
<p>that, therefore, the imposition of a death sentence following a trial in which the provisions 
</p>
<p>of article 14 of the Covenant have not been respected constitutes a violation of the right to 
</p>
<p>life. 
</p>
<p>21. The death penalty is of particular concern when imposed by military courts and 
</p>
<p>tribunals, especially on civilians. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has 
</p>
<p>concluded that military justice systems should be prohibited from imposing the death 
</p>
<p>penalty under all circumstances (see E/CN.4/1999/63, para. 80). 
</p>
<p>22. Recently, a new phenomenon of sentencing large groups of individuals in mass trials 
</p>
<p>has emerged and led to major concerns that such mass trials violate international human 
</p>
<p>rights standards regarding fair trial guarantees. In particular, those trials appear to have 
</p>
<p>been marred by procedural irregularities, including a lack of adequate, timely access to 
</p>
<p>lawyers and instances of trials in absentia, and a lack of respect for the presumption of 
</p>
<p>innocence (see A/HRC/27/23 and Corr.1, paras. 43&#8211;53). Pursuant to general comment 
</p>
<p>No. 32 (2007) of the Human Rights Committee, the presumption of innocence, which is 
</p>
<p>fundamental to the protection of human rights, imposes on the prosecution the burden of 
</p>
<p>proving the charge, guarantees that no guilt can be presumed until the charge has been 
</p>
<p>proved beyond reasonable doubt, ensures that the accused has the benefit of doubt, and 
</p>
<p>requires that persons accused of a criminal act must be treated in accordance with that 
</p>
<p>principle. 
</p>
<p>23. Effective assistance by defence counsel is an important element in the right to a fair 
</p>
<p>trial in capital cases. Article 14 (3) (d) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights requires States parties to provide legal assistance to indigent defendants &#8220;in any case 
</p>
<p>where the interests of justice so require&#8221;. The Human Rights Committee has observed that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;it is axiomatic that legal assistance be available in capital cases&#8221; and concluded that &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>absence of counsel constituted unfair trial&#8221;.26 The Committee against Torture has also urged 
</p>
<p>States parties to guarantee effective assistance by legal counsel for death row inmates at all 
</p>
<p>stages of proceedings.27 In December 2012, the General Assembly adopted the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Principles and Guidelines on Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems, 
</p>
<p>recognizing the right to legal aid for persons facing the death penalty at all stages of the 
</p>
<p>criminal justice process.28 
</p>
<p>24. Article 6 (4) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that 
</p>
<p>anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon or commutation of the 
</p>
<p>sentence. It also states that amnesty, pardon or commutation of the sentence of death may 
</p>
<p>be granted in all cases. Therefore, national laws must provide the possibility of, and 
</p>
<p>corresponding procedure for, granting amnesty, pardon and commutation of death 
</p>
<p>sentences for humanitarian and other reasons.

<p><b> D. Right not to be subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman 
</b></p>
<p><b>or degrading treatment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p>25. In his 2009 report, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment or punishment explored whether the death penalty was compatible with 
</p>
<p>the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment under international law 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/10/44). He noted that the interpretation of legal provisions was subject to change 
</p>
<p>over time, as had been the case with the prohibition of corporal punishment. The 
</p>
<p>prohibition of corporal punishment had evolved to the point that it was now considered a 
</p>
<p>direct assault on the dignity of a person and should be qualified by all relevant human rights 
</p>
<p>bodies as cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment. He concluded that maintaining the 
</p>
<p>distinction between a dynamic interpretation that finds that corporal punishment is 
</p>
<p>prohibited, while upholding that capital punishment is compatible with international law, 
</p>
<p>was increasingly difficult. 
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur has concluded that &#8220;a new approach is needed as there is 
</p>
<p>evidence of an evolving standard within international bodies and a robust State practice to 
</p>
<p>frame the debate about the legality of the death penalty within the context of the 
</p>
<p>fundamental concepts of human dignity and the prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment or punishment. This evolving standard, along with the resulting 
</p>
<p>illegality of the death penalty under such prohibition, is developing into a norm of 
</p>
<p>customary law, if it has not already done so&#8221; (see A/67/279, para. 74). 
</p>
<p>27. In examining whether the death penalty per se violates the prohibition of torture or 
</p>
<p>other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, recent jurisprudence should be 
</p>
<p>taken into consideration. For example, in 2013, the European Court of Human Rights ruled 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;whole life&#8221; sentences with no possibility of review and no prospect of release 
</p>
<p>constituted inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment, and were in breach of the 
</p>
<p>prohibition of torture and ill-treatment.29  
</p>
<p>28. In statements before various international forums, several States and regional bodies 
</p>
<p>have indicated that the death penalty is a violation of the prohibition of torture or other 
</p>
<p>cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. Bulgaria stated that it considered 
</p>
<p>the death penalty to be an extreme form of physical and psychological violence for human 
</p>
<p>beings and as such, it constituted cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p>Denmark expressed the view that the death penalty was brutal and inhuman, no matter how 
</p>
<p>cruel the offence. Finland considered the death penalty a cruel and inhuman form of 
</p>
<p>punishment. Italy classified capital punishment as inhuman treatment. Mongolia justified 
</p>
<p>the abolition of capital punishment by referring to the degrading character of the death 
</p>
<p>penalty. Slovenia considered that the death penalty constituted cruel, inhuman and 
</p>
<p>degrading treatment and a violation of international law. Spain held that the death penalty 
</p>
<p>was cruel and inhuman treatment. The European Union stated that it found the death 
</p>
<p>penalty to be cruel and inhuman, representing an unacceptable denial of human dignity and 
</p>
<p>integrity.30 
</p>
<p>29. National courts have also expressed similar views. For instance, in the case of </p>
<p><i>People v. Anderson, </i>California Supreme Court in the United States of America found that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;the cruelty of capital punishment lies not only in the execution itself and the pain incident 
</p>
<p>thereto, but also in the dehumanizing effects of the lengthy imprisonment prior to execution 
</p>
<p>during which the judicial and administrative procedures essential to due process of law are 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 29 See http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/fra/pages/search.aspx?i=001-122664#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-

<p>carried out. Penologists and medical experts agree that the process of carrying out a verdict 
</p>
<p>of death is often so degrading and brutalizing to the human spirit as to constitute 
</p>
<p>psychological torture&#8221;.31 In 2001, in the case <i>United States v. Burns</i>, the Canadian Supreme 
</p>
<p>Court stated that capital punishment engaged the underlying values of the prohibition 
</p>
<p>against cruel and unusual punishment.32 Furthermore, the Constitutional Courts of Albania, 
</p>
<p>Hungary, Lithuania, South Africa and Ukraine have also found that the death penalty per se 
</p>
<p>violates the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>30. States that still use the death penalty do not have unfettered discretion in deciding 
</p>
<p>about the manner in which it is carried out. They should comply with requirements 
</p>
<p>emanating from the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment under international human rights law. In practice, capital punishment today often 
</p>
<p>leads to violations of this prohibition, either because of the death row phenomenon, or the 
</p>
<p>method of execution. 
</p>
<p>31. The Secretary General and special procedures mandate holders have extensively 
</p>
<p>discussed this issue in recent reports. They have described circumstances that generally go 
</p>
<p>hand in hand with the death row phenomenon, including the lengthy and anxiety-ridden 
</p>
<p>wait for uncertain outcomes, isolation, drastically reduced human contact and the physical 
</p>
<p>conditions in which some inmates are held. The Human Rights Committee has recognized 
</p>
<p>the death row phenomenon as a possible breach of article 7 of the International Covenant 
</p>
<p>on Civil and Political Rights.33 Several regional courts have also confirmed the existence 
</p>
<p>and destructive nature of the death row phenomenon.34  
</p>
<p>32. The Human Rights Committee, in its general comment No. 20 (1992) on article 7 
</p>
<p>(prohibition of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment) also 
</p>
<p>recognized that, when the death penalty is imposed, it must be carried out in a manner that 
</p>
<p>causes &#8220;the least possible physical and mental suffering&#8221; (para. 6). Having examined 
</p>
<p>relevant international, regional and national jurisprudence on various methods of execution, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment concluded that there was a growing trend towards scrutiny of all methods of 
</p>
<p>execution that had to date been considered as not causing severe pain and suffering. He 
</p>
<p>found no categorical evidence that any method of execution currently in use complied with 
</p>
<p>the prohibition of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Even if the required 
</p>
<p>safeguards (Economic and Social Council resolution 1984/50, annex) were respected, all 
</p>
<p>methods of execution currently used could inflict inordinate pain and suffering (see 
</p>
<p>A/67/279, paras. 31&#8211;40).  
</p>
<p><b> E. Right to equality and non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>33. Non-compliance with the right to equality and non-discrimination is a major concern 
</p>
<p>when considering the application of the death penalty. In practice, the decision whether to 
</p>
<p>sentence a convict to death or life imprisonment is often arbitrary and devoid of predictable

<p>rational criteria. A number of studies demonstrate that the death penalty is frequently used 
</p>
<p>in a discriminatory manner.35  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Gender discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>34. At least 10 States continue to impose and carry out the death penalty in connection 
</p>
<p>with actual or purported engagement in consensual sexual acts, such as adultery and 
</p>
<p>sodomy. As stated by the Human Rights Committee and other human rights mechanisms, 
</p>
<p>laws criminalizing actual or purported engagement by adults in consensual sexual relations, 
</p>
<p>including illicit sex, contravene international human rights law (see A/HRC/29/40).36 
</p>
<p>Although the language of such laws may appear not to directly discriminate against women, 
</p>
<p>in practice, their application and enforcement often disproportionately affect women&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of their rights (see A/HRC/27/23, para. 33). Studies have demonstrated that 
</p>
<p>women are more likely to be sentenced to death for such crimes, owing to deeply 
</p>
<p>entrenched discriminatory societal attitudes and bias against women suspected of adultery 
</p>
<p>or of engaging in extramarital relationships among the judiciary and law enforcement 
</p>
<p>officers.37  
</p>
<p>35. Imposition of the death penalty for offences relating to consensual adult homosexual 
</p>
<p>conduct continues to be provided for in the legislation of a number of States. As a result, 
</p>
<p>men, women and transgender persons have been sentenced to death. While no cases of 
</p>
<p>executions for consensual same-sex conduct have been confirmed in recent years, the mere 
</p>
<p>existence of such laws has an intimidating effect on all lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender 
</p>
<p>and intersex persons and, as in other places where homosexual relationships are 
</p>
<p>criminalized, reinforces stigma and fuels discrimination and violence against anyone 
</p>
<p>perceived to be lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex. Several human rights treaty 
</p>
<p>bodies have expressed concern at the fact that homosexuality is a crime punishable by death 
</p>
<p>in some countries, and have concluded that such punishment violates the provisions of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (see CCPR/C/MRT/CO/1, para. 8, and 
</p>
<p>E/C.12/IRN/CO/2, para. 7). The European Union guidelines on the death penalty emphasize 
</p>
<p>that the death penalty must not be applied or used in a discriminatory manner on any 
</p>
<p>ground, including sex or sexual orientation.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Minorities and other marginalized groups  
</b></p>
<p>36. Persons belonging to religious and other minorities are frequently exposed to 
</p>
<p>increased risks of criminalization. In some jurisdictions, criminal law specifically targets 
</p>
<p>members of religious minorities or persons practising religions or beliefs that are different 
</p>
<p>from the predominant religious or traditional belief of the country. Reportedly, in 
</p>
<p>13 countries around the world, people who openly espouse atheism or reject the official 
</p>
<p>State religion face execution under the law.38 Criticism of religious faith or even academic 
</p>
<p>study of the origins of religions is treated as a crime in these jurisdictions. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>when manifesting their religions or beliefs, persons belonging to minorities run the risk of 
</p>
<p>being accused of blasphemy, a charge which in some countries carries harsh sanctions, even 
</p>
<p>the death penalty (see A/HRC/22/51, para. 53). In some States, individuals who converted 
</p>
<p>from one religion to another have been arrested and sentenced to death, and national laws

<p>make the death penalty mandatory for apostates.39 In accordance with international human 
</p>
<p>rights jurisprudence, apostasy, blasphemy and specific religious practices do not meet the 
</p>
<p>most serious crimes threshold.40 It appears that the racial or ethnic origin of the victim and 
</p>
<p>of the defendant in capital cases is also a major factor in determining who is sentenced to 
</p>
<p>death in some States. Recent studies document racial discrimination in the death penalty 
</p>
<p>system in the United States of America, and show that this problem, which persists 
</p>
<p>unabatedly, is not restricted to a single region of a country.41  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Foreign nationals 
</b></p>
<p>37. According to estimates, nationals of at least 50 States are currently on death row or 
</p>
<p>have recently been executed abroad, and reports suggest that foreign nationals may be 
</p>
<p>disproportionately affected by the death penalty in several States (see A/HRC/27/23, 
</p>
<p>para. 55 and A/HRC/24/18, para. 74). International standards and safeguards relating to 
</p>
<p>death penalty cases should apply equally to persons facing the death penalty abroad. 
</p>
<p>However, such persons often face discrimination; they can be arbitrarily and 
</p>
<p>disproportionately affected by the death penalty because they are not familiar with the laws 
</p>
<p>and procedures in the prosecuting State. They may have limited access to legal aid and 
</p>
<p>inadequate and low quality legal representation. They may not understand and speak the 
</p>
<p>language in which proceedings are conducted, in particular when denied the free assistance 
</p>
<p>of an interpreter, which is required under article 14 (3) (f) the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights. They are also less likely to have a support network of family and 
</p>
<p>friends.42  
</p>
<p>38. Access to consular assistance for foreign nationals is an important aspect of the 
</p>
<p>protection of those facing the death penalty abroad. The Inter-American Court of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights has ruled that the denial of the right to consular notification constitutes a violation of 
</p>
<p>due process, and that the execution of a foreign national deprived of his or her right to 
</p>
<p>consular services constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of life, in contravention of article 4 of 
</p>
<p>the American Convention on Human Rights and articles 6 and 14 of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.43 The requirement that foreign nationals must be 
</p>
<p>informed of their rights without delay after their arrest has been confirmed by the 
</p>
<p>International Court of Justice.44 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Poor or economically less privileged individuals 
</b></p>
<p>39. Poor or less privileged individuals who do not have access to effective legal 
</p>
<p>representation are frequently disproportionately subjected to the death penalty. In many 
</p>
<p>States, the most important factor in determining whether a defendant will be sentenced to 
</p>
<p>death is the quality of the legal representation of an accused person. Around the world, a 
</p>
<p>large number of defendants in capital cases cannot afford to pay their own lawyers. In many 
</p>
<p>cases, Government-appointed defence lawyers are overworked, underpaid and lack the 
</p>
<p>experience required for death penalty cases. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
</p>
<p>summary or arbitrary executions pointed out that failure to provide adequately funded state-
</p>
<p>wide public defenders had the predictable result of inadequate legal representation for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>defendants in capital cases (see A/HRC/11/2/Add.5). In a recent judgement, the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Court of India referred to poverty as a new mitigating factor to commute a convict&#8217;s death 
</p>
<p>penalty to life imprisonment. It stated that socioeconomic compulsions such as poverty 
</p>
<p>were factors that should be considered by Courts while awarding a death sentence.45
 
</p>
<p>Research into death row prisoners in India has found that the overwhelming majority of the 
</p>
<p>convicted individuals are poor and from lower castes.46

<p><b> III. Consequences arising at various stages of the imposition 
and application of the death penalty for the enjoyment  
of the human rights of other affected persons 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Children of parents sentenced to death or executed  
</b></p>
<p>40. The negative impact on the human rights of children whose parents are subject to the 
</p>
<p>imposition and execution of the death penalty has received increasing attention.47 In its 
</p>
<p>resolution 68/147 on the rights of the child, adopted in 2013, the General Assembly 
</p>
<p>acknowledges that a parent&#8217;s deprivation of liberty, sentencing to death or life 
</p>
<p>imprisonment has a serious impact on children&#8217;s development, and urges States, in the 
</p>
<p>framework of their national child protection efforts, to provide the assistance and support 
</p>
<p>those children may require. Also in 2013, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 
</p>
<p>22/11 on a panel on the human rights of children of parents sentenced to the death penalty 
</p>
<p>or executed. In September 2013, at the panel organized by the Council, experts highlighted 
</p>
<p>a number of negative short- and long-term effects of a parent&#8217;s death sentence on his or her 
</p>
<p>children, including infringement of the enjoyment of a range of rights and obligations set 
</p>
<p>out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. These included, in particular, the 
</p>
<p>obligation to ensure that the best interests of the child are duly taken into account and 
</p>
<p>protected (art. 3); the right to be free from violence, in particular mental violence (art. 19); 
</p>
<p>the right to special protection and assistance provided by the State when a child is deprived 
</p>
<p>of his or her family environment (art. 20); and the right to a standard of living adequate for 
</p>
<p>the child&#8217;s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development (art. 27 (1)) (see 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/25/33).

<p>41. In October 2013, the Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that 
</p>
<p>Kuwait assess and fully take into account the best interests of the child in judicial 
</p>
<p>proceedings where parents are involved and when sentencing parents to death (see 
</p>
<p>CRC/C/KWT/CO/2, para. 32).  
</p>
<p>42. In her recent report to the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>independence of judges and lawyers expressed concern that, despite the particular 
</p>
<p>emotional and psychological distress of children whose parents were sentenced to death &#8212; 
</p>
<p>who also often experienced social isolation and stigmatization &#8212; the support they were 
</p>
<p>given was very limited. She therefore recommended that prosecutors and judges consider 
</p>
<p>the best interests of the defendant&#8217;s children before requesting and ordering the death 
</p>
<p>penalty (see A/HRC/29/26, para. 77).

<p><b> B. Defence lawyers  
</b></p>
<p>43. The welfare and mental health of lawyers can be negatively affected by participating 
</p>
<p>in a case involving the death penalty, in particular when a client is executed. 
</p>
<p>Recommendation R (2000) 21 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to 
</p>
<p>member States on the freedom of exercise of the profession of lawyer states that bar 
</p>
<p>associations should promote the welfare of members of the profession and assist them or 
</p>
<p>their families if circumstances so require (principle V (4) (e)).  
</p>
<p>44. In accordance with the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, lawyers&#8217; access to 
their clients and confidentiality between lawyers and their clients are essential rights of the 
</p>
<p>accused.48 These may be restricted in practice in cases involving the death penalty if the 
</p>
<p>person sentenced to death is in a prison that is not easy to access for the lawyer or in which 
</p>
<p>there are restrictions on all visitors.  
</p>
<p>45. Defence lawyers are crucial stakeholders in any death penalty related process, 
</p>
<p>particularly post-conviction lawyers who attempt to stop an execution. The looming threat 
</p>
<p>of execution and the fact that the life or death of a client depends on the lawyer&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>intervention put enormous pressure on the lawyer. In addition, the number of lawyers who 
</p>
<p>are experienced and knowledgeable in this area is insufficient to meet the number and 
</p>
<p>needs of persons convicted to the death sentence.49 Reportedly, strong public support for the 
</p>
<p>death penalty and a corresponding lack of respect for lawyers who represent people on 
</p>
<p>death row pose additional challenges.50 
</p>
<p><b> C. Prison officials, including medical personnel 
</b></p>
<p>46. Some prison officials who have participated in overseeing prisoners sentenced to 
</p>
<p>death or executions have reported negative effects on their mental health, in some cases 
</p>
<p>experiencing symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder or becoming isolated 
</p>
<p>and withdrawn. Somewhat similar concerns may emerge in cases in which prison officials 
</p>
<p>involved in overseeing death rows or executions are discouraged from quitting through 
</p>
<p>ridicule, bullying or demotion.51  
</p>
<p>47. Around the world, medical associations have questioned to what extent their 
</p>
<p>members, whose professional ethics require them to be healers and not executioners, may 
</p>
<p>be involved in the implementation of the death penalty. This issue arises regularly, but not 
</p>
<p>exclusively, in the case of lethal injections, where States expect medical personnel to 
</p>
<p>participate in the administration of lethal drugs and monitoring of the onset of death. A 
</p>
<p>global study found that &#8220;virtually all codes of professional ethics which consider the death 
</p>
<p>penalty oppose medical or nursing participation. Despite this, many death penalty States 
</p>
<p>have regulations specifying that health professionals be present at executions&#8221;.52 It is clearly 
</p>
<p>established under international law and codes of medical ethics that physicians and other 
</p>
<p>medical personnel should not participate in torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</p>
<p>treatment or punishment. For example, the Principles of Medical Ethics relevant to the Role 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>of Health Personnel, particularly Physicians, in the Protection of Prisoners and Detainees 
</p>
<p>against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted 
</p>
<p>by the General Assembly in its resolution 37/194, includes such a provision. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions observed that, from the 
</p>
<p>perspective of ethics, given that medical personnel should not help to torture, they should 
</p>
<p>not be asked to assist with executions, at least not where such executions might violate 
</p>
<p>international law. States should be cognizant of those considerations when they called for 
</p>
<p>the presence or assistance of medical personnel when administering the death penalty (see 
</p>
<p>A/67/275, para. 97). 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Consequences of the lack of transparency in the application 
and imposition of the death penalty on the enjoyment  
of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>48. In its resolution 1989/64, the Economic and Social Council set out minimum 
</p>
<p>requirements of transparency. It called upon all Member States to publish annually 
</p>
<p>information about the use of the death penalty for each category of offence for which the 
</p>
<p>death penalty is authorized, as well as information about the use of the death penalty. The 
</p>
<p>information should include the number of persons sentenced to death, the number of 
</p>
<p>executions actually carried out, the number of persons under sentence of death, the number 
</p>
<p>of death sentences reversed or commuted on appeal and the number of instances in which 
</p>
<p>clemency has been granted. Information on the extent to which the safeguards referred to in 
</p>
<p>the resolution are incorporated in national law should also be included. The lack of 
</p>
<p>transparency has direct consequences for the human rights not only of the persons 
</p>
<p>sentenced to death, but also for other affected persons. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to a fair trial and due process 
</b></p>
<p>49. Transparency is fundamental to the administration of justice. A transparency 
</p>
<p>safeguard is contained in article 14 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
</p>
<p>Rights. The Human Rights Committee observed that transparency &#8220;is a duty upon the State 
</p>
<p>that is not dependent on any request by the interested party&#8221;.53 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has 
</p>
<p>emphasized that &#8220;transparency is the surest safeguard of fairness &#8230; Over time, punishment 
</p>
<p>imposed by Governments has come to replace private acts of retribution. This has 
</p>
<p>rationalized the disposition of justice, yet it has also introduced the possibility of more 
</p>
<p>systematic arbitrariness. The extraordinary power conferred on the State &#8212; to take a 
</p>
<p>person&#8217;s life using a firing squad, hanging, lethal injection, or some other means of killing 
</p>
<p>&#8212; poses a dangerous risk of abuse. This power may be safely held in check only by public 
</p>
<p>oversight of public punishment. It is a commonplace that due process serves to protect 
</p>
<p>defendants. However, due process is also the mechanism through which society ensures 
</p>
<p>that the punishments inflicted in its name are just and fair&#8221; (see E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3, 
</p>
<p>para. 7). 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 53 See communication No. 215/1986, <i>Van Meurs v. the Netherlands</i>, Views adopted on 13 July 1990, 
</p>
<p>para. 6.1. </p>


<p><b> B. Prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading 
</b></p>
<p><b>treatment 
</b></p>
<p>51. As illustrated by the Views of the Human Rights Committee in two cases, for a 
</p>
<p>convict and his or her family, a lack of transparency in what is already a harrowing 
</p>
<p>experience &#8212; waiting for one&#8217;s execution &#8212; can result in inhuman or degrading treatment 
</p>
<p>or punishment within the meaning of article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights. In relation to an individual complaint submitted by the mother of an 
</p>
<p>executed prisoner, the Committee found that &#8220;the complete secrecy surrounding the date of 
</p>
<p>execution and the place of burial and the refusal to hand over the body for burial have the 
</p>
<p>effect of intimidating or punishing families by intentionally leaving them in a state of 
</p>
<p>uncertainty and mental distress&#8221;.54 This amounts to inhuman treatment in violation of 
</p>
<p>article 7 of the Covenant. In another case, the Committee found that the delay of 
</p>
<p>approximately 20 hours before communicating a reprieve to the accused just 45 minutes 
</p>
<p>prior to his scheduled execution constituted a violation of article 7 of the Covenant.55  
</p>
<p>52. The Committee against Torture has also expressed deep concern over the 
</p>
<p>unnecessary secrecy and uncertainty surrounding executions. It noted that refusing to 
</p>
<p>provide advance notice of the date and time of execution to convicted persons and their 
</p>
<p>family members was a clear human rights violation (see, for example, CAT/C/JPN/CO/2, 
</p>
<p>para. 15).  
</p>
<p><b> C.  Right to information 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions has stated 
</p>
<p>that article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights addresses not only 
</p>
<p>the rights of accused persons but also the public&#8217;s right to information on the use of the 
</p>
<p>death penalty. States have a duty to make information on the death penalty publicly 
</p>
<p>available (see E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3, para. 12). The Special Rapporteur has stated that 
</p>
<p>article 19 of the Covenant also generates transparency requirements in recognizing not only 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression but also public access to information (see A/65/275, para. 108). In 
</p>
<p><i>Toktakunov v. Kyrgyzstan</i>, the Human Rights Committee found that information about a 
</p>
<p>State&#8217;s use of the death penalty was of public interest.56 The Committee consequently 
</p>
<p>recognized a general right to gain access to that information deriving from article 19. The 
</p>
<p>idea of a public right to information finds further support in the emergence of a right to 
</p>
<p>truth. In the context of the death penalty, this would create the public&#8217;s right to the 
</p>
<p>information needed to establish whether deprivation of life is arbitrary or lawful (see 
</p>
<p>A/67/275, paras. 108 and 109).  
</p>
<p>54. In its resolution 69/186 on moratorium on the use of the death penalty, the General 
</p>
<p>Assembly called upon all States to make available relevant information, which can 
</p>
<p>contribute to informed and transparent national and international debates, including on the 
</p>
<p>obligations of States pertaining to the use of the death penalty. The lack of reliable 
</p>
<p>information is also a serious impediment to scrutiny by the international human rights 
</p>
<p>system. In some cases, not having advance knowledge of an imminent execution makes 
</p>
<p>examining questions of lawfulness before an execution and advising about obligations 
</p>
<p>under international law impossible.

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>As the Secretary-General has noted on several occasions, the death penalty has 
</b></p>
<p><b>no place in the twenty-first century. In the light of the evolution of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights law and jurisprudence and State practice, the imposition of the death 
</b></p>
<p><b>penalty is incompatible with fundamental tenets of human rights, in particular human 
</b></p>
<p><b>dignity, the right to life and the prohibition of torture or other cruel, inhuman or 
</b></p>
<p><b>degrading treatment or punishment. The application of the death penalty often also 
</b></p>
<p><b>violates the right to equality and the principle of non-discrimination. The decision 
</b></p>
<p><b>about whether to sentence a convict to death or to lesser punishment is often arbitrary 
</b></p>
<p><b>and does not necessarily follow predictable, rational criteria. In that judicial lottery, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the odds are often stacked against the poor, minorities and other common targets of 
</b></p>
<p><b>discrimination, including women, foreign nationals and lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
</b></p>
<p><b>transgender and intersex persons. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>All measures aimed at ending the application of the death penalty are steps 
</b></p>
<p><b>towards the enjoyment of the right to life. In its article 6, the International Covenant 
</b></p>
<p><b>on Civil and Political Rights, adopted in 1966, referred to the abolition of the death 
</b></p>
<p><b>penalty in terms that strongly suggest that it is desirable. In 1989, by adopting the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,</b> 
</p>
<p><b>aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, States enshrined their stronger 
</b></p>
<p><b>abolitionist stance in international law. The Secretary-General reiterates his call for 
</b></p>
<p><b>universal ratification of the Second Optional Protocol, and urges those States that 
</b></p>
<p><b>have not yet ratified it to do so without delay. 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>The 70 years since the United Nations came into being have seen a remarkable 
</b></p>
<p><b>shift from a large majority of Member States that maintained the death penalty to, 
</b></p>
<p><b>nowadays, a minority. Since 1997, the General Assembly has adopted five resolutions 
</b></p>
<p><b>that called on States to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing 
</b></p>
<p><b>the death penalty. Currently, approximately 160 of the 193 Member States of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations have abolished the death penalty or introduced moratoriums, either in 
</b></p>
<p><b>law or in practice. States should go beyond simply ceasing executions and aim for a 
</b></p>
<p><b>suspension of capital punishment for all who might be, or have been, sentenced to 
</b></p>
<p><b>death. National prosecutors may consider refraining from seeking the death penalty. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Judges may consider not imposing it. In this regard, the highest judicial bodies could 
</b></p>
<p><b>issue judicial directives or sentencing guidelines, as appropriate.  
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>The continued lack of transparency on the part of some Governments 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerning the numbers of persons who have been executed is incompatible with 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights. States should refrain from carrying out executions in secret and strive 
</b></p>
<p><b>to take all measures necessary to guarantee access to information on the death 
</b></p>
<p><b>penalty, including advance notice to family members regarding the date of execution. 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>States that continue to apply the death penalty should comply with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights requirements, as stipulated in article 6 of the International 
</b></p>
<p><b>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In particular, capital punishment may be 
</b></p>
<p><b>imposed only for most serious crimes, that is, intentional killing, and may not be 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandatory in such cases. States should also adhere to fair trial guarantees in capital 
</b></p>
<p><b>cases. Clemency, pardons and commutations are critical steps towards the abolition of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the death penalty. Heads of State and Government and other responsible State 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities should exercise their constitutional and/or legal authority to grant 
</b></p>
<p><b>amnesty, pardon or commutation of the sentence of death in all cases.  
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>States should consider developing measures to minimize the harm suffered by 
</b></p>
<p><b>other persons affected by the death penalty, including family members of convicts, </b></p>


<p><b>defence lawyers, prison staff and medical staff. In particular, under the Convention 
</b></p>
<p>on the Rights of the Child, States must take measures to ensure that children&#8217;s r<b>ights, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the principle of the best interests of the child, are duly considered during 
</b></p>
<p><b>sentencing.  
</b></p>
