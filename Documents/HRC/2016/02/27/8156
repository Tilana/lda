<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression undertook an official mission to Algeria from 10 to 17 April 2011. 
In the present report, he provides a brief overview of the country&#8217;s historical and political 
background, and outlines the pertinent provisions from the domestic legal framework and 
relevant international legal standards. In the main section of the report, the Special 
Rapporteur focuses on legal action in relation to the exercise of freedom of expression; 
freedom of the press and the right to information; freedom of opinion and expression on the 
Internet; censorship on the import of books; freedom of peaceful assembly and 
demonstration; freedom of association; and the National Advisory Commission for the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.  
</p>
<p> Algeria has come a long way from the Black Decade, during which journalists paid 
a tremendously high price. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the lifting of the state of 
emergency, as well as the decision of the Government to embark on political reforms. 
These are positive developments against the backdrop of historical events in the Arab 
region and beyond. He cautions, however, that the current legal framework is still 
restrictive, coupled with practices inherited from the past, that unduly restrict the right to

<p><b>4 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, Frank La Rue, undertook an official mission to Algeria from 10 to 
17 April 2011, at the invitation of the Government. The visit was carried out pursuant to his 
mandate to assess compliance with international standards on the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur visited the cities of Algiers 
and Oran. 
</p>
<p>2. In Algiers, the Special Rapporteur met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs; the 
Minister for Communications; the Minister for Postal Services and Information and 
Communication Technologies; the Adviser to the President; senior officials from the 
Ministries of Foreign Affairs, the Interior, Justice, Culture, and Education; the General 
Prosecutor; Members of the Council of the Nation (Senate) and of the National People&#8217;s 
Assembly; the Directors-General of Public Television and Radio; the President of the 
Council of the Regulatory Authority of Postal Services and Telecommunications; the Head 
of the National Agency for Publishing and Advertising; and the President of the National 
Advisory Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. In Oran, he met 
with officials from the <i>wilaya</i> (province). 
</p>
<p>3. In both cities, the Special Rapporteur met with journalists from State-sponsored and 
private newspapers, representatives of two journalist unions and members of non-
governmental organizations working on civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. 
Lastly, he met with representatives of the United Nations country team and with diplomatic 
missions.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur congratulates the Government of Algeria on having 
voluntarily invited him to visit the country. He believes that it is very symbolic when a 
State takes the initiative to invite a mandate holder of the Human Rights Council, and such 
an initiative should be seen as a good practice. He also thanks the Government for its 
cooperation, in particular for having facilitated all the meetings he had requested.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur also expresses his appreciation to the United Nations 
Resident Coordinator in Algeria and to staff members at the United Nations Development 
Programme for their invaluable support in preparation of, and during, the mission. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur believes that his visit was timely given the growing demand 
for more openness and freedom of expression in the country, as well as the expressed desire 
of the Government to embark on a new process of political reforms. 
</p>
<p>7. In the drafting of the present report, the Special Rapporteur took due consideration 
of the history of the country. He himself comes from a country that went through a 36-year 
civil war, and therefore understands the complexity of the situation and the trauma left by 
such a period. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Historical and political background 
</b></p>
<p>8. Algeria achieved its independence in 1962. Following major social protests in 
October 1988, the Constitution was revised, and a multiparty system and media pluralism 
were introduced. In 1991, the Islamic Salvation Front came first during the first round of 
legislative elections, and a decade of violence (the &#8220;Black Decade&#8221;) ensued, during which 
200,000 people were killed or disappeared. In 1992, a state of emergency was declared. In 
2005, a charter for peace and national reconciliation was adopted by national referendum 
with a view to bringing closure to the conflict, preserving the unity of the nation and the 
continuity of its institutions, and initiating a process of national reconciliation. The armed 
conflict left deep wounds in Algerian society. In February 2011, the state of emergency was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>finally lifted in the wake of social protests inspired by then unfolding events in the Arab 
region (the &#8220;Arab spring&#8221;); in April 2011, the President of Algeria announced a raft of 
political reforms.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Domestic legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. Algeria has a civil law system that is based on the Constitution, which guarantees 
fundamental human rights, including the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
Article 36 of the Constitution provides that &#8220;freedom of conscience and freedom of opinion 
are inviolable&#8221;. Article 41 further provides that &#8220;freedoms of expression, association and 
assembly are guaranteed to citizens&#8221;. Treaties ratified by the President have primacy over 
national law, as provided for in article 132 of the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>10. At the time of the visit, the main legislation governing the exercise of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression were the Criminal Code; Laws Nos. 90-07 on 
information, 91-19 on assembly, and 90-31 on association; and Ordinance No. 06-01 of 
2006 on the implementation of the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation. Laws 
Nos. 12-05 on information, and 12-06 on association, were subsequently adopted in 
December 2011. The content of the legislation and its implementation were carefully 
analysed when drafting the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. International legal standards 
</b></p>
<p>11. In carrying out his assessment of the situation of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression in Algeria, the Special Rapporteur was guided by several international legal 
standards, the most pertinent being the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
ratified on 12 September 1989, and article 19 thereof in particular. The Special Rapporteur 
also paid attention to articles 21 (right to freedom of peaceful assembly) and 22 (right to 
freedom of association), which are complementary to the exercise of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, as evidenced during the Arab spring.1 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur was also guided by other relevant declarations, resolutions 
and guidelines of various United Nations bodies, including general comments Nos. 10 and 
34 of the Human Rights Committee, Human Rights Council resolution 12/16, and the 
Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation Provisions in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Situation of the right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>13. Algeria has come a long way since the Black Decade, during which journalists paid 
a tremendously high price: 100 journalists were killed, several the targets of a bomb attack 
at the Press House. The Special Rapporteur pays tribute to the memory of those who lost 
their lives during the conflict, and to their families. Today, such violence against journalists 
is no longer in Algeria.  
</p>
<p>  
 1 In its general comment No. 34 (CCPR/C/GC/34), the Human Rights Committee provided that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;freedom of expression is integral to the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of assembly and 
</p>
<p>association&#8221; (para. 4). It should be noted that the mission took place before the Special Rapporteur on 
the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association assumed his mandate, on 1 May 2011. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6 
</b></p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the lifting of the state of emergency as well as the 
decision of the Government to embark on political reforms, including the repeal of Law No. 
90-07, also known as &#8220;Criminal Code bis&#8221;. These are positive developments against the 
backdrop of the historical events in the Arab region and beyond.  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur cautions, however, that the current legal framework is still 
restrictive, coupled with practices inherited from the past that unduly restrict the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, as well as the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly 
and association. In this connection, he notes the statement made by the Chairperson of the 
National Advisory Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, Mr 
Ksentini, on 5 December 2011, regretting the absence of wider consultations on the then 
draft laws, including Laws Nos. 12-05 and 12-06. 
</p>
<p>16. Since the visit of the Special Rapporteur, at the end of which he made a series of 
preliminary conclusions and observations for the consideration of the Government in the 
context of the political reforms, substantive changes to the conclusions and observations 
have been made. In order to ensure that the report is still relevant, those changes have been 
reflected in it.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Legal action in relation to the exercise of freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>17. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur raised concerns about article 97 of Law No. 
90-07, which provided that anyone deliberately offending the Head of State in office was 
punishable by a prison term of between one month and one year and/or a fine of 3,000 to 
30,000 dinars (DA). The amendment made to the Criminal Code in 2001 broadened 
restrictions on the media, prohibiting the publication of information offending a magistrate, 
civil servant, public official, commander or State security agent. Sanctions may be taken 
against the author of the offence, the publisher and the editor, and the publication itself 
(articles 144 bis and 146 of the Criminal Code). Several journalists, including from <i>El 
Watan</i> and <i>El Khabar</i>, who notably denounced corruption by State officials had been 
charged with defamation and sentenced to imprisonment, although in most instances the 
sentence was not executed.  
</p>
<p>18. Law No. 11-14 of 2 August 2011 modified articles 144 bis and 146 of the Criminal 
Code, decriminalizing defamation against the above-mentioned officials. The Special 
Rapporteur commends the Government for this important decision. He is concerned, 
however, at the considerably high level of fines now imposed (between 100,000 and 
500,000 DA). Such disproportionate fines have a chilling effect on the right to freedom of 
expression in general, notably by generating a continuous attitude of self-censorship among 
journalists who earn on an average basis 20,000 DA per month.  
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that Law No. 12-05 abolished prison 
sentences pursuant to articles 77 to 99 of Law No. 90-07. However, he notes that the fines 
provided for some of the same offences in Law No. 12-05 were in some instances 
multiplied by 20. Similarly, these fines have a deterring effect on the right to freedom of 
expression.  
</p>
<p>20. In addition, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that defamation remains a criminal 
offence under articles 296 and 298 of the Criminal Code. Article 296 defines defamation in 
broad terms, as &#8220;any allegation or imputation of a fact offending the honour or 
consideration of persons, or of the body to which the fact is imputed&#8221;. Article 298 provides 
that any act of defamation committed against individuals is punishable by imprisonment of 
two to six months and/or a fine between 25,000 and 50,000 DA.  
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that, for a statement to be considered defamatory, 
it must be false, injure another person&#8217;s reputation and be made with malicious intent to </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>cause injury to another individual&#8217;s reputation.2 Furthermore, the following principles must 
be respected: (a) public figures should refrain from bringing defamation suits, as they are 
required to tolerate a greater degree of criticism than private citizens; (b) to require truth in 
the context of publications relating to matters of public interest is excessive; (c) with regard 
to opinions, it should be clear that only patently unreasonable views should qualify as 
defamatory; (d) the onus of proof of all elements should be on those claiming to have been 
defamed rather than on the defendant; where truth is an issue, the burden of proof lies with 
the plaintiff; (e) in defamation actions, a range of remedies should be available, including 
apology and/or correction; penal sanctions, in particular imprisonment, should never be 
applied.3 To this end, the Special Rapporteur notes that Law No. 12-05 offers the right of 
reply when someone has been the subject of slanderous accusations that may harm his 
honour or reputation (art. 101) without having to take legal action. He notes with concern 
that the right to correction requires directors of media to publish or broadcast, free of 
charge, any rectification submitted by natural persons or institutions regarding facts or 
opinions deemed to have been incorrectly reported (art. 100), without a court decision. 
</p>
<p>22. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about article 96 of the Criminal 
Code, which provides that whoever distributes or sells tracts, bulletins or flyers that &#8220;may 
harm the national interest&#8221; is subject to a term of imprisonment for a period between six 
months and three years, and a fine of between 3,600 and 36,000 DA. &#8220;When the tracts, 
bulletins or flyers come from abroad or are inspired by foreign sources, imprisonment may 
be for up to five years.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>23. In addition, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about article 46 of Ordinance No. 
06-01 of 2006 on the implementation of the Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation, 
which provides that anyone who &#8220;through oral or written statements or any other act, 
exploits the wounds of the national tragedy, with a view to harming Algerian institutions, 
harming the honour of its agents who served it with dignity or tarnishing the image of 
Algeria at the international level&#8221; is punishable by imprisonment for three to five years and 
a fine of 250,000 to 500,000 DA. In the event of recurrence of an offence, the sanctions are 
doubled. Although this provision was never implemented, it contributes dramatically to the 
climate of self-censorship, especially in the media. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that 
reconciliation can never be achieved by imposing silence, and that peace must be based on 
the right to truth and the victim&#8217;s right to justice. In the case of forced disappearances, these 
rights are particularly relevant.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Freedom of the press and the right to information 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Main observations 
</b></p>
<p>24. According to article 2 of No. Law 12-05, informing is an activity that must respect 
12 principles, including the &#8220;national identity and cultural values of the nation&#8221;, &#8220;the 
requirements of State security and national defence&#8221; and &#8220;the State&#8217;s economic interests&#8221;. 
Such restrictions are inherently vague, and not compatible with article 19(3) of the 
Covenant. They apply to journalists, but also to political parties, trade unions and human 
rights organizations. The Special Rapporteur recalls that the general principle is that 
permissible limitations and restrictions must constitute an exception to the rule, and must be 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>kept to the minimum necessary to pursue the legitimate aim of safeguarding other human 
rights established in the Covenant or in other international human rights instruments.4 
</p>
<p>25. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur notes with serious concern article 4 of Law No. 
12-05, which provides that only registered associations may establish media to undertake 
information activities. This article is highly problematic in view of Law No. 12-06, which 
introduces a regime of preliminary authorization for the creation of associations (see 
paragraphs 83 &#8211; 88 below). 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Status of journalists 
</i></p>
<p>26. The precarious nature of journalism was brought to the attention of the Special 
Rapporteur on several occasions. Journalists expressed their concerns about the low 
standards of working conditions, which limit their professional freedom.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that Law No. 12-05 aims at 
addressing this difficult situation. According to the law, journalists are entitled to a written 
contract from their employer that specifies the rights and obligation of both parties (art. 80). 
They are entitled to life insurance when sent to a war zone, a zone held by rebels or in 
regions affected by epidemics or natural disasters, or any other region where his or her life 
may be at risk (art. 90). Article 75 also provides that the nomenclature of the different 
categories of professional journalists is determined by the law on the status of journalists 
(unavailable when the present report was drafted). Furthermore, according to the 
Government, a salary scale involving a substantial increase in salary for all categories of 
journalists is currently applied. 
</p>
<p>28. Although a national journalist identification card should never be necessary to 
practice professional journalism, many journalists expressed their concern at not having 
professional recognition as such. At the end of his visit, the Special recommended that such 
a card be granted upon voluntary request. In this regard, he notes with concern article 76 of 
Law No. 12-05, which provides that professional journalism is reserved to holders of a 
national card of journalism issued by a commission, the composition, organization and 
functioning of which are determined by regulatory measure. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur also notes with concern that article 79 provides that at least 
one third of newspaper editorial teams be composed of full-time journalists who are holders 
of the national professional journalist card. Such quotas governing the composition of 
editorial teams are not found in international law, and may amount to a form of control. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur notes the existence of two unions, the National Union of 
Journalists (since 1997) and the International Federation of Journalists (since 2009), with 
whom he met. He supports their work, but notes that less than 50 per cent of journalists 
belong to either one of the unions. He calls on both unions to join forces to fully support the 
work of journalists. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Access to information 
</i></p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur received various testimonies from journalists who were 
unable to obtain information from public authorities, despite article 35 of Law No. 90-07, 
which guaranteed the right of access to sources to information, and the existence of 
communication officers within public institutions. Several State officials acknowledged the 
unfortunate lack of public communications on activities undertaken by the Government. 
This is all the more serious given that journalists have been tried for defamation because 
</p>
<p>  
 4 A/HRC/14/23, para. 77. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>they were lacking sufficient and/or accurate information. In all democratic societies, 
transparency of public activities plays a crucial role for the confidence and trust of the 
population. Since State officials should work in representation of the people and for the 
common and public good, all official activities and management of resources should also be 
made public at the request of citizens, especially journalists.  
</p>
<p>32. At the end of his mission, the Special Rapporteur recommended that legislation on 
access to public information, which should in itself establish the limitations of an 
exceptional nature, be enacted. He notes with satisfaction article 83 of Law No. 12-05, 
which provides, inter alia, that all administrations and institutions must provide journalists 
with the information and data that they request to guarantee citizens the right to information 
within the framework of the law and applicable legislation. Article 84 also allows 
professional journalists to have access to sources of information. The Special Rapporteur 
notes with concern, however, the list of restrictions (longer than under the previous law) 
drafted in broad terms, such as &#8220;national sovereignty&#8221;, &#8220;strategic economic secret&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;foreign policy and economic interests of the country&#8221;. It is feared that investigative 
</p>
<p>journalism on issues such as corruption of officials will not be possible. Furthermore, there 
is no reason why such access should only be granted to professional journalists. Lastly, 
procedural modalities for access to information and to challenge refusals are not in place.  
</p>
<p>33. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur stresses that the Human Rights Committee, in 
its general comment No. 34, observed that:  
</p>
<p>States parties should also enact the necessary procedures, whereby one may gain 
access to information&#8230;.The procedures should provide for the timely processing of 
requests for information according to clear rules that are compatible with the 
Covenant. Fees for requests for information should not be such as to constitute an 
unreasonable impediment to access to information. Authorities should provide 
reasons for any refusal to provide access to information. Arrangements should be 
put in place for appeals from refusals to provide access to information as well as in 
cases of failure to respond to requests.5  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Ethics 
</i></p>
<p>34. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was repeatedly told by the authorities and 
journalists that there was a need for journalists to adhere to high professional standards and 
ethical values. To quote one journalist with whom the Special Rapporteur met: &#8220;every day, 
</p>
<p>Algerian citizens oblige journalists to be professional: since they tasted freedom of opinion 
and expression, they have not been willing to abandon it&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>35. At the end of his visit, the Special Rapporteur publicly stated that journalists should 
be held to such standards and values, but as a process of self-regulation and in a voluntary 
fashion, never by determination of State authorities or by law. He notes with concern title 6, 
chapter 2 of Law No. 12-05, in particular article 92, which states that journalists must 
strictly respect ethics and deontology. In addition to article 2, a long list of limitations is 
provided, including the respect of the State&#8217;s attributes and symbols; the prohibition to 
damage national history; the prohibition to use the moral prestige associated with the 
profession for personal or material purposes; and the prohibition to diffuse or publish 
statements and images that are amoral to or shock citizens&#8217; sensitivity. The Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that this list is dangerously vague and may have an adverse impact 
on the work of journalists.

<p>36. The Special Rapporteur notes the establishment of the High Council of Ethics and 
Deontology for Journalism (arts. 94-99), whose members are elected by professional 
journalists. The body is responsible for drafting and adopting a charter of honour for the 
profession of journalism (art. 96). In the event of breach of rules of ethics and deontology, 
the High Council may order sanctions against the author (art. 97). The nature of such 
sanctions is determined by the High Council (art. 98). The Special Rapporteur stresses the 
utmost importance that the High Council be fully and truly independent.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Training of journalists and State support for the media 
</i></p>
<p>37. The proliferation of newspapers with low professional standards reportedly led to a 
decline in the overall quality of newspapers in Algeria. There is, therefore, a large number 
of journalists who could benefit from specific training.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur met with senior officials from the Ecole nationale 
sup&#233;rieure de journalisme et des sciences de l&#8217;information, which was established by decree 
in 2009. He noted with interest the various courses offered to students, with a focus on, 
inter alia, new technologies.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction article 128 of Law No. 12-05, which 
provides that &#8220;the State contributes to the increase of the professionalism of journalists by 
means of training activities&#8221;. In this context, he welcomes the statements made by the 
Minister for Communications in December 2011 that the Government would devote, in 
2012, 400 million DA for the training of journalists, and that the ministry, in cooperation 
with the Ministry of Professional Training and Teaching, would establish a training centre 
for journalists and audiovisual professionals in Sidi Abdallah, Algiers. In this regard, on 16 
January 2012, a convention was signed by the two ministries to promote the training of 
professionals in the communications sector. The Special Rapporteur also notes with 
satisfaction that, under article 127, the State supports financially the promotion of freedom 
of expression, particularly through local and specialized press. In that regard, he recalls that 
&#8220;care must be taken to ensure that systems of Government subsidy to media outlets &#8230; are 
not employed to the effect of impeding freedom of expression.&#8221;6  
</p>
<p><i> (e) Foreign journalists 
</i></p>
<p>40. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the number of visas 
granted to foreign journalists had been reduced several weeks prior to the mission, in 
connection with the then unfolding events. He was also informed that some foreign 
journalists had been given accreditations for a very limited period (for example, a week), 
and that accreditation could be revoked any time. The Special Rapporteur expresses 
concern about such practices. He notes that article 81 of Law No. 12-05 states that 
professional journalists working for foreign media receive an accreditation, the modalities 
of which are determined by statutes. He looks forward to receiving a copy of those statutes.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Written media 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Negative practices 
</i></p>
<p> (i) Intimidation and self-censorship 
</p>
<p>41. In its concluding observations on the third periodic report of Algeria, the Human 
Rights Committee observed that, while taking note of the pardon granted to some 
</p>
<p>  
 6 Ibid., para. 41. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>journalists in July 2006, it nevertheless noted with concern that many journalists had been 
and continued to be subjected to pressure and intimidation, or even measures of deprivation 
of liberty, by the authorities of the State party.7 
</p>
<p>42. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur was struck by one event amounting to a 
clear act of intimidation against the profession of journalists. On 5 March 2011, a group of 
journalists, from <i>Le </i>Soir d&#8217;Alg&#233;rie,<i> La Libert&#233;</i>,<i> Le </i>Quotidien d&#8217;Oran, <i>El Watan</i>, L&#8217;Expression,<i> La Tribune </i>and<i> La </i>Voix de l&#8217;Oranie, were apprehended by security forces 
after a rally in Oran, organized by the Oran section of the National Coordination for 
Change and Democracy, even though they had shown their press cards, which was denied 
by the Government. The journalists were transferred to different police stations and 
subsequently released a few hours later. On the same day, a journalist from <i>La Libert&#233;</i> 
intending to cover a similar rally in Batna reportedly had his camera confiscated by the 
police. The fact that he had taken photographs of security forces dispersing this rally was 
reportedly regarded by the authorities as an act of provocation. The camera was returned 
later that day. 
</p>
<p>43. The detention of the 10 journalists in Oran was seen by many journalists as a 
warning to the media to no longer cover such events. Several journalists stated that they 
were indeed dissuaded from attending and reporting on similar events. In addition, one 
journalist who covered the rally in Oran was dismissed for issuing a statement on the 
incident, while another resigned because the article he wrote on the police action that day 
was eventually not published by his newspaper for fear of offending the authorities. Under 
the pressure of authorities, some newspapers were therefore forced to censor themselves &#8211; 
above and beyond the above-mentioned legal sanctions in relation to freedom of 
expression, which lead to further self-censorship. 
</p>
<p>44. Another pervasive form of pressure on editorial positions was brought to the 
attention of the Special Rapporteur. Two independent newspapers, <i>El Watan</i> and <i>El 
Khabar</i>, which have repeatedly been critical of Government policies, were reportedly 
subjected to 6-month-long auditing processes by the tax administration in 2010. Similarly, 
in January 2012, <i>El Watan</i> was summoned by the National Insurance Fund to pay 
221,084,409.75 DA for unpaid social security contributions for collaborators and 
freelancers between 2005 and 2011. Other national newspapers had been targeted by the 
fund two years ago, but all procedures against them were stopped because of complaints by 
the editors. The Special Rapporteur finds such apparent politically motivated practices 
highly disturbing. 
</p>
<p> (ii) Lack of independence and weakening of the press 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern a lack of independence of the written 
press in general. At the time of the visit, there were 80 daily newspapers in Algeria, of 
which fewer than six are considered independent, according to several sources. Most of 
these newspapers are very small and depend entirely on official advertisement for their 
subsistence, and paper supplied by State-owned rotary presses. The Special Rapporteur sees 
this as a problem, given that he was told on several occasions that they were reportedly 
used by the State to create a &#8220;balance&#8221; to critical newspapers, with a view to diluting any 
criticism of State policies. 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur met with the Chief Executive Officer of the Entreprise 
nationale de communication, d&#8217;&#233;dition et de publicit&#233; (ANEP), an agency in charge of, inter 
alia, allocating public advertising to newspapers. It is entirely funded by the State. Prior to 
</p>
<p>  
 7 CCPR/C/DZA/CO/3, para. 24. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12 
</b></p>
<p>the meeting, the Special Rapporteur received testimonies of several journalists concerning 
unfair allocation of official advertising by ANEP as a way to sanction criticism and 
encourage self-censorship of journalists; for instance, <i>El Watan</i> and <i>El Khabar</i> have been 
reportedly banned from receiving public advertising since 1996 and 1997, respectively, 
owing to their critical stance on Government policies.  
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur was informed by the agency&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer that 
there were no rules governing such allocations, and that such an absence of rules made the 
work of ANEP difficult. He was in favour of having a specific law on advertising, which 
would certainly improve the image of ANEP with the press in general. He stated that a 
number of laws on advertising had been drafted, to which ANEP had contributed, but to no 
avail. The Head of the National People&#8217;s Assembly expressed his support for having such a 
law. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that a law should govern the allocation of 
public advertising, based on the principles of equity and fairness, with clear standards that 
preclude preferential treatment for those who are closer to Government positions and the 
sanctioning of those critical of public policies. He notes with satisfaction that article 28 of 
Law No. 12-05 limits advertising space to one third of the global surface of general 
information newspapers and publications. The Government later informed the Special 
Rapporteur that a law on advertising was being prepared. 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur received testimonies from journalists about the dependence 
of the majority of newspapers on State-owned rotary presses and access to paper, which 
seriously limits their press freedom, and as a result creates unfair competition for those 
forced to acquire their own rotary presses to exist. The majority of these newspapers 
reportedly have debts with the printing company, and therefore will refrain from having a 
critical stance towards the Government. This closed circuit harms freedom of expression; it 
is important that the printing activity is not held exclusively in the hands of the 
Government. In addition, the supply of paper for print should be diversified so that a 
monopoly situation can be avoided. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Undue legal restrictions 
</i></p>
<p> (i) Regulatory authority for the press 
</p>
<p>50. Article 40 of Law No. 12-05 establishes an independent and financially autonomous 
regulatory authority for the press that is responsible for, inter alia, ensuring the quality of 
media messages; ensuring the transparency of economic management practices of editorial 
houses; fixing rules and conditions of State financial aid to information bodies, and 
ensuring its distribution; and collecting all necessary information from press 
administrations and publishers to ensure that they respect their obligations. In the event of 
breach of the provisions contained in Law No. 12-05, the authority makes observations and 
recommendations, and sets the conditions and the time limit for their implementation (art. 
42). The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this overall broad mandate could potentially 
impede the exercise of freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>51. The regulatory authority is composed of 14 members: three members, including the 
chairperson, whose vote counts double, are appointed by the President of Algeria; two are 
appointed by the President of the National People&#8217;s Assembly; two are appointed by the 
President of the National Council; and seven are elected by absolute majority from a list of 
professional journalists with at least 15 years of experience (art. 50). The Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that the nomination and appointment procedure does not fully 
guarantee the independence of the authority, given the degree of influence that may be 
exerted by the dominant political party and the President, as well as the lack of 
independence of the written press in general.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p> (ii) Starting a publication 
</p>
<p>52. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur received testimonies of associations and 
trade unions wishing to initiate a publication of their own, but who had not received any 
receipt from State authorities after submitting their preliminary declaration under law 90-
</p><p>07. He publicly stated that anyone should be able to start a publication without any 
restrictions, and there should be no official or de facto mechanisms of authorization beyond 
notification to State institutions.  
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that article 11 of Law No. 12-05 states 
that the publishing of periodical publications is free, subject to a preliminary declaration by 
the director in charge of the publication to the regulatory authority for the press. A receipt is 
immediately issued to the director, then 60 days later, an authorization is issued by the 
regulatory authority (art. 13). In the event of refusal, the authority must justify its decision, 
which can be appealed before the competent jurisdiction. The Special Rapporteur regrets 
that the procedure has been formally changed to an authorization regime.  
</p>
<p> (iii) Foreign participation in the media 
</p>
<p>54. Article 23 of Law No. 12-05 stipulates that the director in charge of a periodic 
publication must, inter alia, hold Algerian citizenship. Article 22 states that the printing of 
any publication owned by a foreign company is subject to authorization by the Ministry for 
Communications. Article 38 states that the production and/or importation by foreign 
entities and diplomatic missions of periodic publications to be freely distributed is/are 
subject to authorization of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Special Rapporteur deplores 
such systems of authorization, and recalls that the right to freedom of expression applies 
regardless of frontiers, as provided by article 19(2) of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>55. In addition, article 29 of Law No. 12-05 prohibits periodic publications from 
receiving direct or indirect material support from any foreign party. Article 116 provides 
for a fine of 100,000 to 300,000 DA, and the temporary or definite suspension of the 
publication or of the body responsible for it. Article 117 further sanctions the directors of 
press or media bodies listed in article 4 with a fine of 100,000 to 400,000 DA for receiving 
funds or benefits from a foreign public or private entity. The Special Rapporteur believes 
that these provisions are aimed at controlling periodic publications, and are therefore 
unacceptable. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Television and radio broadcasting 
</b></p>
<p>56. At the end of his visit, the Special Rapporteur stated that it was clear that the 
opening granted to the press in the early 1990s had yet to be extended to television and 
radio broadcasting, given that the State had a monopoly on both media. The Special 
Rapporteur met with the Directors-General of Public Television and Radio, and was 
informed of their activities. There were then five television channels: three general 
channels; one on the promotion of the Amazigh culture; and one devoted to the Koran. 
There were 54 radio channels, one channel for each wilaya. Most of the country had radio 
broadcast coverage.  
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur conveyed the concerns of several interlocutors, who 
reported that national television and radio had given biased coverage of the protests in the 
country during the Arab spring, and did not grant sufficient access to opposition parties and 
critical non-governmental organizations. These affirmations were denied by the directors of 
television and radio. The Special Rapporteur notes with interest the statement made in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14 
</b></p>
<p>December 2011 by the Minister for Communications8 that his sector would contribute to 
opening Algerian television to all political parties, acknowledging that television was 
experiencing a difficult period, owing also to former policies that did not allow it to 
accomplish its mission as a public service. 
</p>
<p>58. At the end of his visit, the Special Rapporteur recommended that, in order to 
guarantee openness, an independent collective authority for broadcasting be established 
with the representation of different sectors of stakeholders, including the press and civil 
society, which could guarantee genuine independence in the public broadcasting service. 
This is all the more relevant since a high percentage of the population draws its information 
from television and radio. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that Law No. 12-05 establishes a 
regulatory authority in the audiovisual field, which is independent and financially 
autonomous (art. 64). The missions, attributions, composition and functioning of this 
authority will be determined by the law on audiovisual activities (art. 65). Once again, the 
Special Rapporteur stresses the utmost importance of having the press and civil society &#8211; 
actors who must be genuinely independent from the Government &#8211; represented in this 
authority. He expresses his willingness to provide comments on the draft law on 
audiovisual activities.  
</p>
<p>60. At the end of his visit, the Special Rapporteur encouraged the authorities to consider 
the possibility of opening some broadcasting channels and frequencies to private or joint 
initiatives. He noted with satisfaction the schedule determined by the Minister for 
Communications for the digitization of the system, which will allow the diversification of 
initiatives. He welcomes the opening of the audiovisual sector to Algerian private 
companies through the adoption of Law No. 12-05 (art. 61). This is certainly a 
commendable achievement, as it was a long-standing request of various stakeholders. 
Article 59 stipulates that audiovisual activity is a mission of public service. In this 
connection, the Special Rapporteur once again raises concern about article 2 of Law No. 
12-05, which is bound to have an adverse impact on audiovisual activity.  
</p>
<p>61.  The Special Rapporteur remains concerned that the news television channel <i>Al 
Jazeera</i> is still not permitted to operate in the country. According to the authorities, <i>Al 
Jazeera</i> gave biased coverage of the marches organized by the opposition in February 2011, 
and exacerbated tension. He thinks that such exclusion is not compatible with the 
commitment expressed by the Government to embark on political reforms, aimed at, inter 
alia, enhancing the freedom of expression. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Online media 
</b></p>
<p>62. Law No. 12-05, in its title five, covers online media, namely, online newspapers 
(arts. 67 and 68) and online audiovisual activities (arts. 69 and 70). Articles 68 and 70 
provide that online media activities should consist in the production of work that has 
original content, is of general interest and regularly renewed and composed of information 
relevant to current events and that has been handled in a journalistic manner. Once again, 
such provisions are vague and may lead to a restrictive interpretation of the law. Article 71 
states that the activities of the online press and audiovisual media must respect article 2 of 
the same law. This article is problematic owing to its reference to article 2, as mentioned 
above.

</p>
<p><b> C. Freedom of opinion and expression on the Internet 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal framework  
</b></p>
<p>63. Law No. 09-04 of 2009 governs the prevention and fight against offences linked to 
information and communications technologies. Article 3 provides that, in order to protect 
public order or for the needs of an investigation or for ongoing judicial inquiries, technical 
devices may be used for surveillance of electronic communications, and to collect and 
register in real time their content; in computer systems, searches and seizures may also be 
conducted. Article 4 provides that surveillance operations may be conducted to, inter alia, 
prevent offences amounting to terrorist or subversive acts and infractions against State 
security. Such operations may only be conducted on the basis of a written authorization 
from the competent judicial authority. 
</p>
<p>64. While mindful that the Internet may facilitate the commission of a crime, that the 
Government is responsible for ensuring that the Internet remains a safe place, and that 
persons behind such criminal conduct should be held accountable, the Special Rapporteur is 
concerned about the vagueness of the terms &#8220;terrorist or subversive acts&#8221;, which may lead 
</p>
<p>to potential abuses in the implementation of Law No. 09-04. He echoes the observations of 
the Human Rights Committee on Algeria in that regard. While it understood the security 
requirements associated with the fight against terrorism, the Committee expressed its 
concern at the lack of details on the particularly broad definition of terrorist and subversive 
acts given in the Criminal Code. &#8220;The State party should ensure that counter-terrorism 
measures are consistent with the Covenant. In addition, the definition of terrorist and 
subversive acts should not lead to constructions whereby the terrorist acts can be invoked to 
deny the legitimate expression of rights established in the Covenant.&#8221;9  
</p>
<p>65. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that Law No. 09-04 might 
infringe upon Internet users&#8217; right to privacy, and impede the free flow of information and 
ideas online by undermining people&#8217;s confidence. As recalled previously by the Special 
Rapporteur, &#8220;the right to privacy is essential for individuals to express themselves freely.&#8221;10  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Access to the Internet 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the work of the Ministry of Postal Services and 
Information and Communication Technologies in allowing greater access to the Internet to 
the public (now 8 million users), including users with a private subscription (1 million), as 
well as to, inter alia, universities and research centres connected via the Academic Research 
Network, the national education sector, the professional training and teaching sector, 
cultural institutions and public administrations.  
</p>
<p>67. The Government&#8217;s strategy with regard to information and communication 
technologies is reportedly to generalize the use of such technologies for the benefit of the 
national economy and of citizens. Access to high and very high bandwidth is a prerequisite. 
To this end, an appropriation fund for the use and development of information and 
communication technologies, called FAUDTIC, was established in 2009. The fund covers, 
inter alia, generalizing access of the public to the Internet, teaching information and 
communication technologies to all social categories, and strengthening research, 
development and innovation.  
</p>
<p>68. In addition, in the framework of the fund&#8217;s missions, the Ministry of Postal Services 
and Information and Communication Technologies signed, in 2010, a convention with the 
</p>
<p>  
 9 CCPR/C/DZA/CO/3, para. 17. 
 10 A/HRC/17/27, para. 53. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16 
</b></p>
<p>Ministry of Culture aiming at generalizing free access to the Internet with a 2-megabit 
bandwidth for all cultural centres and public libraries at the national level, thereby enabling 
the development of community spaces, and the training of all concerned activity leaders on 
the use of information and communication technologies. Within the same framework, a 
similar convention was signed with the Ministry of Youth and Sport in 2010 to give 
Internet access to all 2,000 youth centres. The Ministry of Postal Services and Information 
and Communication Technologies has also provided some centres with information and 
communication technology facilities. The Ministry of Education also referred to its 
commendable effort to teach information technologies in primary and secondary schools.  
</p>
<p>69. Access to the Internet is further facilitated by the exoneration of (a) value added tax 
on related fees pertaining to access via telephone land lines, the hosting of web servers for 
&#8220;.dz&#8221; data centres located in Algeria, and related maintenance and assistance; and (b) a tax 
on the creation, production and national publishing of digital works. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged by the plans presented by the Minister 
aiming at expanding the network of Internet services via optical fibres, and through other 
existing networks. At the time of his visit, there were reportedly 62,000 km of optical fibres 
and 52,000 km of digital radio transmission lines.  
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur was informed by the Minister for Postal Services and 
Information and Communication Technologies and the President of the Council of the 
Regulatory Authority of Postal Services and Telecommunications that the authorities did 
not censor any websites nor had they developed Internet blocking or filtering mechanisms. 
The Special Rapporteur, however, received testimonies of how Facebook was unavailable 
for a short period of time in early 2011 when protests were taking place in neighbouring 
countries in the region, which the same Minister denied. Similarly, the website of a news 
agency was reportedly disrupted for 15 days during the same period. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Censorship of imported books  
</b></p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur was informed that imported books may be subject to 
censorship by the Ministry of Culture. He is of the opinion that there is a very clear 
contradiction between such a law and the fact that the Internet and the purchase of satellite 
dishes are allowed. The censorship of imported books is relic of the past. The free 
circulation of books is emblematic of the freedom of opinion and expression.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Freedom of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p>73. Decree No. 92-44 of 1992 established a state of emergency and authorized the 
Minister for the Interior and the <i>wali</i> (local governors) to temporarily close access to all 
public meeting places and to prohibit any gathering or demonstration that might disrupt 
public order. Under a decree issued in 2001, all marches in Algiers were also banned. 
Several peaceful gatherings and demonstrations were not allowed: for example, in March 
2010, the Algerian League for the Defence of Human Rights was not permitted to hold its 
third congress despite having filed a declaration with the wilaya of Algiers several weeks 
before the event. In May 2010, a group of people peacefully gathering in front of the office 
of the national television broadcaster on the occasion of the World Press Freedom Day was 
dispersed by security forces. 
</p>
<p>74. When the state of emergency was lifted in February 2011, Law No. 91-19 of 1991 
governing the exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly was once again applied. 
Public gatherings are subject to a prior declaration made to the wali at least three days 
before the event takes place (art. 5). Public demonstrations are subject to prior authorization </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>(art. 15), and the request to a hold a public demonstration must be made to the wali at least 
eight days before it commences (art. 17). Should a demonstration be held without prior 
authorization, it is considered an illegal assembly (art. 19) and the organizers and 
participants may face imprisonment of three months to one year and/or a fine of 3,000 to 
15,000 DA (art. 23). Article 9 provides that &#8220;it is forbidden in any public gathering or 
demonstration to express opposition to national values&#8221; and &#8220;to undermine the symbols of 
the first November revolution, public order and morals&#8221;. In the event of violation of article 
9, the sanctions envisaged under article 23 apply. 
</p>
<p>75. According to several activists, however, despite the lifting of the state of emergency, 
the 2001 decree continues to be invoked to prevent a number of marches in the capital and 
in other cities, such as Oran. When marches are allowed, authorization may be granted at 
the last minute; when refused, justification is rarely provided. The Special Rapporteur 
deplores such arbitrary and oblique practices. He favours a declaratory practice for both 
public gatherings and demonstrations rather than one of authorization.  
</p>
<p>76. People from all parts of society, in particular young people, have taken to the streets 
to demand their rights, including the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, 
and association, as well as basic economic, social and cultural rights, such as employment 
opportunities. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur witnessed in Algiers a number of 
peaceful assemblies, as well as a march by students, contained by a massive police 
presence. According to several sources, the march was eventually violently dispersed by 
security forces. In addition, on 13 April 2011, the Special Rapporteur went to the scene 
where a peaceful assembly of relatives of disappeared persons had just been repressed by 
security forces, in front of the offices of the National Advisory Commission for the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. One activist from the non-governmental 
organization SOS Disparus had been hit in the lower body, another one was beaten, and 
women, including some elderly, were roughly handled. The Special Rapporteur is deeply 
concerned about this completely unacceptable brutality. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur also met with Dalila Touat, a member of the non-
governmental organization Comit&#233; national pour la d&#233;fense des droits des ch&#244;meurs 
(National Committee for the Defence of the Rights of the Unemployed), who was arrested 
in Mostaganem on 16 March 2011 for distributing flyers calling for a peaceful 
demonstration to defend the rights of the unemployed, and charged under article 100 of the 
Criminal Code. The Special Rapporteur raised the case with the authorities, and was 
pleased to learn that, a few weeks later, all charges were dropped and the case was closed. 
</p>
<p>78. Since the visit of the Special Rapporteur, a number of public demonstrations have 
reportedly been banned; for instance, on 23 April 2011, civil servants of the Ministry of 
National Education were reportedly prevented from holding a peaceful assembly in front of 
the presidential office, and several of them were beaten. On 29 June 2011, a peaceful march 
organized by lawyers of the Algiers bar association was not allowed. Likewise, marches 
organized by the Coordination nationale pour le changement et la d&#233;mocratie (National 
Coordination for Change and Democracy) have repeatedly been prevented. On 16 October 
2011, security forces reportedly used violence to disperse a peaceful assembly of 30 
members of the Comit&#233; nationale pour la defence des droits des ch&#244;meurs in the wilaya of 
Laghouat. It is reported that some of the members were physically assaulted and arrested 
for some time; five of them were severely injured. The security forces also took away their 
banners and mobile phones. The Committee coordinator was summoned shortly after to the 
police station in Batna, and was interrogated on the the Committee&#8217;s activities and its link 
with other trade union activists. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that organizers 
of peaceful assemblies were targeted by security forces prior to planned assemblies. For 
instance, in June 2011, three members of the Rassemblement pour la culture et la 
d&#233;mocratie (Alliance for Culture and Peace) were apprehended before the weekly gathering </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18 
</b></p>
<p>of the Coordination nationale pour le changement et la d&#233;mocratie and interrogated on their 
political activities before being released.  
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur met with the Director-General of National Security and four 
other high-ranking officials, to whom he expressed his concerns about the use of excessive 
force by law enforcement officials in the context of peaceful assemblies. He was informed 
that law enforcement officials were trained in human rights law and never used force 
against participants in such assemblies. Furthermore, all levels of command in the security 
forces were instructed to, inter alia, act with &#8220;tact and professionalism&#8221; when maintaining 
or re-establishing public order and to systematically avoid using repressive means against 
demonstrators or when dispersing non-authorized gatherings in public areas. However, in 
the light of the above-mentioned incidents witnessed or brought to his attention, the Special 
Rapporteur would like to reiterate the need for law enforcement agencies to adhere to the 
Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles on the Use of 
Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
would like to stress the importance of prompt and thorough investigation of all allegations 
of excessive use of force by an independent body, of holding responsible persons 
accountable and of providing reparation to victims. Such measures are not only essential to 
protect the rights of individuals, but also to build public confidence in the Government. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Freedom of association 
</b></p>
<p>80. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with a number of human rights 
activists, including trade unionists, who raised a number of issues pertaining to the exercise 
of their right to freedom of association.  
</p>
<p>81. At the time of the visit, Law No. 90-31 of 1990 governed the modalities of 
constitution, organization and operation of associations. Articles 7 and 10 provided that an 
association was lawfully established, inter alia, after (a) a declaration of constitution had 
been submitted to the wali of the wilaya where the association was based, or to the Minister 
for the Interior, in the case of national or inter-provincial associations; and (b) the issuance 
of a registration receipt by the competent authority within 60 days of receiving the said 
declaration. In the event that the competent authority believed that the establishment of the 
association would be contrary to the law (namely, based on an object contrary to the 
established institutional system, public order, public morality or law and regulations in 
force), it referred the case to the administrative chamber of the relevant court eight days 
before the expiry of the 60-day period. The court would then have 30 days to give its 
decision (art. 8). 
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur was repeatedly informed that, in practice, registration 
receipts were arbitrarily denied, upon instructions from authorities or without referring the 
case to a court, or indefinitely delayed, for organizations critical of the Government&#8217;s 
policies or on issues deemed controversial, such as enforced disappearances and the victims 
of terrorism during the Black Decade. For instance, the non-governmental organizations 
SOS Disparus and Somoud, which work on the above-mentioned issues, were reportedly 
never informed of the status of their submission to the Minister for the Interior. Similarly, 
the youth association El Manara has still not received any registration receipt since its 
submission in 2006 before the wilaya of Mostaganem. In the absence of the registration 
receipt, an association has no legal personality and, as a consequence, cannot open a bank 
account, receive funds or file a complaint before a court. In addition, some associations 
have been arbitrarily asked to change their name when applying for the renewal of their 
board. This was the case, for instance, of the non-governmental organization Femmes 
alg&#233;riennes revendiquant leurs droits (Algerian Women Claiming Their Rights). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>83. At the end of his visit, the Special Rapporteur publicly encouraged the Government 
of Algeria to facilitate the exercise of the right to freedom of association. However, the 
provisions of Law No. 12-06 on association, which was adopted in December 2011, unduly 
restrict freedom of association. 
</p>
<p>84. The creation of an association is now subject to a procedure amounting to a regime 
of preliminary authorization since the administrative authorities are required to either 
deliver a receipt granting authorization or reject the application (art. 8), without having to 
refer the case to a judicial court. In the event of rejection, the association may appeal before 
the competent court. The criteria upon which an application may be refused are extremely 
broad, and may therefore lead to arbitrariness, as the object and the goals of an 
association&#8217;s activities must be compatible with the general interest and not contrary to 
national values, public order, public morality or applicable laws and regulations (art. 2). 
Another issue of concern is the fact that associations may no longer receive funds from 
legations and foreign non-governmental organizations outside the framework of duly 
established partnerships (art. 30), financially stifling several human rights associations that 
rely on such funding. Should an association receive funds from these entities, it may be 
suspended for a maximum period of six months (art. 40) or even dissolved (art. 43). 
Furthermore, administrative authorities may suspend or dissolve an association &#8220;when it 
interferes with domestic affairs or when it infringes upon national sovereignty&#8221; (art. 39); 
again, such broad terms may be invoked in an arbitrary manner. Lastly, any member or 
head of an association that has not been registered or authorized, has been suspended or 
dissolved, and who continues to work in its name will face a prison term of three to six 
months and a fine of 100,000 to 300,000 DA (art. 46). Such a provision is particularly 
problematic in the light of the above. 
</p>
<p>85. With regard to foreign associations, they may be authorized to operate only if they 
aim at implementing provisions contained in an agreement between the Government of 
Algeria and the Government of the country of origin of these associations, with a view to 
promoting relations based on friendship and brotherhood between the Algerian people and 
the people of the country of origin of such associations (art. 63) Foreign associations may 
similarly be suspended or dissolved by the administrative authority in the event of, inter 
alia, &#8220;blatant interference with the host country&#8217;s affairs, or when its activity infringes upon 
national sovereignty, the established institutional order, national unity or the integrity of the 
national territory, public order, public morality, or the civilizational values of the Algerian 
people&#8221; (art. 65). Likewise, these provisions are broad and may be used arbitrarily.  
</p>
<p>86. It is therefore feared that the same associations, whose right to freedom of 
association was reportedly illegitimately restricted under Law No. 90-31, will continue to 
be targeted under the new provisions &#8211; even to a greater extent, given that the new law is 
far more restrictive. The Special Rapporteur is, therefore, deeply concerned about this new 
legislation, which impedes the right to freedom of association, and therefore has a 
detrimental impact on the right to freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p>87. Lastly, the Special Rapporteur is also concerned about reports of members of 
international human rights non-governmental organizations who were, on a number of 
occasions, not allowed to enter Algeria; for instance, the Executive Director of the Euro-
Mediterranean Human Rights Network, a network of more than 80 human rights 
organizations, institutions and individuals based in 30 countries in the Euro-Mediterranean 
region, was twice in 2009 not granted a visa to attend meetings in the country. Similarly, in 
2009, a Tunisian journalist and human rights activist due to participate in a programme on 
media monitoring, on the invitation of the Algerian League of Human Rights, was denied 
entry on her arrival at Algiers airport.  </p>

<p><b> G. National Advisory Commission for the Promotion and Protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>88. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with a number of members of civil 
society supportive of the work in the National Advisory Commission for the Promotion and 
Protection of Human Rights, and others who expressed their distrust in the activities of the 
Commission. In a meeting with the Chairperson and members of the Commission, the 
Special Rapporteur mentioned the importance of raising the legitimate human rights 
demands, past and present, of all sectors of civil society. He also reiterated, inter alia, the 
importance of guaranteeing its independence in the appointment procedure and its work, 
following the confirmation in October 2010 of &#8220;B&#8221; status, relating to the status and 
functioning of national institutions for promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris 
Principles) by the Subcommittee of the International Coordinating Committee of National 
Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.11  
</p>
<p>89. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur recalls that, in March 2010, the 
International Coordinating Committee raised a number of concerns, including that the 
&#8220;Commission&#8217;s reports are not widely circulated, discussed, nor considered by 
</p>
<p>governmental bodies or parliament&#8221; and the critical importance for national human rights 
institutions &#8220;to maintain close cooperation with civil society in order to effectively fulfil 
their mandate&#8221;, and called upon those institutions &#8220;to improve its relations with such 
organizations&#8221;.12  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates the importance of freedom of opinion and 
expression, coupled with freedoms of peaceful assembly and of association, in a truly 
</b></p>
<p><b>democratic society. The political reforms in which Algeria has embarked are certainly 
</b></p>
<p><b>important and come at a critical time; however, these reforms are marred by gaps and 
</b></p>
<p><b>shortcomings that seriously impede the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p><b>and association. Enduring negative practices in relation to the rights to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>expression, peaceful assembly and association further undermine the exercise of these 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights.  
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The logic of the past can no longer be used to ignore the expectations of the 
people, in particular the young, and to limit their freedoms. The Government should 
</b></p>
<p><b>heed such voices. Freedom of expression, together with freedoms of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p><b>and association, allow society to ease tensions. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>To strengthen the democratic foundations of Algeria, the Special Rapporteur, 
in a spirit of constructive engagement, recommends the steps set out below.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal action in relation to freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>Defamation should be made a civil action, and fines should be significantly 
reduced in order not to dissuade freedom of expression.  
</b></p>
<p>  
 11 &#8220;B&#8221; status denotes &#8220;not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient information 
</p>
<p>provided to make a determination&#8221;. See the report and recommendations of the session of the Sub-
Committee on Accreditation, March-April 2010, para. 1.8, available from the website

<p><b>A/HRC/20/17/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>94. <b>Defamation should never be used to stifle criticism of State institutions and 
policies. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Government should implement the recommendation of the Human Rights 
Committee, namely, to repeal any provision of Ordinance No. 06-01 enacting the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation, in particular article 46, which 
</b></p>
<p><b>infringes freedom of expression and the right of any person to have access, at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>national and international levels, to an effective remedy against violations of human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights.</b>13<b> In this context, the Special Rapporteur notes that Algeria accepted the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendation made at the first session of the universal periodic review, namely, 
</b></p>
<p><b>that the State take into account the observations made by the Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Committee.</b>14<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Freedom of the press and the right to information 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Government should implement the recommendation of the Human Rights 
Committee, namely, to guarantee the exercise of freedom of the press and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection of journalists, in accordance with article 19 of the Covenant.</b>15<b> 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>All provisions under Law No. 12-05 identified as problematic in the present 
report should be revised with a view to fully ensuring the right to freedom of opinion 
</b></p>
<p><b>and expression. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The Government should adopt legislation to establish specific mechanisms to 
ensure access to public information. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>State institutions should design a common strategy of communication that 
would keep the public better informed, with a view to publicizing, inter alia, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>positive measures taken by the Government.  
</b></p>
<p>100. Journalists&#8217; visas<b> and accreditations and their renewals should be dealt with 
promptly, and not be used as a means to threaten or limit their freedom to cover all 
</b></p>
<p><b>stories. The access of foreign journalists to the country should be facilitated. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>Acts of intimidation and other forms of pressure against journalists should 
cease with a view to ending self-censorship among the profession. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>The Parliament should enact legislation to makes ANEP a truly independent 
institution and establish principles on governing the allocation of public advertising. 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Printing activities should be governed by principles of fair competition. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b><i>Al Jazeera</i> should be allowed to operate in the country. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Freedom of opinion and expression on the Internet 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>Law No. 09-04 should be applied only as an exception to the general norm of 
permitting the open and free use of the Internet, like all other forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>communication; only very few qualified and clearly legislated exceptions should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>permitted.

</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The Government should implement the recommendation of the Human Rights

</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>109. <b>The right of relatives of victims of enforced or involuntary disappearance to 
express themselves publicly should be recognized and respected. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>The 2001 decree banning marches in Algiers should be abrogated. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>The Government should amend Law No. 91-19 with a view to introducing a 
regime of notification for public demonstrations rather than authorization. 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Law enforcement officials should not use excessive force against peaceful 
demonstrators. These officials should be fully trained in international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards on the policing of assemblies and demonstrations. All allegations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>excessive use of force should be promptly and thoroughly investigated by an

<p>113. <b>The Government should amend Law No. 12-06 with a view to fully ensuring the

<p><b>their right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>The Government should respond favourably to the request of the Special
