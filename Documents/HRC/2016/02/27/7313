<p><b>  Report of the Independent Expert on capacity-building and 
technical cooperation with C&#244;te d</b>&#8217;<b>Ivoire in the field of 
human rights, Mohammed Ayat</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
</p>
<p> In this document, which covers the period from 1 December 2014 to 31 March 
</p>
<p>2015, the Independent Expert reports on his first visit to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, from 12 to 21 
</p>
<p>January 2015. He welcomes the progress made by the Government in terms of respect for 
</p>
<p>and protection of human rights, particularly its efforts to set the country&#8217;s economy back on 
</p>
<p>the path of sustainable development and the establishment of bodies such as the National 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Institute, the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the victims&#8217; 
</p>
<p>reparation fund and the National Programme for Social Cohesion. 
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert also commends the Government&#8217;s efforts to build capacity 
</p>
<p>in the justice system, including through renovation of the courts and the ongoing legislative 
</p>
<p>reforms, notably of the Criminal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Civil Code and 
</p>
<p>the Code of Civil Procedure. He welcomes the reopening of the assize courts after many 
</p>
<p>years, which should in theory make it possible to bring cases for serious offences against 
</p>
<p>and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and to help combat the 
</p>
<p>culture of impunity. 
</p>
<p> The case currently before the assize courts against 83 persons, including Simone 
</p>
<p>Gbagbo, is a good start towards combatting the impunity that reigned for nearly two 
</p>
<p>decades. However, the Independent Expert points out that the proceedings still concern a 
</p>
<p>restricted period, that of the electoral crisis in 2010, despite the fact that serious violations 
</p>
<p>of human rights and international humanitarian law had been committed for more than a 
</p>
<p>decade before then. 
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert also emphasizes that the charges concern acts prejudicial to 
</p>
<p>State security. There is still impunity for the perpetrators of serious violations of human 
</p>
<p>  
 * Late submission.

<p>rights and international humanitarian law. Lastly, the charges still focus on just one party to 
</p>
<p>the fighting, although the reports of both the international commission and a national 
</p>
<p>commission indicated that both parties committed acts of violence that could constitute 
</p>
<p>international crimes. The Independent Expert states that equitable justice is a necessary 
</p>
<p>passage towards breaking the vicious circle of violence. 
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert recognizes that this path must be embarked on with caution 
</p>
<p>to avoid destroying the hard-won but fragile progress that has been made in security and 
</p>
<p>economic development, which benefits all Ivorians. However, he finds it clear that no 
</p>
<p>achievement can be sustained if it is not endorsed by justice. In that regard, the Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert is pleased to note that almost all those with whom he discussed the issue, 
</p>
<p>particularly Ivorians, agreed that justice must be impartial and equitable. It remains for that 
</p>
<p>conviction to be put fully into practice. 
</p>
<p> The Independent Expert makes a number of recommendations intended to improve 
</p>
<p>detention conditions in prisons and to strengthen measures taken to combat impunity and 
</p>
<p>the legal framework for the protection of human rights in the country. He calls on the 
</p>
<p>international community to provide staunch support for C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire on its path towards 
</p>
<p>reconstruction.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report, covering the period from 1 December 2014 to 31 March 2015, is 
</p>
<p>submitted pursuant to resolution 26/32 of the Human Rights Council, adopted on 27 June 
</p>
<p>2014, in which the Council decided to establish a new mandate on capacity-building and 
</p>
<p>technical cooperation with C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in the field of human rights, to follow on from the 
</p>
<p>previous mandate, for a renewable period of one year, and requested the Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert to submit a report at its twenty-eighth session and his final recommendations at its 
</p>
<p>twenty-ninth session. 
</p>
<p>2. The Independent Expert&#8217;s first visit to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire took place from 12 to 21 
</p>
<p>January 2015. He was received by Alassane Ouattara, the President of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the 
</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of the Interior and Security, 
</p>
<p>the Minister for Employment, Social Affairs and Vocational Training, the Minister of 
</p>
<p>Justice, Human Rights and Public Freedoms, the Minister of Higher Education and 
</p>
<p>Scientific Research, the Minister of National Education and Technical Education and other 
</p>
<p>senior civilian and military authorities. 
</p>
<p>3. The Independent Expert met with the Prosecutor-General at the Court of Appeals of 
</p>
<p>Abidjan, the Public Prosecutor at the Court of First Instance of Abidjan, the Chief of 
</p>
<p>General Staff of the Armed Forces, the chairperson of the National Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission, the Ombudsman, the chairperson of the National Electoral Commission and 
</p>
<p>the former chairperson of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert visited detention centres in Abidjan. He also met with the leaders of the 
</p>
<p>majority and opposition political parties, religious leaders, traditional chiefs, human rights 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the diplomatic corps and United Nations bodies. 
</p>
<p>4. The Independent Expert wishes to thank the Ivorian authorities for facilitating the 
</p>
<p>effective completion of the mission and for being so open to dialogue. He would also like to 
</p>
<p>thank all those who provided him with useful information on the human rights situation in 
</p>
<p>C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. He would furthermore like to commend the excellent work done by Mr. 
</p>
<p>Doudou Di&#232;ne, the previous Independent Expert. 
</p>
<p>5. The Independent Expert wishes to thank the officials of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Operation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (UNOCI) and the staff of the Human Rights Division of UNOCI 
</p>
<p>for their technical and logistical support, which ensured the smooth running of his mission 
</p>
<p>to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General situation in the country 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>6. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has a presidential system of government (Constitution of 23 July 
</p>
<p>2000). The President is elected by universal suffrage in a two-round election for a five-year 
</p>
<p>term renewable only once. The President holds executive power. He appoints the Prime 
</p>
<p>Minister &#8212; the head of Government &#8212; who is answerable to him. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has a 
</p>
<p>single-chamber Parliament (Constitution, art. 58). The Parliament adopts legislation, 
</p>
<p>including in relation to the fundamental freedoms of citizens. 
</p>
<p>7. The Ivorian Constitution establishes the principle of the independence of the 
</p>
<p>judiciary from the other branches of government. The President of the Republic is the 
</p>
<p>guarantor of the independence of the judiciary. He presides over the Supreme Council of 
</p>
<p>Justice. </p>


<p>GE.15-08296 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>8. In its preamble, the Constitution proclaims the country&#8217;s commitment to human 
</p>
<p>rights and fundamental freedoms and to democratic values. An extensive chapter of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution is devoted to the recognition of human rights (arts. 1 to 22), focusing in 
</p>
<p>particular on equality before the law (art. 2) and providing for the guarantees of a fair trial 
</p>
<p>(arts. 20 to 22).  
</p>
<p>9. International agreements that have been regularly adopted by C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire prevail 
</p>
<p>over domestic laws. The Independent Expert notes with satisfaction that C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has 
</p>
<p>ratified seven of the nine international human rights instruments that form the backbone of 
</p>
<p>the broader international human rights framework. It has ratified the first Optional Protocol 
</p>
<p>to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. C&#244;te 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;Ivoire still needs to ratify other important conventions and protocols in order to 
</p>
<p>consolidate the progress already made in the adoption of international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Political context 
</b></p>
<p>10. In the 1960s and 1970s, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire enjoyed resounding economic success, which 
attracted many immigrants from neighbouring countries. In 1998, approximately 26 per 
</p>
<p>cent of the population of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was made up of non-nationals. In the 1990s, a 
number of factors, including the introduction of a multiparty system and the economic 
</p>
<p>crisis caused by the fall in coffee and cocoa prices, began to exacerbate xenophobic tension. 
</p>
<p>This tension centred around the concept of &#8220;ivoirit&#233;&#8221;, underlined in article 35 of the 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p>11. Since then, the country&#8217;s history has been punctuated by violent events, starting with 
</p>
<p>the overthrow of President Henri Konan B&#233;di&#233; in a military coup on 24 December 1999 and 
</p>
<p>followed by an armed conflict that virtually split the country into two opposing parties: the 
</p>
<p>north, more or less controlled by the rebels, and the south, which remained in the hands of 
</p>
<p>supporters of President Laurent Gbagbo. The violent conflicts that have arisen in C&#244;te 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;Ivoire since the late 1990s have primarily been related to elections. The most recent 
</p>
<p>electoral crisis was in 2010. 
</p>
<p>12. In the second round of the presidential elections in November 2010, Alassane 
</p>
<p>Ouattara was declared the winner by the Independent Electoral Commission. This result 
</p>
<p>was certified by the United Nations and accepted by the African Union. On the same day, 
</p>
<p>the Constitutional Council had announced the victory of Laurent Gbagbo. The two men 
</p>
<p>both took an oath of office and a wave of violence broke out. According to UNOCI 
</p>
<p>estimates, 3,000 persons lost their lives and there were thousands of injured and displaced 
</p>
<p>persons and refugees (there are still some 300,000 displaced persons and over 50,000 
</p>
<p>refugees, mostly in Liberia). 
</p>
<p>13. The situation began to ease following the arrest of Laurent Gbagbo and his transfer 
</p>
<p>to the International Criminal Court. Alassane Ouattara was inaugurated as President on 21 
</p>
<p>May 2011. Since then, the country has been trying, with the support of the international 
</p>
<p>community, to restore peace and social cohesion and regain its momentum towards 
</p>
<p>economic development. This arduous work, which is still ongoing, has resulted in tangible 
</p>
<p>and commendable progress. 
</p>
<p>14. The next presidential elections are scheduled for October and November 2015. 
</p>
<p>However, for more than a decade, election periods have given rise to violent disturbances. 
</p>
<p>All national and international stakeholders concerned with the human rights situation in the 
</p>
<p>country must therefore be vigilant. This need for vigilance makes the Independent Expert&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>obligation of objectivity more imperative than ever and also means that he must be very </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.15-08296 
</p>
<p>circumspect and measured in what he says, in order to effectively support the country in its 
</p>
<p>journey towards stability and the consolidation of social peace and greater respect for 
</p>
<p>human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Security situation 
</b></p>
<p>15. Peace is the foundation necessary for economic and human development and the 
</p>
<p>promotion of all categories of human rights. The Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, with the 
</p>
<p>assistance of its international partners, is trying to establish lasting peace in the country. As 
</p>
<p>a result, there has been a remarkable improvement in security, which the Independent 
</p>
<p>Expert wishes to acknowledge, although it remains fragile. 
</p>
<p>16. In Abidjan, there are no longer illegal roadblocks or hold-ups organized by 
</p>
<p>uncontrolled forces. Elsewhere, particularly in the west, north and sometimes centre of the 
</p>
<p>country, the phenomenon of highway robbery still persists. The competent UNOCI units 
</p>
<p>record some 14 such incidents per month. There is also crime due, among other factors, to 
</p>
<p>the legacy of the long period of civil war, especially the economic difficulties it has created 
</p>
<p>for vulnerable population groups. 
</p>
<p>17. Some of this crime is committed by children in conflict with the law, often living in 
</p>
<p>precarious conditions with a poor family environment or no family environment at all. 
</p>
<p>These children are commonly referred to as &#8220;germs&#8221; (<i>microbes</i>), a term frequently used by 
</p>
<p>Ivorians in their everyday speech and in the media. The Independent Expert would like to 
</p>
<p>draw attention to the fact that this is a term that carries a strong stigma and is likely to 
</p>
<p>entrench juvenile offenders in their deviant behaviour. He therefore urges the Ivorian 
</p>
<p>authorities, the Ivorian media and Ivorian civil society to completely eliminate this highly 
</p>
<p>degrading term, which is used to describe some children in conflict with the law, from their 
</p>
<p>vocabulary. It should also be mentioned that these children and children in general are 
</p>
<p>victims of crime, including sexual abuse. The alarming phenomenon of child abduction is 
</p>
<p>common. Indeed, the Ivorian authorities have strongly condemned the practice and pledged 
</p>
<p>to combat it through appropriate preventive and punitive measures. 
</p>
<p>18. However, in terms of security, the risks of instability have not been entirely 
</p>
<p>eliminated. The Akou&#233;do military camp in Abidjan was attacked on the night of 17&#8211;18 
</p>
<p>September 2014. The attack resulted in the deaths of four members of the Forces 
</p>
<p>R&#233;publicaines de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (FRCI) and an attacker and injured several people, 
</p>
<p>including two UNOCI soldiers. Similarly, during the night of 9&#8211;10 January 2015, the Grabo 
</p>
<p>region was the scene of an attack by an armed commando in which three persons were 
</p>
<p>killed &#8211; two members of the FRCI and an assailant. The attack also led to the displacement 
</p>
<p>of more than 1,000 people. 
</p>
<p>19. The continued security risks in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire must be seen in the particular context 
</p>
<p>of the long period of violent disturbances that has only just abated, together with the 
</p>
<p>upcoming elections. The situation is thus linked to specific factors that require an 
</p>
<p>appropriate response. These factors include the difficulty in monitoring some geographical 
</p>
<p>areas, such as the porous border area in the north of the country and the many huge forest 
</p>
<p>areas. 
</p>
<p>20. In addition, the Dozo (a heterogeneous group of traditional hunters) and &#8220;comzones&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(former zone commanders) still have some influence in a few localities outside the capital. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, some of the ex-combatants are still in possession of firearms, while they wait 
</p>
<p>for the ongoing disarmament process to reach them. The authority responsible for the 
</p>
<p>disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants has identified 76,000 
</p>
<p>former combatants. </p>


<p>GE.15-08296 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>21. To date, more than 46,000 persons have been effectively disarmed, with some 
</p>
<p>30,000 remaining. The Government plans to finalize the whole disarmament operation by 
</p>
<p>about June 2015, which should contribute to the efforts to ensure a calm atmosphere ahead 
</p>
<p>of the next presidential elections and a climate conducive to sustainable economic and 
</p>
<p>social progress. The international community is actively helping to implement the 
</p>
<p>disarmament programme and should continue to support it through to its conclusion. 
</p>
<p>22. Social protest movements can sometimes have significant potential to destabilize. 
</p>
<p>However, social demands have almost invariably been followed by a dialogue in order to 
</p>
<p>avoid escalation. The Ivorian authorities clearly have the will to maintain an adequate level 
</p>
<p>of security and social peace. The anger of some elements of the Armed Forces who 
</p>
<p>demonstrated in Abidjan on 18 November 2014 was quickly calmed by the Government, 
</p>
<p>which reacted promptly and promised to meet their demands. The same is true of a recent 
</p>
<p>strike begun by prison guards. However, the dialogue with striking university teachers 
</p>
<p>continues, with a serious risk of the students not being able to take their examinations this 
</p>
<p>year. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Economic and social situation 
</b></p>
<p>23. A thriving economy can provide fertile ground for human rights to flourish. The 
</p>
<p>economic growth rate in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was in double figures in 2012 (10.5 per cent) and 8.5 
</p>
<p>per cent in 2014. Other indicators also point to the country&#8217;s reinvigorated economy. These 
</p>
<p>include the new investments in infrastructure, the return of the African Development Bank, 
</p>
<p>the resumption of long-haul flights connecting the capital with Europe, the improved 
</p>
<p>business climate reflected by international agencies and the establishment of a commercial 
</p>
<p>court. Another symbolic and timely event that raised hopes was the crowning of the C&#244;te 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;Ivoire football team as champions of the Africa Cup of Nations on 8 February 2015. 
</p>
<p>24. The Independent Expert commends the Ivorian Government on the economic 
</p>
<p>progress it is in the process of achieving, while encouraging it to strengthen efforts to 
</p>
<p>ensure that this progress benefits all segments of the population living in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, 
</p>
<p>firstly, because the impact of economic progress is only felt by the most disadvantaged 
</p>
<p>groups after a relatively long time and, secondly, because enlightened social policy is part 
</p>
<p>of a good economic recovery and should be pursued in tandem with it. 
</p>
<p>25. In addition, there are emergency situations that need to be addressed quickly. 
</p>
<p>Indeed, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire is ranked 171st of a total of 187 countries in terms of human 
</p>
<p>development.1 This means that there are still many people in need in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. One in 
</p>
<p>every two Ivorians lives below the poverty line. The Government is well aware that this 
</p>
<p>situation could have a negative impact on social and political stability and has taken or is 
</p>
<p>taking steps to meet the needs of the most disadvantaged groups. 
</p>
<p>26. In this regard, a national social protection strategy was adopted in 2013 (with action 
</p>
<p>plans in progress). One of the achievements under the strategy was the introduction of 
</p>
<p>universal social security coverage to make health care more accessible to the entire 
</p>
<p>population. Furthermore, a bill is being prepared to make education free and compulsory 
</p>
<p>until the age of 16. This is extremely important given that, according to statistics from the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), one in two 
</p>
<p>children has never attended school and is likely to be illiterate.

</p>
<p>27. In addition, a reform of the cocoa marketing chain has directly benefited 
</p>
<p>approximately 1 million farmers. Capacity-building projects for small and medium-sized 
</p>
<p>enterprises are under way, aimed, inter alia, at reducing the size of the informal sector and 
</p>
<p>combating unemployment. 
</p>
<p>28. The past two decades, marked by conflicts, the exacerbation of inter-ethnic tension 
</p>
<p>and violence, have seriously weakened social cohesion in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. The wounds 
</p>
<p>inflicted must be healed and that will take time. The process is already under way and must 
</p>
<p>continue without interruption. 
</p>
<p>29. Several institutions have been set up to help, directly or indirectly, to mend and 
</p>
<p>protect the social fabric. These include the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation 
</p>
<p>Commission, the National Programme for Social Cohesion, the Ombudsman and the 
</p>
<p>National Human Rights Institution. They are discussed later in this report, but first the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert would like to highlight, with both emotion and particular interest, a 
</p>
<p>point that is clear from most of the statements made by the Ivorian people with whom he 
</p>
<p>spoke. In short, but very revealingly, Ivorians are tired of the violence and endless disputes 
</p>
<p>of politicians. They want to live, here and now, a normal life in which they can flourish 
</p>
<p>without constraint and support their children to do the same. 
</p>
<p>30. The ordinary people of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire are eager for peace and development and want 
</p>
<p>their human rights to be respected. For those born in the 1950s, the &#8220;golden era&#8221; is not so 
</p>
<p>long ago. It is an ever-present part of their past, and they often talk about it nostalgically to 
</p>
<p>younger people, which is inspiring for everyone and offers them great hope. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p>31. During the period covered by this report, the Independent Expert received 
</p>
<p>information, particularly from United Nations agencies, concerning violations of the rights 
</p>
<p>to physical integrity, including acts of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, 
</p>
<p>arbitrary arrest and detention, sexual violence and violations of freedom of expression. In 
</p>
<p>December 2014, UNOCI documented two cases of human rights violations committed by 
</p>
<p>members of FRCI: one case of arbitrary arrest and detention and one case of torture and 
</p>
<p>cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. In December 2014, nine cases of rape were also 
</p>
<p>recorded, most of them committed by civilians. 
</p>
<p>32. In January 2015, the decline in the number of human rights violations committed by 
</p>
<p>FRCI registered in December 2014 continued. However, UNOCI noted the arbitrary arrest 
</p>
<p>and detention of two men in a military camp. The number of victims of sexual violence 
</p>
<p>remained stable, with 10 cases of rape. Eight suspects were arrested and three of them were 
</p>
<p>sentenced to between 3 and 5 years&#8217; imprisonment for indecent assault. 
</p>
<p>33. In February 2015, the Human Rights Division of UNOCI documented 22 cases of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations, which marked an increase compared to December 2014 and 
</p>
<p>January 2015. Twelve cases of human rights violations committed by FRCI soldiers were 
</p>
<p>recorded, including arbitrary arrests and detentions and inhuman and degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>The number of victims of rape also increased in February 2015, with 16 registered victims, 
</p>
<p>15 of whom were minors. In two cases, the alleged perpetrators were government officials, 
</p>
<p>one a teacher and the other a health worker. 
</p>
<p>34. On 12 February 2015, the Toumodi court of first instance sentenced a person for 
</p>
<p>indecent assault in a rape case. The Independent Expert notes with concern that rape is </p>


<p>GE.15-08296 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>often prosecuted as indecent assault before the criminal courts, which underestimates the 
</p>
<p>seriousness of this crime for the victims. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>35. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has a population of 20.8 million people, more than 50 per cent of 
</p>
<p>whom are under 24 years of age. This demographic profile poses major challenges to the 
</p>
<p>State in the areas of education and employment and in relation to social solidarity. 
</p>
<p>36. The country&#8217;s gradual economic recovery, which is well under way, could play a 
</p>
<p>decisive role in the promotion of economic and sociocultural rights. Macroeconomic 
</p>
<p>reforms have resulted in significant growth. In 2008, 49 per cent of the population was 
</p>
<p>living below the poverty line. Per capita gross domestic product has now increased by 15 
</p>
<p>per cent. The Government plans to carry out a survey on the situation of households in 
</p>
<p>March&#8211;April 2015 to assess the impact of this progress on the daily lives of all sectors of 
</p>
<p>society. The Government plans to try to reduce the level of poverty by half during the 
</p>
<p>current year. 
</p>
<p>37. This is clearly an ambitious goal, which will probably take longer to realize. The 
</p>
<p>Ivorian authorities should continue to develop and implement strategies to reduce poverty 
</p>
<p>among the population, with the assistance of international technical cooperation. Poverty 
</p>
<p>reduction involves many components, but the right to education, the right to work and the 
</p>
<p>right to health deserve the greatest attention. 
</p>
<p>38. The many years of unrest and violence have had a very negative impact on the 
</p>
<p>continuity and quality of teaching in educational institutions. According to the findings of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), 25 per cent of school-age children are not 
</p>
<p>enrolled in school. The dropout rate among those fortunate enough to have access to 
</p>
<p>education is very high (36 per cent continue to baccalaureate and 36 per cent complete 
</p>
<p>university). This makes it essential to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the quality of 
</p>
<p>teaching and the overall educational environment. 
</p>
<p>39. A bill is currently being drafted to make education free and compulsory until the age 
</p>
<p>of 16, which normally corresponds to the end of the first cycle of secondary school. 
</p>
<p>Adequate resources should be allocated to ensure that this welcome initiative is realized. It 
</p>
<p>is also important to continue to upgrade school and university facilities, enhance the 
</p>
<p>training of teaching staff and avoid losing academic years to university closures. 
</p>
<p>40. The problem of university residences still occupied by ex-combatants should be 
</p>
<p>resolved, as it is important that students have access to a minimum of social services to 
</p>
<p>enable them to focus seriously on their studies. The learning environment should be made 
</p>
<p>safe and free from all forms of abuse or discrimination. The rate of pregnancy among 
</p>
<p>primary and secondary school students is alarming. Solutions must be found to prevent it, 
</p>
<p>including by raising awareness of the seriousness of pregnancy and taking dissuasive 
</p>
<p>measures against those responsible for the pregnancies. Projects for the construction of 
</p>
<p>local schools and boarding schools for girls who have to study far from their families&#8217; 
</p>
<p>places of residence should be encouraged. 
</p>
<p>41. The Government has increased the guaranteed minimum interprofessional wage 
</p>
<p>from 36,600 CFA to 60,000 CFA. The guaranteed agricultural minimum wage is 25,000 
</p>
<p>CFA and the Government plans to increase it soon. Dialogue is ongoing with trade unions 
</p>
<p>and professional groups. As in many other developing countries, there is a large informal 
</p>
<p>economy in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, is a 
</p>
<p>worrying phenomenon. There are currently 160,000 students in public universities and as 
</p>
<p>many in private universities, and the number of students continues to increase rapidly. 
</p>
<p>However, only 43 per cent of those who obtain a university degree manage to join the </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.15-08296 
</p>
<p>labour market. Over time, this situation could have a destabilizing effect. The Government 
</p>
<p>should continue to pursue lasting solutions to the problem with the support of its 
</p>
<p>international partners. 
</p>
<p>42. In addition, the Government should continue its efforts to combat child labour, 
</p>
<p>especially in cocoa plantations and mines, and these efforts must be seriously supported by 
</p>
<p>international partners. The subregional dimension of this problem must be incorporated into 
</p>
<p>the responses that are considered. More generally, despite progress made in this area, many 
</p>
<p>Ivorian children still do not enjoy all the rights recognized under the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child. This state of affairs was analysed by the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Fund (UNICEF) in 2014. Action at national level to address these shortcomings should 
</p>
<p>continue with the support of international partners on the basis of the recommendations put 
</p>
<p>forward in the UNICEF report and those of the National Child Protection Policy adopted in 
</p>
<p>2012. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Justice and national reconciliation 
</b></p>
<p>43. The long years of unrest and violence have wreaked havoc on the infrastructure of 
</p>
<p>the judiciary. They have also seriously diminished human resources, damaged the training 
</p>
<p>and motivation of remaining staff and resulted in an increase in the number of unresolved 
</p>
<p>disputes. Bearing in mind the lawlessness that usually prevails in times of armed conflict, 
</p>
<p>this situation has encouraged a climate of impunity that is detrimental to the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>stability, reconciliation and social cohesion. 
</p>
<p>44. Reforming and restoring the justice system is a prerequisite to improving the human 
</p>
<p>rights situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. Of course, the Ivorian Government&#8217;s efforts in this area 
</p>
<p>must be recognized, commended and encouraged, especially since it is no easy task. 
</p>
<p>International partners must also continue to support these efforts. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Justice: Reforms under way 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Ivorian authorities&#8217; efforts to reform the justice system cover a number of areas. 
</p>
<p>Firstly, work is being undertaken in the area of human rights training and awareness-
</p>
<p>raising, targeted in particular at law enforcement personnel, NGOs, the media and young 
</p>
<p>people. United Nations bodies support these efforts at all levels in a cross-cutting manner 
</p>
<p>covering all dimensions of human rights. 
</p>
<p>46. In this regard, a promotional caravan on human rights issues organized in 
</p>
<p>collaboration with UNOCI toured all the regional capitals for one week. Another 
</p>
<p>audiovisual awareness-raising campaign plans to involve well-known Ivorian artists to take 
</p>
<p>advantage of their public profile. 
</p>
<p>47. A second aspect relates to the fight against impunity. In this regard, the national 
</p>
<p>commission of inquiry into the post-electoral crisis of 2010 submitted its report in 2012. 
</p>
<p>The report should serve as a road map for the development of a balanced strategy for the 
</p>
<p>judicial response to impunity. The special investigation unit (which did not have 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction) was replaced by the special investigation and examination unit in order to 
</p>
<p>initiate appropriate criminal prosecutions. 
</p>
<p>48. Criminal proceedings have already begun and the assize courts resumed their 
</p>
<p>sessions in December 2014 after having been forced to stop for more than 10 consecutive 
</p>
<p>years. In addition, despite the criticism it has faced, the work of the Dialogue, Truth and 
</p>
<p>Reconciliation Commission is also aimed at combating impunity in the sense that it leads to 
</p>
<p>reparations for victims. </p>


<p>GE.15-08296 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>49. The third aspect is justice reform. This involves the renovation of existing judicial 
</p>
<p>facilities and the establishment of new facilities, capacity-building in human resources in 
</p>
<p>terms of quantity and quality, legislative reform and setting the judicial machinery in 
</p>
<p>motion again to take advantage of all this progress. To date, many courts have been 
</p>
<p>refurbished and new courts have been built. A judicial academy is under construction and a 
</p>
<p>number of prisons, including the Abidjan Detention and Correctional Facility and the 
</p>
<p>Abidjan Military Detention Centre, have been restored as well as possible. The number of 
</p>
<p>judges remains insufficient to ensure the proper administration of justice, as there are less 
</p>
<p>than 700 for a population of 20.8 million. Efforts are being made, although they are 
</p>
<p>hampered by a lack of resources, to recruit approximately 25 new judges per year. An 
</p>
<p>inspection unit is also being set up in the Ministry. 
</p>
<p>50. The reform of the criminal justice system involves in particular the Criminal Code, 
</p>
<p>the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedure, the 
</p>
<p>regulations governing the judiciary, the juvenile justice system and the Court of Audit. A 
</p>
<p>commercial court has been established with the objective of regaining the trust of economic 
</p>
<p>actors in the country&#8217;s justice system. It is the first court of its kind in the region. In 
</p>
<p>addition, following the ratification of the Treaty of Rome, the process of bringing domestic 
</p>
<p>laws into line with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court has begun. 
</p>
<p>51. In this context, the death penalty has been abolished in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. This initiative 
</p>
<p>is warmly welcomed. The possibility of making the rulings of the assize courts subject to 
</p>
<p>appeal and ultimately abolishing juries is also being discussed. There is also a project for 
</p>
<p>the protection of witnesses and victims of crime. 
</p>
<p>52. Special attention is given to the situation of victims of sexual violence. A bill has 
</p>
<p>been passed that redefines rape, provides for harsher penalties and removes the requirement 
</p>
<p>that the victim produce a medical certificate before an investigation is opened into the 
</p>
<p>complaint. This procedural requirement, which, although it was not provided for by law, 
</p>
<p>was established as a rule by a number of criminal investigation officers, made it very 
</p>
<p>difficult for victims to lodge complaints because it was unaffordable. However, sexual 
</p>
<p>violence against women includes many other aspects that need to be addressed as a whole 
</p>
<p>(female genital mutilation, domestic violence, pregnant students, etc.). 
</p>
<p>53. Lastly, although this list is not exhaustive, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire adopted an Act on the 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights defenders on 20 June 2014. This is a significant step towards the 
</p>
<p>promotion of human rights. Of course, the Government must ensure that the Act is as 
</p>
<p>effective as it deserves to be, including by preparing the necessary instruments for its 
</p>
<p>implementation. Civil society should also establish a sense of ownership of the Act. 
</p>
<p>54. In addition to this series of reforms, both completed and in progress, there have been 
</p>
<p>capacity-building activities for legal and paralegal personnel. Training is provided to 
</p>
<p>judges, prosecutors and the police, especially on human rights. These areas have often 
</p>
<p>benefited, and continue to benefit, from the support of technical cooperation from several 
</p>
<p>international partners. This kind of cooperation should be increased in line with the 
</p>
<p>legitimate expectations of Ivorians and to the level required by the need for respect and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>55. Particular attention should also be paid to inquiries conducted into serious human 
</p>
<p>rights violations in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, international humanitarian law, the proceedings initiated 
</p>
<p>by the assize courts, the situation of persons in pretrial detention and the condition of 
</p>
<p>prisons.  </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.15-08296 
</p>
<p><b> B. Prosecutions: More progress should be made on some cases 
</b></p>
<p>56. More than a decade ago, allegations of human rights violations in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
</p>
<p>(committed between 19 September 2002 and 15 October 2004) had already been considered 
</p>
<p>in a report by an international commission of inquiry. That report came to the clear 
</p>
<p>conclusion that a number of serious violations of human rights and international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law had been committed during the period in question. The report also 
</p>
<p>highlighted the fact that the warring sides both had their own militia forces and it was those 
</p>
<p>forces that had committed the violations.  
</p>
<p>57. More recently, violations of human rights and international humanitarian law that 
</p>
<p>occurred between 31 October 2010 and 15 May 2011 were considered in a report by a 
</p>
<p>national commission of inquiry established pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 2011-176 
</p>
<p>of 20 July 2011. The report indicates that serious human rights violations were committed, 
</p>
<p>particularly against the right to life, the right to physical integrity and the right to security of 
</p>
<p>persons. They included executions, extrajudicial disappearances, sexual violence against 
</p>
<p>women and violations of international humanitarian law. The report also notes that these 
</p>
<p>violations were committed by groups belonging to both warring parties.  
</p>
<p>58. The establishment of a national commission of inquiry was both a judicious and a 
</p>
<p>courageous initiative seeking to uncover the truth about the violations in question. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, the subsequent establishment of a Special Investigation and Examination Unit, a 
</p>
<p>judicial mechanism responsible for leading the necessary criminal proceedings, 
</p>
<p>demonstrates the Ivorian Government&#8217;s commitment to combating impunity. The Unit must 
</p>
<p>be strengthened and provided with appropriate and sufficient means to carry out its delicate 
</p>
<p>and sensitive role in a professional and neutral way.  
</p>
<p>59. Furthermore, the assize courts have resumed their work in order to prosecute the 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of the serious violations committed during the crises that the country has gone 
</p>
<p>through. The Abidjan assize court has opened proceedings against 83 persons from the 
</p>
<p>regime of the former president, Laurent Gbagbo. Among the accused is Simone Gbagbo. 
</p>
<p>Most of the 83 defendants have been held in pretrial detention for some time, in some cases 
</p>
<p>since 2011. 
</p>
<p>60. Given the length of the pretrial detentions, these cases should be addressed as 
</p>
<p>promptly as possible but also, and above all, with complete respect for the guarantee of a 
</p>
<p>fair trial. The rights of the defence should be strictly respected in accordance with the law 
</p>
<p>and the international instruments ratified by C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, in particular the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>61. The charges against the defendants in question concern crimes against the security 
</p>
<p>of the State. They do not concern the violations of human rights or international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law that were indicated in the reports of the international and national 
</p>
<p>commissions of inquiry. However, these very serious crimes must not go unpunished. The 
</p>
<p>victims of these crimes are entitled to truth and justice. It should be stressed that justice 
</p>
<p>should be impartial and should make no distinction between perpetrators of the violations, 
</p>
<p>whatever their allegiance.  
</p>
<p>62. Equitable justice at all levels is a necessary step on the path towards breaking the 
</p>
<p>vicious circle of violence. This path should certainly be embarked on with caution to avoid 
</p>
<p>destroying the hard-won but fragile progress that has been made in security and economic 
</p>
<p>development, which benefits all Ivorians. However it must be recognized that no 
</p>
<p>achievement can be sustained if it is not endorsed by justice. 
</p>
<p>63. The Independent Expert was pleased to note that almost all those with whom he 
</p>
<p>discussed the issue agreed that justice must be impartial and equitable. It remains for that 
</p>
<p>conviction to be put fully into practice. </p>


<p>GE.15-08296 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>64. In addition to the case mentioned above that is currently before the Abidjan assize 
</p>
<p>court, dozens of civilians and military personnel are being held in pretrial detention in 
</p>
<p>connection with offences committed during the 2010 electoral crisis. They have been 
</p>
<p>awaiting trial for some time. A list of names drawn up by a group of wives of the detainees 
</p>
<p>arrested during the post-electoral crisis includes 441 persons, of whom 329 are civilians and 
</p>
<p>112 are military personnel. The majority are imprisoned in the Abidjan Detention and 
</p>
<p>Correction Centre, while others are being held in the Abidjan Military Detention Centre or 
</p>
<p>in regional prisons. Some of the detainees were arrested in 2011 and others later, between 
</p>
<p>2012 and 2014. 
</p>
<p>65. The Independent Expert would like to remind the Ivorian authorities of their 
</p>
<p>obligation, under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to bring all 
</p>
<p>detainees to trial as promptly as possible and to provisionally release those who do not need 
</p>
<p>to be detained pending trial. In that regard, the Independent Expert welcomes the 
</p>
<p>provisional release of 47 defendants, including some of the 83 standing trial in the Abidjan 
</p>
<p>assize court. The unfreezing of a number of bank accounts so that their beneficiaries can 
</p>
<p>use them to support themselves and their families is another commendable initiative. These 
</p>
<p>measures have a calming effect on social tensions despite the fact that the judicial process is 
</p>
<p>still ongoing.  
</p>
<p>66. It was noted that time limits for holding suspects in police custody prior to trial are 
</p>
<p>not always respected and the relevant penalties provided by law are not applied. It is 
</p>
<p>important to highlight that the length of police custody must be respected and suspects must 
</p>
<p>be brought before a court within the time limit specified by law. The presence of a lawyer 
</p>
<p>to assist suspects is also vital to minimize the risk of abuse.  
</p>
<p>67. An example is that of the attack on the Akou&#233;do military camp in Abidjan on the 
</p>
<p>night of 17&#8211;18 September 2014, which resulted in the deaths of four members of FRCI and 
</p>
<p>one attacker and left several persons injured, including two UNOCI soldiers. Following the 
</p>
<p>attack, 16 persons were arrested. Twelve of them are being held at the Abidjan Detention 
</p>
<p>and Correction Centre, and the remaining four, two of whom are civilians, were detained 
</p>
<p>for more than a month at a military camp in Abidjan run by an ex-comzone, before being 
</p>
<p>released on 14 November 2014. It seems that their arrest and detention in locations that did 
</p>
<p>not comply with international standards were not subject to judicial review.  
</p>
<p>68. Furthermore, one of these persons reported to UNOCI that he had been tortured and 
</p>
<p>that traces of violence remained visible on his body. Some detainees complained about the 
</p>
<p>time they spent in the National Surveillance Directorate (DST), the legality of which is 
</p>
<p>contested. However, on the whole, there has been an improvement in respecting the time 
</p>
<p>limits for suspects being detained on DST premises. The public prosecution service and the 
</p>
<p>judges concerned must apply the law by carefully fulfilling their duties to supervise and 
</p>
<p>monitor investigations and prosecutions conducted by the criminal police (Code of 
</p>
<p>Criminal Procedure, art. 13). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Prison 
</b></p>
<p>69. During his mission, the Independent Expert had the opportunity to visit the Abidjan 
</p>
<p>Detention and Correction Centre and the Abidjan Military Detention Centre. He also met 
</p>
<p>with Ms. Gbagbo whilst she was under house arrest. The country&#8217;s prisons are a clear 
</p>
<p>reflection of the damage caused to infrastructure by two decades of conflict.  
</p>
<p>70. Both detention centres are overcrowded. While the Abidjan Detention and 
</p>
<p>Correction Centre has a capacity of 1,500 detainees, it houses triple that number, that is, 
</p>
<p>4,561 detainees. The Abidjan Military Detention Centre, which housed 64 military 
</p>
<p>detainees and one civilian, only has the capacity to hold a third of that number in relatively </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.15-08296 
</p>
<p>decent conditions. Some convicts are serving sentences of between 5 and 20 years, but most 
</p>
<p>detainees are being held in pretrial detention, some having been held since 2011.  
</p>
<p>71. The Abidjan Military Detention Centre is dilapidated and extremely run-down. It 
</p>
<p>consists of two small buildings with insufficient ventilation and sunlight. In one of the 
</p>
<p>buildings, bunk beds are crammed into tiny rooms and other beds are spread over the floor, 
</p>
<p>blocking the corridor. The toilets and the shower are basic and detainees have to cope with 
</p>
<p>daily water cuts. The electrical system is antiquated which could be a danger to detainees. 
</p>
<p>However, they do have a clay courtyard where they are allowed to stretch their legs once a 
</p>
<p>day. The least run-down building houses the officers. 
</p>
<p>72. Detainees in the Abidjan Military Detention Centre are given three meals per day 
</p>
<p>and are allowed visits from families and lawyers twice a week. The nurse assigned to the 
</p>
<p>prison comes only occasionally due to transport difficulties. In addition to the prison 
</p>
<p>governor, the Abidjan Military Detention Centre has 11 guards who work night and day 
</p>
<p>shifts.  
</p>
<p>73. The Independent Expert was unable to visit the buildings containing the prison cells 
</p>
<p>of the Abidjan Detention and Correction Centre because he arrived at around 5 p.m., after 
</p>
<p>closing time. He was able to visit the sick-bay and the library, to have discussions with the 
</p>
<p>prison governor and take part in a meeting with representatives speaking on behalf of 
</p>
<p>detainees in the presence of the prison governor and some guards. Out of 4,561 detainees, 
</p>
<p>1,677, or approximately one third, were being held in pretrial detention. The total number 
</p>
<p>includes 59 minors who are housed in 5 shared cells. Consistent testimonies state that 
</p>
<p>prison conditions are a major concern. Particular attention should be paid to this situation in 
</p>
<p>order to remedy shortcomings.  
</p>
<p>74. Some detainees arrested during the post-electoral crisis of 2010&#8211;2011 had been on a 
</p>
<p>hunger strike, which they had ended following a visit on Christmas Eve from A&#239;chatou 
</p>
<p>Mindaoudou Souleymane, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for C&#244;te 
</p>
<p>d&#8217;Ivoire. Some of those who had taken part in the strike are still very weak and their health 
</p>
<p>requires close medical attention.  
</p>
<p>75. At the Abidjan Detention and Correction Centre, detainees receive two meals a day 
</p>
<p>and do not cost the State more than 300 CFA francs per day. They are entitled to a weekly 
</p>
<p>visit from their families. However, a visiting permit must be obtained from the judicial 
</p>
<p>authorities prior to every visit. The detainees complain about the practical difficulties that 
</p>
<p>their families have in obtaining a new visiting permit each time. Pretrial detention periods 
</p>
<p>are long, with some detainees having been held since 2011. It is worth noting that several 
</p>
<p>default judgements have been passed when detainees were not present at trial because of 
</p>
<p>problems with transport. There is no doubt that the resources available to the Centre are 
</p>
<p>insufficient and the equipment inadequate. 
</p>
<p>76. When the Independent Expert visited Ms. Gbagbo, she was under house arrest in 
</p>
<p>acceptable conditions of imprisonment. Her lawyers had been given open permission to 
</p>
<p>visit and talk with her. Two of her lawyers visited her during her meeting with the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert. They voiced their concerns over the ethnic origin of the jury that had 
</p>
<p>been chosen to sit alongside the judges. They also highlighted the fact that Ms. Gbagbo&#8217;s 
bank account had been blocked and she could no longer pay their fees. Furthermore, they 
</p>
<p>claimed that approximately 100 suspects from &#8220;the opposing side&#8221; had already been 
summonsed by judges, but had neither presented themselves to the courts nor were being 
</p>
<p>obliged to do so.  </p>

<p><b> D. Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission  
</b></p>
<p>77. The victims of serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law 
</p>
<p>are entitled to truth, justice, reparations and non-repetition of the abuses that they have 
</p>
<p>suffered. The Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission consisted of 10 national 
</p>
<p>commissioners and 37 local commissions. The commissions were largely open to broad 
</p>
<p>participation and included religious and traditional leaders, women, young people, 
</p>
<p>representatives of civil society and of the Economic Community of West African States. 
</p>
<p>The Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission had a three-year mandate.  
</p>
<p>78. The Commission&#8217;s most important task was to restore and strengthen social 
</p>
<p>cohesion between communities in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. It heard 72,483 persons, including 28,064 
</p>
<p>women and 757 children. It also held public hearings, although they were not broadcast by 
</p>
<p>the audiovisual media services. The final report of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation 
</p>
<p>Commission was submitted to the President of the Republic on 15 December 2014. It has 
</p>
<p>not yet been published and it is therefore difficult to give a detailed opinion on the outcome 
</p>
<p>of the Commission&#8217;s work.  
</p>
<p>79. Nevertheless, the information collected by the Independent Expert was often critical 
</p>
<p>of the work of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In particular, its 
</p>
<p>hearings were criticized for not being accessible enough to the public. The places where the 
</p>
<p>hearings were held were not sufficiently publicized and the audiovisual media did not 
</p>
<p>broadcast them.  
</p>
<p>80. There is no doubt that the lack of publicity surrounding the Commission&#8217;s hearings 
</p>
<p>may have reduced the benefits it would have otherwise brought to victims. Although there 
</p>
<p>are a few legitimate exceptions, victims generally need their grievances to be recognized 
</p>
<p>publicly and the crimes that caused them to be denounced as what they were. It is thus 
</p>
<p>advisable that the Commission&#8217;s report be made public. The content belongs to the victims 
</p>
<p>and to all Ivorians, since they have the right to be informed of the nature and extent of the 
</p>
<p>criminal acts committed.  
</p>
<p>81. On receiving the Commission&#8217;s report, the President of the Republic formally 
</p>
<p>announced the establishment of a fund to provide reparations for victims. He allocated 10 
</p>
<p>million CFA francs to the fund for 2015 and has called upon the international community to 
</p>
<p>offer its support. This initiative should be commended and encouraged because it puts the 
</p>
<p>victims of the violence that has cast a shadow over the country at the heart of the debate on 
</p>
<p>reconciliation. It will, of course, be necessary to define the notion of a victim, as someone 
</p>
<p>legally entitled to reparations, to coordinate the list of victims compiled by the Commission 
</p>
<p>with those drawn up by different government departments, to decide on the types of and 
</p>
<p>modalities for reparation and to appoint an authority to be in charge of putting the initiative 
</p>
<p>in place in the most efficient and transparent way. The Independent Expert calls upon the 
</p>
<p>international community to offer financial and technical assistance to the fund, which is one 
</p>
<p>of the pillars of lasting national reconciliation, in order to allow reparations to be awarded 
</p>
<p>to the victims. 
</p>
<p><b> E. National Programme for Social Cohesion 
</b></p>
<p>82. The violence that marked the past two decades has sown discord and mistrust among 
</p>
<p>the different communities in Ivorian society. It is necessary to bring back harmony and trust 
</p>
<p>among Ivorians in order to build a lasting peace and restore a climate that favours human 
</p>
<p>development. The National Programme for Social Cohesion was established to achieve that 
</p>
<p>goal. The Programme was launched in 2012 for a renewable period of four years. It is run 
</p>
<p>by a national coordination group and has regional branches. The Programme has been </p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.15-08296 
</p>
<p>assigned a budget of 7 billion CFA francs and receives support and technical cooperation 
</p>
<p>from a number of United Nations bodies.  
</p>
<p>83. Above all, the Programme takes two approaches to tackling the social tensions that 
</p>
<p>fuelled the crises of the past two decades. The first looks at the disagreements that emerged 
</p>
<p>at the top of the political hierarchy. These were rooted in the ideology of &#8220;l&#8217;ivoirit&#233;&#8221; and 
resulted in armed conflicts. The second approach addresses the grassroots and concerns 
</p>
<p>land disputes and intercultural and ethnic tensions within the population. 
</p>
<p>84. In order to restore social cohesion, the Programme focuses on four major areas: 
</p>
<p>peace, solidarity, intercultural dialogue and reconciliation. As part of the Programme, a 
</p>
<p>number of actions have been taken to reinforce these values. The most important is 
</p>
<p>awareness-raising. In practice, this involves carrying out actions to educate people about 
</p>
<p>community spirit, tolerance and acceptance of differences. Above all, emphasis has been 
</p>
<p>placed on the important role of the media in preserving peaceful coexistence among 
</p>
<p>Ivorians. They have been encouraged to act responsibly and give priority to stories which 
</p>
<p>promote respect for differences and constructive dialogue. The fact that 2015 is an election 
</p>
<p>year means that these activities must be given particular attention. 
</p>
<p>85. In this process of appeasing tensions between communities, the Programme is an 
</p>
<p>attempt to involve all those who could play a significant role in exerting social and cultural 
</p>
<p>influence, such as religious and traditional leaders and human rights organizations. It is also 
</p>
<p>noteworthy that the Programme continually maps out areas of tension which require close 
</p>
<p>and fairly urgent monitoring. It goes on to outline the interventions that need to be made, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with its means, and attempts to find sustainable solutions.   
</p>
<p>86. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire also has an Ombudsman who plays an important mediatory role 
</p>
<p>between the citizens and the administration, without actually intervening in judicial 
</p>
<p>disputes.  
</p>
<p>87. There is no doubt that the Programme&#8217;s task of monitoring social cohesion increases 
</p>
<p>the need for capacity in logistics and human resources. It must strengthen its presence 
</p>
<p>across all the regions of the country in order to bring about better and lasting results. The 
</p>
<p>move must be made from raising awareness on the importance of social cohesion to 
</p>
<p>achieving the support of the majority of the country&#8217;s population for these values and their 
</p>
<p>translation into practice. It is for that reason that the Programme should be backed and 
</p>
<p>strongly supported by the international community, particularly by United Nations bodies. 
</p>
<p><b> F. National Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>88. A national human rights commission was first established in 2004. In the early 
</p>
<p>stages, the Commission did not comply with the Paris Principles. The legislation 
</p>
<p>establishing the new national human rights institution that is currently in operation (Act No. 
</p>
<p>2012-1132) received sustained technical support from the Human Rights Division of 
</p>
<p>UNOCI and now complies better with the Paris Principles. The status, the structures and the 
</p>
<p>mandate of the National Human Rights Commission are proof of this commendable 
</p>
<p>achievement.  
</p>
<p>89. It comprises both a national commission and regional commissions. Overall, it is 
</p>
<p>participatory in nature, and this aspect should be enhanced. In its article 1, the Act gives the 
</p>
<p>National Human Rights Commission legal personality as well as independence and 
</p>
<p>financial autonomy. Its mandate is relatively broad, encompassing the duties to provide 
</p>
<p>consultation services to the Government, to monitor the human rights situation in the 
</p>
<p>country (including in particular the possibility of carrying out investigations and visiting 
</p>
<p>places of detention) and to deal with the non-judicial aspects of complaints concerning 
</p>
<p>violations of fundamental human rights.  </p>


<p>GE.15-08296 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>90. The National Human Rights Commission advises the competent authorities on the 
</p>
<p>harmonization of national law with international human rights standards and is helping to 
</p>
<p>draw up the reports required by the United Nations human rights treaty bodies. In general, 
</p>
<p>the Commission works together with national and international human rights entities. The 
</p>
<p>Commission must submit an annual report to both the President of the Republic and all 
</p>
<p>governmental institutions; it is also published.  
</p>
<p>91. The National Human Rights Commission has already considered many different 
</p>
<p>areas. They include focused protection activities following complaints concerning human 
</p>
<p>rights violations, advocacy for vulnerable populations, particularly those that have been 
</p>
<p>forced out of shanty towns and national park forests with no prospect of being promptly 
</p>
<p>rehoused, visits to prisons, on the basis of which reports are then published, with emphasis 
</p>
<p>on their overcrowded and unhygienic state, meetings with political parties in order to 
</p>
<p>strengthen the national dialogue with a view to ensure that the forthcoming elections take 
</p>
<p>place in a peaceful atmosphere and to contribute to drawing up the universal periodic 
</p>
<p>report.  
</p>
<p>92. Monthly meetings are organized with the Human Rights Division of UNOCI in 
</p>
<p>order to review the human rights situation in the country. These meetings have led to the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a human rights forum intended to strengthen collaboration between the 
</p>
<p>National Human Rights Commission and civil society and enabled the development of a 
</p>
<p>strategy on the prevention of human rights violations for 2015.  
</p>
<p>93. The conditions in which the National Human Rights Commission has to carry out its 
</p>
<p>work should be improved in two respects. Firstly, its autonomy, which is clearly stipulated 
</p>
<p>in the body&#8217;s founding text, should be better guaranteed. The relationship between the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice, Human Rights and Public Freedoms and the National Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission should be one of mutual cooperation rather than of administrative supervision. 
</p>
<p>The present situation arises from the fact that the Commission&#8217;s budget needs to be 
</p>
<p>approved by the Minister of Justice (Act No. 2012-1132, art. 38) and the amounts awarded 
</p>
<p>to its members are also determined by the Minister (art. 25).  
</p>
<p>94. Furthermore, the procedure for the appointment of members of the regional 
</p>
<p>commissions needs to be reviewed. The National Human Rights Commission should, 
</p>
<p>legally, have a say in the appointment procedure which is currently carried out by order of 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Justice, Human Rights and Public Freedoms following a proposal from the 
</p>
<p>prefect of the region (Act No. 2012-1132, art. 12). It is also vital that the Commission 
</p>
<p>should raise its profile, which depends on whether it has adequate resources, on the courage 
</p>
<p>and commitment of its members as well as on the constructive cooperation of the public 
</p>
<p>authorities. 
</p>
<p>95. The National Human Rights Commission is not yet two years old. Indeed, its work 
</p>
<p>is still in the early stages and it has at times been faced with security challenges from within 
</p>
<p>the country. The Commission needs to develop and implement a good information strategy 
</p>
<p>for its activities and cultivate its relations with outside bodies. This requires improved 
</p>
<p>internal organization, capacity-building for its members and increased funds that are spent 
</p>
<p>wisely. With that in mind, reports on the human rights situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire drawn up 
</p>
<p>by the Commission should be published and quickly made available to the public. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, the Commission&#8217;s website should be made a priority. These recommendations 
</p>
<p>will help the Commission to better comply with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Independent Electoral Commission 
</b></p>
<p>96. The 2015 presidential elections will be a critical time to test the strength of the 
</p>
<p>efforts made by C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire in favour of democracy. It is the responsibility of the Ivorian </p>


<p><b>18</b> GE.15-08296 
</p>
<p>Government and also that of all other key players on the political scene, such as political 
</p>
<p>parties, civil society (both modern and traditional) and the international community, to 
</p>
<p>protect and build on those efforts through constructive, technical cooperation.  
</p>
<p>97. The Independent Electoral Commission is a constitutional institution (Constitution, 
</p>
<p>article 32, para. 4). Its aim is to ensure that elections are transparent and lawful. It 
</p>
<p>represents an institutional achievement intended to put an end to the time when elections 
</p>
<p>were organized and monitored by the Ministry of the Interior alone. A sustained dialogue 
</p>
<p>has been initiated with the opposition parties in order to ensure the balanced representation 
</p>
<p>of all political parties within the Commission. The outcome was satisfactory, with the 
</p>
<p>inclusion of an opposition party.  
</p>
<p>98. The Independent Electoral Commission is faced with many challenges in ensuring 
</p>
<p>that the forthcoming presidential elections run smoothly. It is primarily a question of 
</p>
<p>updating the electoral register, mapping electoral districts and reforming the Electoral 
</p>
<p>Code. However, the greatest challenges relate to training opportunities for politicians and 
</p>
<p>ways in which they will educate voters. Security is also a major challenge and must be 
</p>
<p>assured so that all citizens can adequately exercise their right to vote in satisfactory 
</p>
<p>conditions. In principle, all Ivorian citizens aged 18 or over have the right to vote. In order 
</p>
<p>to meet this standard, it is necessary to find a solution to the fact that many citizens do not 
</p>
<p>have identity cards. Moreover, it is crucial to address the situation of Ivorians living abroad 
</p>
<p>so that they can exercise their right to vote. For instance, it is estimated that there are 
</p>
<p>between 60,000 and 80,000 Ivorians in Liberia.  
</p>
<p>99. There is no doubt that the Independent Electoral Commission is an important step 
</p>
<p>towards achieving peaceful and transparent elections. Nonetheless, the lack of civil society 
</p>
<p>representatives in local commissions is disappointing. There is a tendency to justify this by 
</p>
<p>the difficulties encountered in finding a balance of representatives from all parts of the 
</p>
<p>country, but many civil society actors are not convinced. Moreover, the refusal of one 
</p>
<p>opposition party to participate in the Independent Electoral Commission is likely to weaken 
</p>
<p>the Commission&#8217;s power and undermine its authority. Political dialogue should continue in 
</p>
<p>order to overcome this setback as efficiently as possible.  
</p>
<p>100. Voter apathy should be combated by raising more awareness of the fact that voting 
</p>
<p>is extremely important for the future of the country. The Commission should also ensure 
</p>
<p>that all political parties have equal access to the audiovisual media (all of which are State-
</p>
<p>owned) and to the official print media. It is also important to continue enhancing security in 
</p>
<p>the country because that is the foundation on which any lasting political, economic and 
</p>
<p>social progress can be built. All of these aspects require consistent support from the 
</p>
<p>international community.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>It is noteworthy that, during its universal periodic review, C&#244;te d</b>&#8217;<b>Ivoire 
</b></p>
<p><b>accepted almost all the recommendations made by the Member States of the United 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nations Human Rights Council. On 18 and 19 March 2015, C&#244;te d</b>&#8217;<b>Ivoire also 
</b></p>
<p><b>submitted its initial report, 20 years overdue, to the Human Rights Committee. This 
</b></p>
<p><b>attitude shows that C&#244;te d</b>&#8217;<b>Ivoire is committed to constructive collaboration. This 
</b></p>
<p><b>report seeks to modestly strengthen this process and to provide guidance to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Ivorian Government in its efforts to honour its international human rights obligations 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the benefit of the Ivorian people.</b>  </p>

</p>
<p>103. <b>The Independent Expert recommends that the international community 
</b></p>
<p><b>should: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Provide financial support and technical assistance for the Government</b>&#8217;<b>s 
</b></p>
<p><b>capacity-building efforts in the judicial system with a view to combating, in an
