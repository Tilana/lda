<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> At the invitation of the Government of Spain, the Special Rapporteur visited the country 
from 20 November to 1 December 2006. The general objectives of the mission were to examine 
and report on the status of realization of the right to adequate housing and other related rights in 
the country, with particular attention to aspects of gender equality and non-discrimination; to 
engage in dialogues with the Government and civil society in their efforts to secure these rights; 
and to identify practical solutions and best practices in the realization of rights related to the 
mandate. 
</p>
<p> In this report, the Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that adequate housing is 
recognized as a constitutional right in Spain and points to the positive steps that have been taken 
by the central and regional authorities in order to implement the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p> Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur also notes that economic and financial factors, 
including widespread speculation, have had negative impacts on the right to adequate housing in 
Spain. Affordability and the lack of public housing stock, in particular rental housing, has 
affected large sectors of the population. 
</p>
<p> One of the most significant elements of Spanish housing policy, compared to other 
European Union countries, is the priority given during the last decades to the homeownership 
model through different instruments such as tax policy and public housing. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that the functioning of the market, the current homeownership model and its 
possible negative impact on low-income housing options should be seriously reflected upon and 
necessitates State intervention in the market. 
</p>
<p> At the end of his report, the Special Rapporteur addresses a number of recommendations 
that he believes to be necessary to implement the constitutional and international obligations of 
Spain. These recommendations include a comprehensive and coordinated national housing 
policy based on human rights and the protection of the most vulnerable as well as heavy 
penalization of practices such as &#8220;real estate mobbing&#8221;, corruption and discrimination in the real 
estate sector. The Special Rapporteur calls for immediate attention to be paid to particular 
groups, including women, youth, the elderly, people with disabilities, Roma (<i>gitano</i>) 
communities, migrants and the homeless, and for ensuring justiciability of the right to adequate 
housing. </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of Spain, the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing 
as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, Miloon Kothari, undertook a 
mission to the country from 20 November to 1 December 2006. During his mission, he visited 
Madrid, Bilbao, San Sebastian, Almeria, El Ejido, Roquetas de Mar, Sevilla, Barcelona and 
Zaragoza. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur met with high-level representatives at State, autonomous region 
and local levels, including the Minister of Housing, Ms. Maria Antonia Trujillo; the Secretary of 
State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Bernardino Le&#243;n Gross; the Mayor of El Ejido, Mr. Juan Enciso 
Ru&#237;z; the Vice-Mayor of Seville, Mr. Emilio Carrillo; the Ombudsman of Andalucia, 
Mr. Jos&#233; Chamizo de la Rubia; the Counsellor of Catalonia, Mr. Francesc Baltasar; the Mayor 
of Barcelona, Mr. Jordi Hereu; the Special Prosecutor on environment and housing, 
Mr. Antonio Vercher Noguera; and other high-ranking officials. 
</p>
<p>3. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with a large number of 
representatives of civil society, including social movements, non-governmental organizations, 
academics, women&#8217;s groups and representatives of minorities such as the Roma (<i>gitanos</i>).<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his gratitude to the Government of Spain for the 
invitation, the support it provided during this mission and its constructive response to his 
preliminary observations. He hopes that this visit and the present report will contribute positively 
to the efforts of the authorities to implement the right to adequate housing in the country and 
looks forward to continuing his collaboration with the Spanish authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Housing rights within the constitutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>5. The right to a &#8220;decent and adequate housing&#8221; (<i>una vivienda digna y adecuada</i>) is 
recognized in article 47 of the Spanish Constitution. This article includes two important 
obligations for the authorities, to promote the necessary conditions, and to establish appropriate 
standards to implement the right and the obligation to regulate the use of land in order to prevent 
speculation. The Constitution also recognizes the need to involve specific groups in relevant 
policymaking in addition to their right to participate in the conduct of public affairs.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>6. The Constitution also contains provisions to protect the &#8220;social function&#8221; of the right to 
private property (art. 33) and &#8220;the right to enjoy an environment suitable for the development of 
the person&#8221; (art. 45). Moreover, article 10 states that the &#8220;Provisions relating to the fundamental 
</p>

</p>
<p>from other parts of Europe.

</p>
<p>rights and liberties recognized by the Constitution shall be construed in conformity with the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international treaties and agreements thereon ratified 
by Spain&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Decentralized competencies and housing 
</b></p>
<p>7. The kingdom of Spain is a decentralized State formed by 17 Autonomous Communities 
and 2 autonomous cities (Ceuta and Melilla). In this context, legal regulation of housing issues in 
Spain involves not only the central level but also the regional and local levels. 
</p>
<p>8. While article 148 of the Constitution establishes that the Autonomous Communities may 
assume (<i>podr&#225;n asumir</i>) competences over a certain number of matters including town and 
country planning and housing, the regional constitutions (<i>Estatutos de Autonom&#237;a</i>), subsequently 
adopted, clarified that the Autonomous Communities have exclusive competences on housing 
and urbanism. Nevertheless, Autonomous Communities are required to implement and develop 
housing plans established by the central Government.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>9. Article 149 of the Constitution lays down the competencies of the central State which is 
responsible for the establishment of general guidelines for housing programmes (such as 
modalities of protection for public housing and its minimum period of time); of the national 
housing plans (<i>Planes Estatales de Vivienda</i>) to be developed and implemented by the 
Autonomous Communities; and the distribution of credit and housing taxation (such as tax 
policy, regulation of mortgages and access to loans).<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>10. Whilst direct competences for housing are in the hands of the Autonomous Communities, 
the central State has a legal obligation to promote the equal exercise of the rights within the 
territory (art. 149.1.1 of the Constitution). It has also jurisdiction over basic norms relative to the 
promotion of public land through the national Land Law, and the minimum amount of land to be 
dedicated to social purposes. The central State is also in charge of civil legislation (art. 149.1.8) 
which includes access to land, social housing, rentals, rehabilitation and compulsory 
expropriation (art. 149.1.18). It is also in charge of the economic and financial policies, through 
basic rules and coordination of general economic planning (art. 149.1.13) and general financial 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>3
</b>  In its sentence 125/1988 of 20 July 1988, the Constitutional tribunal stated that Autonomous 
</p>
<p>Communities must follow Central State&#8217;s National Plan because of the competences of the 
central State in general economic planning (art. 149.1.13) and general financial affairs 
(art. 149.1.14). In its sentence 61/1997 of 20 March 1997, the Constitutional tribunal had to 
consider the constitutionality of certain provisions of the 1997 Land Law (<i>Texto Refundido de 
la Ley de Reforma del R&#233;gimen del Suelo y Valoraciones</i>). In this sentence, the Tribunal defined 
the limits of the central State&#8217;s intervention in property, expropriation and valuation of land.

</p>
<p>affairs and State debt (art. 149.1.14). The central State is competent on the questions of 
immigration, status of aliens and right of asylum (art. 149.1.2), international relations 
(art. 149.1.3), and basic legislation on environmental protection (art. 149.1.23). 
</p>
<p>11. Autonomous and State legislation<b>5</b> also grants significant powers to municipal 
governments (<i>ayuntamientos</i>)<b>6</b> in matters concerning planning, management, and development of 
public stock of land (<i>patrimonios p&#250;blicos de suelo</i>), as well as improving and upgrading 
existing urban areas. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ISSUES RELATED TO THE RIGHT TO HOUSING 
</b></p>
<p>12. One of the most significant elements of the Spanish housing policy, compared to other 
European Union countries, is the priority given during the last decades to the homeownership 
model through different instruments such as tax policy and public housing. According to the 
National Institute of Statistics, in 2001, 82 per cent of families live in privately owned homes.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>13. The authorities have identified several problems in housing in Spain. These include 
insufficient stock of public and private rented dwellings, the distortion caused by the high level 
of capital flooding the housing market, the number of vacant housing units, inappropriate 
frameworks for renting homes and for building on vacant land and the shortage of affordably 
priced developable land (mainly for the middle-income population).<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Affordability 
</b></p>
<p>14. Among developed countries, Spain has experienced one of the highest increases in housing 
prices in recent years. During the last five years, housing prices have increased in real terms at 
an average annual rate of almost 10 per cent. Prices in Madrid and Barcelona increased by well 
over 100 per cent between 1997 and 2007.<b>9</b>

</b>  By virtue of Law 7/1985 of 2 April 1985 (<i>Ley de Bases del R&#233;gimen Local</i>).

</b>  There are more than 8,000 municipal governments (<i>ayuntamientos</i>) in Spain.

</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur notes that by 2006 the cost of an average house would require 
paying more than 40 per cent of an average income on mortgages.<b>10</b> During his visit, he received 
a number of testimonies by persons who were defaulting on their payments due to various 
reasons, inter alia, precarious work or unemployment and increases in interest rates.<b>11</b> Spain has 
experienced a rise in mortgage interest rates in recent years.<b>12</b> Although it is reported that the 
percentage of vulnerable people in Spain with a mortgage in default in September 2006 was only 
0.3 per cent,<b>13</b> the Special Rapporteur is convinced that such a situation is not sustainable in the 
long term, and more people will experience payment problems in the future, which could affect 
their right to adequate housing.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the increase in housing prices has been showing 
clear signs of slowing down. Nevertheless, he is particularly concerned that the current housing 
system will increasingly affect the middle-income population. 
</p>
<p>17. Reportedly, default on payment was the cause of some evictions. Evictions, whether legal 
or illegal, have a serious impact on individuals, in particular on women and children. In this 
context, the Special Rapporteur has developed a set of guidelines aiming at helping Governments 
in situations where evictions are unavoidable and when no alternative can be found.<b>15</b>

<p>  About 80 per cent of Spanish families cannot save money each month because of the 
payments of mortgages and other debts. Moreover, 10 per cent of the population cannot pay 
their debts (<i>Expansi&#243;n</i>, 1 November 2006, p. 30, available at http://www.ces.es/servlet/

<p>  According to the data of the Spanish Mortgage Association (<i>Asociaci&#243;n Hipotecaria 
Espa&#241;ola</i>, <i>AHE</i>), information provided by the Spanish authorities. 
<b>14
</b></p>
<p>  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has also expressed a 
similar concern: &#8220;Despite some signs of a property market slowdown, residential investment has 
reached 9.2 per cent of GDP, real estate prices are still rising about 10 per cent per year and 
household mortgage borrowing is growing excessively&#8221; (OECD Policy Brief, Economic Survey 
of Spain, January 2007).

</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that important events, such as the Olympic 
Games,<b>16</b> as well as tourism and secondary houses, have fuelled speculation in land and a steep 
rise in the prices of housing in the concerned cities, including Barcelona, Seville and some 
coastal cities. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Public housing 
</b></p>
<p>19. In Spain, public housing assistance (referred to as <i>vivienda de protecci&#243;n oficial</i> VPO) 
consists of financial and non-financial assistance to rent, purchase and rehabilitate.<b>17</b> The system 
not only provides subsidies for renting and purchasing VPO units, but also establishes maximum 
rental and sale prices. Currently, VPO housing prices are up to 50 per cent lower than the 
free-market value, and it is estimated that 25 per cent of the total housing stock has received 
some kind of VPO housing subsidy. 
</p>
<p>20. Yet, as recognized by the authorities, insufficient supply of rental and subsidized housing 
is a major problem in Spain.<b>18</b> The stock of subsidized rented dwellings is scarce and does not 
satisfy the immediate and future needs of the population. In the early 2000s, it accounted for just 
6.3 per cent of all main residences, compared to the European average of 13.7 per cent, while the 
number of low-cost dwellings being rented covered only 35.4 per cent of poor households, as 
against 72.8 per cent on average in Europe.<b>19</b> Virtually, all of it is in the private sector with 
only 2 per cent of dwellings classified as public social housing. In addition, although lower 
than in the private market, prices of social housing tend to be too high for the lower-income

<p>  <i>Economic Survey of Spain 2005: Stabilising the housing market</i>, available at 
http://www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/spain. The Study states that &#8220;low supply of low-rent housing is 
liable to cause growing problems in the future, because of the probable rise in captive demand 
for this type of accommodation due to the increase in immigration. Seventy per cent of 
immigrants rent their homes and most of them live in large towns where real estate prices are the 
highest&#8221;. </p>

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>segments of the population.<b>20</b> The liberalization of rental contracts and the lack of a public 
stock of affordable housing have contributed to a considerable rise in private rental prices.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>21. The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that since 2004, 271,697 units of 
VPO have been initiated (94,638 in the last 12 months). However, the demand for social 
housing seems superior to this. The last draws<b>22</b> made to attribute social housing from 
applications received covered only 2.8 per cent of the 54,440 applications in Barcelona, 
1.9 per cent of the 53,431 applications in Sevilla, and 5.5 per cent of the 23,737 applications in 
Malaga.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>22. The provisions of the New Land Law in force since 2007 seem to try to address this 
situation by applying a minimum land reserve for subsidized housing. It has been stated that this 
legal technique, if applied consistently over time, would have two effects. First, it will address 
the problems of a wide spectrum of society and satisfy the latter&#8217;s need for housing at prices 
which are ostensibly lower than those of the market. And secondly it will put pressure on the 
freehold property market which, if the supply of subsidized housing is sufficiently great and 
constant over time, will tend to limit price increases.<b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>23. According to official information, the level of financing for protected homes in Spain has 
increased recently, reaching the levels of the 1990s. Over 410,000 families have benefited from 
some kind of financial help for housing in the past two and a half years. Besides providing 
financial help to buyers and tenants, VPOs also set limits on the maximum prices of these units. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>20
</b>  The Special Rapporteur is of the view that a sizable percentage of the population may be 
</p>
<p>falling into this category. Figures indicate that 19.9 per cent of the Spanish population live 
below the poverty line. See <i>Encuesta de Condiciones de Vida, A&#241;o 2004, Principales resultados, 
5 de diciembre de 2005</i>, available at http://www.ine.es/prensa/np394.pdf. 
<b>21
</b></p>
<p>  This liberalization followed a period of rigid control on rents which contributed to the 
reluctance of owners to rent. 
<b>22
</b></p>
<p>  As the number of applications is far more important than the public stock, a lottery takes place 
periodically in each location to attribute the public housing available or under construction.

<p>Public protection is granted for a limited period of time - at least 30 years - after which the house 
can enter the free market. The 2005-2008 Housing Plan foresees an increase in subsidies for 
house purchases by low-income groups. In January 2006, the Ministry of Housing approved a 
60 per cent increase in the price of VPO in 64 cities. In addition, a new type of VPO was created 
(<i>vivienda concertada</i>). This type of VPO is especially orientated towards middle-class-income 
families who do not qualify for help under the normal VPO conditions but who cannot afford to 
access the free market housing either. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur notes, however, that aspects of the VPO system have come under 
criticism from various quarters. The system of draws for attribution of public housing and the 
usual requirement by municipalities that participants have between five and seven years of legal 
residence may be detrimental to families or persons in the most immediate need for this kind of 
housing. It has been reported that the system of draws is also being used by some for speculative 
purposes. Cases of fraudulent sale of these units during the protection period have also been 
reported. Moreover, the possibility of selling the VPO after the legal time limit in the free 
market has been said to hamper the consolidation of the public housing stock. Moreover, the 
multiplicity of VPO registers has reportedly been detrimental to a coordinated approach to the 
problem. 
</p>
<p>25. Although the price of VPO is lower than that of the market, it still seems too high for parts 
of the population, particularly for the most vulnerable groups. The system therefore seems to 
benefit only some groups of the population that can afford the purchase of a house and leaves 
aside those who cannot purchase or sustain the payment of mortgages or rents. Moreover, 
according to experience, the subsidization of purchases has not proven to be an effective tool for 
reducing market prices. What is more, it has only produced a proportionate rise in the original 
price of the housing unit. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development, in view of the strong pressure on demand and the rigidity of the housing supply, 
tax deductions are largely capitalized into prices. If these tax concessions were not in place, 
property prices would fall by between 15 and 30 per cent.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Vacant houses 
</b></p>
<p>26. Spain is one of the European countries with the largest rate of housing construction during 
recent years. According to the latest census of 2001, the housing stock contains 20.9 million 
units, and only 14.1 million families. Many properties are secondary homes and empty 
properties. In 2001, they accounted for some 14 per cent of the total housing stock, which is 
about double the total stock of rental accommodation.<b>26</b>

</p>
<p>27. Spain possesses the largest number of vacant houses of the European Union. According to 
the 2001 census, there were 3,091,596 vacant dwellings that represent around 15 per cent of the 
total stock (not taking into account secondary residences).<b>27</b> This percentage is reportedly lower 
than the estimated deficit in the rental housing market. 
</p>
<p>28. To address this situation, some corrective measures, such as the creation of the Rental 
Public Society (<i>Sociedad P&#250;blica de Alquiler</i>), which the Special Rapporteur welcomes, have 
been implemented. However, these measures appear to be insufficient and only address the needs 
of the higher end of the rental housing demand. 
</p>
<p>29. The liberalization of rental contracts initiated in 1985 by the Boyer Act, and continued 
in 1994 by the Urban Rental Law (<i>Ley de Arrendamientos Urbanos</i>), aimed at facilitating in 
principle the renting of homes by the owners.<b>28</b> However, it seems that this measure has not been 
fully productive, has not acted as an incentive to the rental market, and has possibly affected 
security of tenure. The Special Rapporteur believes that there is a need for more protective 
measures for tenants in the context of steadily increasing rents. The current rental contracts 
foresee that during a period of five years, price increases cannot go beyond the CPI (consumer 
price index). It has been reported that in many cases, at the expiry of this period, landlords have 
asked for very high increases in rents. As a result, people who cannot afford such an increase 
have been forced to move out. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  GOOD PRACTICES 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that Spain has legal provisions to protect 
the right to adequate housing in line with the international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>31. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur welcomed the efforts that have been made by the 
Spanish authorities at all levels on the issue of adequate housing. As a matter of priority for 
government policy, a Ministry of Housing was created in 2004 to address the situation. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur also welcomed progress in legislation with regard to the 
implementation of the right to adequate housing, including the new 2005-2008 housing plan, 
the new technical building code, and the national plan on water quality. The new Land Law 
(<i>Ley del Suelo</i>) that recently entered into force on 1 July 2007 addresses several issues such as: 
</p>
<p> (a) The basic rights of citizens in relation to housing and in particular, the right to enjoy 
decent and adequate housing in an adequate environment; 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>27
</b>  Official communication dated 6 February 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>28
</b>  The Boyer Act liberalized post-1985 rental contracts and in 1994, the minimum length of 
</p>
<p>rental leases was set at five years. Nowadays, rents are initially negotiated freely and then 
indexed on the consumer price index for the life of the contract. </p>

</p>
<p> (b) Measures proposed to facilitate transparency and participation of citizens in the 
process of land development (access to information, participation in the process of elaboration 
and approval of ordaining instruments, public action to respect the determination of the 
plans, etc.); 
</p>
<p> (c) The establishment of a compulsory land reserve (a minimum of 30 per cent of 
the residential building capacity) for new housing under some kind of public protection  
plan;<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p> (d) The establishment of instruments to enable value capture<b>30</b> from urban development 
(up to 20 per cent of the capital gains); 
</p>
<p> (e) The establishment of use of land for public housing as one of the priorities. 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur also welcomed the process under way to draft a national human 
rights plan of action. Although details of this draft plan are not yet available, the Special 
Rapporteur hopes that it will fully and explicitly incorporate economic, social and cultural 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur also acknowledged the positive efforts that have been made by 
regional authorities to promote housing rights, such as in the Basque country, and Catalonia and 
Andalucia. 
</p>
<p>35. In Catalonia, the draft legislation on the right to adequate housing (<i>Llei del Dret a 
l&#8217;Habitatge</i>) punishes acts such as leaving properties vacant, overcrowding and real estate 
mobbing. Similarly, the Catalan Neighbourhoods Law<b>31</b> aims at halting the deterioration of 
impoverished neighbourhoods through conservation, renovation and renewal. Since June 2007, 
measures are under way to address access to adequate housing in Catalonia. The National 
Agreement on Housing (<i>Pacte nacional per a l&#8217;Habitatge</i>) aims at ensuring an affordable 
housing policy for all the population based on solidarity and collective responsibility. Through 
five thematic guidelines, which are structured into objectives and targets, the Agreement aims at 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>29
</b>  The question of the proportion of the type of housing to be developed remains open. The 
</p>
<p>Basque Land Law establishes a reserve of 70 per cent of land devoted to social housing, with a 
maximum of 20 per cent to &#8220;<i>vivienda concertad</i>&#8221;. Moreover, there is no time limit to the 
protection of VPOs. 
<b>30
</b></p>
<p>  Value capture refers to the process by which all or a proportion of the increase in land value 
attributed to &#8220;community efforts&#8221; rather than the actions of the landowner are recovered by the 
public sector. 
<b>31
</b></p>

</p>
<p>improving access to housing, particularly for young people; improving the quality of the housing 
stock; improving the housing accessibility of disabled people; preventing social exclusion and 
guaranteeing adequate housing for homeless persons. In order to achieve these goals, the 
Government has planned to build 160,000 units under the VPO scheme, improve the housing 
accessibility and mobility of 35,000 disabled people and build 15,000 units for &#8220;social inclusion&#8221; 
and 8,000 &#8220;emergency&#8221; units for homeless people. In addition, a study group on urban 
segregation (<i>Observatorio de la Segregaci&#243;n Urbana</i>) should be created, to monitor the social 
cohesion and the non-territorial segregation measures of the plan.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>36. In Andalucia, the recently approved amendment to the Regional Constitution of Andalucia 
(<i>Estatuto de autonom&#237;a, Ley 2/20</i>7) provides for further public policies related to social and 
economic rights. It specifically mentions a number of priority groups, including persons with low 
income, minors and the elderly. Article 25 of the code aims at ensuring that public institutions in 
Andalucia promote public housing and assistance to implement the constitutional right to 
housing.<b>33</b> 
</p>
<p>37. In the Basque country, in contrast with the rest of Spain, the production of public housing, 
especially in recent years, has considerably increased. One in three houses initiated in this 
Autonomous Community in 2005 was regionally subsidized, whereas in the rest of Spain it was 
only 1 in 13.<b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the focus given to the right to adequate housing by 
ombudspersons, such as in Andalucia. Yet, he also notes that the recommendations contained in 
reports prepared by the ombudspersons have, to a large extent, not yet been implemented.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the work of the social movements and 
non-governmental organizations in the field of housing, including their reliance on international 
human rights instruments as standards to hold governments at all levels accountable.

<p><b>IV.  PARTICULAR CONCERNS IN HOUSING 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Speculation 
</b></p>
<p>40. According to the Observatory of Sustainability in Spain, 812,294 properties were built 
in 2005, which is more than Germany, France and the United Kingdom put together.<b>36</b> According 
to the Department of Public Works, between 1996 and 2003 the nominal value of land increased 
by 120 per cent.<b> 37</b> According to the Spanish Central Bank (<i>Banco de Espa&#241;a</i>), between 1998 
and 2005 the price of land increased by 500 per cent, and the price of housing 150 per cent.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p>41. One of the most decisive factors for the rise of housing prices has probably been a stock 
market crisis that lasted from 2000 to 2002. During this period of recession, investors left the 
stock market and took refuge in the real estate market which had a direct impact on the price of 
housing. According to the Bank of Spain, between 1988 and 2003, the average return on 
property investment was higher than on stock investments (13.5 per cent compared 
to 9 per cent).<b>39</b> 
</p>
<p>42. It has been stated that buying residential property off-plan and selling it before the title 
deed has been signed can, in some cases, generate capital gains of over 846 per cent in less than 
a year.<b>40</b> This speculation seems to be important in the upper socio-economic class and with 
foreign investors.<b>41</b> 
</p>
<p>43. According to the Public Prosecutor of the Spanish Supreme Court, the increase in the price 
of housing is partly due to malpractice by official bodies or the excessive bureaucratization of

<p>the system. This increase directly affects the price of housing construction. Whilst in 1996, 
26 per cent of the price of building could be attributed to the cost of the land, in 2002 the 
percentage was 37 per cent.<b>42</b>  
</p>
<p>44. Increases in prices of housing and speculation have been a major source of profit for large 
real estate companies, constructors and banks.<b>43</b> During his visit to the Basque country, the 
Special Rapporteur was informed that between 1995 and 2005, the price of houses went up by 
250 per cent, while building costs went up by 35 per cent. During the same period, mortgages 
rose from &#8364;650 million to &#8364;6,000 million.<b>44</b>  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Corruption 
</b></p>
<p>45. The situation of housing and the large sums of money generated by real estate business 
have reportedly created problems of corruption in the country.<b>45</b> The difference in price of land 
which can be developed and land which cannot seems to be one of the reasons for this 
phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>46. According to the previous Land Law,<b>46</b> it was possible for local administrations to 
reclassify land to allow construction on them. This urban reclassification method allowed the 
conversion of previously protected areas deemed inappropriate for urbanization into areas that 
could be developed into large residential complexes.<b>47</b> The new Land Law still permits this

<p>reclassification but with a number of additional safeguards. While the Land Law seeks to set the 
guidelines and provisions to guarantee the fulfilment of housing and territorial planning rights in 
all the territory, it is the competence of local government and autonomous communities to 
legislate, to create provisions and to implement urban plans that comply with the Land Law. 
</p>
<p>47. It has been alleged that the lack of local administration resources contributed to the use of 
land reclassification as a source of financing of political parties. It has also been alleged that 
some politicians and officials have personally benefited from this situation. Persons in key 
positions have access to privileged information concerning urban planning and management 
(forecasting which areas are going to be reclassified, etc.), as well as the capacity to influence 
urban planning. In the last four years alone Mallorca has modified 227 urban development plans. 
In the first trimester of 2006, 15 of the 24 complaints on urban development abuse received by 
the European Union came from Spain. The case of corruption in Marbella, for example, has also 
shed light on some practices at the local level and led to the instigation of criminal procedures 
and the intervention of the national Minister of Justice in April 2006.<b> 48</b> 
</p>
<p>48. Independent estimates claim that 26 per cent of the income of Municipal Councils comes 
from urban development speculation.<b>49</b> Although the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and 
Provinces only claims to receive 3 per cent of total income from the sale of land, through the 
property tax and the capital gains tax, as well as taxes on construction, installations and works, 
urban development provides more income to local corporations than the central Government, 
which only provides 23 per cent of the funds that finance the 8,000 municipalities of Spain.<b>50</b>  
</p>
<p>49. With regard to this situation, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the nomination of Special 
Prosecutors to look into these practices and additions to the newly adopted Land Law to combat 
corruption.<b>51</b>  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Real estate mobbing 
</b></p>
<p>50. The housing situation has generated many disturbing problems. Amongst others, 
testimonies and information received by the Special Rapporteur indicate various discriminatory 
factors with regard to access to housing, including gentrification of cities and resulting 
segregation, evictions and what has been called &#8220;real estate mobbing&#8221;.

<p>A/HRC/7/16/Add.2

</p>
<p>51. In the draft bill for the right to housing in Catalonia, &#8220;real estate mobbing&#8221; is defined as 
&#8220;all conduct, acts or omissions, aimed at disrupting a person&#8217;s peaceful use of their home by 
creating a hostile environment, either at a personal social or material level, with the ultimate 
objective of forcing the adoption of an undesired decision related to their rights protecting their 
occupation&#8221;.<b>52</b> Real estate mobbing can include acts such as: 
</p>
<p> (a) Non-compliance with the landlord&#8217;s obligations of maintenance and conservation of 
the property, with the intention of declaring the technical or economic bankruptcy of the building 
thereby allowing for the cancellation of rental contracts; 
</p>
<p> (b) The refusal to accept payment of the rent, so as to later make a claim for 
non-payment or to change administrators or bank accounts to ensure that rents never reach their 
destination; 
</p>
<p> (c) Frequent changes in the property register without informing the tenants; 
</p>
<p> (d) Changing locks without giving tenants prior notice, cutting or damaging light and 
water supply; 
</p>
<p> (e) Verbal threats by owners, and hiring people to intimidate tenants. 
</p>
<p>52. This phenomenon affects mostly households that have old rental contracts (contracted 
before the Boyer Act), which establish indefinite rental periods at prices notably inferior to the 
market. The elderly are usually the primary victims of mobbing. This practice also affects 
property owners who reside in buildings owned primarily by a large real estate company, as well 
as tenants of properties that are susceptible to changes in use (home to hotel, offices or tourist 
apartments), or essentially to speculative property sales. 
</p>
<p>53. Some courts have already considered that this phenomenon is currently posing a social 
problem. For instance, the Criminal Court of Barcelona stated that &#8220;given the disproportionate 
levels that this [urban] speculation has reached, it is easy to imagine situations in which owners 
of urban real estate, do not hesitate in forcing by any means necessary, legitimate or not, the 
termination of old rental contracts, which are not at all profitable&#8221;.<b>53</b>

</b>  &#8220;<i>El acoso, considerado como toda conducta que, sea por actuaci&#243;n u omisiones varias o que

<p><i>actue con abuso de derecho, tenga por objetivo perturbar a la persona acosada en el uso 
pac&#237;fico de su vivienda creando un entorno hostil, ya sea en el aspecto material o en el social o 
personal, con la finalidad &#250;ltima de forzar la adopci&#243;n de una decisi&#243;n no deseada sobre el

</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur received testimonies of people being physically harassed by 
private agents as part of the mobbing phenomenon. In one court case, an 81 year-old man did not 
have hot water for a period of two years. The steps of his building were allegedly coated with 
soap to provoke an accident.<b> </b>In this case the decision acknowledged that the intention of the 
defendant was to ensure that the tenants did not renew their rental contracts in view of the 
building&#8217;s condition.<b>54</b> 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur believes that the recent amendment of the Spanish Criminal Law 
(art. 173), which introduced the concept of mobbing in the workplace and in contractual 
relationships could be extended to similar situations arising in other fields, such as real estate 
mobbing.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur was disturbed to learn that despite the number of testimonies and 
reports that he received of cases of real estate mobbing, very few cases have been prosecuted.<b>55</b> 
He fears that the low number of cases are mainly due to the vulnerability of the persons who are 
victims of mobbing (age for instance) and the difficulty in engaging in legal action for these 
persons. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  The state of housing and living conditions 
</b></p>
<p>57. According to the 2001 census, in Spain, 112,824 people lived in housing with no running 
water, 13,002 persons lived in buildings in a dilapidated (<i>ruinoso</i>) state, 13,660 persons lived in 
poor (<i>deficiente</i>) conditions, and 25,839 in substandard (<i>malo</i>) conditions.<b>56</b> 
58. Some parts of the population such as the elderly are affected more than others. In 2001, 
more than 40,000 elderly people were living in very poor conditions; 110,000 in poor conditions, 
and more than 500,000 in defective buildings.<b>57</b>

<p>  According to Mr. Santiago Vidal (<i>magistrado de la Audiencia Provincial de Barcelona</i>), out

<p>59. The 2001 census stated that a fifth of the elderly in Ceuta and Melilla lived in buildings in 
poor condition and that this proportion may be quite similar in other parts of the country. Recent 
reports indicate precarious living conditions, including density in rooms that are subleased (and 
even beds, chairs and balconies in the most extreme cases).<b>58</b>  
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCERNS OVER PARTICULAR GROUPS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Women 
</b></p>
<p>60. During the various meetings the Special Rapporteur attended, a number of issues related to 
women and housing was raised, including in testimonies.<b>59</b> Housing issues related to women 
have been highlighted in various parts of this report. This section focuses more specifically on 
the question of adequate housing and domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur also met with women who were victims of domestic violence. The 
Law of Comprehensive Measures against Violence against Women, of 28 December 2004, 
provides that victims shall be given priority in access to public housing and referred to 
specialized shelters. However, some reports indicate<b>60</b> that this law lacks resources for its 
implementation and that housing measures are still scarce and inadequate.<b>61</b> The implementation 
of measures depends, to a great extent, on the Autonomous Community. Some shelters make it a 
condition that the women report their attacker, which can be an inappropriate barrier for Roma or 
illegal immigrant women. Finally, according to the information received, inadequate residential 
measures are applied by some Autonomous Communities (for instance, Catalonia and the 
Basque country) in placing victims in pensions and hotels.  
</p>
<p>62. In some cases, in addition to violence, sexual abuse of children has been reported. Other 
issues have been highlighted in the meetings. Roma and migrant women expressed their 
concerns about living in overcrowded houses with no privacy.<b>62</b> Migrant women are faced with

<b>61
</b></p>
<p><b>  </b>In 2004, there were 293 locations providing temporary accommodation in all of the Spanish 
territory including emergency centres and shelters (<i>Memoria de actuaciones contra la violencia

</p>
<p>various problems including discrimination, the legal requirement to have adequate housing that 
they cannot afford and the fact of living separated from their children. Single women, including 
single women with children, have difficulties in accessing and affording adequate housing.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Youth 
</b></p>
<p>63. According to the Institute of Youth (<i>Instituto de la Juventud</i>, INJUVE), in 2005 there 
were 9,245,420 persons between the age of 15 and 29.<b>63</b> Young people in Spain have been 
particularly affected by the current housing crisis.<b>64</b> For instance, only 10.9 per cent of youth 
between the ages of 18 and 24 have been able to leave their parents&#8217; home (<i>emancipaci&#243;n</i>). For 
the age 25-29 segment, the figure rises to 42.4 per cent, but only the segment of people 
aged 30-34 reaches more than a 50 per cent <i>emancipaci&#243;n </i>rate.<b>65</b> According to the Youth 
Council of Spain, on average, 60.8 per cent of a young person&#8217;s salary is needed to access 
private market housing, leading to long-term debts.<b>66</b> 
</p>
<p>64. Although problems of &#8220;emancipation&#8221; have multiple elements, two main reasons have 
been identified: induction into the labour market and affordability of housing.<b>67</b> According to the 
<i>Observatorio joven de vivienda</i>, a young person must allocate 69 per cent of his/her salary to buy 
a house on the free market. Similarly, it was estimated that 43.2 per cent of the income of a 
household headed by a young person must be spent for the same purpose.<b>68</b> These figures 
increased by 20 per cent in 2006 despite signs of deceleration of prices in the housing market. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>63
</b>  The Institute defines youth as persons aged between 15 and 29 years. Ministry of Housing 
</p>
<p>consider youth as persons under 35 years.

<b>67
</b></p>
<p>  It has been also stated that this situation hampers mobility for workers and their opportunities 
to find work in other parts of the country. See for instance: The European Industrial Relations 
Observatory -EIRO, available at http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2006/02/feature/

</p>
<p>This may indicate that prices in housing rise much more than average salaries.<b>69</b> Interest rates 
began to rise at the end of 2005 and continued in 2006, hampering access to the housing market 
for young people. The economic effort is reportedly higher for women for reasons such as 
inequality in salaries. 
</p>
<p>65. Subsequent to his mission, the Special Rapporteur was informed that as of 1 January 2008, 
persons from 22 to 30 years old may benefit from a new form of State assistance (<i>Renta de 
emancipac&#237;on</i>) which contributes to their rent for a maximum period of four years.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  The elderly 
</b></p>
<p>66. The elderly represent 18 per cent of the total population. Despite a constitutional 
provision,<b>70</b> this group faces problems such as low income, mobility and access to the home, and 
property mobbing. The majority of the elderly live in their own houses (72 per cent), or in 
accommodation with old rental contracts, their level of income being generally lower than the 
average.  
</p>
<p>67. In Bilbao, the Special Rapporteur visited some buildings with architectural barriers which 
hinder the mobility of the dwellers. The 2001 census indicated that 42.3 per cent of the elderly 
lived in buildings with more than one floor and without a lift (although the census did not 
indicate on which floor the elderly persons lived). In addition, the questionnaire concerning the 
living conditions of the elderly 2004, estimated that almost half of the elderly reside in properties 
on higher floors and that more than a third of the buildings do no not have lifts. Some of these 
houses have been depicted as &#8220;prison flats&#8221;.<b>71</b> 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur was informed of &#8220;the forced confinement due to physical barriers&#8221; 
and the concern that this drastically reduces personal autonomy, as well as limiting access to 
basic social, medical care or cultural services and leading to social exclusion. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>69
</b>  Ibid. 
</p>
<p><b>70
</b>  Article 50 of the Constitution states that &#8220;The public authorities shall guarantee, through 
</p>
<p>adequate and periodically updated pensions, a sufficient income for citizens in old age. Likewise, 
and without prejudice to the obligations of the families, they shall promote their welfare through 
a system of social services that provides for their specific problems of health, housing, culture 
and leisure.&#8221;

</p>
<p><b>D.  People with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>69. People with disabilities represent 9 per cent of the Spanish population<b>72</b> for which physical 
accessibility and the means to be as autonomous as possible are important concerns. The 
Housing Plan 2005-2008 recognizes persons with disabilities and their families as priority 
citizens regarding the housing policy and it establishes measures in order to enable their access 
to housing.<b>73</b> People with disabilities are entitled to receive a grant (up to &#8364;3,100) to undertake 
necessary changes in order to remove physical barriers that impede the accessibility of their 
homes. 
</p>
<p>70. However, various groups of people with disabilities have requested better access to 
subsidized housing and better access to the labour market. Cases of non-adapted housing 
resources have also been reported. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Roma (<i>gitanos</i>) communities 
</b>71. In several locations, such as in El Bacie (Sevilla), the Special Rapporteur visited slums, 
some existing for decades, in which some marginalized communities such as Roma groups have 
been living. He also visited other Roma communities living in housing estates (for example in 
Polygonos Sur, Sevilla) experiencing poor housing and living conditions, overcrowding and 
discrimination.<b>74</b>  
</p>
<p>72. According to the <i>Asociaci&#243;n Secretariado General Gitano</i>, in 1999 the Roma in Spain 
amounted to 630,000 inhabitants, the majority of whom were concentrated in Andaluc&#237;a 
(45.35 per cent), followed by Madrid (9.37 per cent) and Catalonia (8.39 per cent).<b>75</b> Concerns

<p>  For an analysis of various discriminations faced by Roma in Spain, one can refer to the study 
of the National Analytical Study on Housing, Raxen Focal Point for Spain, October 2003, 
available at http://fra.europa.eu/fra/material/pub/RAXEN/4/house/ES_Housing.pdf. Some 
studies have shown there is a negative perception of Roma in Spain, including in questions 
related to housing and rent (see for example: <i>Centro de Investigaciones Sociol&#243;gicas (CIS)</i>, 
Survey of November 2005, study No. 2625, questions 16 and 17, http://www.cis.es).

</p>
<p>have been expressed by several international and regional bodies and civil society organizations 
in relation to the systematic discrimination and adverse situation faced by the Roma communities 
in Spain.<b>76</b> 
</p>
<p>73. Tenure is a particular concern for this population. Relocations of Roma settlements are 
often carried out due to urban development pressures or at the insistence from neighbours. This 
has created difficulties in terms of social integration, and in some cases has created newly 
segregated locations.  
</p>
<p><b>F.  Migrants 
</b></p>
<p>74. In Almeria, El Ejido and Roquetas de Mar (Andalucia), the Special Rapporteur received 
first-hand testimonies of migrant workers who face discrimination in accessing housing, live in 
informal dwellings, on construction sites, in overcrowded houses, or rent beds by the hour.<b>77</b> He 
visited structures in which workers were living in very inadequate conditions. He is puzzled that 
while the economy of some regions has largely benefited from a migrant workforce, not enough 
has been done to address the housing needs of these persons.<b>78</b> 
</p>
<p>75. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur agrees with the recommendations made by the 
Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants during her visit to Spain in 2003. In 
particular, the State should adopt &#8220;Active policies to encourage rental of subsidized housing for 
low-income migrants, offering guarantees to owners, and initiating awareness campaigns against 
racism and xenophobia&#8221;.<b>79</b> Unfortunately, there is little evidence that these recommendations 
have been implemented.

</p>
<p>76. State legislation concerning immigration, rather than enshrining the right to housing, 
conceives adequate housing as an obligation of the resident in order to be able to work and 
exercise the right to family reunion.<b>80 </b> 
</p>
<p>77. The insufficiency of the State Plan has been partially alleviated by the Autonomous 
Communities. For instance, in Catalonia the State Plan has been developed via the Plan for the 
Right to Housing 2004-2007. Unlike the State Plan, Catalonia included migrants as one of the 
groups that require specific measures. 
</p>
<p><b>G.  Homeless people 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Spanish Institute of Statistics (INE) estimated at the end of 2005 that there 
were 21,900 homeless persons in Spain who were being attended to more or less regularly or 
sporadically by the network of centres (dining halls or shelters) located in cities with more 
than 20,000 inhabitants.<b>81</b> Yet, this may be a conservative figure as there is no official consensus 
on the definition of homelessness.<b>82</b> For instance, the Government of Catalonia has officially 
estimated a number of 6,000 homeless while the national survey 2005 undertaken by INE 
estimated 2,428 homeless people for the same region.<b>83</b> 
</p>
<p>79. According to a survey undertaken by the Spanish Institute of Statistics in 2006, shelters for 
homeless people offer 13,003 beds daily in the entire country. The average occupancy rate 
is 83.1 per cent. The vast majority of shelters are private centres or run by civic organizations. 
The survey revealed that the biggest target populations of the centres are migrants and women 
experiencing violence.

have another in three months&#8221; (art. 75). In relation to family reunion, it is foreseen that 
certification from the council or via notary is proof that the applicant has &#8220;an adequate home in 
order to deal with the needs of the person and the family&#8221; (art. 42).

<b>82
</b></p>
<p>  &#8220;In Spain, homelessness is not tackled consistently, and coordination is poor. A lack of 
coordination among and between centres for homeless people and service providers makes it 
impossible to collect reliable and regular information.&#8221; (European Commission Employment, 
Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities DG, Measurement of Homelessness at European Union 
Level, January 2007, p. 37).

</p>
<p>80. Studies tend to show a shift in the nature of the homeless population in Spain which 
increasingly consists of women, single-parent families, divorced and separated persons, youth 
and unaccompanied minors and migrants, the latter representing almost half of the total. 
Homeless people need residential facilities adapted to their needs and particular situations, such 
as emergency accommodation, and medium- and long-term transitional housing. 
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur believes that homelessness is a complex phenomenon and as such 
must be dealt with using a comprehensive approach based on human rights, and through 
coordination between different administrative levels, political areas, non-profit organizations and 
the private sector.<b>84</b> Moreover, he considers that homelessness should not only be dealt with by 
the social services, but that housing departments should also take part in managing the problem. 
Thus the allocation of housing resources for the homeless should be recognized in the State 
Housing Plan, as should flats for young workers. 
</p>
<p>82. As a first step towards developing a housing policy that covers the needs of the homeless, 
the Spanish State should investigate homelessness more thoroughly, paying attention to the 
quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the homeless and the factors leading to 
homelessness. 
</p>
<p>83. Finally, the Rapporteur considers that following the example set by Scotland,<b>85</b> the Spanish 
State should consider urgently guaranteeing the housing rights of the homeless, bearing in mind 
their diversity.  
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> Since the mission took place, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to hear that the 
Government has responded positively to his initial comments and its commitments to 
promptly address the situation. For instance, the Government has acknowledged the 
necessity to develop public rental housing and has initiated fiscal deductions for tenants to 
support this housing option.  
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> In addition to these steps, the Special Rapporteur believes that Spain should reflect 
on its economic and social policies. Policies and laws that flow from such a reconsideration 
should be underpinned by a human rights approach to housing and to land. The Spanish 
Constitution and the international human rights instruments can be the driving force of 
this approach. Rigorous human rights education and learning is necessary in all the line 
Ministries in Spain including knowledge of general comments and other interpretative 
instruments that can assist in law and policymaking on the right to adequate housing.

</p>
<p>86.<b> Despite the fact that constitutional provisions recognize housing as a basic right, 
housing, in practice, is currently considered as a mere commodity to be bought and sold. In 
this context, the social function of housing needs to be recovered and article 47 of the 
Constitution fully implemented. All sectors of society, including developers, constructors, 
real estate agents, civil society groups and other public and private actors, must play a role 
in the realization of this basic human right.  
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> Spain should adopt a comprehensive and coordinated national housing policy based 
on human rights and the protection of the most vulnerable. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur calls for an indivisibility of human rights approach in relation to policies on 
adequate housing. There is also a need to integrate social policies in all housing and urban 
planning and policies.  
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> The Spanish authorities should gather disaggregated data on housing conditions, 
particularly of vulnerable groups, that will provide the Government with the information 
needed to initiate policies consistent with its human rights and constitutional obligations. 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> Legislations and policies at State and autonomous region level should recognize 
economic, social and cultural rights, in particular the right to adequate housing. The 
Special Rapporteur recommends that the draft national human rights plan of action fully 
include economic, social and cultural rights.86 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> The Special Rapporteur believes that the primacy given to the homeownership policy 
model has had several negative impacts on the realization of the right to adequate housing. 
Firstly, it has marginalized sectors of society that do not have enough means to purchase 
their homes and those who face discrimination. These groups include, women, low-income 
households, migrants, young people, the elderly, and Roma. Secondly, it has generated 
uncontrolled speculation. This has also led to numerous problems, including cases of 
corruption that have been widely publicized in the media and are being investigated. 
Over-construction in various regions of the country has also had a grave impact on the 
environment and long-term sustainability of some regions, including along the Spanish 
coasts.87 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The functioning of the market, the current homeownership model and its possible 
negative impact on low-income housing options should be seriously reflected upon. The 
Special Rapporteur believes that there is no alternative but for the Government, at all 
levels, to more rigorously intervene and regulate the market in land and housing, to secure 
the effective implementation of the right to adequate, affordable and accessible housing by 
bringing down housing and land prices.

</b>  The Government informed the Special Rapporteur that the national human rights plan is in 
</p>
<p>process of elaboration and that no draft could be made available to him. No information on its 
public availability for consultations, or calendar of its consideration by Parliament was provided.

<p>92.<b> The Special Rapporteur believes that the ownership model is the result of policies 
introduced in the last decades that have strongly encouraged the ownership model both in 
public and private housing sectors through tax deductions and other means. This has led to 
a situation where other tenancy regimes, such as rental for lower income sectors, were not 
sufficiently promoted. 
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> The Special Rapporteur reiterates the recommendation of the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) in which it requested Spain to &#8220;take 
remedial action to improve the conditions of housing, and provide more housing units, 
housing facilities, credits and subsidies to low-income families and disadvantaged and 
marginalized groups, in line with the Committee&#8217;s general comment No. 4&#8221;.88 
</b></p>
<p>94.<b> The State should also heavily penalize practices such as &#8220;real estate mobbing&#8221;, 
corruption and discrimination in the real estate sector. Proper mechanisms to investigate, 
sanction and provide redress for such activities should be made fully available to all 
residents of Spain. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that more rigorous investigations 
and prosecution of those responsible in these cases, including developers, is necessary and 
calls for more rigorous implementation of existing legislation, such as the relevant 
provisions of the new land law.</b> 
</p>
<p>95. <b>All levels of governments should consider the application of the basic principles and 
guidelines on development-based evictions and displacement, including the 
recommendation to conduct eviction impact assessments.89 
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> Spain may want to consider the establishment of a well-resourced and independent 
human rights commission at all levels, based on the principles relating to the status of 
national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights</b> (<b>Paris Principles). 
The Special Rapporteur also believes that the Offices of the Ombudsman should be 
reinforced. The proper functioning of such independent bodies is essential, to enable those 
individuals that have faced violations of the right to housing to have access to effective 
complaint and redress mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> The Special Rapporteur believes that the State should ensure justiciability of the right 
to adequate housing contained in the Spanish Constitution and relevant international 
instruments, through accessible complaint mechanisms available to all. A timely 
implementation of the recommendations of treaty bodies and Special Rapporteurs is 
necessary.

<p>98.<b> All levels of Government should urgently address the adverse situation of the lack of 
housing and social services for some parts of society, including for vulnerable groups and 
people on low-incomes, the homeless, migrants and Roma communities.  
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> Given the interlinkages between violence against women and women&#8217;s right to 
adequate housing, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Spanish authorities 
continue and develop their work on this issue, including to act with due diligence to 
prevent, investigate and punish acts of violence against women; to ensure access to 
temporary and appropriate shelters; and to ensure their security in any given 
circumstance. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government utilize, in this 
context, the solutions proposed in the work of the Commission on Human Rights on women 
and housing, such as the introduction of anti-violence provisions in housing legislation and 
policies and ensuring that domestic violence laws include provisions to protect women&#8217;s 
right to adequate housing, including the right to privacy and security.90 
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> The authorities must ensure affordable public social housing meeting the needs of all, 
and the creation of various types of accommodation, in order to be able to cope with 
various situations. Such accommodation should include shelters, emergency housing, 
boarding houses and transitional housing. 
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> There is an urgent need to increase the availability of rental housing, through 
building more affordable rental housing, a more intensive use of vacant buildings, but also 
through consolidation of a publicly managed stock of rental housing targeted at meeting 
the demands of the low-income population and guaranteeing security of tenure for tenants. 
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> The Special Rapporteur urges the Spanish authorities to adopt an official definition 
of homelessness.91 In order to address the situation, it is of the utmost importance to gather 
reliable statistics and data on the phenomenon in Spain, as previously requested by the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.92 The Government should also 
develop a comprehensive social reintegration programme for all of the homeless, in

<p>103.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that all possible measures be taken in order to 
ensure equal opportunities in access to housing, as well as to implement strong mechanisms 
to document discrimination in access to housing, including statistical tools.93

<p>104.<b> The Special Rapporteur takes note of recent efforts by the Government at various 
levels to consult civil society on the design of housing and urbanization policies, strategies 
and planning, notably the State Housing Plan in 2005 and the Federal Land Law Bill, and 
calls upon the Spanish authorities to continue their efforts to ensure they are increasingly 
genuine and effective.
