Husky  plans to  invest  $2.2  billion  in its  upstream  assets  in 2006,  with
approximately $1.5 billion in capital spending for Western Canada,  exclusive of
oil sands  projects.  The  Western  Canada  program  will focus on  natural  gas
exploration  in Alberta and B.C.,  the continued  long-term  development  of the
Company's  extensive  heavy oil  assets in  Alberta  and  Saskatchewan,  and the
drilling of two wells to appraise the Summit Creek B-44 oil discovery and test a
new  prospect  in the  Northwest  Territories.  Husky  also  plans to spend $100
million to expand  production of natural gas from coal (NGC) or coal bed methane
(CBM). In the Horseshoe Canyon  Formation in central Alberta,  Husky will tie in
150 net wells, boosting production from 10 million cubic feet per day of natural
gas to 35 million cubic feet per day of natural gas by the end of 2006.

In the Oil Sands business, Husky will spend $230 million, including $145 million
to finalize  construction of the  30,000-barrel per day Tucker Oil Sands Project
near Cold Lake,  Alberta.  Commissioning  of facilities  and steam  injection at
Tucker is expected by mid-2006,  with first oil  production  by the end of 2006.
Husky has  allocated $60 million for an initial  development  of its Sunrise Oil
Sands Project near Fort McMurray,  Alberta.  The  200,000-barrel per day project
received  regulatory  approval in December,  2005. The next phase of the project
will  encompass  engineering  for the upstream  element of the  development  and
further  review of upgrading and downstream  options.  An additional $25 million
will be used to drill  resource  evaluation  wells to further assess the Caribou
Lake and Saleski oil sands leases near Cold Lake and Fort McMurray.
On Canada's East Coast,  Husky plans to spend $350 million in 2006.  The program
includes  capital to drill and  complete a fourth  production  well on the White
Rose  offshore oil field.  It is expected  this well will boost  production to a
peak of approximately  100,000 barrels per day by mid-2006.  Husky also plans to
drill a delineation  well to further  define  reserves in the North Avalon Pool,
adjacent to the South Avalon Pool of the White Rose oil field.
Internationally,  Husky plans to spend $57 million on its  interests in both the
South and East China Seas. Offshore  Indonesia,  Husky will spend $75 million to
advance engineering and development plans for the Madura BD gas field.
In  the  Midstream  and  Refined  Products   segments,   Husky  plans  to  spend
approximately $340 million and $260 million respectively.  The Midstream program
will  complete   debottlenecking  work  at  the  Husky  Lloydminster   Upgrader,
increasing  throughput  from 77,000 to 82,000  barrels per day by mid-2006.  The
Company  plans to spend $90  million  to expand its heavy oil  pipeline  system,
including construction of a connecting line to the Tucker Oil Sands Project near
Cold Lake, Alberta. For the Refined Products segment, the Clean Fuels Project at
the Prince George Refinery will enable the refinery to produce ultra-low sulphur
diesel and will increase  overall capacity from 10,000 to 12,000 barrels per day
by mid-2006.  Husky has  allocated  $120 million in 2006 for  construction  of a
130-million litre per year ethanol facility at Minnedosa,  Manitoba.  Meanwhile,
the  Company  anticipates  its  inaugural  130-million  litre  per year  ethanol
facility at Lloydminster, Saskatchewan will be operational in the second quarter
of 2006.
For the year 2006,  Husky estimates  production of 360,000 to 390,000 barrels of
oil  equivalent  per day.  Light  oil and  natural  gas  liquids  production  is
estimated to be 103,000 to 116,000 barrels per day,  including  50,000 to 55,000
barrels per day from the White Rose offshore oil field; medium oil production is
estimated  to be 29,000 to  32,000  barrels  per day;  heavy oil  production  is
estimated to be 115,000 to 120,000  barrels per day; and natural gas  production
is estimated to be 680 to 730 million cubic feet per day.
