on the current practices related to mercenaries and private military and security companies 
registered, operating or recruiting personnel in Asia, the Pacific and the Middle East. It 
provided an opportunity to discuss the fundamental question of the role of the State as 
holder of the monopoly of the legitimate use of force and to share information on steps 
taken by States in the region to introduce legislation or other measures to regulate and 
monitor activities of such companies on the international market.

</p>
<p><b> I. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. In paragraph 15 of its resolution 62/145, the General Assembly requested the Office 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to convene 
regional governmental consultations on traditional and new forms of mercenary activities as 
a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-
determination, in particular regarding the effects of the activities of private military and 
security companies (PMSCs) on the enjoyment of human rights. 
</p><p>2. In line with the above-mentioned resolution and Human Rights Council resolution 
7/21, the Working Group on the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights 
and impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination1 held a regional 
consultation for Asia and the Pacific in Bangkok on 26 and 27 October 2009. 
</p>
<p>3. The consultation was attended by representatives of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, 
Cambodia, China, Fiji, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan, Myanmar, Pakistan, Qatar, 
Samoa, Thailand, Viet Nam and Yemen; as well as by the observer of Palestine.  
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group was represented by the Chairperson-Rapporteur, Shaista 
Shameem, and its members Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez, Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del Prado and 
Alexander Nikitin. 
</p>
<p>5. The Working Group had held two previous regional consultations, the first in 
Panama City for the Latin American and Caribbean Region on 17 and 18 December 2007 
(see A/HRC/7/7/Add.5) and the second in Moscow for the Eastern European Group and 
Central Asian Region on 17 and 18 October 2008 (see A/HRC/10/14/Add.3). 
</p><p>6. The Working Group expresses its sincere appreciation for the warm welcome of the 
authorities of Thailand and for their support for the organization of this consultation in 
Bangkok. It also thanks the OHCHR office in Bangkok for its invaluable assistance 
throughout the meeting. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Summary of the meeting 
</b>7. The consultation was opened by Asda Jayanama, advisor to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs of the Government of Thailand, who welcomed the participants and underlined the 
importance to explore regional perspectives on the issue of PMSCs. Mr. Jayanama said that 
PMSCs were on the rise and active worldwide and that the legal gaps applicable to such 
groups needed to be filled. He added that many questions had to be addressed, including the 
accountability of PMSCs, their obligations to respect human rights and international 
humanitarian law and the extent to which States could outsource their inherent security and 
military functions to private entities. He concluded by encouraging participants to engage in 
a fruitful discussion on the possibility of a new international convention to ensure 
regulation and oversight of the activities of PMSCs.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 The Working Group on the use of mercenaries was established by the Commission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>through its resolution 2005/2. The Working Group is composed of five independent experts serving in 
their personal capacities. Since March 2009, Shaista Shameem (Fiji) is the Chairperson-Rapporteur. 
The other members are Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez (Colombia), Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del Prado (Spain), 
Alexander Nikitin (Russian Federation) and Najat al-Hajjaji (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12590 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. National experiences regarding the activities of private military and 
security companies 
</b></p>
<p>8. The representative of Fiji introduced the session and provided a comprehensive 
presentation on the practice of foreign PMSCs employing personnel from Fiji to operate in 
third countries, in particular in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the challenges it represented for 
the country and the personnel. He noted that Fiji had not until now adopted a specific 
regulation on the issue.  
</p>
<p>9. Participants shared the experience of their countries regarding PMSCs. They 
stressed the need to distinguish between local private security companies used to secure 
official or private buildings (often with unarmed personnel) and foreign private military 
companies operating outside their own countries, often in zones of conflict or tension. 
Some also recalled specific situations where PMSCs had been involved in mercenary 
activities.  
</p>
<p>10. A discussion followed on the importance of regular human rights training for PMSC 
personnel. Participants also noted the need for an enforcement mechanism to protect against 
potential violations by PMSC personnel of international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>11. Participants discussed the consequences of the increased recruitment of former 
security personnel to PMSCs on the employees themselves and on the society. One 
representative said that often personnel were not offered the working conditions initially 
promised. He noted, for example, that in many instances personnel were not paid the wage 
announced. Another participant noted the negative impact a large-scale recruitment by 
PMSCs could have on a home country, in particular when the recruits were sent back with 
serious post-traumatic trauma and no appropriate structure to assist them.  
</p>
<p><b> B. National legislation to regulate and monitor the activities of private 
military and security companies 
</b></p>
<p>12. The item was introduced through a presentation of the regulation of PMSCs in 
Afghanistan. The representative of Afghanistan outlined the regulation adopted in February 
2008 by the Ministry of Interior, in particular the guidelines for registration and licensing as 
well as the monitoring and verification mechanisms. He described the &#8220;irregularities&#8221; that 
had been committed by PMSCs in Afghanistan, including the killing of civilians, clashes 
with Afghan forces, and threats against clients who did not intend to renew their contracts.  
</p>
<p>13. The representative underlined that the need for PMSCs was largely dependent on the 
situation of the country, that is, whether a conflict was taking place or not, as well as on the 
capacity of the national security forces to provide security and protection to its population. 
In his country, the Government lacked the capacity to maintain the full monopoly of the use 
of force, which had prompted it to call on the assistance of PMSCs. The Government was 
in the process of building the capacity of its armed forces to regain the full control over the 
use of force. The new regulation in Afghanistan stated that PMSCs could not be involved in 
offensive actions. 
</p>
<p>14. Participants engaged in a discussion of the different forms of regulation in place in 
their respective countries. Most representatives underlined the distinction between 
international PMSCs and national private security companies providing services on their 
national territory. Several noted that they had a licensing regime in place for national 
private security companies. Most countries, with the exception of Afghanistan, stated that 
they had no foreign or national private military companies operating on their territory. For 
example, a representative noted that such companies were not authorized to operate in his 
country; and that the Government was currently investigating allegations that some </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> GE.10-12590 
</p>
<p>companies were active in the country without its knowledge or authorization. In particular 
he underlined that PMSCs commonly used the cover of a multinational military operation, 
such as NATO, to operate in countries without the explicit approbation and oversight of the 
territorial country.  
</p>
<p>15. One representative highlighted the guidelines provided in the Montreux Document 
on pertinent international legal obligations and good practices for States related to 
operations of private military and security companies during armed conflict (A/63/467) and 
stated that his country was supportive of efforts to develop an international instrument or 
basic principles highlighting the human rights standards on the issue and emphasizing the 
need for accountability in cases of human rights violations. He also reiterated the 
importance for States to support all human rights when contracting PMSCs.  
</p>
<p><b> C. The role of the State as holder of the monopoly of the legitimate use of 
force 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Chairperson of the Working Group said that the Working Group had noted a 
global trend toward the increased privatization of security. In some conflict zones, PMSC 
contractors were more numerous than conventional forces and often had very sophisticated 
logistical support and weaponry. She underlined the potential conflict of interest faced in 
the case of a for-profit organization providing security in a conflict or post-conflict zone. 
Those developments had consequences on the role of the State as holder of the legitimate 
monopoly on the use of force. That assessment had led the Working Group to advocate for 
the elaboration of an international framework to regulate and the activities of PMSCs. The 
Chairperson welcomed the Swiss initiative towards a code of conduct for the industry but 
stressed that self-regulatory initiatives were far from sufficient. 
</p>
<p>17. Several participants underlined the existing legal vacuum and stressed the necessity 
to ensure that the activities of PMSCs were systematically monitored. Several 
representatives expressed their support for the efforts of the Working Group with regard to 
drafting a new convention, an initiative complementary to the Swiss efforts towards an 
international code of conduct. A representative reiterated the responsibility of States vis-&#224;-
vis PMSCs they contracted and stressed that States could not shift their responsibility to 
such companies by virtue of a contract. PMSCs should exercise maximum restraint in the 
use of force, and should not participate in any activities to overthrow a legitimate 
Government.  
</p>
<p>18. Participants also underlined the importance of increased transparency regarding the 
activities of PMSCs, including with respect to their numbers, the number of weapons used 
and the services provided. They emphasized the right of the public to be informed.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Elements for a possible draft convention on private military and 
security companies 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Chairperson noted that the restrictive definition of mercenaries as per the 
International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of 
Mercenaries (1989) was not applicable to PMSCs. That assessment had led the Working 
Group to advocate for a new convention on the regulation, oversight and monitoring of 
such companies and their activities.  
</p>
<p>20. In that regard, the Chairperson recalled that in its resolution 10/11 (para. 13), the 
Human Rights Council had requested the Working Group: (a) to consult with 
intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, academic institutions and experts 
on the content and scope of a possible draft convention on PMSCs; (b) to share with </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p>GE.10-12590 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Member States elements for a possible draft convention on PMSCs and to request their 
input on the content and scope of such a convention; and (c) to report to the Council at its 
fifteenth session on the progress achieved in the elaboration of the draft convention.  
</p>
<p>21. The Chairperson emphasized that a legal gap existed with respect to governing the 
activities of private military and security companies. The purpose of a new convention on 
the issue would be to fill that legal gap, by, among other things, reaffirming and 
strengthening State responsibility for the use of force and supporting the regulation of the 
activities of PMSCs and subcontractors.  
</p>
<p>22. The Chairperson described the main purpose and elements of the draft convention, 
including the fundamental principles on State responsibility for the exercise of the 
legitimate use of force; the States&#8217; primary obligation to ensure that respect for human 
rights and humanitarian law was demonstrated by the PMSCs they contracted; the 
definition of parameters of inherently State functions that could not be outsourced, in any 
context or circumstances, to PMSCs; the establishment of international and national 
regulatory principles for the activities of PMSCs, through the establishment of licensing 
and registration; the creation of an independent international oversight and monitoring 
mechanism; and the provision of an avenue of redress for victims.  
</p>
<p>23. Other members of the Working Group provided additional information on the 
rationale and purpose of the new legal instrument, including its applicability to all 
situations regardless of the existence of armed conflict, the emphasis on the access of 
victims to reparation and justice and the need for a system of national registration and 
increased control for host countries where companies operate.  
</p>
<p>24. Participants welcomed the work of the Working Group on a possible draft 
convention. Several delegates recognized the importance of national legislation but also 
noted the importance of an international framework to address the global problem. Several 
countries underlined the responsibility of countries of origin with regard to PMSCs that 
were contracted to operate abroad.  
</p>
<p>25. Another delegate emphasized that the convention should address the human rights 
impact of PMSCs and not become an attempt to regulate all PMSC activities. In particular, 
monitoring and regulating the use of national private security companies should remain the 
prerogative of the State concerned.  
</p>
<p>26. Finally, several participants underlined that the Working Group and Member States 
should strive to ensure the universality of such an instrument or basic principles.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusions and observations of the Working Group 
</b>27. <b>The Working Group concluded the meeting by thanking all participants for 
their valuable contributions. The Chairperson reiterated the key points that had been 
raised, including the general concern at the rapid growth of private military and 
security companies (PMSCs) and the consensus on the need for increased national and 
international regulation of private military and security companies.</b> 
</p>
<p>28. <b>Participants discussed the monopoly of the legitimate use of force and the 
possibility of defining at the international level those functions that were inherently 
governmental and that should not be outsourced. The Working Group shared its 
concerns regarding the trend of PMSCs increasingly taking over functions that were, 
until recently, inherent to the sovereignty of States. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/25/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> GE.10-12590 
</p>
<p>29. <b>The Working Group notes that although the growth of PMSCs is a global 
phenomenon, States are particularly concerned with the activities of foreign PMSCs 
operating in countries in the absence of clear oversight and monitoring mechanisms.  
</b></p>
<p>30. <b>The Working Group recognizes a consensus from the participants regarding 
the existing legal gap at the international level regarding the activities of PMSCs and 
welcomes the declarations of support regarding its efforts to elaborate an 
international instrument for the regulation of such companies.  
</b></p>
<p>31. <b>The Working Group recalls the responsibility of States to respect and protect 
human rights and to ensure that PMSCs are held accountable if and when they are 
responsible for crimes or human rights violations. 
</b></p>
<p>32. <b>The Working Group believes that an effective system for the licensing and 
registering of private military and security companies and the training of their 
employees should be developed. 
</b></p>
<p>33. <b>The Working Group encourages all regulatory efforts (a) at the industry level 
through self-regulation, (b) at the national level through specific legislation and (c) at 
the international level with the efforts of the Working Group to elaborate a possible 
draft convention for the oversight and monitoring of PMSCs. 
</b></p>
<p>34. <b>The Working Group plans to hold the final two regional consultations, in 
Africa and in Western Europe, in 2010. New legal instruments on regulating private 
military and security companies, which are currently being elaborated by the 
Working Group, shall be deliberated with Member States at these consultations, to 
provide wide input into the content and consensus on the format of these instruments. 
</b></p>
<p>35. <b>The Working Group notes that this process of regional consultation may lead to 
the holding of a high-level round table of States under the auspices of the United 
Nations to discuss the fundamental question of the role of the State as holder of the 
monopoly of the use of force. The round table would be aimed at (a) facilitating a 
critical understanding of the responsibilities of the different actors, including private 
military and security companies, in the current context, and their respective 
obligations for the protection and promotion of human rights and (b) reaching a 
common understanding as to which additional regulations and controls are needed at 
the international level, as requested in Human Rights Council resolution 7/21. </b></p>
