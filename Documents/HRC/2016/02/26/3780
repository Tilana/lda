<p><b>III. Duration of the review in the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review</b> 
</p>
<p> 3. The duration of the review shall be extended to three hours and thirty minutes 
for each country in the working group, so as to be within existing resources and with no 
additional workload, during which the State under review shall be given up to 70 minutes to 
be used for initial presentation, replies and concluding comments in line with PRST/8/1. 
</p>
<p> 4. The allocation of time during the working group shall be in accordance with 
Annex II. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. List of Speakers in the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review 
</b></p>
<p> 5. The established procedures, which allow 3 minutes speaking time for 
Member States and 2 minutes for Observer States, will continue to apply when all speakers 
can be accommodated within three hours and thirty minutes available to Member and 
Observer States. 
</p>
<p> 6. Should it be impossible to accommodate all speakers within three hours and 
thirty minutes based on 3 minutes speaking time for Member States and 2 minutes for 
Observer States, the speaking time will be reduced to 2 minutes for all.  
</p>
<p> 7. If all speakers still cannot be accommodated, the speaking time will be 
divided among all delegations inscribed so as to enable each and every speaker to take the 
floor. 
</p>
<p> 8. Steps for drawing up the list of speakers 
</p>
<p> (a) The list of speakers will open at 10:00 on the Monday of the week 
preceding the beginning of the UPR working group session and remain open for a 
period of four days. It will close on the Thursday at 18:00. A registration desk will 
be set up at the Palais des Nations. The exact location will be communicated to all 
permanent missions by the Secretariat. 
</p>
<p> (b) In all cases, regardless of speaking times, the delegations inscribed on 
the list of speakers will be arranged by alphabetical order of the county names in 
English. On the Friday morning preceding the beginning of the session, the 
President, in the presence of the Bureau, will draw by lot the first speaker on the list. 
The list of speakers will continue from the State drawn onward. On Friday </p>


<p>afternoon, all delegations will be informed of the speaking order and of the speaking 
time available to delegations. 
</p>
<p> (c) Speaking time limits during the review will be strictly enforced. 
Speakers who exceed speaking time will have their microphones cut off. Speakers 
may therefore wish to deliver the essential part at the beginning of their statements. 
</p>
<p> (d) All speakers will retain the possibility of swapping place on the 
speakers list under bilateral arrangement between speakers 
</p>

Fund for participation in the universal periodic review and to provide an annual written 
update to the Human Rights Council, starting from the 18th session, on the operations of the 
funds and the resources available to it. 
</p>
<p> 10. The Secretariat is requested to revise the terms of reference of the Voluntary 
Fund for financial and technical assistance in the implementation of the universal periodic 
review and to provide an annual written update to the Human Rights Council, starting from 
the 18th session, on the operations of the fund and the resources available to it. A board of 
trustees shall be established by the Secretary General of the United Nations in accordance 
with the rules of the United Nations and taking into consideration equitable geographic 
representation. </p>
