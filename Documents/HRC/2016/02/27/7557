<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur focuses on the realization of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression in electoral contexts, paying particular attention to the 
establishment and enforcement of legal instruments regulating political communications.  
</p>
<p>2. The free flow of ideas is incontestably a core requirement for the promotion of 
democratic spaces. Ensuring an open space for the multiple voices of politicians, the press, 
minorities or citizens in general is a permanent challenge for entities tasked with overseeing 
electoral processes. The recognized need to establish and enforce regulations on political 
campaigning is inevitably accompanied by the concern that, depending on their application, 
such regulations may be used to obstruct or even impede the natural flow of ideas. How to 
ensure all voices have a space in the public debate, including newly established groups? 
How to avoid having the most powerful groups in a society take unfair advantage of their 
political or economic powers to exclude dissident voices from the debate?  
</p>
<p>3. A quick overview of recent electoral processes in all regions of the world can easily 
identify numerous structural, legal and practical barriers which impede the equitable 
enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression during electoral processes. In some 
situations politically dominant groups directly attack and intimidate voices of dissent and 
criticism which are crucial for the promotion of democratic debate; journalists, activists and 
political leaders are violently attacked, harassed through multiple legal procedures or 
arbitrarily detained. In others, economic and political imbalances permit some groups to 
dominate the public debate to a point where divergent ideas are often excluded from public 
debate. In these very different contexts, freedom of expression can be affected both by the 
absence of regulations for political communications and campaigning, and by the adoption 
of inadequate norms that disproportionately restrict political communications and 
jeopardize public debate. 
</p><p>4. The report will analyse some common challenges in the establishment and 
enforcement of legal instruments regulating communications in electoral processes. It will 
begin by describing the human rights framework applicable to the question of freedom of 
opinion and expression in political communications and electoral processes. It will analyse 
in more depth the main concerns regarding possible violations of free expression in this 
context. The Special Rapporteur will then propose some key principles that can guide the 
establishment and implementation of national legal frameworks regulating political 
communications.  
</p>
<p>5. Common concerns relating to the realization of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression studied by the Special Rapporteur in his recent reports are all relevant to the 
regulation of communications during electoral processes; the responsibility of States to 
&#8220;prohibit&#8221; incitement of hatred, hostility, discrimination and violence,1 for example, is 
particularly relevant in electoral periods. Unfortunately, one can observe today in all 
regions of the world, especially during political and economic crises, candidates making 
use while campaigning of a language of hatred and hostility, targeting, inter alia, women, 
racial, linguistic or religious minorities, homosexuals and foreign migrant workers. The 
protection of journalists from violence2 is central to ensuring that the press exercises its 
crucial role of informing the public about candidates, their platforms and the ongoing 
debates. Unfortunately, attacks against the press often increase during electoral periods.

<p>The full realization of the right to access information,3 is another crucial element in the 
promotion of free and fair democratic elections. As further detailed below, informed 
political debate requires transparency, with respect to the conduct of political organizations, 
the financing and promotion of political campaigns, and the ownership of media groups.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b>6. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur continued to participate in 
national and international events relating to the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
In October 2013, he submitted his report to the General Assembly (A/68/362), in which he 
addressed the right to access information held by public bodies, emphasizing its relation 
with the right to truth. In 2013, he also undertook missions to Montenegro from 11 to 17 
June, to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from 18 to 21 June, and to Italy from 
11 to 18 November. His preliminary findings on these visits are detailed in the three 
additional reports to the 27th session of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur regrets never having received a response from the 
Government of Indonesia to his repeated requests for a new date to visit the country, after 
the Government asked for his visit, previously scheduled for January 2013, to be 
postponed. He also expresses disappointment that the Government of Pakistan did not 
provide a date for his visit to the country, despite having invited the mandate holder to visit 
in early 2012. The following States never responded to requests for visits by the Special 
Rapporteur: Islamic Republic of Iran (visit requested in February 2010); Sri Lanka (visit 
requested in June 2009 and 2012); Thailand (visit requested in 2012); Uganda (visit 
requested in May 2011); and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (visit requested in 2003 
and in 2009).  
</p><p>8. The Special Rapporteur has attended a number of international events at which 
topics studied in his previous reports were debated. In particular, he contributed to various 
seminars addressing freedom of expression and privacy in digital communications. In 
September 2013, he participated in a side event focusing on the topic at the twenty-fifth 
session of the Human Rights Council. In October 2013, he participated in a hearing at the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on freedom of expression and 
communications surveillance by the United States of America, in the Americas and at the 
Council of Europe Conference of Ministers responsible for Media and Information Society 
in Belgrade. Since November 2013, he has been a member of the High-level Panel on 
Global Internet Cooperation and Governance Mechanisms. The panel brings together 
representatives of government, civil society and industry with the aim of proposing 
frameworks for Internet cooperation and a road map to address Internet governance 
challenges. In February 2014, he participated in an expert seminar on the right to privacy in 
the digital age, hosted in Geneva by the Permanent Missions of Austria, Brazil, Germany, 
Liechtenstein, Mexico, Norway and Switzerland.  
</p>
<p>9. For the preparation of the present report, the Special Rapporteur reviewed studies on 
communications in electoral processes. He also organized a sequence of regional expert 
meetings, bringing together electoral authorities, researchers, journalists, activists and 
representatives of international organizations working on matters related to 
communications in electoral process in various regions. The consultations took place in 
Bangkok (co-hosted by the Southeast Asian Press Alliance and FORUM-ASIA); 
Johannesburg, South Africa (co-hosted by the University of Pretoria); Guatemala City (co-
hosted by the Instituto DEMOS); Madrid (co-hosted by the Fundaci&#243;n Cultura de Paz and

</p>
<p><b> III. Freedom of expression and communication in electoral 
processes 
</b></p>
<p>10. The right to freedom of opinion and expression is a central pillar of democratic 
societies; and a guarantor of free and fair electoral processes, and meaningful and 
representative public and political discourse. It is during times of political change that the 
right to freedom of expression is most essential, ensuring that a well-informed and 
empowered public is free to exercise its civil and political rights. Providing the conditions 
for free and open political communication is an essential element of ensuring fair and 
democratic electoral processes.  
</p>
<p>11. In the context of elections and political communications, dedicated attention is to be 
afforded to the free expression rights of the main actors: the voters, who depend on the right 
to freedom of expression to receive full and accurate information, and express their political 
affiliation without fear; candidates and political organizations, who need to exercise their 
rights through campaigning and communicating their political messages freely without 
interference or attacks; and the media, which rely on the right to freedom of expression to 
play their essential democratic role of informing the public, scrutinizing political parties 
and platforms, and providing checks and balances in the electoral process.  
</p>
<p>12. Common and continuing challenges to the promotion and protection of freedom of 
expression that persist in all aspects of society &#8211; censorship, violence against journalists, 
speech that incites hatred, discrimination and political violence &#8211; increase in both frequency 
and severity during electoral processes. Ensuring an open public debate where all the main 
stakeholders in an electoral process &#8211; namely, the voters, the political leaders and groups, 
and the media &#8211; can freely share information and opinions is a permanent challenge for 
democratic societies. In some cases, inadequate regulation of communications can unduly 
restrict the freedom of the media or of political actors. In other situations, the political 
debate is dominated by powerful political and economic groups that take advantage of 
poorly regulated and enforced legal frameworks. 
</p>
<p>13. International human rights standards do not provide detailed models for regulating 
political communications. However, some core principles can be identified: efforts must be 
deployed to promote the pluralism of the media and ensure a plural political debate, ensure 
transparency in the promotion and financing of political campaigns, and guarantee 
accountability and fair enforcement of political regulations to prevent those in power from 
taking advantage of domestic regulatory regimes to dominate and manipulate public debate.  
</p>
<p>14. States must take measures to eliminate the structural, legal and practical barriers to 
the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression. At a fundamental, structural level, 
economic power enables political influence to be concentrated in, and exercised by, small 
segments of society, thereby undermining the democratic ideal. Those who own and 
finance media organizations and outlets are often able to use their economic power and 
influence to enhance the visibility of certain political candidates or groups, and impede the 
communication and expression of others. This is particularly the case where national 
legislative frameworks do not sufficiently provide for free, direct access by political 
candidates to publicly or privately owned media outlets for campaigning purposes. Even 
when such provisions are in place, many media organizations are able to use the unequal 
provision of air time, partisan editorial commentary, or the facilitation of paid political 
advertising to promote one political candidate or group over another. The situation is 
exacerbated when media ownership is obscured by complex corporate structures and there </p>


<p>is no public transparency as to the corporate and private interests entwined with media 
coverage. Especially in circumstances in which a State&#8217;s media ownership is concentrated 
in only a handful of corporate entities, this can threaten the ability of all political entities to 
freely and effectively express their positions and platforms, and impede individuals from 
receiving information about their electoral choices on an equal and impartial basis. 
</p>
<p>15. Freedom of opinion and expression in electoral processes is also threatened when 
economic power is exerted over the political process through campaign financing and paid 
political advertising. Wealthy societal segments and corporate interest lobbies can directly 
exert political influence through exploiting unregulated political finance structures, and 
opportunities for paid political advertising. In many States neither the donor nor the 
recipient is required publicly to disclose financial contributions. Wealthy groups and 
candidates are also disproportionately advantaged when there are no restrictions in place as 
to how political campaigns can use and disburse campaign funds. 
</p>
<p>16. The over- or under-regulation of electoral processes may also threaten enjoyment of 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Legal barriers to the free flow of 
communication and expression during electoral processes include thematic restrictions on 
political expression and discourse (which often include prohibitions on criticism of 
incumbent politicians or political groups), regulation of the content of print and online 
media sources, and limitations on protests and demonstrations during electoral processes. 
Lacunae in legal frameworks also erode free expression and communication in political 
discourse; failures to articulate regulatory frameworks related to equal direct access to 
publicly-owned media outlets, polling, campaign financing and paid political advertising 
create conditions that may unfairly disadvantage particular political candidates or groups, 
thereby undermining the equal and free flow of ideas and communications that is an 
essential prerequisite to a truly democratic electoral process.  
</p>
<p>17. In addition to the structural and legal threats to free expression rights in electoral 
processes, States are also actively restricting the practical enjoyment of the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression in political communications. Such measures include multiple 
forms of censorship, such as restrictions on particular websites and social media sites, 
sources of political commentary, including local and international media, or even Internet 
services more broadly; harassment of the media; violence against and imprisonment of 
journalists, activists and bloggers; direct attacks on dissident political groups; and measures 
to impede public demonstrations and other forms of valid political expression. These 
common violations of freedom of expression rights occur outside electoral processes as 
well, but are often more frequent or acute during moments of political change or upheaval, 
and are especially damaging during such times. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. International human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>18. The right to freedom of opinion and expression, as articulated in articles 19 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, is fundamentally interrelated with article 25 of the Covenant, on the right 
to participation in government through free and fair elections. During electoral processes 
and in the context of political communication, the equal and unimpeded exchange of 
contrasting ideas is a crucial prerequisite to ensuring that the voting public can make 
informed choices and is thus a basic pillar of any democratic system. In the absence of 
protections to ensure the freedom to express, communicate, publish and discuss political 
and electoral issues, genuine and effective political participation cannot be realized.  </p>


<p>19. In its general comment No. 34 (2011) on article 19 on freedoms of opinion and 
expression, the Human Rights Committee noted that: 
</p>
<p>The free communication of information and ideas about public and political issues 
between citizens, candidates and elected representatives is essential. This implies a 
free press and other media able to comment on public issues without censorship or 
restraint and to inform public opinion. The public also has a corresponding right to 
receive media output.4  
</p>
<p>20. This finding builds on general comment No. 25 (1996) on article 25 (the right to 
participate in public affairs), in which it is stipulated that States must take positive measures 
to protect and promote the freedom of expression in the context of political and electoral 
processes in order to ensure the full realization of article 25.5 The General Assembly, in its 
resolution 59/201, declared that freedom of association and peaceful assembly were 
essential elements of democracy, together with the right to vote and to be elected at genuine 
periodic free elections, and encouraged the strengthening of political party systems and 
civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>21. Both the right to free expression and the right to political participation are enshrined 
in numerous other regional and international human rights instruments.6 Importantly, their 
critical relationship and mutual dependency are also borne out in a number of human rights 
texts. It is stipulated in article 3 of the first protocol to the European Convention on Human 
Rights that contracting parties must &#8220;hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret 
ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people 
in the choice of the legislature&#8221;. The European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly 
emphasized that the fundamental importance of freedom of political expression rests in 
large part on the importance of an informed electorate to the functioning of a genuine 
democracy, and that &#8220;freedom of political debate is at the very core of the concept of a 
democratic society&#8221;.7 Free and impartial media are key to ensuring the necessary vibrant 
political debate that underpins democratic elections and political processes. The Court has 
noted that:  
</p>
<p>Freedom of the press affords the public one of the best means of discovering and 
forming an opinion of the ideas and attitudes of their political leaders. In particular, 
it gives politicians the opportunity to reflect and comment on the preoccupations of 
public opinion; it thus enables everyone to participate in the free political debate 
which is at the very core of the concept of a democratic society.8  
</p>
<p>22. The press is also recognized as playing a crucial role in informing the public about 
matters of public interest and acting as a &#8216;public watchdog&#8217;:  
</p>
<p>It is ... incumbent on [the press] to impart information and ideas on matters of public 
interest. Not only does it have the task of imparting such information and ideas: the

<p>public also has a right to receive them. Were it otherwise, the press would be unable 
to play its vital role of &#8216;public watchdog&#8217;.9  
</p>
<p>23. Accordingly, all political parties and candidates should have access to the media in a 
fair and impartial way. As articulated in the Document of the Copenhagen Meeting of the 
Conference on the Human Dimension of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE), States must &#8220;ensure that the will of the people serves as the basis of the 
authority of government&#8221; by, inter alia, ensuring &#8220;that no legal or administrative obstacle 
stands in the way of unimpeded access to the media on a non-discriminatory basis for all 
political groupings and individuals wishing to participate in the electoral process&#8221;.10  
</p>
<p>24. The Inter-American Court on Human Rights has equally emphasized that free 
expression rights are the cornerstone for the debate during electoral processes, because they 
act: 
</p>
<p>as an essential instrument for the formation of public opinion among the electorate, 
strengthen the political contest between the different candidates and parties taking 
part in the elections, and are an authentic mechanism for analyzing the political 
platforms proposed by the different candidates.11 
</p>
<p>25. Accordingly, the Inter-American Court has said, restrictions on political expression 
during electoral processes undermine the right to freedom of opinion and expression: 
&#8220;everyone must be allowed to question and investigate the competence and suitability of the 
candidates, and also to disagree with and compare proposals, ideas and opinions, so that the 
electorate may form its opinion in order to vote.&#8221;12 
</p>
<p>26. In a joint statement with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe  
Representative on Freedom of the Media, the Organization of American States Special 
Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression and the African Commission on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information, 
the Special Rapporteur reiterated the positions of both the European and Inter-American 
Courts, emphasizing that free and fair elections are possible only where the electorate is 
well-informed and has access to pluralistic and sufficient information, and that only a 
diverse media environment can ensure that all viewpoints and political perspectives are 
aired during election campaigns.13  
</p>
<p>27. Similar wording is found in the Windhoek Declaration on Promoting Independent 
and Pluralistic Media (1991): &#8220;an independent, pluralistic and free press is essential to the 
development and maintenance of democracy in a nation.&#8221;

<p>28. The importance of ensuring access to the media as part of the electoral process is 
also well-established in a number of regional human rights instruments. The South African 
Development Community Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections, for 
example, reiterate that, in the conduct of democratic elections, all political parties should 
have access to State media (principle 2.1.5). The same principle is enshrined in article 17 of 
the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance, on the importance of 
ensuring access by political candidates and parties to State-controlled media during 
elections. The Declaration of Principles of Freedom of Expression in Africa also affirms 
that &#8220;the public service ambit of public broadcasters should be clearly defined and include 
an obligation to ensure that the public receive adequate, politically balanced information, 
particularly during election periods&#8221; (art. VI).  
</p><p>29. The need for a vibrant and critical debate, with no restrictions on the form or content 
of political expression, has been explored in depth by the European Court of Human Rights, 
which has emphasized that &#8220;the limits of permissible criticism are wider with regard to the 
Government than in relation to a private citizen, or even a politician&#8221;.14 The State 
authorities may adopt, &#8220;in their capacity as guarantors of public order&#8221;, penalties for 
defamation that are proportionate to the injury but only where the accusations are &#8220;devoid 
of foundation or formulated in bad faith&#8221;.15 The reference to public order suggests that 
discretion of a government to restrict potentially defamatory statements against it should be 
limited to situations in which public order is threatened:  
</p>
<p>While freedom of expression is important for everybody, it is especially so for an 
elected representative of the people. He represents his electorate, draws attention to 
their preoccupations and defends their interests. Accordingly, interferences with the 
freedom of expression of an opposition member of parliament, like the applicant, 
call for the closest scrutiny on the part of the Court.16 
</p>
<p>30. United Nations human rights mechanisms have also considered the permissible 
limitations upon speech in the context of electoral processes. The Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination has noted that &#8220;the fundamental right to freedom of 
expression does not protect the dissemination of ideas of racial superiority or incitement to 
racial hatred&#8221;.17 In a recent review, the Committee underlined that  
</p>
<p>the fundamental right of freedom of expression should not subtract from the 
principles of equality and non-discrimination as the exercise of the right to freedom 
of expression carries with it special responsibilities, among which is the obligation 
not to disseminate ideas on racial superiority or hatred.18 
</p>
<p>31. The Committee recommended that the State inter alia reinforce the mandate of the 
authority which monitors the media to ensure that racist statements are prosecuted and 
victims granted reparations; ensure that the media do not stigmatize, stereotype or 
negatively target non-citizens and ethnic minorities; invite the media to strictly respect the 
Charter of Rome (2008) in order to avoid racist, discriminatory or biased language; and 
raise awareness among media professionals of their responsibility not to disseminate 
prejudice and to avoid reporting in a way that would stigmatize communities subject to 
historical discrimination.

<p>32. Additionally, in another review, the Committee encouraged the State to thoroughly 
investigate and prosecute, where appropriate, the use during election campaigns of 
statements by politicians that would incite racial hatred against persons of minority ethnic 
origin.19 
</p>
<p><b> V. Common concerns regarding the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression in electoral processes 
</b></p>
<p>33. The enjoyment of the right to freedom of opinion and expression in electoral 
processes can be jeopardized through numerous overlapping legal and practical State 
measures. In the present section some of the primary threats to freedom of opinion and 
expression during electoral processes are identified.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Direct attacks against journalists, activists and political candidates 
and groups 
</b></p>
<p>34. Violence against, and harassment of, the press during electoral and political 
processes remains a common way of impeding the free expression of political ideas in 
many countries. Throughout his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has received numerous 
communications alleging serious violence against reporters, journalists, bloggers, television 
reporters and writers in the lead-up to, during and in the aftermath of elections.20 Attacks 
against the media function both as a specific means of deterring targeted journalists from 
investigating and reporting on a particular issue or candidate, and as a means of more 
generally deterring the media from reporting freely and impartially on political issues. In 
this context, violence against the media is one of the most destructive forms of violation of 
free expression in electoral processes. 
</p>
<p>35. In the course of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has addressed, through 
communications and public statements, reports of violence against or harassment of 
journalists in Belarus, where it was reported that, in the lead-up to the December 2010 
presidential elections, journalists had their equipment seized and photographs deleted;21 and 
in the Islamic Republic of Iran, where, as at May 2013, 40 journalists had reportedly been 
imprisoned as a means of silencing free speech and debate ahead of the June 2013 
elections.22  
</p>
<p>36. The State is not the only perpetrator of violence against journalists during elections; 
however it has a permanent responsibility to ensure the safety of all journalists at all times. 
In some countries, media organizations, independent editors and journalists receive threats 
and intimidation from militant groups or political parties demanding coverage for their 
messages. In many cases the State fails to take sufficient measures to protect journalists 
from such harassment, and responds by fining or otherwise punishing the media for 
broadcasting messages by banned organizations, despite the media being forced to do so 
under threat.23

<p>37. Attacks on journalists, activists and political candidates and groups also occur in the 
context of measures to limit the enjoyment of the freedoms to associate and assemble 
during electoral processes. The prohibition of protests and demonstrations and the 
harassment and intimidation of demonstrators during electoral processes remain common 
means of impeding the free expression of political ideas and the free conduct of public 
political debate. Such restrictions may take the form of harsh penalties for protesters who 
fail to comply with articulated requirements.24 In some countries, suppression of the right to 
peacefully assemble in the lead-up to elections takes the form of arbitrary arrest of 
demonstrators. Such actions deter the exercise of free expression and assembly by activists, 
opposition supporters and civil society groups. Requirements that protests receive prior 
State approval can also impede the free exercise of rights by creating the conditions for 
bribery and manipulation.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Regulatory and legal measures that restrict or undermine freedom of 
expression 
</b></p>
<p>38. Restrictions on political expression take a variety of forms &#8211; from defamation and 
slander laws, to blanket bans on critical expression relating to incumbent politicians, to the 
prohibition of whole media sources, outlets and websites &#8211; and impact not only the 
individuals or groups which might run afoul of them, but the media outlets or 
intermediaries that publish restricted, or what is considered to be illegal, political 
expression.  
</p>
<p>39. Violations of the right to freedom of expression during electoral processes often take 
the form of State interference in media content. The adoption of laws to control or regulate 
political speech immediately before and during elections is an important concern in this 
regard. For example, a series of legislative measures in Azerbaijan, including the 
criminalization of &#8220;online slander or insults&#8221;, reportedly had the effect of restraining the 
role of the media in the lead-up to the October 2013 elections.25 Violations of the right to 
freedom of expression also arise more broadly when existing laws are selectively 
interpreted or enforced by the State to crack down on specific forms of media content. 
Laws that are overly broad in scope and incorporate insufficient accountability mechanisms 
and protections against abuse are vulnerable to selective interpretation and enforcement.  
</p>
<p>40. Recent reports testify that States also seek to restrain free expression during 
elections by prohibiting access to certain media sources and outlets, for example through 
blocking online websites and blogs. In 2013, civil society reported restrictions on critical 
newspaper distribution networks, and the blocking of opposition websites, Facebook and 
YouTube in the run-up to four different elections. The Special Rapporteur publicly joined 
other experts in indicating their concern at reports of harassment of human rights defenders 
and attempts to silence media outlets and websites in Malaysia before elections scheduled 
to take place in May 2013.26 In March 2014, the Special Rapporteur voiced his serious

</p>
<p><b> C. Absence of pluralistic political and media environments 
</b></p>
<p>41. The effective functioning of a vibrant democratic political system rests on the 
realization by the State of its responsibility to ensure an environment in which a diverse 
range of political opinions and ideas can be freely and openly expressed and debated. The 
realization of the right to freedom of expression during electoral processes thus depends on 
the promotion of the independence and diversity of media and of the pluralism of political 
candidates and groups, by means of which political ideas can be tested, analysed and 
communicated to the voters.  
</p>
<p>42. The media play a fundamental and critical role in guaranteeing and facilitating free 
expression during electoral processes: as the conduit between the voters and their political 
representatives, the media provide a platform for the transmission of political ideas; educate 
voters about candidates and their affiliations and about the election process itself; scrutinize 
political promises and test their strength and veracity; and ensure accountability in the 
electoral process by reflecting the mood of the populace, conducting polls, examining 
election procedures and identifying undue influence in the electoral process. The only way 
to ensure that each of the essential functions is conducted in an equal and unimpeded 
manner is to provide the media with an independent space to publish freely, without fear of 
retribution or attack.  
</p>
<p>43. A pluralistic electoral process is also undermined by the unregulated financing of, 
and spending by, political campaigns. As the<b> </b>Global Commission on Elections, Democracy 
and Security (a joint initiative by the Kofi Annan Foundation and the International Institute 
for Democracy and Electoral Assistance) recognized in 2012, &#8220;uncontrolled political 
finance threatens to hollow out democracy and rob it of its unique strengths&#8221;.28 In many 
countries, the absence of regulations controlling campaign financing and spending creates 
the conditions for wealthy individuals and groups to exert influence and power over 
political candidates and groups, and provides an unequal advantage to wealthy political 
participants. Furthermore, groups of organized criminals are able to exploit unregulated and 
unenforced political financing regimes to buy political influence and even protection.  
</p>
<p>44. Unregulated campaign financing practices have recently been recognized by some 
authorities as a key contributor to political corruption.29 Countries such as Switzerland and 
Sweden have received criticism for the absence of national regulation of political financing, 
and political party financing systems in Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland have also been called into question by transparency 
advocates.30 Evaluations by the Council of Europe Group of States against Corruption on

<p>Andorra, Denmark and Malta31 identified as a concern the legal gaps allowing anonymous 
party and campaign financing, in contravention of its transparency recommendations.32 
</p>
<p>45. A lack of laws regulating political financing and requiring full disclosure of 
information on the functioning of political organizations can also give rise to the suggestion 
or appearance of corruption, causing public mistrust in the political process. Research 
shows that in the vast majority of European countries, more than 50 per cent of people 
believe political parties to be &#8220;corrupt&#8221; or &#8220;extremely corrupt&#8221; because of illicit financing 
practices. The perception of widespread political corruption as a result of the failure to 
regulate political financing often precipitates demonstrations and unrest in the lead-up to 
elections.33 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Towards a legal framework that protects freedom of 
expression in electoral processes 
</b></p>
<p>46. The State has a duty to provide a regulatory environment that facilitates a diverse 
range of political positions and ensures that voters have access to comprehensive, accurate 
and reliable information about all aspects of the electoral process. This may require the 
imposition of regulations that stipulate restrictions on campaigning, advertising, polling, 
spending and financing. Such restrictions must be designed to achieve the objective of 
providing a pluralistic and fair playing field, upon which political groups can communicate 
their ideas, and must have at their heart the protection and promotion of freedom of opinion 
and expression. 
</p>
<p>47. In the present section, the Special Rapporteur attempts to canvass in broad terms the 
pillars of an equitable legal framework that would ensure the protection of the freedom of 
opinion and expression during electoral processes. He recognizes, however, that a plurality 
of political systems exists and does not attempt to prescribe, in absolute terms, how States 
should design their legal systems. He simply suggests the types of regulatory framework 
that are most conducive to protecting human rights in the context of political 
communications and electoral processes.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Promoting plurality 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Political campaigning and expression 
</b></p>
<p>48. States should take general measures to encourage a diverse and pluralistic political 
process that is hospitable to ideologies from across the political spectrum. An important 
element of achieving this is ensuring that all political candidates&#8217; parties have access to the 
media for campaigning and advertising purposes. Public campaigning is the central means 
that political parties and candidates employ to publicize their platforms and express their 
opinions, and to communicate their message to the voters. Political campaigns generally 
employ a diverse range of mediums, from pamphlets, posters and direct mail-outs, to 
addresses via radio and television, online and in the print media. Access by all political

<p>candidates and parties to all campaigning mediums is essential to ensuring an equal and 
pluralistic electoral process that facilitates the free flow of information and ideas.  
</p>
<p>49. One important element of political campaigning during electoral processes is the 
provision to all parties and candidates of direct access to media outlets for allotted times. 
While the media play an essential role in facilitating political campaigns and providing 
scrutiny and analysis of political positions, direct access to broadcast media enables parties 
to speak in their own voice. The vast majority of established democracies have put in place 
regulations stipulating that all candidates be able to directly access publicly-owned 
broadcast media services for specific times on an equal basis. In some cases, these 
provisions also extend to access to privately owned broadcasters.34 The order of direct 
access is generally determined either on the basis of the previous performance of a given 
party or candidate, or through a ballot process. Media guidelines issued by the United 
Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC)35 include the principle of fair access 
to media outlets for all parties contesting the election, which was a central concern.36 
</p>
<p>50. It is essential to the protection of freedom of expression during electoral processes 
that political parities and candidates are free to express ideas and communicate about any 
issue that they see fit. Unregulated expression and access to information are at their most 
crucial during times of political change, and any restrictions upon political expression can 
seriously threaten the democratic process. The European Court of Human Rights has 
previously spoken out against restraints on political speech, particularly prior restraints.37 
Accordingly, campaign speech should not be regulated or restrained, unless it falls within a 
well-recognized understanding of restricted expression as recognized under international 
human rights law. The United Nations Technical Team on the Malawi Referendum has 
noted that, in order to ensure free political expression during electoral processes, any 
restrictions on expression must be exceptional and &#8220;should not be so vague or broadly 
defined as to leave an overly wide margin of discretion to the authorities responsible for 
enforcing the law, since uncertainty over legal boundaries has a dampening effect on the 
exercise of this right [to freedom of expression] and may encourage discrimination in ... 
[the restrictions&#8217;] application&#8221;.38 
</p><p>51. Another way that political parties and candidates seek to publicize their platforms 
and garner votes is by paying for political advertising. The regulation of political 
advertising is a contentious issue. Whereas political advertising can be an important means 
by which political parties, particularly those with less public visibility, can educate voters, 
unlimited and unregulated paid political advertising increases dependence on campaign 
finance and gives an unfair advantage to well-financed political candidates.  
</p>
<p>52. States have taken a variety of approaches to paid political advertising. In some 
countries paid political advertising is a central pillar of political processes and is not strictly 
regulated.39 Other States, particularly those with a strong history of public broadcasting,

<p>have an outright prohibition of paid campaign advertising on radio and television.40 Some 
legal frameworks have taken a middle ground approach, putting in place financial limits on 
paid advertising spending, paired with rules on equitable pricing, timing, duration and 
scheduling of advertising.41 In other situations, it is the electoral authority which is 
mandated to allocate electoral publicity by channelling public funds to different contenders 
in proportion to previous election results, with basic minimum support assured for new 
parties.42  
</p>
<p>53. Those who support unregulated paid political advertising often argue that it is an 
essential guarantor of freedom of expression in political and electoral processes. However, 
where paid political advertising presents an unfair advantage to certain political parties over 
others, and increases reliance on campaign financing, it may create unequal conditions for 
electoral processes. The European Court of Human Rights has recently recognized this, 
stating that the prohibition of paid political advertising was a justifiable limitation of the 
right to freedom of opinion and expression because it could protect against &#8220;powerful 
financial groups with advantageous access to influential media &#8230; obtain[ing] competitive 
advantages in the area of paid advertising and thereby curtail[ing] a free and pluralist 
debate, of which the State remains the ultimate guarantor.&#8221;43 
</p>
<p>54. States should therefore consider whether unrestricted paid political advertising may 
destabilize the playing field and impede the equal participation of certain parties or 
candidates in political campaigns. In all circumstances, paid political advertising should 
always be identified as such, and should not be disguised as news or editorial coverage.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>55. The ability of a political party to generate funds to support the various costs related 
to political communication and campaigning is an additional determining factor as to 
whether a party is able to participate fully in elections, and is thus a central pillar of 
ensuring plurality in political and electoral processes. A political party may be indirectly 
prevented from participating fully in an election if it is unable to raise financing from 
diverse sources. Poorly regulated political finance has the potential to undermine the 
integrity of elections by enabling individuals or groups to exert undue influence on political 
candidates or parties, and may facilitate vote buying or bribery. Equally, restrictions that 
limit the ways in which a political party may disburse funds raised may also impede full 
and free participation in political and electoral processes, while unlimited political spending 
benefits wealthier candidates and parties and undermines political equality.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Media diversity and independence 
</b></p>
<p>56. Pluralistic electoral processes depend on the existence of a diverse range of media 
sources to convey ideas and educate the voters. States have the obligation to guarantee the 
right to access information and this entails, inter alia, promoting the independence and 
diversity of media. The media provide a platform for candidates to publicize their platforms 
and messages, and for analysing proposed policies, scrutinizing the political process and 
ensuring its integrity, and holding candidates and incumbents to account. A level electoral 
playing field is impossible without free, pluralistic and unrestricted media. To this end, 
national legal frameworks should be based on the fundamental premise that the media must

<p>be free from political influence and should not be restricted or regulated, particularly during 
electoral processes. Self-regulation is arguably the most effective means of ensuring that 
the media live up to their own ethical standards while remaining free from the influence of 
the State.  
</p>
<p>57. However, the media must be encouraged to put in place mechanisms to ensure that 
all media actors adhere to the highest ethical standards of objective reporting, and guarantee 
equal coverage of political parties in a way that facilitates broad voter education and 
ensures all parties across the political spectrum are heard.  
</p>
<p>58. Where media are State-owned, national legal frameworks should ensure that all 
political parties have access to them and are treated fairly and equitably. When paid 
political advertising is allowed, private media outlets should be required to charge all 
parties and candidates the same rates without discrimination.44 The incumbent government 
or candidates should not be given preferential or disproportionately large media coverage.  
</p>
<p>59. State-owned or public media broadcasters bear an extra responsibility to ensure that 
the political platforms of all candidates and parties across the political spectrum are given 
coverage. Furthermore, public media sources have an important role in ensuring critical 
analysis and the availability of countervailing viewpoints. Several national courts have 
ruled that State-run media have a responsibility to publish replies by critics of the 
Government to government statements on controversial issues.45 The Supreme Court of 
India, for example, recognized the right of reply to political statements in the columns of a 
government-owned publication. The Court held that a public-sector agency publishing an 
in-house journal, owing to its status as an instrument of government, had a duty of fairness 
to its readers, and demanded that both viewpoints be placed before its readers, however 
limited be their number, to enable them to draw their own conclusions.46 The media 
guidelines issued by UNTAC also set out the duty of balance and impartiality in detail. 
Guideline 8 provides: &#8220;Media outlets should give parties, groups or individuals whose 
views have been misrepresented or maligned by a publication or broadcast the &#8216;right of 
response&#8217; in the same media outlet&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>60. Any regulation requiring impartiality should only extend to licensed broadcasters, 
and should not purport to restrict the content of print or online media sources, which should 
be available as a means of communicating all political viewpoints. Self-regulation is the 
most appropriate means of ensuring that the media are able to fulfil their important duty to 
facilitate the free flow of ideas and communications across the political spectrum. The 
media must be empowered to publish any and all political communications and campaign 
speeches, including those containing criticism of an incumbent government or candidate.47 
In a broad sense, media should not be made liable for disseminating, without endorsement, 
unlawful statements, or be restrained from publishing such statements; this principle is of 
particular importance during electoral processes given the imperative for timely 
dissemination of information. Imposing liability on the media promotes self-censorship by

</p>
<p><b> B. Ensuring transparency 
</b></p>
<p>61. Critically, any regulatory framework pertaining to electoral processes must have as a 
key objective the achievement of transparency in all facets of political life and discourse. A 
transparent political process is open to scrutiny by the voters and the media, and enables all 
players in the process to be held accountable, from political candidates, to public 
broadcasters, to the electoral authorities. This is the most effective means of ensuring that 
opinions and ideas can be freely and fully expressed, communicated, debated and promoted 
during electoral processes.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Political financing 
</b></p>
<p>62. Transparency of political financing is a critical prerequisite for any effective 
democratic process, and a key means of ensuring the equitable protection of free expression 
rights. Political finance may come either from private financing, in the form of individual 
campaign contributions or contributions from the private sector, or from public financing, 
where the Government contributes. Increasingly, States are focusing on regulating political 
finance to ensure transparency and to attempt to achieve an equal playing field for political 
parties.49 There is a general regulatory trend towards the restriction of private financing and 
the prohibition of donations from foreign States or companies, public authorities and 
anonymous persons. This is particularly the case given the rise of third-party financing, 
where individuals, or more often groups or corporate entities, campaign for or against a 
political party to which they are ostensibly unrelated.50 Whereas third-party financing can 
be an important means for private sector groups or civil society organizations to promote 
their chosen candidates or parties, it can also make it difficult for the voting public to know 
what interests are exerting influence on particular political parties and candidates. 
</p>
<p>63. At the same time, many States are moving towards increased public funding for 
political parties to promote a level playing field and reduce dependence on private funding. 
In some countries this takes the form of a direct transfer of money without restrictions upon 
its use; in others public financing includes free access to specific State services such as 
transport, media or government property, or tax exemptions on contributions made to 
political parties.51 
</p>
<p>64. Transparency and accountability around political financing are key to ensuring the 
fairness and integrity of elections. The Global Commission on Elections, Democracy and 
Security identified the regulation of uncontrolled, undisclosed or opaque political finance as 
one of five major challenges that must be overcome to conduct elections with integrity.52 
Increasingly, States are setting limits on how parties may spend their funds, in order to 
reduce the costs of elections and minimize the potential for undue influence of donors on

<p>political candidates. Many States also require the disclosure of expenditure reports of 
parties and candidates, in order to promote public scrutiny and informed voting by citizens. 
Political finance reporting should be comprehensive, timely, available to the public and 
subject to stringent sanctions for inadequate disclosure or timeliness.  
</p><p>65. Political finance is a key concern when protecting and promoting the freedom of 
opinion and expression in electoral and political processes are being considered. 
Restraining campaign spending and creating an equal playing field for political parties and 
candidates are key to ensuring that citizens have access to a diverse range of opinions and 
political choices. At the same time, the provision of financial support to a political party 
may in itself be an act of political expression. A careful balance must therefore be struck by 
each State, reflecting local political values and legal frameworks, while at the same time 
conforming with international human rights norms. This would require, at a minimum, that 
States ensure that there is independent monitoring and oversight of political financing, and 
that every effort is made to ensure that organized crime is prohibited from using campaign 
financing as a means to gain political influence. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Media ownership and influence 
</b></p>
<p>66. An essential area of transparency during electoral processes relates to the ownership 
of, and influence exerted over, the media. The increasing consolidation of media outlets in 
the hands of fewer and fewer companies is of serious concern in the context of political 
communication. Given the critical public service role played by the media, this 
monopolization undermines diversity of opinion, raises the risk that information will be 
controlled or censored, and creates opportunities for bribery, manipulation or exploitation 
by powerful political or social groups. Furthermore, with increasing frequency, national 
media sources are, in part or in full, foreign owned. While foreign ownership of media 
outlets does not in itself undermine the ability of media sources to promote freedom of 
opinion and expression, it obfuscates the influence structures and may create mistrust in the 
voting public.  
</p>
<p>67. Transparency of media ownership enables readers, viewers and voters to understand 
the structures of influence that underpin the campaign, advertising and editorial content that 
so often determine their political choices. States should find a way, either through 
regulatory policy or industry-led self-regulation processes, to promote greater transparency 
in media ownership and influence. The public has a right to know the identities of the 
corporate entities and individuals that influence the media sources upon which it relies for 
information during electoral processes. However, the requirement for transparency of 
private media ownership should not be used as a means of de facto media licensing.  
</p>
<p>68. States should ensure that, in addition to promoting diversity of media ownership and 
making financing and influence structures transparent, they educate the public about the 
importance of understanding how media outlets are financed, and encourage critical 
thinking about how editorial content is developed and how it might reflect the persuasions 
or biases of media owners.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Advancing accountability 
</b></p>
<p>69. The only way for States to ensure that freedom of opinion and expression is freely 
enjoyed and protected during electoral processes is to ensure that mechanisms are in place 
to monitor, record, address and provide redress for violations of free expression rights. </p>


<p><b> 1. Redress for attacks against journalists, activists and political candidates 
</b>70. Harassment of, and violence or threats against, journalists, bloggers or other 
members of the media, activists or political candidates or parties must be prohibited by law 
and subject to criminal penalties. Equally, as the Human Rights Council recognized in its 
resolution 21/12 on the safety of journalists, States must ensure accountability through the 
conduct of impartial, speedy and effective investigations into such acts and bring to justice 
those responsible, as well as ensuring that victims have access to appropriate remedies. 
Accountability mechanisms are the only way to ensure that such attacks do not occur with 
impunity, undermining not only the free expression rights of those involved, but the 
integrity of the electoral process. States should also ensure that legal frameworks protect 
the rights to peaceful assembly and association during electoral processes, and should 
eliminate any practical barriers to the conduct of protests and demonstrations.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Electoral commissions 
</b></p>
<p>71. In many States, electoral commissions are endowed with a range of responsibilities 
that are an essential guarantee against violations of the right to freedom of expression 
during electoral processes. Those responsibilities include election monitoring, the 
regulation of political funding, the provision of direct access to public broadcasting media 
and the monitoring of political speech. However, electoral commissions are often badly 
resourced and lack the necessary regulatory mandate and enforcement powers to fulfil their 
responsibilities and guarantee accountability and transparency in the electoral process. In 
order to ensure that electoral commissions are integral in a free, fair and accountable 
democratic process, States should ensure that they are given sufficient financial and human 
resources, and enforcement powers, to carry out their duties effectively and efficiently. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Opinion polls 
</b></p>
<p>72. Opinion polls can be an important source of accountability, by providing 
information for voters, educating them about the political landscape and contextualizing the 
electoral process. However, some argue that opinion polls may also operate to influence the 
voting pattern of electorates on the basis of the opinions of a small and non-representative 
segment of society. When opinion polls are conducted by corporate media entities, there are 
also concerns that they may allow the private sector to exert influence on the outcome of 
electoral processes. 
</p>
<p>73. Concerns about the possible manipulation of opinion polls to influence electoral 
processes lead some States to restrict the dissemination of poll results for short periods 
leading up to an election; in general the period ranges from 24 to 36 hours. This restriction 
is sometimes justified by the limited capacity for verification of the methodology used by 
the polling agency before the election takes place. In order to ensure transparency and avoid 
the misuse of opinion polls, some countries have adopted requirements on the public 
disclosure of the methodology implemented in opinion polling exercises.  
</p>
<p>74. Exit polling, where voters are surveyed upon exiting a polling booth, are also 
considered risky when their results are reported while votes are being counted. Thus, many 
countries prevent the publication of exit polls until the conclusion of voting. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>75. <b>Freedom of expression plays a central role in ensuring that political processes 
are open, free and fair, thus guaranteeing a functioning and effective democracy. The 
right to participate in public life cannot be fully realized without ensuring the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression in all its dimensions. Free elections become </b></p>


<p><b>impossible if candidates and political groups are unable to freely promote their ideas 
or if the media cannot operate with safety and independence.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>During electoral processes, States must ensure that the right to freedom of 
expression is guaranteed to political candidates and their supporters, opposition 
groups, political lobbies and the whole spectrum of media actors, from news media to 
bloggers, commentators and analysts. Political communications must be unhindered 
by restrictions that hamper the fluid exchange of opinions, whether such restrictions 
come in the form of explicit prohibitions of certain political positions, or limitations 
that indirectly &#8220;chill&#8221; the expression of the opinions of political groups, such as 
controls of media content or on public demonstrations. At the same time, the absence 
of a regulatory framework to control political financing and spending, or to ensure 
accountability and redress for rights violations, also undermines the ability of voters, 
political groups and the media to exercise the right to freedom of expression during 
electoral processes.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The call for an open political debate should not be misunderstood as a call for 
unregulated political campaigns. The adequate regulation of political communications 
is crucial to ensuring a just and equitable space for public dialogue and access to 
information. In a democratic society, elections must never be ruled by market logic, 
with those having greater access to financial support controlling the public debate 
through their disproportionate access to publicity and the media.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Examples from around the world indicate that the regulation of political and 
electoral communications can both enhance and undermine the enjoyment of free 
expression rights during political processes. Therefore, States must carefully evaluate 
the impact of each norm and ensure that an equitable balance is struck in providing 
for a structural environment that will enhance freedom of expression while not 
hindering the independent role of the media or the content of political expression. To 
ensure the adequate translation of norms into practice, it is critical that judicial 
entities and electoral authorities tasked with overseeing respect for the right to 
freedom of expression in electoral processes are totally independent and sufficiently 
resourced to implement their mandates in a timely and effective way. States should 
also take measures to prevent speech that constitutes incitement to hatred, hostility, 
discrimination and violence. 
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>Whereas the international human rights framework does not establish specific 
prescriptions for national regulation of political and electoral communications, it does 
provide very clear guiding principles that should frame the establishment and 
implementation of all regulations. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that, besides 
promoting an adequate environment for the work of the media, States should seek to 
ensure the fulfilment of three key tenets in order to ensure the protection and 
promotion of freedom of expression during electoral processes: pluralism, 
transparency and accountability. 
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>In conclusion, the Special Rapporteur provides the following recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Promote pluralism 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>In order to secure a diverse and pluralistic political process which is hospitable 
to candidates and parties from across the political spectrum, States should: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Remove any regulation of or restriction upon political speech and 
expression, outside of restrictions that fall within well-recognized understandings of 
the permissible limitations on freedom of expression as recognized in international 
human rights law; </b></p>


<p><b>(b) Remove any restrictions or regulations that might place the media under 
political influence or compromise the vital role of the media as public watchdog; and 
take appropriate action, consistent with relevant human rights standards, to promote 
media diversity and prevent undue media dominance or concentration; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Put in place measures to ensure that all political candidates and parties 
have direct access to State-owned broadcast media services for specific times on an 
equal basis, which access is determined either on the basis of the previous 
performance of a given party or candidate or through a ballot process, and that they 
are treated fairly and equitably by those services; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Permanently assess the impact of private financing of political 
communication in the promotion of a plural debate; and consider adopting ceilings for 
donations to political campaigns in order to prevent financial imbalances from 
destabilizing the playing field and disproportionately limiting the participation of 
certain parties or candidates in political campaigns. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Ensure transparency 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The obligations to promote the enjoyment of the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression require that States guarantee the transparency of all aspects of 
political and electoral processes, and should particularly put in place measures to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Enact regulations requiring the submission of periodic financial reports 
by parties, political organizations and candidates, entailing full disclosure of all 
resources collected, in monetary form or in kind, and their origin, and all expenditure, 
in order to promote public scrutiny and informed voting by citizens. Political finance 
reporting should be comprehensive, timely, available to the public, and subject to 
stringent sanctions for inadequate disclosure or timeliness; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Put in place measures to ensure that, in all circumstances, paid political 
advertising is identified as such and not disguised as news or editorial coverage, and 
that the origin of its financial backing is evident; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that the implementation of political financing regulations is 
overseen, monitored and enforced by the electoral authorities, the judiciary and other 
independent bodies; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Take measures to prevent those involved in criminal activity from using 
campaign financing as a means to gain political influence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Promote transparency of media ownership, making public the identity of 
the owners and how it might reflect their persuasions or biases; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Ensure that there is sufficient transparency around the means and 
methodology of opinion polling; and consider prohibiting the dissemination of polling 
results 24 to 36 hours preceding voting. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Ensure accountability 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Accountability mechanisms are a crucial means of ensuring that regulatory 
frameworks are enforced and abuses of power are rectified. Impunity is a root cause 
of the lack of safety faced by journalists. In the context of promoting free expression 
during electoral processes, States should: </b></p>


<p><b>(a) Ensure that electoral authorities or independent oversight bodies are 
given sufficient financial and human resources, and enforcement powers to carry out 
their duties effectively, making all political entities accountable for irregularities, 
including all forms of abuse of political and economic powers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Guarantee the safety of journalists and media workers; legislative and 
policy measures must be adopted to prevent attacks against journalists and to 
eradicate impunity in relation to episodes of violence and intimidation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Call on journalists and the media to seek the highest standards of 
professionalism and ethics through the promotion of self-regulation.  
</b></p>
