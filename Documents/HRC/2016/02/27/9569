<p>HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL 
Fourth session 
Item 2 of the provisional agenda 
</p>
<p><b>IMPLEMENTATION OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION 60/251 
OF 15 MARCH 2006, ENTITLED &#8220;HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>Report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation 
in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 pursuant to  
                 resolution 3/1 of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>1. At its 2nd meeting, on  6 July 2006, the Human Rights Council adopted  resolution S-1/1 
in which it decided &#8220;to dispatch an urgent fact-finding mission headed by the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967&#8221;.  Although the 
terms of the fact-finding mission were not spelled out, in context it was clear that the fact-finding 
mission was established to examine the factual situation in Gaza following the commencement 
of &#8220;Operation Summer Rains&#8221; by the Israel Defense Forces and to report on violations of human 
rights in the course of this Operation. 
</p>
<p>2. On 7 July I met with the President of the Human Rights Council and the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights and their respective staff in order to implement this 
resolution.  It was agreed by all that it would be necessary to obtain the consent of the 
Government of Israel for this mission as required by the General Assembly in paragraph 6 of its 
resolution 46/59 entitled:  &#8220;Declaration on Fact-finding by the United Nations in the Field of the 
Maintenance of International Peace and Security&#8221; ... .  To this end, it was agreed that the 
President would approach the Ambassador of Israel for such consent on the basis of a 
memorandum on the proposed mission prepared by the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>GE.06-15587  (E)    281206 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>3. On 10 July 2006, I submitted such a memorandum to the President and the 
High Commissioner setting out the objectives, timing, duration and composition of the mission 
together with proposals of places to visit and persons to consult.  The memorandum proposed 
that the mission should &#8220;visit the Occupied Palestinian Territory as soon as possible and 
preferably before the end of July&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>4. The President of the Human Rights Council met shortly afterwards with the 
Ambassador of Israel and requested the consent of the Government of Israel for the mission.  
The President later informed me that the Ambassador had indicated that he would seek 
instructions on the matter from the Government of Israel and give his reply as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>5. I then proceeded to constitute the fact-finding mission.  I approached a military security 
officer and an expert in public health to join the mission under my leadership.  Arrangements 
were made for the assistance of two staff members of the Office of the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights, one security officer and interpreters.  The mission was planned to last for 7 
to 10 days. 
</p>
<p>6.  As the days passed, I became worried that the President of the Human Rights Council 
had received no reply from the Government of Israel.  On Tuesday 18 July 2006, I spoke with 
the President who told me that he had asked the Ambassador to provide him with a reply by 
20 July.  Later the President informed me that the Ambassador had told him that the Government 
of Israel required more time to make its decision. 
</p>
<p>7.  On 21 July the President wrote a letter to the Ambassador in which he requested a reply 
to his request for consent to the mission by 24 July, failing which he would have to inform the 
members of the Council.  To the best of my knowledge the President received no reply to this 
letter. 
</p>
<p>8.  The days and weeks passed without any response from the Ambassador of Israel.  At 
least I was not informed of any such response.  Consequently, on 8 August I wrote a letter to the 
President (copied to the High Commissioner and the sponsors of resolution S-1/1) in which I 
stated: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;We have now waited for more than a month to receive a reply from the Government of 
Israel  I think we have no alternative but to construe its failure to reply as a refusal.  In 
my view you should notify the Government of Israel that this is the position and that you 
should report accordingly to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>&#8230; 
</p>
<p>I request you to kindly inform the Human Rights Council that in my view it is pointless 
to persist with the fact-finding mission requested on 6 July as the Government of Israel 
has, by its failure to respond to your request, indicated very clearly that it will not grant 
permission to the visit of such a fact-finding mission.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>9. I was accordingly not able to head a fact-finding mission to the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory  in July-August 2006 as required by the Human Rights Council in its resolution S-1/1.  
I did, however, compile a report on the situation in Gaza, following the start of &#8220;Operation </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Summer Rains&#8221;, and other issues of concern to the Human Rights Council in its special session 
of 6 July.  This report, based on secondary sources and on my visit to the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory (including Gaza) from 9 to 17 June 2006, was incorporated in my report (A/HRC/2/5), 
which was considered by the Human Rights Council on 26 September 2006. 
</p>
<p>10.  I reported to the Human Rights Council on 29 Septemberthat I had been unable to carry 
out the requested fact-finding mission as a result of the failure of the Government of Israel to 
consent to the mission. 
</p>
<p>11.  I visited the Occupied Palestinian Territory  from 1 to 8 December 2006, in my capacity 
as Special Rapporteur  on the situation of human rights in the on the situation of human rights in 
the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967.  I did not require the consent of the Government 
of Israel for this mission but I did as a matter of courtesy inform the  Ambassador of Israel in 
Geneva of my visit.  At the same time I assured him that I did not intend to visit the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory  in pursuance of resolution S-1/1 but in my capacity as Special Rapporteur.  
The Government of Israel accordingly agreed to facilitate my visit, as it has done in the past, by 
providing me with a letter which explained the purpose of my visit and requested the relevant 
Israeli authorities to facilitate my movements in the  Occupied Palestinian Territory.  Although 
the Government of Israel refuses to accept my mandate, and consequently to have any contacts 
with me at governmental level during my visits, it has greatly facilitated my movements by 
issuing me with the letter described above. 
</p>
<p>12. On my visit to the Occupied Palestinian Territory  from 1 to 8 December, I investigated 
the human rights situation in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.  My report on this visit is 
contained in document (A/HRC/4/17).  While I investigated the human rights situation, I did not 
undertake fact-finding for the following reasons.  First, this was not the purpose of my visit.  
Second, I lacked the expertise on my own to carry out such a task. 
</p>
<p>13.  In the result I have not been able to carry out the fact-finding mission requested by the 
Council in its resolution S-1/1 as a result of the failure of the Government of Israel to consent to 
such a mission.
