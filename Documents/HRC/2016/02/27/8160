</p>
<p><i>Summary  
</i></p>
<p> The present report contains the findings and recommendations of the former Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
while countering terrorism, Martin Scheinin, on his follow-up mission to Tunisia from 22 
to 26 May 2011. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to the interim Government of 
Tunisia for the invitation to conduct the follow-up mission in order to assess how Tunisia 
was making progress in implementing the recommendations contained in his report on his 
previous mission, conducted from 22 to 26 January 2010 (A/HRC/16/51/Add.2). The 
Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that the interim Government regarded them as 
conducive to helping Tunisia to express its will to build a new culture of human rights in 
the context of countering terrorism. The invitation extended to the Special Rapporteur, and 
broad legislative reforms to bring the laws of Tunisia into line with international human 
rights standards that the interim Government planned to initiate, including a reform of the 
2003 anti-terrorism law or the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and other 
international human rights instruments, are promising signs of a  break with the past of 
human rights abuses in the context of countering terrorism committed under the Ben Ali 
regime. 
</p>

</p>
<p>itself, contained in the annex to the summary, is circulated in the language of submission 
and in French only.

<p><b>2</b> 
</p>
<p> The first set of recommendations contained in the previous mission report of the 
Special Rapporteur centred on the provisions of the 2003 anti-terrorism law. The Special 
Rapporteur had recommended the revision of the definition of terrorism and provisions 
relating to membership in terrorist groups, and incitement to and the financing of terrorism. 
In his assessment, the law did not provide more security to the Tunisian people, but was in 
the past widely abused as a tool of repression against any form of political dissent. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the decision of the interim Government to 
provide for a general amnesty for all political prisoners pursuant to the 19 February 2011 
decree law relating to amnesty on the basis of which all prisoners detained as at 14 January 
2011 under the 2003 anti-terrorism law, security related provisions of the Penal Code or 
article 123 of the Code of Military Justice had been released. 
</p>
<p> Although the amnesty law made the 2003 anti-terrorism law de facto obsolete, the 
Special Rapporteur was surprised to learn during his follow up visit to Al Mornaguia prison 
that at least two recently arrived detainees had been detained on the basis of the 2003 anti-
terrorism law. The Special Rapporteur observes that the paradoxical status of the law is 
highly problematic from a rule of law perspective, given that a law cannot be enforced and 
not enforced at the same time, and requests the Government of Tunisia to resolve this 
ambiguous situation with immediacy. 
</p>
<p> One of the most disturbing findings of the Special Rapporteur during his previous 
mission in 2010 was the pattern of unacknowledged detention under the interrogation 
authority of the Ministry of the Interior, which was used secretly to detain terrorist 
suspects. During the period of secret detention on the premises of the Ministry of the 
Interior, practices of torture to obtain confessions were not the exception, but the rule. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the confirmation received from all official 
interlocutors during the follow-up visit that such detentions no longer take place. He 
regards the decision by the interim Government to open the doors of the previously secret 
detention facility, and all other detention facilities in the country, to scrutiny by his 
mandate, international and regional organizations and non-governmental organizations, as a 
new sign of transparency. While the follow-up visit of the Special Rapporteur was held in a 
general atmosphere of cooperation and good will, he remains concerned, however, that 
some officials remaining from the Ben Ali regime were defensive, evasive or dismissive of 
the extent of human rights violations that had happened in the past. This was manifested in 
the refusal to allow the Special Rapporteur to inspect offices on the premises of the 
Ministry of the Interior where abusive interrogation had invariably taken place according to 
the findings in his report on the previous mission. 
</p>
<p> In the report on his previous mission, the Special Rapporteur expressed grave 
concerns about the activities of various entities of the Tunisian security apparatus and the 
secrecy and impunity in which they operated. The Special Rapporteur therefore welcomes 
the announcement made on 7 March 2011 by the Ministry of the Interior that it was 
dissolving the Directorate for State Security (DSS) and the &#8220;political police&#8221;, which did not 
exist officially, but can be described as those elements in the security organs related to the 
Ministry that were responsible for cracking down on political opponents to the Ben Ali 
regime, irrespective of the entity by which the officer was officially employed. 
</p>
<p> While welcoming this announcement and other initial steps taken to remove from 
office, investigate and prosecute those responsible for serious human rights violations 
committed in the past, also in the context of countering terrorism, including the 
establishment of the National Commission to Establish the Facts of Abuses and Violations 
from 17 December 2010 until the Elimination of Their Cause, the Special Rapporteur 
considers that much more needs to be done to provide truth, justice, reparations and 
guarantees of non-recurrence. It is of utmost importance that a real investigation be 
initiated into the crimes committed by the DSS and that all those who were involved in 
these practices be removed, from office, subjected to a fair trial and, if found guilty, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>3 
</b></p>
<p>punished. Legislation envisaged by the interim Government to provide for reparations to 
victims of human rights abuses should be adopted without delay. 
</p>
<p> In this context, and in a spirit of cooperation, the Special Rapporteur recommends 
that the Government of Tunisia proceed to, inter alia, resolve the ambiguous status of the 
2003 anti-terrorism law; if it decides to prepare special legislation for countering terrorism, 
that it introduce a bill for its replacement that fully complies with international human 
rights norms and standards; introduce amendments to legislation to strengthen the 
safeguards against torture and other forms of ill-treatment; introduce legislative, 
institutional and budgetary reforms to strengthen the independence of the judiciary; and 
initiate ex officio investigations into allegations of torture and illegal detentions in the 
context of the fight against terrorism during the Ben Ali regime; and provide reparations to 
those who were harmed.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The former Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Martin Scheinin, conducted a follow-up 
visit to Tunisia from 22 to 26 May 2011 at the invitation of the interim Government. The 
purpose of the mission was to assess the progress made by the country in implementing the 
recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur after his previous country mission 
conducted from 22 to 26 January 2010 (A/HRC/16/51/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>2. During his five-day mission, the Special Rapporteur met with the Minister for Justice 
and Human Rights, the Prosecutor-General for the Administration of Justice, the Director-
General for Prison Administration, the Director-General for International Cooperation and 
other officials at the Ministry of Justice; the Minister for the Interior, the Director-General 
for External Relations and International Cooperation, the Director-General for National 
Security, the Director-General of the National Guard, the Head of the Human Rights Unit, 
representatives of the Directorate for Criminal Investigations (<i>Police judiciaire</i>), the 
Directorate for Legal Studies and Disputes and other officials at the Ministry of the Interior; 
the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and other officials at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs; and other members of the interim Government. The Special Rapporteur also 
attended a class at the Security Forces Staff College and gave a brief lecture on counter-
terrorism measures and compliance with international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>3. Another important part of the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s mission were the meetings with 
the Chairperson of the National Commission to Establish the Facts of Abuses and 
Violations from 17 December 2010 until the Elimination of their Cause; the spokesperson 
of the High Authority for the Achievement of the Revolution&#8223;s Objectives, Political Reform 
</p>
<p>and Democratic Transition; and representatives of civil society organizations, and lawyers. 
In addition, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with the United Nations country team, 
the International Committee of the Red Cross and the diplomatic community. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur visited the detention centres at Bouchoucha and Al 
Mornaguia Prison, where he was able to interview suspects of terrorist crimes in private.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his gratitude to the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Resident Coordinator, the 
United Nations country team, the members of his delegation, and others involved in 
organizing the visit for the excellent assistance prior to, throughout and after the mission.  
He would also like to thank the members of civil society for meeting with him.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur presented his preliminary findings to the interim Government 
on the closing day of his mission and held a press conference. On 30 December 2011, he 
shared a preliminary version in French of the present report with the Government, 
following the transmission of a version in English on 6 December.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Findings  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Context of the follow-up mission  
</b></p>
<p>7. When the former Special Rapporteur presented his previous mission report 
(A/HRC/16/51/Add.2) to the Human Rights Council on 7 March 2011, the representative of 
the new interim Government of Tunisia reacted positively to many of the conclusions and 
recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in the report. The Special Rapporteur 
was pleased to learn that the interim Government regarded them as conducive to helping </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>Tunisia to express its will to build a new culture of human rights in the context of 
countering terrorism. The interim Government was planning to initiate broad legislative 
reforms to bring its laws into line with international human rights norms and standards, 
including a reform of the 2003 anti-terrorism law1 in order to prevent its abuse against 
innocent persons. It had adopted an amnesty law for persons convicted on the basis of the 
anti-terrorism law; according to the interim Government, thousands of political prisoners 
had already benefitted from the amnesty law. The interim Government also pledged to 
reinforce the independence of the judiciary. It acknowledged the existence of secret 
detention facilities, and announced that it had put an end to the practice of secret detention 
and had opened prisons and other facilities where people were deprived of their liberty to 
the scrutiny of international and regional organizations and non-governmental organizations 
since 14 January 2011. The interim Government promised to ratify the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment to prevent such practices from taking place in the future. The overarching aim 
of the interim Government, as expressed to the Special Rapporteur by Government 
interlocutors of the highest level, was to make the achievements of the revolution 
irreversible and enter into an era where human rights and the rule of law are promoted and 
protected. The Special Rapporteur was assured that visits such as his and that of other 
human rights mechanisms and representatives of non-governmental organizations, as well 
as the presence of OHCHR, which had opened an office in the country following an 
assessment mission from 26 January to 2 February 20112 were highly welcome in the new 
Tunisia, as they helped the interim Government to correct past wrongs. In this atmosphere 
of increased transparency, the interim Government issued an invitation to the former 
mandate holder to conduct a follow-up mission in order to assess how Tunisia was making 
progress in implementing the recommendations made in the previous mission report.3  
</p>
<p><b> B. Definition of terrorism and the amnesty decree law 
</b></p>
<p>8. The first set of recommendations made in the previous mission report centred on the 
provisions of amended Law No. 2003-75 of 10 December 2003. The Special Rapporteur 
recommended the revision of the definition of terrorism and provisions relating to 
membership in terrorist groups, incitement to and financing of terrorism. Its article 4 
defines terrorism as:  
</p>
<p>every crime, regardless of its motives, connected to an individual or collective 
initiative (&#8222;enterprise&#8223;) aiming at terrorizing one person or a group of people and 
spreading fear among the population, for the purpose of, among other things, 
influencing State policies and compelling it to act in a particular way or preventing it 
from so acting; or disturbing public order or international peace and security, or 
attacking people or facilities, damaging buildings housing diplomatic missions, 
prejudicing the environment, so as to endangering the life of its inhabitants, their 
health or jeopardizing vital resources, infrastructures, means of transport and 
communications, computer systems or public services.  
</p>
<p>The definition of terrorism had to be changed and to be expressed in precise terms so that it 
fulfilled the requirement of legality enshrined in article 15 of the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 1 Law No. 2003-75 of 10 December 2003 on the support of international efforts in the fight against 
</p>
<p>terrorism and the suppression of money laundering, <i>Journal officiel de la R&#233;publique tunisienne</i>, 12 
December 2003, p. 3592, as amended.

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights, which requires that all elements of a crime have to be 
encapsulated in legal definitions in explicit and precise terms.  
</p>
<p>9. Furthermore, as emphasized in several reports by the Special Rapporteur, deadly or 
otherwise serious physical violence against members of the general population or segments 
of it must be the central element of any definition of terrorism. If prosecutions relating to 
membership in terrorist groups, incitement to and financing of terrorism result in 
restrictions of human rights, such as the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, 
association or religion, such restrictions must comply with the requirements of necessity 
and proportionality.4 
</p>
<p>10. The concern about the definition of terrorism and its potential for abuse against 
political opponents, students, human rights activists, trade union officials, journalists or 
bloggers came to the fore when former President, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, called the then 
ongoing nationwide protests &#8220;acts of terrorism&#8221; during a speech broadcast on national 
television on 11 January 2011.5 Statements like these highlighted the potential for abuse of 
the 2003 anti-terrorism law, and its application indeed facilitated torture and secret 
detention. This law did not provide the Tunisian people with more security, but was widely 
abused as a tool of oppression against any form of political dissent. It was also 
counterproductive in the fight against actual terrorism as it had the effect of overstating the 
phenomenon. In the words of one civil society interlocutor with whom the Special 
Rapporteur met, &#8220;Tunisia had terrorists, but no terrorism&#8221;. The negation of human rights by 
an oppressive regime, including under the pretext of countering terrorism, ultimately set 
one of the causes for bringing together a critical mass of people from very different walks 
of life to pursue their aspirations for a free and democratic society and a Government that 
respects human rights. Tunisia has become a symbol of this lesson. 
</p>
<p>11. At the first session of the first interim Government of Tunisia on 20 January 2011, an 
initial decision was made to provide for a general amnesty for all political prisoners. This 
decision became law in a decree signed by then Acting President, Foued Mebazaa, on 19 
February 2011.6 The decree applied to anybody who had been convicted or prosecuted for, 
inter alia, a violation of any provision of the 2003 anti-terrorism law, an attempt on the 
internal security of the State as foreseen in articles 63 to 83 of the Tunisian Penal Code, or a 
violation of the provisions of the second and third paragraphs of article 123 of the Code of 
Military Justice, which penalizes any Tunisian civilian who, in time of peace, provides 
services to or cooperates with any foreign army or any organization qualified as &#8220;terrorist&#8221; 
that operates abroad, or who incites to the above-mentioned crimes or facilitates them by 
any means. According to article 2 of the decree, all those who were affected by the amnesty 
law were entitled to be reinstated in their work and to apply for reparations. 
</p>
<p>12. During the mission, the Special Rapporteur learned that all prisoners detained as at 14 
January 2011 on the basis of the 2003 anti-terrorism law, security related provisions of the 
Penal Code or article 123 of the Code of Military Justice had been released. This included 
prisoners who had been returned to Tunisia by certain European States, two former 
Guant&#225;namo Bay detainees and all members of the political party Ennahda. A total of 8,700 
people benefited from this amnesty law either by being released from prison or &#8211; in the 
broad majority of cases &#8211; by being restored their political rights.  
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur was informed by a credible source that some 3,000 people 
had been tried and sentenced under the 2003 anti-terrorism law only, many for such 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8220;offences&#8221; as growing beards, wearing specific clothing or for consulting prohibited 
Internet sites. By the time of the visit of the Special Rapporteur, 217 people held on the 
basis of the 2003 anti-terrorism law had been released from prison. Suspects who were in 
pretrial detention were freed by a court order, while those convicted were released on the 
basis of a decision by the Minister for Justice and Human Rights. The Special Rapporteur 
was informed by the Prosecutor-General for the Administration of Justice that a number of 
those released under the amnesty law had subsequently been tried and convicted for 
reportedly recognizable offences under ordinary criminal law, and that cases were pending 
on appeal before the Supreme Court; exact statistics could not, however, be provided. In 
this respect, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern credible information received that 
some beneficiaries of the amnesty law were pushed back at the border on the basis of 
restraining orders or re-arrested on the basis of mere search warrants, both stemming from 
the time of the Ben Ali regime. 
</p>
<p>14. The adoption of the amnesty law made the 2003 anti-terrorism law de facto obsolete. 
This impression was confirmed by all Government representatives whom the Special 
Rapporteur met during the follow-up mission. They confirmed that the law was &#8220;dormant&#8221; 
but not yet officially scrapped from the books; however, without the formal repeal of the 
law, it is up to the judiciary to decide whether or not the law is still in force and, for 
instance, whether to use it as a basis to order the detention of terrorist suspects.  
</p>
<p>15. During his follow-up visit to Al Mornaguia prison, the Special Rapporteur was 
surprised to learn that at least two recently arrived detainees had been detained on the basis 
of the 2003 anti-terrorism law. This paradoxical status of the law is highly problematic 
from the perspective of the rule of law, as a law cannot be enforced and not enforced at the 
same time. It is important that this ambiguous situation be resolved as soon as possible. 
During the mission, the Special Rapporteur was informed by high-level Government 
officials that a reform of the 2003 anti-terrorism law was under way, but that it would be 
replaced only after a new Constitution comes into force. The Special Rapporteur offered his 
good services to provide technical assistance in the drafting in accordance with the mandate 
bestowed upon him by the Human Rights Council, and was encouraged by the assurances 
received from competent Government interlocutors that the assistance of his mandate 
would be sought for the drafting process. 
</p>
<p>16. The arrest and detention of the foreign terrorist suspects in question was related to the 
then ongoing violence in Libya and the movement of armed individuals through the 
territory of Tunisia, possibly in order to enter Libya. Such developments illustrate the 
reality of the threat of international terrorism for Tunisia, especially in the context of the 
porous border with Libya, and a further reason for swiftly establishing a proper legal 
framework to counter terrorism. Home-grown terrorism, assured Government interlocutors, 
had not been a major problem in Tunisia before or after the revolution, save for an attack, 
qualified as terrorist, that had led to the deaths of tourists visiting Tunisia in 2002. 
However, in the assessment of a representative from the interim Government, which was 
shared by a representative of civil society, poverty is considered to be a fertile ground for 
terrorism in Tunisia and that the consequences would include the real threat of terrorist 
hostage-taking. 
</p>
<p>17. Article 5 of decree law No 2011-14 dated 23 March 2011,7 relating to the provisional 
organization of the public authorities, provides the interim Government with the explicit 
possibility of adopting a new decree law related to &#8220;the fight against terrorism and money 
laundering&#8221;. The decision of whether or not to adopt a new, separate anti-terrorism law 
rather than relying on the existing offences of the Tunisian Penal Code is a sovereign 
decision that the Government of Tunisia and the legislature need to make. The Special 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 7 <i>Journal officiel de la R&#233;publique tunisienne</i>, 25 March 2011, p. 365. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Rapporteur is fully cognizant of the fact that some of the civil society representatives and 
certain Government officials met during the mission cautioned against the adoption of a 
separate legal framework for countering terrorism, citing the abuses that occurred in 
Tunisia in the past under the pretext of the fight against terrorism and arguing that ordinary 
criminal and criminal procedure legislation in force would suffice. However, in the light of 
the State&#8223;s international legal obligations to, inter alia, prevent the financing of terrorism, 
the adoption of a new anti-terrorism law is advisable. 
</p>
<p>18. In order to provide the Tunisian people with the security they deserve, the Special 
Rapporteur offered the assistance of his mandate to create a proper legislative framework to 
regulate the State&#8223;s anti-terrorism efforts in line with international instruments on 
countering terrorism, while being in full conformity with international human rights norms 
and standards. Inspiration for such a legal framework can be drawn from his last thematic 
report as Special Rapporteur on 10 areas of best practice in countering terrorism8 and from 
Security Council resolution 1566 (2004), paragraph 3. 
</p>
<p>19. In May 2011, the same month as the follow-up visit of the Special Rapporteur, 
Tunisian security forces uncovered in Tunisia several people from neighbouring countries 
who were allegedly related to &#8220;Al Qaeda in the Maghreb&#8221;. In one particular event in 
Rouhia, two members of the National Guard and two terrorist suspects reportedly died 
during a violent confrontation. According to official sources, one Tunisian terrorist suspect 
had fled the scene and was still at large. Some of the interlocutors of the Special Rapporteur 
suggested that this particular event had led to various forms of harassment against people 
who had earlier been released under the amnesty law. They feared that such an event could 
easily be abused, falling back on the old habits of the former regime. The Special 
Rapporteur is not in a position to verify these claims, but notes again that such claims 
indicate the urgency of adopting a proper legal framework for counter-terrorism. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Addressing the former practice of secret police custody 
</b></p>
<p>20. One of the most disturbing findings of the previous mission in 2010 was the pattern 
of unacknowledged detention under the interrogation authority of the Ministry of the 
Interior, which was used to secretly detain terrorist suspects. Their official date of arrest 
was recorded at Bouchoucha police station &#8211; where the terrorist suspects pass through 
before being taken into pretrial detention upon a decision of the judge &#8211; only much later, 
after the authorities have obtained a confession. During the period of secret detention on the 
premises of the Ministry of the Interior, practices of torture were not the exception, but the 
rule, in total disregard not only for the international human rights obligations that Tunisia 
had undertaken, but also for the articles of the Constitution of Tunisia and the provisions of 
ordinary laws safeguarding against such practices.9  
</p>
<p>21. All the official interlocutors of the Special Rapporteur stressed during his follow-up 
visit that such detentions no longer took place. As a sign of new transparency, the interim 
Government opened the doors of its previously secret detention facility at the Ministry of 
the Interior to the Special Rapporteur. This facility consisted of around a dozen cells of 
various sizes, ranging from 8 to 14 m2, which were positioned around a large room with 
direct access from the closed courtyard of the Ministry. In one room, 70 mattresses were 
piled up. One staircase in the facility led to the upper floors of the Ministry. Unfortunately, 
the premises had not been preserved in their original state; for example, the walls had 
received a fresh coat of white paint.  
</p>

</p>
<p>22. While the mission of the Special Rapporteur was conducted in a general atmosphere 
of cooperation and good faith, some officials remaining from the Ben Ali regime were 
defensive, evasive or dismissive when questioned about the extent of illegal practices of the 
past; for example, the Special Rapporteur&#8223;s delegation was shown what were supposed to 
be the only two interrogation rooms at the entrance of the formerly secret detention facility 
at the Ministry of the Interior. In his previous mission report, however, the Special 
Rapporteur had found that interrogations invariably did not take place in these two small 
white cabins at the entrance, but on the upper floors of the offices of the Ministry of the 
Interior.10 This fact was still denied by some officials, who insisted that the two small white 
cabins were the only interrogation facilities in the building. The Special Rapporteur was 
also disturbed to learn during his follow-up visit to Bouchoucha police station that no 
disciplinary or criminal proceedings had been initiated against those who collaborated in 
the practice of back-dating dates of arrests of terrorism suspects in the past that resulted in 
secret detention. 
</p>
<p>23.  The Special Rapporteur notes that two related recurring problems in the country&#8223;s 
criminal justice system have still not been resolved. Firstly, suspects still do not have 
effective access to a lawyer immediately after apprehension.11 This is a crucial issue that 
should be introduced in the legal framework as soon as possible, since lack of access has 
greatly contributed to the impunity under which torture has been carried out in the past, also 
in the context of countering terrorism. 12 <b> </b>Secondly, a more elaborate system of bail is 
urgently needed in order to prevent overcrowding and to lower the number of people 
currently under <i>garde &#224; vue</i> or in pretrial detention. At Al Mornaguia prison, for instance, 
the Special Rapporteur found that, even after the implementation of the amnesty law, more 
than 60 per cent of the 5,462 prisoners were pretrial detainees, which is an unacceptably 
high ratio and cannot be explained simply on the basis of the limited number of functioning 
prisons (17 of which were set alight during the revolution, were thus not fully in use and 
required the transfer of inmates to other usable detention facilities).  
</p>
<p>24. In order to abolish the practice of secret detention and to strengthen independent 
domestic and international monitoring mechanisms over domestic detention facilities, one 
of the recommendations made in the mission report and addressed to the former 
Government was the ratification of Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.13 
During the follow-up mission, the Special Rapporteur commended the interim Government 
for its decision to ratify or to accede to several international instruments, including the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance,14 
the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,15 the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture 16  and the Rome Statute of the

<p>International Criminal Court,17 but emphasized that such promises turn into real rights only 
when implemented by depositing the international instrument of accession. On 29 June 
2011, one month after the follow-up visit, Tunisia acceded to the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture. In June 2011, Tunisia also acceded to the Optional Protocol to 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and to the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court, and ratified the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. While the Special Rapporteur welcome these 
important measures, he feels that a concern from his previous report should, however, be 
reiterated. In general, the country&#8223;s pre-revolutionary legal framework provided procedural 
and substantive guarantees that should have prevented many abuses and human rights 
violations from taking place. These guarantees, however, were circumvented in a number of 
ways, described by the Special Rapporteur in his previous report.18 There must be no new 
gap between the law and the reality in Tunisia. Changes in laws and policies is an important 
first step, but these changes must be accompanied by institutional changes and the 
replacement of all Government officials involved in atrocious human rights violations, 
following a proper vetting process. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged at information 
received from the interim Government that 10,000 new recruitments to the security services 
had been carried out, but was surprised to see that some of the officials that he encountered 
at the Ministry of the Interior during the follow-up visit were the same that he had met in 
January 2010 during his first mission. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Reform of State security entities and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>25. In his previous report, the Special Rapporteur expressed grave concerns about the 
activities of various entities of the security apparatus, and the secrecy and impunity in 
which they operated. He singled out the Directorate for State Security<b> </b>(DSS)<b> </b>as a crucial 
entity that was responsible for activities of torture, and arbitrary and even secret detention. 
The Special Rapporteur therefore welcomes the announcement of the Ministry of the 
Interior, made on 7 March 2011, that it was dissolving both the DSS and the &#8220;political 
police&#8221;. The latter did not exist officially and can generally be described as those members 
of the security organs related to the Ministry of the Interior, notably within the DSS/<i>Police 
judiciaire</i>, that were responsible for cracking down on political activities by political 
opponents, students, human rights activists, trade union officials, journalists, bloggers and 
others, irrespective of the entity by which the officer was officially employed. It is unclear, 
however, how many officials have been affected by this abolition, and what the 
implications were for their future status. The Special Rapporteur also received inconclusive 
accounts about whether those who served in the DSS had been dismissed, forced to retire or 
simply moved to new positions inside the Ministry of the Interior or other parts of the State 
security apparatus. While the abolition of these two bodies is a welcome step, it does not 
amount to holding individual members of these entities to account for the crimes they have 
committed.  
</p>
<p>26. Changes to the way the State&#8223;s security organs operate should not be limited to 
slogans but should result in concrete measures. The first steps for establishing 
accountability have been taken in relation to officials who cracked down on demonstrators 
after 17 December 2010. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this positive development, but 
stresses that, for Tunisia to be able to truly look forward to a new era, it has to come to 
terms with the dark remnants of its past.<b> </b>Therefore, it is of utmost importance that a real 
</p>

Immunities of the Court. <i>Journal officiel de la R&#233;publique tunisienne,</i> 22 February 2011, p. 181.

</p>
<p>investigation be initiated into the crimes committed by the DSS, and that those who were 
involved in these practices be removed from office, subjected to a fair trial and, if found 
guilty, punished. The Special Rapporteur learned that, at the time of his follow-up mission, 
66 security officials had been arrested and taken into pretrial detention, including a former 
Minister for the Interior, seven high-ranking officials had been prosecuted, and 42 others 
had been forced to retire or went into voluntary retirement, including some 10 members of 
the leadership of the National Guard. Tunisia should continue along the same path and 
investigate <i>ex officio</i> allegations of torture and illegal detention committed in the context of 
the fight against terrorism. Requiring victims of serious human rights violations committed 
in the past, including in the context of counter-terrorism, to submit complaints before an 
investigation is opened would subject them to an uphill battle. The need to reinforce this <i>ex 
officio</i> mechanism is also linked to the general lack of trust of the Tunisian people in the 
independence and effectiveness of the judicial system and the presence of some 
representatives of the Ben Ali regime remaining in office, which might deter them from 
filing complaints. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about reports he received during his 
follow-up visit that complaints may have to be filed with the same State entity whose 
agents are alleged to have committed these human rights abuses.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur commends the interim Government for having established a 
mechanism, in the form of a fact-finding commission, as a first step for ultimately 
providing truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence of serious human 
rights violations. He feels, however, duty-bound to stress that such an investigative 
mechanism cannot &#8211; and indeed is not meant to &#8211; substitute justice, including criminal 
justice, which should be allowed to take its course. The fact-finding commission does not 
have any prosecutorial, let alone judicial, powers to bring to justice the perpetrators of 
excesses committed in the context of countering terrorism and hold them to account, nor 
can it award compensation or other forms of reparation to the victims of abuses. In addition, 
its mandate is limited in time to investigate and document human rights violations that 
occurred after 17 December 2010; it is imperative, therefore, that accountability be 
established prior to this date. 19  In the view of the Special Rapporteur, however, it is 
nonetheless a very important mechanism, since it is mandated to make its final report 
available to the President of the country and to the public at large, and to submit its findings 
and relevant evidence to the Office of the Public Prosecutor so that criminal investigations 
leading to prosecution may be initiated.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>28. In his previous report, the Special Rapporteur also highlighted the lack of publicly 
available information in which several security organs of the State performed, including the 
secrecy surrounding decree No. 246 of 15 August 2007, which purportedly clarified the 
structure of the internal security forces under the Ministry of the Interior,20 but was not a 
publicly available document. The previous Government of Tunisia itself, in its comments of 
2 December 2010 on the draft report on the first mission to Tunisia by the Special 
Rapporteur, stated that:  
</p>
<p>The structures under the Internal Security Forces within the Ministry of the Interior 
and Local Development, to prevent and combat terrorism, operate in the context of 
specialization and complementarity; a decree organizing such structures attached to 
the Directorate General of National Security, on the one hand, and the Directorate 
General of the National Guard, on the other (Decree n&#176; 246-2007 of August 15, 
2007).  
</p>
<p>29. During his follow-up mission, the Special Rapporteur requested a copy of the above-
mentioned decree from Government interlocutors operating under the auspices of the 
</p>
<p>

<p>relevant ministries, who all referred him to the Ministry of the Interior as the appropriate 
entity. The Special Rapporteur regrets the fact that he was not provided with a copy of the 
decree during his visit despite the assurances of the Minster of the Interior to the contrary. 
In a note verbale dated 28 June 2011, the interim Government of Tunisia transmitted, 
however, a document entitled &#8220;Circular No. 246 of 15 August 2007&#8221;, which outlined the 
structure of the Ministry of the Interior but had the appearance of an organization chart 
lacking all formal elements of a law.  
</p>
<p>30. According to &#8220;Circular No. 246&#8221;, the Ministry of the Interior is divided into three 
subdirectorates: the General Directorate for National Security, the General Directorate of 
the National Guard, and the National Bureau for Civil Protection. The General Directorate 
for National Security has eight subdivisions, including the Directorate of Special Services 
and the General Directorate for Public Security. The General Directorate for Public 
Security is in turn divided into six subdivisions, including the <i>Police judiciaire, </i>which 
comprises four entities, one of which is the Subdirectorate for Criminal Affairs.  
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur regrets that he has been unable to establish the existence, 
nature and contents of a &#8220;Decree No. 246 of 15 August 2007&#8221; during his two missions, 
which only confirmed his previous findings: namely, that it was this secrecy that was an 
important element that contributed to the shield of impunity behind which the actors of the 
Tunisian security apparatus under the Ben Ali regime could operate. In transparent States, 
all functions and powers of the security organs are regulated by publicly available laws. 
Such transparency prevents not only the creation of myths about what these agencies do but 
also ensures their accountability when these agencies commit illegal acts. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Reparations 
</b></p>
<p>32. During his follow-up visit, the Special Rapporteur sensed a general dissatisfaction 
within civil society with the way in which the interim Government was progressing with 
the issue of reparations for past human rights abuses. He was informed that separate 
legislation providing for reparations was envisaged by the interim Government, but had not 
yet been adopted. Article 2 of the amnesty law21 also envisages the adoption of a specific 
legal framework for reparations to be awarded to the beneficiaries of the law, stating that 
&#8220;all those who will be concerned by the amnesty in accordance with the decree-law herein 
will be entitled to the right to return to their employment and to a damages request. The 
requests for damages submitted by the persons benefiting from the amnesty will be 
examined in accordance with the procedures and methods fixed by a specific legal 
framework.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur has always emphasized in his country missions and thematic 
reports the importance of providing redress and assistance to victims of human rights 
violations committed in the context of countering actual or perceived terrorism, and also to 
victims of terrorist acts, from the State budget.22 He therefore encourages Tunisia to swiftly 
adopt and implement a legal framework and set aside the necessary funding for reparative 
measures for past human rights violations, including for the compensation and 
rehabilitation of victims of counter-terrorism measures.

<p><b> III. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>34. <b>The Special Rapporteur was able to conduct his follow-up mission in a spirit of 
cooperation with general transparency and openness extended to him by all the 
</b></p>
<p><b>interlocutors from the interim Government whom he met. He remains concerned, 
</b></p>
<p><b>however, that some officials were still in a state of denial about the existence of 
</b></p>
<p><b>interrogation rooms on the upper office floors of the Ministry of the Interior that were 
</b></p>
<p><b>used during the Ben Ali era for the secret detention of terrorism suspects in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>obtain confessions under torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</b></p>
<p><b>treatment.  
</b></p>
<p>35. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the interim Government  has 
embarked upon legal reforms to bring its legislation into conformity with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights law and standards, and has ratified or acceded to several 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights instruments, including the Optional Protocol to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</b></p>
<p><b>Punishment, as an important instrument for the prevention of torture and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>forms of ill-treatment, also in the context of counter-terrorism.  
</b></p>
<p>36. <b>The Special Rapporteur also welcomes the adoption by the interim Government 
of an amnesty law, pursuant to which all detainees detained as at 14 January 2011 
</b></p>
<p><b>under the 2003 anti-terrorism law, security-related criminal offences in terms of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Penal Code, and article 123 of the Code of Military Justice were released. 
</b></p>
<p>37. <b>With regard to the requirements of the principle of the rule of law, it is 
imperative that the ambiguous status of the 2003 anti-terrorism law, which was 
</b></p>
<p><b>rendered de facto obsolete by the amnesty law but has not been formally repealed, be 
</b></p>
<p><b>addressed.  
</b></p>
<p>38. <b>If the Government of Tunisia proceeds with its plan to replace the 2003 anti-
terrorism law with a special legal framework for countering terrorism, the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur renews his commitment, expressed during his follow-up mission, that his 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandate stands ready to assist in the drafting process. 
</b></p>
<p>39. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that Tunisia has seized a historic 
opportunity to break with the past practice of secret detention and torture of 
</b></p>
<p><b>terrorism suspects in order to obtain a confession before the arrest of the suspect was 
</b></p>
<p><b>formally recorded. While commending the interim Government for establishing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>fact-finding commission with a mandate to investigate excesses and violations that 
</b></p>
<p><b>took place after 17 December 2010, such a mechanism can only be the first step for 
</b></p>
<p><b>fighting impunity, holding perpetrators of human rights violations of the bygone era, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including in the highest ranks, to account, and providing the victims with redress, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including compensation, rehabilitation and other forms of reparations. 
</b></p>
<p>40. <b>While welcoming the dissolution of the infamous DSS and the </b>&#8220;<b>political police</b>&#8221;,<b> 
the Special Rapporteur insists that it is imperative that the reform of the security 
</b></p>
<p><b>apparatus of Tunisia continue as speedily as possible and that further steps be taken 
</b></p>
<p><b>to ensure that officials who were implicated in human rights violations no longer hold 
</b></p>

<p><b> B. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>41. <b>In a spirit of cooperation, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government of Tunisia: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Proceed to resolve the ambiguous status of the 2003 anti-terrorism law 
</b></p>
<p><b>(Law No. 2003-75 of 10 December 2003 relating to the support of international efforts 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the fight against terrorism and the suppression of money laundering, as amended), 
</b></p>
<p><b>which had not been formally repealed at the time of the visit of the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur, but was qualified as </b>&#8220;<b>dormant</b>&#8221;<b>, yet still applied by courts in isolated 
</b></p>
<p><b>cases; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) If it decides to prepare special legislation for countering terrorism to 
</b></p>
<p><b>meet its international obligations under pertinent Security Council resolutions, as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>second step, introduce a bill to replace the 2003 anti-terrorism law with a proper legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>framework that complies fully with international human rights norms and standards, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the principle of legality enshrined in article 15 of the International Covenant 
</b></p>
<p><b>on Civil and Political Rights. Inspiration for a proper legal framework in countering 
</b></p>
<p><b>terrorism may be drawn from the report of the Special Rapporteur on 10 areas of best 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices in countering terrorism (A/HRC/16/51) and from Security Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>resolution 1566 (2004). If a special counter-terrorism law were to include not only 
</b></p>
<p><b>special substantive provisions but also special powers for law enforcement agencies, it 
</b></p>
<p><b>would imperative to provide for clear limitations to the application of such powers to 
</b></p>
<p><b>terrorism crimes as properly defined in order to prevent the risk of a spillover effect 
</b></p>
<p><b>to other forms of crimes; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Initiate amendments to legislation to the effect that persons deprived of 
</b></p>
<p><b>their liberty have access to a lawyer immediately after apprehension and enjoy a right 
</b></p>
<p><b>to have a lawyer present from the moment of the first interrogation, to ensure prompt 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to medical examination, and to implement video and audio recording of 
</b></p>
<p><b>interrogations, in order to strengthen the safeguards against torture and other forms 
</b></p>
<p><b>of ill-treatment with a view to their prevention in the future in the context of measures 
</b></p>
<p><b>taken in countering terrorism; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Create an effective system of bail; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Show full respect for the independence of the judiciary and introduce 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislative, institutional and budgetary reforms to that effect; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Clarify the exact structures, responsibilities and powers of all internal 
</b></p>
<p><b>security forces in publicly available laws;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Initiate <i>ex officio</i> investigations into allegations of torture and illegal 
</b></p>
<p><b>detentions committed in the context of the fight against terrorism under the Ben Ali 
</b></p>
<p><b>regime, and provides reparations to those who were harmed; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Establish promptly an effective national preventive mechanism in full 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance with the Paris Principles, and following broad-based consultations, 
</b></p>
<p><b>following </b>the State&#8217;s <b>accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
</b></p>
<p><b>Torture, which can also provide for a powerful deterrent against unlawful detention 
</b></p>
<p><b>and prevent torture and other forms of ill-treatment in the context of countering 
</b></p>
<p><b>terrorism; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Strengthen human rights education further at the Security Forces Staff 
</b></p>
<p><b>College as an important element of ensuring human rights-compliant counter-
</b></p>
<p><b>terrorism measures by the security forces and for rebuilding trust of the Tunisian 
</b></p>
<p><b>people in the security apparatus. A particularly effective approach is the training of 
</b></p>
<p><b>trainers, which combines a high level of peer acceptance and professional expertise. It </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/14/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p><b>is also essential to involve the leadership of the respective security agencies in such 
</b></p>
<p><b>training activities.</b>
