<p><b>Human Rights Council 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>8/PRST/1. Modalities and practices for the universal periodic review 
process 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>On 9 April 2008, the President of the Council made a statement reading as follows: 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>I. Modalities of work for troika members before the session of  
the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review 
</b></p>
<p>1. States that wish to raise questions and/or issues with the State under review may do so 
</p>
<p>via the troika, which shall relay them to the Secretariat. These questions and/or issues should 
</p>
<p>conform to the basis of the review, as identified by the Human Rights Council in paragraph 1 
</p>
<p>of the annex to its resolution 5/1 on institution-building of the Council, and shall be raised in a 
</p>
<p>manner that is consistent with the principles and objectives of the universal periodic review, 
</p>
<p>as stated in resolution 5/1, and be based mainly on the three universal periodic review 
</p>
<p>documents.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2. The Secretariat shall then transmit all questions and/or issues to the State under review 
</p>
<p>no later than 10 working days before the date of the review in the Working Group on the 
</p>
<p>Universal Periodic Review. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3. The troika members shall cluster the questions and/or issues in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>content and the structure of the report prepared by the State under review. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4. As the universal periodic review is, inter alia, a transparent process, the questions and/or 
</p>
<p>issues will be circulated among Member and Observer States after being relayed to the State 
</p>
<p>under review. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p> 
</p><p>5. The State under review is sovereign in addressing the questions and/or issues it chooses to 
</p>
<p>answer of those transmitted to it by the troika members or raised during the proceedings of the 
</p>
<p>Working Group. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>II. Modalities for the review in the Working Group 
</b> 
</p>
<p>6. The interactive dialogue of the universal periodic review exercise takes place solely in the 
</p>
<p>Working Group of the Universal Periodic Review. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7. The State under review will be given up to 60 minutes in the Working Group, to be used 
</p>
<p>for:  
</p>
<p>(a) Initial presentation of the national report / responses to written questions; 
</p>
<p>(b) Replies to the questions raised from the floor during the interactive dialogue, if 
</p>
<p>desired;  
</p>
<p>(c) Concluding comments at the end of the review, in an interactive dialogue under the 
</p>
<p>guidance of the President.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. Report of the Working Group 
</b> 
</p>
<p>8. The Working Group shall prepare a factual report of its proceedings, consisting of a 
</p>
<p>summary of the interactive dialogue, which will reflect recommendations and/or conclusions 
</p>
<p>made by delegations during the interactive dialogue.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9. The report of the Working Group shall be prepared by the troika by fully involving the 
</p>
<p>State under review and with the assistance of the Secretariat.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>10. The State under review is expected to examine all recommendations made, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the provisions of the annex to Council resolution 5/1. In all cases, the 
</p>
<p>recommendations that enjoy the support of the State under review are to be identified as such. 
</p>
<p>Other recommendations, together with the comments of the State under review, are to be 
</p>
<p>noted. Both will be included in the report of the Working Group, to be adopted by the Council 
</p>
<p>at its plenary session. The State under review is expected to follow up on the 
</p>
<p>recommendations that enjoy its support as well as on voluntary commitments and pledges.  </p>

<p> 
 
 
</p>
<p>11. The State under review will inform the Council about its views concerning the 
</p>
<p>recommendations and/or conclusions as well as voluntary commitments/pledges whenever it 
</p>
<p>is in a position to do so, during the meeting of the Working Group, or between the session of 
</p>
<p>the Working Group and the next session of the Council, or during the meeting of the Council 
</p>
<p>at its plenary session.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV. Modalities at the plenary session 
</b> 
</p>
<p>12. The review process starts at Working Group level and ends with the adoption of the 
</p>
<p>outcome of the review by the Council at its plenary session.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>13. The report of the Working Group, together with the views of the State under review 
</p>
<p>concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, as well as voluntary commitments made 
</p>
<p>by the State under review and replies presented by the State under review before the adoption 
</p>
<p>of the outcome by the Council at its plenary session to questions or issues that were not 
</p>
<p>sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group, will constitute 
</p>
<p>the outcome of the review, which shall be adopted by the Council at its plenary session 
</p>
<p>through a standardized decision.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>14. A summary of the views expressed on the outcome of the review by the State under 
</p>
<p>review and of Member and Observer States of the Council, as well as general comments made 
</p>
<p>by other relevant stakeholders before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary, will be 
</p>
<p>included in the report of the Council session.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>V. General modalities 
</b> 
</p>
<p>15. Only the three documents mentioned in paragraph 15 of the annex to Council resolution 
</p>
<p>5/1 as constituting the basis of the review will be posted on the Extranet.  
</p>
<p> </p>

<p> 
</p><p>16. The Council will consider favourably the adoption of a decision on the webcasting of all 
</p>
<p>public proceedings of its various working groups, taking into account the principles of 
</p>
<p>transparency, equal treatment and non-selectivity.
