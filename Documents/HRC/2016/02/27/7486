<p><i>Summary 
</i>The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples held its seventh session 
</p>
<p>from 7 to 11 July 2014. In addition to members of the Expert Mechanism, the participants 
in the session included representatives of States, indigenous peoples, United Nations bodies 
and specialized agencies, non-governmental organizations, national human rights 
institutions and academic institutions. 
</p>
<p>The Expert Mechanism held a half-day session to discuss the World Conference on 
Indigenous Peoples, and a panel discussion on the post-2015 development agenda, before 
moving to a discussion on the follow-up to thematic studies and advice. The Expert 
Mechanism&#8217;s follow-up study on access to justice in the promotion and protection of the 
rights of indigenous peoples, and its study on the promotion and protection of the rights of 
indigenous peoples in disaster risk reduction initiatives, were considered. Discussions on 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples were held too, which 
included a panel discussion on the role of parliaments in the implementation of the 
Declaration. 
</p>
<p>The Expert Mechanism adopted the proposals to be submitted to the Human Rights 
Council at its twenty-seventh session. In particular, it adopted the follow-up study on 
access to justice in the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples, the 
study on the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples in disaster risk 
reduction initiatives, and the final summary of responses to the questionnaire seeking the 
views of States and indigenous peoples on best practices regarding possible appropriate 
measures and implementation strategies to attain the goals of the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 6/36, the Human Rights Council established the Expert Mechanism 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as a subsidiary body to assist the Council in the 
implementation of its mandate by providing it with thematic expertise on the rights of 
indigenous peoples, as requested by the Council. In the resolution, the Council established 
that the thematic expertise would focus mainly on studies and research-based advice, and 
that the Expert Mechanism may suggest proposals to the Council for its consideration and 
approval. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Adoption of studies, reports and proposals 
</b></p>
<p>2. The Expert Mechanism adopted its follow-up study and advice on access to justice 
in the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples, its study and advice on 
the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples in disaster risk reduction 
initiatives, and the report summarizing the responses to the questionnaire seeking the views 
of States and indigenous peoples on best practices regarding possible appropriate measures 
and implementation strategies to attain the goals of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Adoption of the follow-up study and advice on access to justice in 
the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: 
</p>
<p>(a) Refers to paragraph 5 of Human Rights Council resolution 24/10, in which 
the Council requested the Expert Mechanism to continue its study on access to justice in the 
promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples, with a focus on restorative 
justice and indigenous juridical systems, particularly as they relate to achieving peace and 
reconciliation, including an examination of access to justice related to indigenous women, 
children and youth and persons with disabilities, and to present it to the Human Rights 
Council at its twenty-seventh session; 
</p>
<p>(b) Adopts the study and advice on access to justice in the promotion and 
protection of the rights of indigenous peoples: restorative justice, indigenous juridical 
systems, and access to justice for indigenous women, children and youth and persons with 
disabilities (A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/3/Rev.1);  and 
</p>
<p>(c) Authorizes Expert Member Danfred Titus, in consultation with the other 
members of the Expert Mechanism, to make the necessary revisions to the study in the light 
of discussions carried out at its seventh<b> </b>session<b> </b>and to submit the final study to the Human 
Rights Council at its twenty-seventh session. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Adoption of the study and advice on the promotion and protection 
of the rights of indigenous peoples in disaster risk reduction,  
prevention and preparedness initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: 
</p>
<p>(a) Refers to paragraph 6 of Human Rights Council resolution 24/10, in which 
the Council requested the Expert Mechanism to prepare a study on the promotion and 
protection of the rights of indigenous peoples in natural disaster risk reduction and </p>


<p>prevention and preparedness initiatives, and to present it to the Human Rights Council at its 
twenty-seventh session; 
</p>
<p>(b) Adopts the study and advice on the promotion and protection of the rights of 
indigenous peoples in disaster risk reduction, prevention and preparedness initiatives 
(A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) Authorizes the Chair-Rapporteur, in consultation with the other members of 
the Expert Mechanism, to make the necessary revisions to the study in the light of 
discussions carried out at its seventh<b> </b>session<b> </b>and to submit the final study to the Human 
Rights Council at its twenty-seventh session. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Adoption of the report summarizing the responses to the questionnaire 
seeking the views of States and indigenous peoples on best practices 
regarding possible appropriate measures and implementation strategies 
to attain the goals of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: 
</p>
<p>(a) Refers to paragraph 7 of Human Rights Council resolution 24/10, in which 
the Council requested the Expert Mechanism to continue to undertake, with the assistance 
of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the 
questionnaire survey seeking the views of States and of indigenous peoples on best 
practices in implementing the Declaration; 
</p>
<p>(b) Adopts the updated report that summarizes the responses to the questionnaire 
seeking the views of States and of indigenous peoples on best practices regarding possible 
appropriate measures and implementation strategies to attain the goals of the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/4); 
</p>
<p>(c) Authorizes the Chair-Rapporteur, in consultation with the other members of 
the Expert Mechanism, to make the necessary revisions to the report in the light of 
discussions carried out at its seventh<b> </b>session<b> </b>and to submit the report to the Human Rights 
Council at its twenty-seventh session. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Proposals 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Proposal 1: Study on the right to cultural heritage, including sports  
and traditional games 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: 
</p>
<p>(a) Proposes to the Human Rights Council that it authorize the Expert 
Mechanism to undertake a study on the promotion and protection of the right of indigenous 
peoples to their cultural heritage, including sports and traditional games. 
</p>
<p><b>  Proposal 2: World Conference on Indigenous Peoples  
</b></p>
<p>7. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: 
</p>
<p>(a) Proposes to the Human Rights Council that it organize a panel on the 
outcome of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples and its implications for the 
implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; and  </p>


<p>(b) Also proposes to the Human Rights Council that it urge the inclusion of the 
Expert Mechanism, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the Special Rapporteur 
on the rights of indigenous peoples in the follow-up related to the World Conference. 
</p>
<p><b>  Proposal 3: Business and human rights  
</b></p>
<p>8. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: 
</p>
<p>(a) Proposes to the Human Rights Council that it take measures to ensure that the 
Expert Mechanism is included in the Council&#8217;s ongoing initiatives relating to business and 
human rights; 
</p>
<p>(b) Also proposes that the Human Rights Council request the Expert Mechanism 
to convene a technical expert seminar, in collaboration with the Working Group on the 
issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, and 
with the participation of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples and the 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, to elaborate guidance on the issue of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; access to justice and remedy in the context of business operations affecting their 
human rights. The technical expert seminar could be based on relevant reports by the 
Expert Mechanism and the above-mentioned Working Group and Special Rapporteur, and 
on other relevant documentation. The report of the expert seminar would be submitted to 
the next session of the Expert Mechanism and the Forum on Business and Human Rights 
and thus be transmitted to the Human Rights Council, so that it is taken into account in all 
of the Council&#8217;s processes relating to human rights and business, including the work of the 
open-ended intergovernmental working group on a legally binding international treaty on 
human rights, transnational corporations and other business enterprises.  
</p>
<p><b>  Proposal 4: Implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights  
of Indigenous Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: 
</p>
<p>(a) Proposes that the Human Rights Council urge States and indigenous peoples 
to report on the measures taken to implement the rights enshrined in the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, through the continuation of the Expert 
Mechanism&#8217;s questionnaire survey. The Expert Mechanism will revise the questionnaire on 
the basis of its experiences and the lessons learned from implementing it over the past 
three years; 
</p>
<p>(b) Also proposes that the Human Rights Council call upon States to establish, 
with the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples, independent mechanisms to 
oversee and promote the implementation of the rights contained in the Declaration, and to 
ensure that those mechanisms are mandated to oversee the implementation of 
recommendations made by the human rights treaty bodies, the Human Rights Council&#8217;s 
special procedures, the universal periodic review and other mechanisms relating to the 
rights of indigenous peoples. Such mechanisms should cooperate closely with regional and 
national human rights institutions;  
</p>
<p>(c) The Expert Mechanism reiterates its proposal whereby it: 
Recognizes that the United Nations consultative arrangements for non-State entities 
can prevent indigenous peoples&#8217; governance bodies and institutions, including 
traditional indigenous Governments, indigenous parliaments, assemblies and 
councils, from participating in decision-making processes at the United Nations, as 
they are not always organized as non-governmental organizations; [and] proposes 
that the Human Rights Council encourage the General Assembly to adopt, as a 
matter of urgency, appropriate permanent measures to ensure that indigenous </p>


<p>peoples&#8217; governance bodies and institutions, including traditional indigenous 
Governments, indigenous parliaments, assemblies and councils, are able to 
participate at the United Nations as observers with, at a minimum, the same 
participatory rights as non-governmental organizations in consultative status with 
the Economic and Social Council (see A/HRC/18/43, proposal 3). 
(d) The Expert Mechanism reiterates its proposal that the Human Rights Council 
</p>
<p>review the language and terminology used in United Nations documents pertaining to the 
rights of indigenous peoples with a view to ensuring that they reflect the terminology 
contained in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It calls 
upon the United Nations and other international organizations to review their spelling rules 
with a view to using capital letters in spelling the term &#8220;Indigenous Peoples&#8221; (see 
A/HRC/24/49, proposal 3). 
</p>
<p><b>  Proposal 5: Post-2015 development agenda 
</b></p>
<p>10. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: 
</p>
<p>(a) Proposes that the Human Rights Council urge States to address the concerns 
of indigenous peoples in the post-2015 development agenda and to take measures to ensure 
the participation of indigenous peoples, and in particular indigenous youth, in national 
processes for the implementation of the new development goals.  
</p>
<p><b>  Proposal 6: Indigenous human rights defenders  
</b></p>
<p>11. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: 
</p>
<p>(a) Proposes that the Human Rights Council pay particular attention to 
indigenous human rights defenders in its work on this theme, drawing in particular on the 
work of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders and on Council 
resolution 25/18. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Organization of the session 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Attendance 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples held its seventh session

</p><p>13. The participants in the seventh session of the Expert Mechanism included 
representatives of Member States, indigenous peoples, United Nations organizations and 
programmes, national human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations and 
academic institutions (see annex I).  
14. Also participating in the session were Victoria Tauli Corpuz, the Special Rapporteur 
on the rights of indigenous peoples; Dalee Sambo Dorough, the Chair of the Permanent 
Forum on Indigenous Issues; and Shankar Limbu, a member of the Board of Trustees of the 
United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>15. The session included panel discussions featuring representatives of OHCHR, the 
Indigenous Peoples of Africa Coordinating Committee and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. 
Crispin Gregoire, Special Adviser to the President of the General Assembly for the World 
Conference on Indigenous Peoples, and Les Malezer, Indigenous Adviser to the President </p>


<p>of the General Assembly, also participated, from New York via videoconference, during the 
agenda item on the World Conference.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Documentation  
</b></p>
<p>16. The Expert Mechanism had before it the provisional agenda for the seventh session 
(A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/1), the annotated agenda (A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/1/Add.1) as 
prepared by OHCHR, the follow-up study on access to justice in the promotion and 
protection of the rights of indigenous peoples (A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/3/Rev.1), the study on 
the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples in disaster risk reduction 
initiatives (A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/2), and the report summarizing the responses to the 
questionnaire seeking the views of States and of indigenous peoples on the implementation 
of the Declaration (A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/4). 
</p><p>17. The Expert Mechanism also had before it the following conference room papers: 
&#8220;Compilation of conclusions and recommendations from the United Nations seminars on 
treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements&#8221; (A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/CRP.1), 
&#8220;Article 31 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the 
World Indigenous Nations (WIN) Games&#8221; (A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/CRP.2), and 
&#8220;Compilation of references to indigenous women and girls in reports and advice of the 
Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (1st to 6th sessions)&#8221; 
(A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/CRP.3). 
</p>
<p><b> C. Opening of the session 
</b></p>
<p>18. International Chief Wilton Littlechild, Chair of the Expert Mechanism, opened the 
seventh session of the Expert Mechanism. He introduced the Deputy High Commissioner 
for Human Rights, Flavia Pansieri, and the President of the Human Rights Council, 
Baudelaire Ndong Ella, who made opening remarks. 
</p>
<p>19. The Deputy High Commissioner drew attention to the importance of the Expert 
Mechanism&#8217;s thematic studies on access to justice and disaster risk reduction. She 
emphasized that the implementation of the Declaration was an ongoing challenge, and that 
even though its standards were often overlooked, there were many positive practices at the 
national level that should be replicated. She also described some highlights of OHCHR&#8217;s 
work to promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples, including initiatives in 
Cambodia and Guatemala to facilitate access to justice for indigenous peoples. 
</p><p>20. The Deputy High Commissioner underlined the importance of an inclusive World 
Conference on Indigenous Peoples, with strong engagement by indigenous peoples, and 
expressed her hope that the World Conference would lead to concrete measures to improve 
the implementation of the Declaration, for example via more action plans and strategies for 
national-level implementation.  
</p>
<p>21. In his opening statement, the President of the Human Rights Council recognized the 
work of the Expert Mechanism and noted that its studies and advice had been well received 
by the Council and had positively contributed to the efforts to further the protection of the 
rights of indigenous peoples. He expressed his gratitude to the Expert Mechanism for the 
two studies being presented at the seventh session. He noted that the Council attached high 
importance to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. He 
emphasized that the Council had continuously called for the full and effective participation 
of indigenous peoples during the preparatory process of the World Conference, and for the 
studies and advice of the Expert Mechanism to be considered in that preparatory process.  </p>


<p><b> D. Election of officers 
</b></p>
<p>22. International Chief Littlechild invited the members of the Expert Mechanism to 
nominate a Chair-Rapporteur and a Vice-Chair for its seventh session. Mr. Tsykarev 
nominated Mr. Deterville as Chair-Rapporteur. Mr. Mansayagan nominated Mr. Tsykarev 
as Vice-Chair. Both were then appointed by acclamation. 
</p>
<p>23. The Chair-Rapporteur, Mr. Deterville, thanked the other members of the Expert 
Mechanism for his election. The Chair-Rapporteur welcomed the new member of the 
Expert Mechanism, Mr. Mansayagan. 
</p>
<p>24. The Chair-Rapporteur highlighted the work of the Expert Mechanism since the last 
session. That had included the follow-up study on access to justice in the promotion and 
protection of the rights of indigenous peoples. The study was informed by an expert 
seminar co-organized by the Faculty of Law of the University of Auckland and OHCHR. 
The Chair-Rapporteur discussed the Mechanism&#8217;s work in completing the study on the 
promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples in disaster risk reduction, 
prevention and preparedness initiatives, and its work on the questionnaire to States and 
indigenous peoples on best practices regarding possible appropriate measures and 
implementation strategies to attain the goals of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>25. The Chair-Rapporteur then outlined the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s activities relating to 
the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, which included participation in a panel 
discussion, at the twenty-fourth session of the Human Rights Council; in the World 
Conference on Indigenous Women, in Peru; in the International Parliamentary Conference 
on Parliaments and the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, in April 2014; in the thirteenth 
session of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, in May 2014; and in the informal 
consultation and interactive dialogues convened by the President of the General Assembly, 
which were held on 4 June and 17&#8211;18 June 2014 respectively. 
</p>
<p>26. In her statement during the opening session, the Special Rapporteur on the rights of 
indigenous peoples expressed her gratitude to the Human Rights Council and OHCHR for 
their support for coordination between the United Nations mandates relating to indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights. She provided a brief overview of her mandate and stressed the importance 
of the topics of the studies undertaken by the Expert Mechanism. With regard to access to 
justice, she emphasized that indigenous peoples often did not actually enjoy the rights 
embedded in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. She 
noted that this was particularly the case with women, children and persons with disabilities, 
who were often the victims of discrimination and violence. She also noted that since 
indigenous peoples often lived in fragile ecosystems, they were at particular risk of being 
affected by disasters. The Special Rapporteur stressed that this was a particularly important 
year for indigenous peoples, because of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p><b>E. Adoption of the agenda 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Expert Mechanism adopted the agenda and the programme of work of the 
seventh session (A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/1 and A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/1/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Panel discussion on the post-2015 development agenda 
</b>28. The panel discussion on the post-2015 development agenda began with an 
introductory statement from the Chair-Rapporteur, who stressed that the post-2015 
development agenda constituted the international community&#8217;s road map for development </p>


<p>in the years to come. Therefore, it was crucial that indigenous peoples&#8217; rights be taken into 
consideration. The agenda must firmly reflect the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples, particularly the rights to self-determination, to freely pursue their 
economic, social and cultural development, to determine and develop priorities and 
strategies for exercising the right to development and to participate in decision-making. The 
Chair-Rapporteur further emphasized the importance of indigenous peoples&#8217; involvement in 
national action plans, policies and programmes resulting from this international 
commitment.  
</p>
<p>29. This was followed by a presentation by a staff member of OHCHR&#8217;s Millennium 
Development Goals section, who provided an overview of the post-2015 process to date, 
including the importance of integrating human rights dimensions. She identified five 
critical human rights elements to be included in the development agenda, as follows: 
(a) freedom from want (aligning socioeconomic goals with economic, social and cultural 
rights); (b) freedom from fear (including civil and political rights, such as political 
participation, access to justice, and personal security); (c) leaving no one behind, through 
the application of equality and non-discrimination; (d) ensuring international policy 
coherence (through strong global partnerships and international reforms based on the right 
to development); and (e) effective accountability through a strong framework.  
</p><p>30. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples then made a statement 
which focused on the need to fully integrate indigenous peoples&#8217; perspectives, through their 
full and effective participation in all related processes, including the open-ended working 
group. She noted that indigenous representatives were asserting the need for a fourth pillar 
in development, namely culture, to be added to the existing three pillars of economic, social 
and environmental development. Indigenous peoples were advancing the need for 
indicators of well-being and sustainability to be used as measures of development, rather 
than relying on economic indicators. Furthermore, indigenous peoples were calling for the 
use of the terminology &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221; rather than &#8220;indigenous and local 
communities&#8221; throughout the new sustainable development goals. Whereas in an earlier 
draft, goal 16 of the draft sustainable development goals had included a reference to 
indigenous peoples, and had also included the term &#8220;free&#8221; in the phrase &#8220;free, prior and 
informed consent&#8221;, the term &#8220;free&#8221; had been removed in the present version of the zero 
draft. Both of those references should be reinserted. Furthermore, indigenous peoples&#8217; 
concerns should be integrated throughout the goals. Ms. Tauli Corpuz urged States and the 
Expert Mechanism to work towards ensuring that these concerns relating to the lack of 
recognition of indigenous peoples and their rights were addressed.  
</p>
<p>31. Joseph Itongwa, of the Indigenous Peoples of Africa Coordinating Committee and 
the Integration Programme for the Development of the Pygmy Peoples in Kivu, presented a 
regional and national perspective on indigenous peoples&#8217; involvement in the post-2015 
development agenda based on his experiences in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He 
outlined the challenges facing indigenous peoples in Africa in terms of development, 
including denial of their recognition as indigenous peoples, and marginalization of their 
participation in political life and in their access to health and education services. He 
indicated that the involvement of indigenous peoples was necessary in the development of 
national plans for the implementation of international development goals, and highlighted 
the importance of dialogue between States and indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>32. Mr. Tsykarev referred to the World Conference on Youth, which had been held in 
Colombo in May 2014 with the specific theme of mainstreaming youth in the post-2015 
development agenda. The Colombo Declaration had been presented to the United Nations 
General Assembly for consideration, and Mr. Tsykarev noted that it encouraged States to 
allocate budgetary support to the creation of more and decent job opportunities for 
indigenous youth, and to develop programmes and policies aimed at eradicating violence </p>


<p>against the most marginalized groups of young people. He noted that a majority of the 
world&#8217;s youth lived in rural settings in developing countries, with a lack of access to 
productive resources, and relied on their own labour to earn a living. Thus, it was vital to 
ensure that indigenous youth received support to participate in decision-making related to 
efforts aimed at the creation of decent rural employment, and at sustainable agricultural 
livelihoods and food production. 
</p>
<p>33. International Chief Littlechild noted the need to ensure that the post-2015 
development agenda outcome document used the term &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221; consistently 
with the Declaration. He referred delegations to the substantial research that had already 
been completed on the term &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221;, which served to protect the recognition 
of indigenous peoples. That research included a legal opinion produced for the Permanent 
Forum on Indigenous Issues. He highlighted the need to make the linkages between 
business and human rights in the context of the post-2015 development agenda, and to 
ensure the continued participation of indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p><b> V. World Conference on Indigenous Peoples 
</b>34. Mr. Tsykarev introduced the agenda item on the World Conference on Indigenous 
Peoples, noting the importance of that meeting for advancing the human rights of 
indigenous peoples. He noted the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s commitment to working towards a 
successful World Conference, as one of the United Nations bodies specifically identified in 
General Assembly resolution 66/296, as well as its continued calls for the full, equal and 
effective participation of indigenous peoples at all stages of the World Conference, 
including its preparatory meetings. He invited participants to refer to the Expert 
Mechanism&#8217;s studies and advice to inform the development of the outcome document.  
</p>
<p>35. Mr. Gregoire, Special Adviser to the President of the General Assembly for the 
World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, and Mr. Malezer, Indigenous Advisor to the 
President of the General Assembly, joined the session from New York via videoconference 
on 7 July 2014. Mr. Gregoire indicated that the zero draft would be available soon for 
discussion and would form the basis for discussions at the informal interactive consultation 
being held on 16 July 2014. Mr. Malezer indicated that he and Mirna Cunningham, the 
other Indigenous Advisor to the President of the General Assembly, had been fully 
involved in the process to date.  
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples indicated that it would 
be important for the four themes outlined in the Alta outcome document to be reflected in 
the zero outcome document. The Chair of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, 
Ms. Sambo Dorough, agreed, and indicated that it was positive to see the equity of advisors, 
namely two indigenous advisors and two State advisors, as well as reliance on the Alta 
outcome document. Hjalmar Dahl, co-Chair of the Global Coordinating Group, emphasized 
that the final outcome document should be concise and action-oriented, with concrete 
recommendations, time frames and follow-up mechanisms, and should reflect the priorities 
of all indigenous regions.  
</p>
<p>37. International Chief Littlechild stated that from a preliminary review of the outcome 
document, he was pleased to note that several elements of the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s work 
were reflected in the zero draft, specifically in relation to access to justice and to the 
interventions made by the Expert Mechanism at the informal interactive hearing held in 
June 2014 in New York. Furthermore, he was encouraged by the adherence to Human 
Rights Council resolution 24/10, paragraph 8 (b), wherein the Human Rights Council 
recommends that the studies and advice of the Expert Mechanism be considered in the 
preparatory process to the World Conference. He noted that the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s </p>


<p>interventions, studies and advice appeared throughout the zero draft, for example those on 
access to justice. 
</p><p>38. International Chief Littlechild also raised some concerns. Firstly, reference to the 
role of parliamentarians was excluded. Secondly, he pointed out that, in the zero draft, only 
11 out of 39 paragraphs articulated specific actions; the commitment to action needed to be 
strengthened in order to advance the rights of indigenous peoples in accordance with the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Furthermore, specific 
mention should be made of treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements. In 
relation to paragraph 31 of the zero draft, reference should be made to physical health 
where mental health is currently mentioned, so that it would read &#8220;health, including 
physical and mental health&#8221;, in order to promote the rights of indigenous peoples to sport 
and traditional games, in accordance with article 31 of the United Nations Declaration on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>39. On the positive side, he noted that the zero draft referenced the action of appointing 
a high-level indigenous representative, such as an Assistant Secretary-General or an Under-
Secretary-General; the creation of a Third International Decade of the World&#8217;s Indigenous 
Peoples; and the call for a system-wide action plan.  
</p>
<p>40. International Chief Littlechild drew attention to the cover letter from the President of 
the General Assembly, dated 8 July 2014, in which it was stated that &#8220;consultations will 
enter an intergovernmental process and continue among Member States as required&#8221; 
following the consultation being held on 18 August 2014. This ran counter to the provisions 
of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and to the Expert 
Mechanism&#8217;s studies and advice, on the right of indigenous peoples to participate in 
decision-making.  
</p>
<p>41. He stated that the principle emphasized at the two informal interactive hearings was 
that the outcome document should build on the strengths of the Declaration, and of other 
international norms and standards, including International Labour Organization (ILO) 
Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent 
Countries.  
</p>
<p>42. Several State and indigenous representatives provided key recommendations relating 
to the outcome document, including the recommendation that it should be shorter and more 
action-oriented (for example, calling for the adoption of national laws, policies and 
procedures and constitutional reforms, along with adequate budget allocations at the 
national level) and concise. It should be the result of the full, equal and effective 
participation of indigenous peoples. Participants noted that it should be based on the Alta 
outcome document (or, at a minimum, the Alta outcome document should be included as an 
appendix), and on a consensus between States and indigenous peoples. Participants 
indicated that it should refer to the work of the Secretary-General in the study on ways and 
means of promoting the participation of indigenous peoples&#8217; representatives within the 
United Nations system (A/HRC/21/24). Other participants mentioned that one positive 
action to include in the outcome document would be the appointment of a high-level 
indigenous representative, to be established within the United Nations system. Many 
participants emphasized that the outcome document must advance the implementation of 
the Declaration.  
</p>
<p>43. States and indigenous peoples suggested additional themes for the round-table 
discussions. There was, for example, a suggestion for the inclusion of economic 
development and the promotion of indigenous cultures and businesses. Other suggestions 
included referencing treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements, and taking a 
comprehensive approach to all forms of violence against indigenous women and girls. </p>


<p>Mr. Gregoire indicated that the topics for the round-table discussions had not yet been 
finalized. 
</p>
<p>44. The Expert Mechanism returned to agenda item 3 upon the release of the zero draft. 
While the availability of the zero draft was commended, many of the observers taking the 
floor emphasized that they had only had a limited time to examine the document and, as 
such, could only provide preliminary observations.  
</p>
<p>45. Indigenous observers referred in a positive way to certain elements of the zero draft 
but also issued numerous calls for its further strengthening. In that respect, the importance 
of the forthcoming consultations was emphasized. 
</p>
<p>46. Many participants referred to the Alta outcome document, stressing the importance 
of annexing it to the outcome document. Concerns were raised about the lack of inclusion 
of some proposals contained in the Alta outcome document in the zero draft. The examples 
given included the lack of explicit language on the proposed supervisory mechanism of the 
Declaration, although there was an important reference to the request by the General 
Assembly to seek guidance from the Human Rights Council to improve implementation of 
the Declaration. The proposals for a new high-level representative to be appointed by the 
Secretary-General also prompted interest, and the importance of a reference to treaty bodies 
was highlighted.  
</p>
<p>47. Indigenous observers stated that some provisions of the zero draft were already 
covered by relevant articles of the Declaration. They also expressed their concern over the 
fact that, after 18 August 2014, the process may be transferred into an intergovernmental 
context, which could potentially exclude indigenous peoples. They emphasized that the full 
participation of indigenous peoples should be continued at all stages. They supported the 
proclamation of the Third International Decade of the World&#8217;s Indigenous Peoples, with its 
goal of international cooperation for the implementation of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>48. Indigenous participants identified the importance of using the outcome document to 
advance indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. At a parallel level, it was noted that such an 
advancement must be reflected in the post-2015 development agenda.  
</p>
<p>49. The Global Indigenous Youth Caucus called for stronger language in terms of the 
commitments by States, in order to reflect stronger commitment to following through on 
the outcome document, with the aim of further implementing the Declaration and the rights 
of indigenous peoples contained therein.  
</p>
<p>50. In sum, there was a clear consensus for ensuring that the World Conference and its 
outcome document provided a firm commitment to the standards of the Declaration, 
without any backsliding in respect of the standards that it contains. Observers also stressed 
that the outcome document should be endorsed by consensus. 
</p>
<p>51. Mr. Gregoire joined the session once again via videoconference after the zero draft 
of the outcome document had been released and the participants and experts had had an 
opportunity to discuss it. Mr. Tsykarev provided a summary of those discussions to 
Mr. Gregoire, who identified the importance of conveying perspectives on the zero draft at 
the upcoming consultations on 16 July and 18 August 2014. Mr. Tsykarev thanked 
Mr. Gregoire and the advisors to the President of the General Assembly for their hard work 
and commitment to ensure that the World Conference results in an outcome document that 
makes a concrete contribution to the implementation of the Declaration.  </p>


<p><b> VI. Follow-up to thematic studies and advice 
</b></p>
<p>52. Mr. Mansayagan introduced the agenda item on follow-up to thematic studies and 
advice by recalling the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s mandate and listing the studies and advice 
previously issued by the Expert Mechanism. He added that the studies and advice were 
meant to provide a better understanding of the provisions of the Declaration and to propose 
concrete actions that States, indigenous peoples, civil society, international organizations, 
national human rights institutions and others could take in order to further its 
implementation. He noted that the studies of the Expert Mechanism placed special 
emphasis on the participation of indigenous peoples themselves in decisions affecting them. 
He also highlighted the role that the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s studies and advice could play in 
the preparation of the outcome document of the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples.  
</p>
<p>53. A good practice was shared with regard to implementation of the Expert 
Mechanism&#8217;s advice No. 2 on the right to participation in decision-making, in connection 
with indigenous youth, through the development of the Empowered Communities initiative 
in Australia. That programme aimed to strengthen local indigenous leadership and 
governance and to ensure that indigenous peoples had a greater say in how government 
services were delivered in their regions.  
</p>
<p>54. Some statements from indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations, referring to the Expert 
Mechanism&#8217;s studies on languages and culture and on education, drew attention to the fact 
that in certain countries, indigenous peoples were still denied the right to obtain education 
in their native language. Statements also lamented the fact that the right to participate in 
decision-making, particularly with regard to lands, education and language, remained 
unfulfilled in many cases.  
</p>
<p>55. International Chief Littlechild provided updates relating to previous Expert 
Mechanism studies. First, in connection with the study on the right to education and the 
study on the role of languages and culture, he noted that work was continuing on First 
Nations control of First Nations education in Canada. Furthermore, he reviewed a 
groundbreaking, unanimous decision by the Supreme Court of Canada declaring the 
existence of aboriginal title for the Tsilhqot&#8217;in people in <i>Tsilhqot&#8217;in Nation </i>v. <i>British 
Columbia</i>, 2014 SCC 44, which relates to the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s follow-up study on the 
right to participate in decision-making, with a focus on extractive industries 
(A/HRC/21/55). It declared the existence of aboriginal title for the Tsilhqot&#8217;in people and 
indicated the need to include indigenous peoples&#8217; views on the granting of licences.  
</p>
<p>56. Referring to the study on the role of languages and culture, Mr. Tsykarev discussed 
some of the challenges that indigenous peoples faced in ensuring that their languages were 
transmitted across generations, such as efforts at assimilation and linguistic integration. He 
stressed that indigenous peoples&#8217; right to autonomy in education included the right to set 
their own priorities in education and to participate effectively in the development, 
implementation and evaluation of plans, programmes and services in education, as well as 
the right to establish and control their own educational systems and institutions. In that 
regard, he pointed out that reductions of hours for teaching indigenous languages in order to 
increase the teaching of the mainstream language could not be made without consultation 
with indigenous peoples. </p>


<p><b> VII. Study and advice on access to justice in the promotion and 
protection of the rights of indigenous peoples: restorative 
justice, indigenous juridical systems, and access to justice 
for indigenous women, children and youth and persons 
with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>57. Mr. Titus introduced the follow-up study on access to justice with a focus on 
restorative justice, indigenous juridical systems and access to justice for indigenous women, 
children and youth and persons with disabilities. Before providing an overview of the 
study&#8217;s contents, he expressed the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s gratitude to the University of 
Auckland and OHCHR for jointly organizing the expert seminar on the topic of the study, 
which took place in Auckland, New Zealand, on 17 and 18 February 2014, as well as to the 
experts who participated in the seminar, for their invaluable contributions. He also thanked 
the States, the indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations and the national human rights institutions 
that had contributed to the study through written submissions. 
</p>
<p>58. International Chief Littlechild emphasized the need to refer to the Expert 
Mechanism&#8217;s advice on access to justice in the lead-up to the World Conference and the 
finalization of its outcome document. 
</p>
<p>59. Mr. Tsykarev referred to the positive practice of there being indigenous rights 
ombudsmen, as was the case in the Russian Federation, and as mentioned in the report of 
the sixth session of the Expert Mechanism and the report of the Permanent Forum on 
Indigenous Issues on its thirteenth session. However, he urged all actors to ensure that this 
&#8220;good practice&#8221; was fully and widely implemented before presenting it at the international 
level. Mr. Tsykarev called on all stakeholders to ensure that there was no regress in the 
implementation of positive practices, and that all measures had a systemic character, rather 
than a one-off nature. He also highlighted the important role that human rights defenders 
played in supporting indigenous peoples&#8217; access to justice, stressing that it was 
unacceptable to intimidate and illegally detain human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>60. State delegations and indigenous peoples&#8217; representatives gave generally positive 
statements regarding the follow-up report on access to justice, noting in particular its 
emphasis on indigenous women, children and youth and persons with disabilities, and on 
the right of indigenous peoples to exercise their traditional justice systems. Participants also 
commended the Expert Mechanism for emphasizing the fact that a holistic approach to 
access to justice was necessary. The New Zealand Human Rights Commission, for 
example, illustrated how, in New Zealand, the interlinked issues of crime, vulnerable 
families and victims of crime were being addressed in partnership with indigenous 
community leaders. In several regions of the country, a Community Justice Panel, made up 
of Maori leaders and elders, meets with offenders to agree on a way to repair harms caused 
and to deal with factors that led to the offending. In addition, participants agreed with the 
study&#8217;s emphasis on the fact that indigenous juridical systems needed to be properly 
resourced and funded if they were to be effective and sustainable in facilitating indigenous 
peoples&#8217; access to justice. 
</p><p>61. Interventions from the floor brought up certain barriers to accessing justice that had 
either been omitted from the study or had not been addressed sufficiently. These included 
environmental justice and access to justice over issues relating to land and natural 
resources, situations in which indigenous peoples were not recognized as such, the link 
between self-determination and access to justice, and discrimination in accessing justice 
based on sexual orientation and gender identity. </p>


<p>62. Several participants referred to the link between education, including human rights 
education, and access to justice. In that regard, the technical secretariat of the United 
Nations Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Partnership highlighted an initiative that it supported in the 
Republic of the Congo, whereby the 2011 Law on the Promotion and Protection of the 
Rights of Indigenous Populations was being translated into indigenous languages and its 
contents were being disseminated via television and radio. 
</p>
<p>63. Several participants discussed the challenges that language and cultural barriers 
posed to indigenous peoples when accessing justice, particularly the non-recognition of 
their languages. In that regard, Mr. Tsykarev pointed out that legal proceedings often 
ignored the language and culture of indigenous peoples, and that it was crucial to build the 
capacity of judges, lawyers and prosecutors in such a way as to provide them with a better 
understanding of the traditions and rights of indigenous peoples. Making reference to some 
cases, he stressed the need to respect the identity and linguistic rights of indigenous 
individuals in the criminal justice system, regardless of whether a defendant was guilty or 
not. Several States, including Mexico and Guatemala, described programmes run in their 
countries for facilitating interpretation and translation into indigenous languages in legal 
proceedings. 
</p>
<p>64. Some participants contributed specific suggestions for strengthening the text of the 
study. One participant suggested that, in addition to calling for greater gender balance in 
indigenous and non-indigenous justice systems, the text should also call for greater 
representation of indigenous women in international legal systems, such as the human 
rights treaty bodies. The same participant also called for a distinction to be made in the 
study between &#8220;ancestral courts&#8221;, rooted in indigenous juridical concepts, and those 
modelled on colonial juridical concepts. 
</p><p>65. In closing the discussion on the study, Mr. Titus suggested that the advice should 
include a point on the role that national human rights institutions could play in contributing 
to the dissemination and promotion of the advice of the Expert Mechanism among the 
judiciary and the legal profession, so that it could be used to inform legal cases and 
opinions. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Study and advice on the promotion and protection of the 
rights of indigenous peoples in disaster risk reduction, 
prevention and preparedness initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>66. Mr. Deterville introduced the study on the promotion and protection of the rights of 
indigenous peoples in natural disaster risk reduction, prevention and preparedness 
initiatives. Before going on to provide a summary of the study, he expressed his thanks to 
all those who had contributed to it. He underlined that since an expert seminar had not been 
held on the topic of the study, the seventh session provided an opportunity to receive 
additional contributions regarding the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous 
peoples in disaster risk reduction initiatives, as well as to receive feedback from States and 
indigenous peoples on the study&#8217;s contents. 
</p>
<p>67. Several State delegations made reference to both good practices and remaining 
challenges in addressing the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples in 
the context of disaster risk reduction. For example, the United States of America mentioned 
an outreach campaign specifically for tribal governments, which was designed to raise 
awareness and build emergency management capacity and was entitled Ready Indian 
Country. Guatemala described initiatives that it had taken, such as the development of risk 
and vulnerability maps with the participation of indigenous women, as well as several 
training and awareness-raising initiatives on disaster risk reduction specifically targeted at </p>


<p>indigenous communities. Mexico stressed the importance of providing information on 
disaster risk reduction in indigenous languages, highlighting a programme whereby 120 
public information messages had been recorded and disseminated in the local indigenous 
languages of eight states with high disaster risk. The Plurinational State of Bolivia stressed 
the links between vulnerability to disasters and broader challenges such as poverty and the 
need for a more harmonious relationship with nature, referring to its <i>Ley Marco de la 
Madre Tierra</i>, which in addition to establishing a basis for sustainable development in 
harmony with nature, also created a national framework for the prevention and reduction of 
risk and vulnerability to disasters. 
</p>
<p>68. The New Zealand Human Rights Commission commented on the impact of the 2010 
Canterbury earthquakes on the Maori population. This example illustrated the impact that 
disasters could have on urban indigenous peoples living in high-risk areas. The 
Commission mentioned resources that had been developed following the earthquakes, 
including a document produced by the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency 
Management entitled &#8220;Including culturally and linguistically diverse communities: 
information for the civil defence and emergency management sector&#8221;. </p>
<p>69. Indigenous peoples&#8217; representatives called upon the Expert Mechanism to give more 
emphasis to the role played by extractive industries in exacerbating disaster risk, and drew 
attention to man-made causes of disasters. Specific suggestions were made as to how the 
study could better address the contribution of traditional knowledge to disaster risk 
reduction. The Asia Indigenous Caucus, for example, noted that indigenous peoples should 
not only be looked upon as &#8220;vulnerable people&#8221;, but rather as ecosystem experts who had a 
sound knowledge of and intimate relationship with the environment. Several examples 
mentioned by indigenous peoples illustrated how they, while inhabiting some of the most 
fragile ecosystems and locations on the planet, had developed unique strategies for coping 
with climate change and other drivers of disasters. Several interventions also emphasized 
the link between vulnerability to disasters and insecurity over land tenure and resources.  
</p>
<p>70. International Chief Littlechild intervened to make three points. First, it was 
important to link the examination of the topic of disaster risk reduction to the right of 
indigenous peoples to self-determination, as articulated in the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s 
follow-up study on the right to participate in decision-making, with a focus on extractive 
industries, specifically paragraphs 11, 12, 44 and 45, as well as Expert Mechanism advice 
No. 4, and its comment on the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Those 
documents provided guidance for States, businesses and indigenous peoples that was aimed 
at ensuring respect for the right to self-determination; for free, prior and informed consent; 
and for the full, equal and effective participation of indigenous peoples in the global post-
2015 framework for disaster risk reduction. Second, he highlighted the importance of the 
United Nations system, and of States, providing financial support for indigenous peoples&#8217; 
participation in relevant United Nations forums, particularly in relation to the post-2015 
development agenda. Third, he highlighted a good practice in Canada whereby indigenous 
peoples and governments worked in partnership to address natural disaster risk reduction 
via the country&#8217;s Emergency Management Agency. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>71. Prior to opening the discussion on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, International Chief Littlechild provided an overview of the Expert 
Mechanism&#8217;s work in that area, including a review of the final summary of responses to the 
questionnaire seeking the views of States and indigenous peoples on best practices 
regarding possible appropriate measures and implementation strategies to attain the goals of </p>


<p>the Declaration. He announced the availability of three conference room papers: 
&#8220;Compilation of conclusions and recommendations from the United Nations seminars on 
treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements&#8221; (A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/CRP.1), 
&#8220;Article 31 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the 
World Indigenous Nations (WIN) Games&#8221; (A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/CRP.2), and 
&#8220;Compilation of references to indigenous women and girls in reports and advice of the 
Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (1st to 6th sessions)&#8221; 
(A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/CRP.3). 
</p><p>72. Participants heard from Shankar Limbu on behalf of the Board of Trustees of the 
United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Peoples. Mr. Limbu announced the historic 
and highly significant change of the Fund&#8217;s name from the Voluntary Fund for Indigenous 
Populations to the Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Peoples, bringing the name into 
conformity with the Declaration. He provided an overview of the Fund&#8217;s support for 
indigenous representatives in 2013 and 2014, including support for the participation of 84 
indigenous representatives at the upcoming World Conference.  
</p>
<p>73. A panel discussion followed, on the role of parliaments in the implementation of the 
Declaration. First, International Chief Littlechild provided an overview of the Expert 
Mechanism&#8217;s activities relating to the implementation of the Declaration, including his 
presentation to the Inter-Parliamentary Conference on Parliaments and the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, held in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Plurinational State of Bolivia, where he 
had outlined concrete actions that could be taken towards implementation at the national 
level. He also emphasized the importance of consent, as opposed to consultation, in order to 
attain the standards contained in the Declaration. He noted the importance of considering 
the Santa Cruz Declaration in the World Conference&#8217;s deliberations and follow-up.  
</p>
<p>74. Akiyo Afouda, Human Rights Officer at the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), 
provided a comprehensive overview of the work of IPU and of its structure and strategies. 
He outlined the concrete activities of IPU that were aimed at promoting indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights and the Declaration, which included a joint project with the United Nations 
Development Programme on the representation of minorities and indigenous peoples in 
parliaments, the Chiapas Declaration of 2010, and, most recently, the Santa Cruz 
Declaration of April 2014. He outlined the focal areas in the Santa Cruz Declaration: the 
importance of free, prior and informed consent, and national action plans for implementing 
the Declaration. He outlined IPU&#8217;s plans to contribute to the World Conference, which 
would include sharing the findings of its survey on the representation of indigenous peoples 
in parliaments. 
</p>
<p>75. Mar&#237;a Eugenia Choque Quispe, Vice-Chair of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous 
Issues, spoke about the implementation of the Declaration and about the discussions that 
had taken place at the conference in Santa Cruz. She highlighted the discussions about good 
practices and about administrative and legislative measures designed to promote 
implementation. She stressed the need for parliamentarians to participate in the World 
Conference. She discussed the importance of non-discrimination in achieving the objectives 
of the Declaration, and called particularly for attention to be paid to the protection of 
indigenous women (including their right to participate in decision-making) and of 
indigenous youth. Ms. Choque Quispe noted the need to provide training to 
parliamentarians on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and world views, and for budgetary 
allocations for implementation measures.  
</p>
<p>76. Johnson Ole Kaunga, of the Indigenous Movement for Peace Advancement and 
Conflict Transformation (Kenya) provided a national example of implementation of the 
Declaration by parliamentarians in Kenya, where pastoralists had formed an ad hoc 
Pastoralist Parliamentary Group that facilitated progress on issues affecting indigenous 
peoples. One of the challenges was the internal system, composed of a National Assembly </p>


<p>and a Senate, which made it challenging for indigenous peoples to understand how to 
approach issues, or at what level of government. Another barrier that Mr. Ole Kaunga 
identified was parliamentarians&#8217; lack of awareness about the rights of indigenous peoples, 
which precluded them from being interested in educational efforts, given their perception 
that it was a politically sensitive issue.  
</p>
<p>77. Mr. Tsykarev commended IPU for holding a panel discussion on promoting 
international commitments and defending the rights of vulnerable groups, including 
indigenous peoples, during its 129th session, in October 2013. Specific attention had been 
paid during the panel discussion to ILO Convention No. 169 and to the Convention for the 
Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage. He called for the inclusion of 
parliamentarians in the national delegations that would be attending the World Conference 
on Indigenous Peoples. He pointed out that it was crucial not only to ensure the 
participation of indigenous peoples in parliaments, but also to create adequate conditions 
for them to work effectively to influence law-making decisions, particularly when those 
decisions concerned indigenous peoples. He also stressed the need to use indigenous 
languages in parliaments.  
</p>
<p>78. Ms. Tauli Corpuz spoke about her mandate to implement the Declaration and other 
international and regional instruments to advance the rights of indigenous peoples. She 
spoke about the obstacles to implementing the rights of indigenous peoples. These included 
recognition of indigenous peoples, particularly in Asia and Africa; the challenge of 
developing practical implementation measures in areas such as education, health, and 
cultural intellectual property; outstanding issues of reconciliation and redress for historical 
wrongs from the times of colonization up to the present; and ensuring that adequate 
monitoring was established in order to measure what had been achieved. Ms. Tauli Corpuz 
provided examples of the role of parliamentarians in implementing the Declaration in 
Indonesia and the Philippines. Participants intervened on the matter of implementation of 
the Declaration, including on the importance of implementation of the articles relating to 
free, prior and informed consent.  
</p>
<p>79. Ms. Sambo Dorough noted that there were a number of publications that were highly 
relevant to the issue of implementation of the Declaration. On the issue of free, prior and 
informed consent, she referred delegates to the Guidelines on Free, Prior and Informed 
Consent.  
</p>
<p>80. In terms of the role of parliamentarians, Ms. Sambo Dorough noted the need for 
human rights education, and referenced the statement by Erica-Irene Daes that &#8220;everyone 
needs human rights education&#8221;, noting that this was absolutely true, particularly where 
there were new developments, such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples. This was necessary in order to guide the work of treaty monitoring 
bodies and parliamentarians.  
</p>
<p>81. Several States described positive practices that they had employed to advance the 
rights of indigenous peoples through implementation of the Declaration. Indigenous 
participants highlighted several barriers and challenges that had arisen in the process of 
realizing the rights enshrined in the Declaration on the ground.  
</p>
<p><b> X. Proposals to be submitted to the Human Rights Council 
</b>82. The Chair-Rapporteur invited observers to share their recommendations regarding 
the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s proposals to the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>83. The proposals put forward included an expansion of the mandate of the Expert 
Mechanism, including, inter alia, a stronger role in monitoring the implementation of the </p>


<p>Declaration; making proposals to the Council for new standards or norms, as needed to 
protect indigenous peoples&#8217; human rights; and providing input for the universal periodic 
review process, in connection with the rights of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>84. Some participants also suggested themes for future studies by the Expert 
Mechanism. These included article 26 of the Declaration (right to lands, territories and 
resources); a continuation of the present study on disaster risk reduction, with a focus on 
climate change; indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and business; indigenous peoples and food 
sovereignty; and the role of indigenous human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>85. The Expert Mechanism also discussed the possibility of carrying out, in the future, a 
study on indigenous peoples&#8217; right to health. 
</p>
<p>86. International Chief Littlechild provided two proposals (see paras. 8 and 9). The first 
related to the organization of an expert seminar on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and business, 
and the second concerned the continuation of the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s questionnaire to 
States and indigenous peoples on good practices in implementing the Declaration. 
Mr. Tsykarev agreed with the questionnaire on the implementation of the Declaration being 
continued, and called on all stakeholders to adopt a critical approach when providing their 
responses, so that, along with the positive practices, challenges and lessons learned would 
be highlighted too. 
</p>
<p><b> XI. Adoption of reports, studies and proposals 
</b></p>
<p>87. At the end of the seventh session, the Expert Mechanism adopted its follow-up study 
and advice on access to justice in the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous 
peoples, its study and advice on the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous 
peoples in disaster risk reduction initiatives, and the report summarizing the responses to 
the questionnaire seeking the views of States and indigenous peoples on best practices 
regarding possible appropriate measures and implementation strategies to attain the goals of 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. All proposals were 
adopted by consensus by the members of the Expert Mechanism.  
</p>
<p>88. The members of the Expert Mechanism also adopted a provisional agenda for the 
eighth session of the Expert Mechanism (annex II). </p>
