<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms </i>that States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism 
complies with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, 
refugee and humanitarian law; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Deeply deplores </i>the suffering caused by terrorism to the victims and their families, 
expresses its profound solidarity with them, and stresses the importance of providing them with 
proper assistance; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Reaffirms </i>the obligation of States, in accordance with article 4 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,<b>1</b> to respect that certain rights are non-derogable in any 
circumstances, and recalls, in regard to all other Covenant rights, that any measures derogating 
from the provisions of the Covenant must be in accordance with<b> </b>that article in all cases, and 
underlines the exceptional and temporary nature of any such derogations;<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon </i>States to raise awareness of the importance of these obligations among 
national authorities involved in combating terrorism; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>5. <i>Reaffirms </i>that counter-terrorism measures should be implemented in full 
consideration of the human rights of persons belonging to minorities and must not be 
discriminatory on grounds such as race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Calls upon </i>States not to resort to discriminatory profiling based on stereotypes 
founded on grounds of discrimination prohibited by international law, and recalls therefore, to 
the extent that States use profiling while countering terrorism that they must comply strictly with 
international law, including human rights law; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Urges </i>States, while countering terrorism, to fully comply with their obligations in 
respect of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in particular 
the absolute prohibition of torture; 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p> 8.<b> </b><i>Also urges</i> States to fully<b> </b>respect non-refoulement obligations under international 
refugee and human rights law and, at the same time, to review, with full respect for these 
obligations and other legal safeguards, the validity of a refugee status decision in an individual 
case if credible and relevant evidence comes to light that indicates that the person in question has 
committed any criminal acts, including terrorist acts, falling under the exclusion clauses under 
international refugee law; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Calls upon </i>States to refrain from returning persons, including in cases related to 
terrorism, to their countries of origin or to a third State whenever such transfer would be contrary 
to their obligations under international law, in particular human rights law, international 
humanitarian law and international refugee law, including in cases where there are substantial 
grounds for believing that they would be in danger of subjection to torture, or where their life or 
freedom would be threatened in violation of international refugee law on account of their race, 
religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, bearing in 
mind obligations that States may have to prosecute individuals not returned; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Also calls upon </i>States to ensure that guidelines and practices in all border control 
operations and other pre-entry mechanisms are clear and fully respect their obligations under 
international law, particularly refugee law and human rights law, towards persons seeking 
international protection; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Urges </i>States, while countering terrorism, to ensure due process guarantees, 
consistent with all relevant provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,<b>3</b> of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and of the Geneva Conventions and their 
additional Protocols,<b>4</b> in their respective fields of applicability;

liberty, regardless of the place of arrest or of detention, benefit from the guarantees to which they 
are entitled under international law, including the review of their detention and, if subjected to 
trial, fundamental judicial guarantees; 
</p>
<p> 13.<b> </b><i>Opposes </i>any form of deprivation of liberty that amounts to placing a detained person 
outside of the protection of the law, and urges States to respect the safeguards concerning the

accordance with international law, including human rights law and international humanitarian 
law;

</p>
<p> 16.<i> Also calls upon</i> States to include adequate guarantees, including the requirement of

individuals and entities with a view to combating terrorism, and to ensure full compliance with 
their international obligations, including human rights obligations; 
</p>
