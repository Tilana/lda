<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This document contains information supplied by Governments, as well as other 
stakeholders, including National Human Rights Institutions and non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), relating to the follow-up measures to the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur 
made following country visits. In paragraph 5 (c) of its resolution 8/8 on torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of June 2008, the Human Rights Council urged 
States &#8220;To ensure appropriate follow-up to the recommendations and conclusions of the 
Special Rapporteur;&#8221; The report submitted to the fifty-ninth session of the Commission 
(E/CN.4/2003/68, para. 18), indicated that Governments of countries to which visits have been 
carried out would regularly be reminded of the observations and recommendations made by the 
Special Rapporteur after such visits. Information would be requested on the consideration given 
to the recommendations, the steps taken to implement them, and any constraints that may 
prevent their implementation. Information from NGOs and other interested parties regarding 
measures taken in follow up to his recommendations would be welcome as well. 
</p>
<p>2. Starting from the present report, the format of the follow-up report has been modified with 
the aim of rendering it more reader-friendly and of facilitating the identification of concrete steps 
taken in response to the specific recommendations and their results. For this reason, so-called 
follow-up tables have been created, which contain the recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur, a brief description of the situation when the country visit was undertaken, an 
overview of steps taken in previous years and included in previous follow-up reports and, in the 
last column, measures taken in the current year on the basis of information gathered by the 
Special Rapporteur, from governmental and non-governmental sources. 
</p>
<p>3. By letters dated 4-9 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur submitted to the respective 
Governments for their consideration and comments the information on follow-up measures he 
had gathered. Letters were sent to the following countries: China, Georgia, Jordan, Mongolia, 
Nepal, Nigeria, Paraguay and Togo. Information was received from the Governments of Georgia 
and Togo. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the information received. 
</p>
<p>4. The Government of Mongolia has not provided any follow-up information since the visit 
was carried out. 
</p>
<p>5. In the future, the Special Rapporteur intends to include in the new format all countries 
visited by mandate holders in the previous ten years. 
</p>
<p>6. Owing to restrictions, the Special Rapporteur has been obliged to reduce the details of 
responses; attention has been given to reflect information that specifically addresses the 
recommendations and which has not been previously reported. 
</p>
<p><b>China 
</b></p>
<p><b>Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in the report of his 
visit to China in November 2005 (E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.6, para. 82). 
</b>7. On 2 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of 
China requesting information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with regard to the </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/44/Add.5 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p>implementation of his recommendations. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government 
has not provided any input. He looks forward to receiving information on China&#8217;s efforts to 
follow-up to his recommendations and he reaffirms that he stands ready to assist in efforts to 
prevent and combat torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>8. Echoing the observations of the United Nations Committee against Torture 
of 21 November 2008 (see CAT/C/CHN/CO/4), the Special Rapporteur notes several positive 
regulatory changes in recent years that relate to criminalizing acts aimed at coercing confessions. 
He regrets, however, that the definition of torture and the criminalization of torture in Chinese 
law still do not satisfy the requirements of articles 1 and 4 of the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). He also reiterates his 
concerns about Re-education-through-labour (RTL) camps and urges the Government to abolish 
the doctrine of RTL. The Special Rapporteur notes with interest the Government&#8217;s on-going 
efforts to combat torture practices, including through the provision of nationwide training of the 
police and the introduction of audio and video recording devices in interrogation rooms. 
However, he also notes reports on shortcomings in the implementation of these new measures as 
well as on cases of intimidation of defence lawyers. He regrets that the state secrets system 
continues to be the primary obstacle to independent investigations of torture allegations, thereby 
also hindering the prosecution of perpetrators. Moreover, the secrecy surrounding actions taken 
with respect to torture makes it difficult to assess the results of new measures. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the amended Law on Lawyers but notes with concern 
that efforts to reform the Criminal Procedure Law were apparently put on hold at the end 
of 2007. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to resume its reform efforts as soon as 
possible, taking into account his recommendations concerning the guarantee of habeas corpus or 
equivalent means to challenge the lawfulness of detention and the full guarantee of the right to 
fair trial. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about reports of the increasing use of 
house arrests for prolonged periods of time without a possibility to challenge the deprivation of 
liberty, as well as a reported increase in the number of arrests relating to political crimes in 2008. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur further notes that no independent mechanism mandated to monitor 
all places of detention has been created. In this context, he strongly encourages the Government 
to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes efforts made by non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), national and international, to provide him with relevant reports and information, and 
encourages the Government to further strengthen its cooperation with them with regard to the 
implementation of his recommendations. </p>

<p><b>Recommendation 
</b>(E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.6)<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Situation during visit in 2005 
</b>(See E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.6)<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Steps taken in previous years 
</b>(See A/HRC/4/33/Add.<footnote name="2">7. While there are legal provisions in place covering important - but not all necessary - 
elements for the prevention, prohibition and prosecution of torture, the current legal framework 
is undermined by the lack of implementation, and thus rendered meaningless for the 
overwhelming majority of detainees. In this context, the Rapporteur would also like to reiterate 
his recommendation to the Government of Nigeria to consider the ratification of the OPCAT. 
</footnote> and 
A/HRC/7/3/Add.<footnote name="2">6. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that a bill providing for the establishment of 
an anti-torture commission has been tabled in the Senate, and calls upon the members of 
Parliament to work for its expeditious adoption and effective implementation. A truly 
independent and effective commission would be a crucial step forward in the fight against the 
prevailing climate of impunity which constitutes an environment conducive to further acts of 
torture. 
</footnote>)<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Information received on steps taken 
since December 2007/current situation 
</b></p>
<p>(a) The <b>crime of 
torture should be 
defined </b>as a matter of 
priority in accordance 
with article 1 of the 
Convention against 
Torture, with <b>penalties 
commensurate with 
the gravity</b> of torture. 
</p>
<p>No explicit definition of torture 
in domestic legislation; the 
existing legislation relevant to 
the prohibition and 
criminalization of torture did not 
satisfy the requirements of the 
Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (CAT) articles 1 and 
4; in particular, it lacked the 
following elements:  
&#8226; mental torture 
&#8226; the direct or indirect 
</p>
<p>involvement of a public 
official or another person 
acting in an official capacit 
</p>
<p>&#8226; infliction of the act for a 
specific purpose 
</p>
<p>The penalization of acts of 
torture was stipulated in articles 
247 and 248 of the Criminal Law 
(CL), however a number of other 
regulations permit exceptions 
(see infra Rec c)). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 2006: the Ministry of Justice issued 
regulations aimed at prohibiting 
torture and ill-treatment by specific 
categories of public officials, such as 
&#8220;Six prohibitions for prison guards&#8221;, 
&#8220;Six prohibitions for Re-education 
Through Labour&#8221; (RTL) etc.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; In the Regulations on Case-Filing 
Standards in Cases of Rights 
Infringement through Dereliction of 
Duty, the Supreme People&#8217;s 
Procuratorate (SPP) referred to 
specific forms of ill-treatment by 
judicial employees, which amount to 
the crime of coercing a confession, 
such as beatings, binding, prolonged 
use of cold, hunger, exposure or 
scorching to abuse detainees, 
severely injuring suspects or leading 
a suspect to commit serious self-
injury or directly or indirectly 
ordering others to use torture for the 
purpose of extracting a confession. 
Cases against civil servants and 
employees of prisons, detention 
facilities, holding cells, labour camps 
and RTL facilities can be filed for the 
crime of abusing a detainee.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b><i>: Despite 
the introduction of new categories of 
offences relating to torture by the 
Supreme People&#8217;s Procuratorate 
(SPP), the definition of torture and 
the prohibition and criminalization of 
torture in Chinese law still do not 
satisfy the requirements of CAT 
articles 1 and 4. In particular the 
definition does not include the 
infliction of severe mental pain or 
suffering, torture for other purposes 
such as discrimination and a catch-all 
phrase that would apply to all state or 
quasi-state actors. 
</i></p>
<p>&#8226; <i>The 2008 Government White Paper 
on China&#8217;s Efforts and Achievements 
in Promoting the Rule of Law does 
not acknowledge or address these 
shortcomings.</i>

</p>
<p><i>Chinese media, in most of the torture 
cases documented by human rights 
organizations, no effective 
investigations are conducted. The 
primary obstacle to the independent 
investigation of torture allegations is 
the classification of information 
related to torture and abuse in 
detention facilities under the state 
secret system, such as information on 
methods used for investigation of 
important criminal cases and the 
targets of investigations; information 
on the places and circumstances of 
custody of important detainees; 
statistics on unusual deaths in prisons 
and other detention facilities; 
statistics on the number of detainees 
sent to RTL; data on incidents of 
police officers and other state 
officials using torture, causing 
injuries or disabilities to detainees; 
information on investigations against 
state officials, etc. For example, 
information about the treatment of 
persons detained or sentenced in 
connection with the March 2008 
demonstrations in Tibet and 
information about investigations into 
the deaths resulting from these events 
are all classified. </i></p>

office in August 2008, a 50-point Common Minimum Programme (CMP) was agreed, focusing 
on constitutional supremacy, judicial independence, the rule of law, and fundamental rights. He 
welcomes that the CMP aims at ending the culture of impunity and provides for the 
establishment of several commissions, including the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and a 
Commission on Disappearances, but regrets that in practice the issue of impunity for past and 
current human rights violations has not received sufficient attention from the authorities. He 
further expresses concern regarding reports that suggest that torture allegations continue to 
frequently not be properly investigated and that perpetrators are not prosecuted or punished. 
</footnote> and 
A/HRC/7/3/Add.<footnote name="2">1. The Special Rapporteur notes that the political situation in Nepal has changed significantly 
since the visit. In this context, he welcomes that the elections of April 2008 were widely found to 
have been free and fair, but he regrets the upsurge of violence ahead of the polls.

<p>&#8226; <i>As a result, victims of torture, their 
lawyers, families or unrelated persons 
with knowledge of an act of torture 
who complain to the PSB 
Superintendent&#8217;s Office or the 
Procuratorate usually receive the 
response that no evidence of torture 
was found without an effective and 
independent investigation having 
been carried out. When they are 
initiated, investigations fail to meet 
the requirements of promptness, 
effectiveness and impartiality. 
Political imperatives often influence 
the outcome of individual cases, 
including the decision whether to 
investigate and prosecute allegations 
of torture. The police, procuratorate 
and courts are not independent and 
remain under the supervision of the 
Chinese Communist Party, including 
through &#8220;Politics and Law

<p><b>Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in the report of his 
visit to Georgia in February 2005 (E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.<footnote name="3">0. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial note le travail important de la CNDH (en coop&#233;ration avec le bureau 
du HCDH au Togo), notamment les sessions de formation avec les magistrats et officiers de 
police judiciaire au sujet de l&#8217;interdiction et la pr&#233;vention de la torture et de l&#8217;application de la 
d&#233;tention pr&#233;ventive (article 112 du Code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale), les audiences foraines, ainsi que 
les visites des prisons qui ont abouti &#224; la lib&#233;ration de centaines de d&#233;tenus. Il applaudit les 
initiatives du parquet et d&#8217;autres organes &#233;tatiques en mati&#232;re d&#8217;inspection des lieux de d&#233;tention 
et rappelle &#224; cet &#233;gard l&#8217;importance d&#8217;envisager la ratification du Protocole facultatif &#224; la 
convention contre la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants, qui

inopin&#233;es dans tous les lieux de d&#233;tention. Concernant les conditions de d&#233;tention dans les 
institutions p&#233;nitentiaires, il note la r&#233;habilitation des prisons en cours appuy&#233;e par l&#8217;Union 
europ&#233;enne et le d&#233;cret portant la cr&#233;ation d&#8217;un corps surveillant les &#233;tablissements 
p&#233;nitentiaires, r&#233;cemment adopt&#233; par le conseil des ministres. A cet &#233;gard, il souligne &#233;galement 
l&#8217;importance des mesures de substitution &#224; l&#8217;emprisonnement et salue la r&#233;vision du Code p&#233;nal 
en cours qui, selon le Gouvernement, pr&#233;voit l&#8217;introduction des peines alternatives non privatives 
de libert&#233; pour les infractions mineures et &#233;rigera la torture en infraction p&#233;nale. Dans ce 
contexte, il invite le Gouvernement &#224; acc&#233;l&#233;rer la r&#233;vision du Code de proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale et &#224; 
interdire explicitement l&#8217;utilisation des preuves obtenues sous torture dans toute proc&#233;dure

</b>12. On 2 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of 
Georgia requesting information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with regard to 
the implementation of his recommendations. The Government provided comprehensive 
information on steps taken on 28 February 2008, on 20 and 26 January 2009. The 
Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for the very detailed and thorough 
replies provided to him. He reaffirms that he continues to stand ready to assist in all efforts to 
prevent and combat torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of the Anti-torture action plan and trusts 
that, by assigning tasks to specific bodies and through improving cooperation, it will render the 
fight against torture more effective. He hopes that its implementation will constantly be reviewed 
and is looking forward to learning about the concrete results it will bring about. Similarly, he 
notes with satisfaction that efforts to establish a national preventive mechanism (NPM) in 
accordance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture are on-going. He 
encourages the Government to ensure that the NPM becomes functional as soon as possible and 
that civil society is fully included in the process of its creation and in its work. 
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur commends on-going institutional reforms, e.g. integration of the 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in the Ministry of Justice, the creation of a new Ministry of the Penitentiary 
and Probation, and the establishment of the national forensic service as a stand-alone body. He 
looks forward to receiving information on how these institutional changes translate into concrete 
improvement on the ground. 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur also welcomes recent measures taken to address overcrowding in 
places of detention. However, he regrets that reports still indicate that the overall number of 
persons deprived of their liberty continues to grow and that non-custodial punishment measures, 
such as fines and bail are not sufficiently applied. In this context, he hopes that the Criminal 
Justice Reform Inter-Agency Coordinating Council will contribute to strengthening the use of 
non-custodial measures and looks forward to hearing about progress in this regard. </p>

<p>&#8226; Reforms in the Ministry of Justice of 
Georgia and the Prosecution Service 
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 10 October 2008, amendments to the 
Constitution of Georgia authorized the 
merger of the Prosecution Service of 
Georgia with the Ministry of Justice. 
Following the corresponding changes to 
the Constitution, a new Law on the 
Prosecution Service of Georgia was 
adopted on 21 October 2008. As a result, 
the Prosecution Service now is part of 
the Ministry of Justice of Georgia. 
However, its legal status is different from 
other departments and units of the 
Ministry, in view of the scope of its 
independence. The Chief Prosecutor 
supervises the prosecutorial and 
administrative activities. The Chief 
Prosecutor is nominated by the Minister 
of Justice and appointed by the President 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Minister of Justice, unlike the then 
existing Prosecutor General, is a member 
of the Cabinet and accountable to 
Parliament. Political accountability and 
parliamentary supervision concern only 
criminal justice policy. The Prosecution 
Service as a whole maintains the 
necessary independence in its day-to-day 
work. The Law on the Prosecution </p>

<p>H.E. King Abdullah and the director of

Lt. Gen Muhammad Mahmud al-&#8216;Aitan 
issued clear instructions that there was to 
be no torture. The General Intelligence 
Directorate (GID) has issued written and 
oral instructions addressed to all 
personnel to refrain from abusing any 
detainee physically, verbally or 
emotionally, and providing for an 
increase in penalties for violations.<b>

article 1 of the

Torture, with penalties 
commensurate with the 
gravity of torture

<p>Torture was criminalized in

<p>The special court system did 
not work effectively. The 
presumption of innocence was 
illusory, primacy was placed 
on obtaining confessions, 
public officials essentially 
demonstrated no sense of

human rights violations

special courts served only to 
shield security officials from

(CCP), guaranteed every 
prisoner the right to

forward the complaint to 
the Public Prosecutor 
</p>
<p>&#8226; When allegations of 
torture against a member 
of the police were made, 
the Department of Public 
Prosecutions had to 
register it in an 
investigation report and

<p>&#8226; The PSD established a radio station 
through which all complaints are 
directly aired and appropriate

complaints boxes in various prisons

Human Rights 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Ministry of Justice created a

torture, on suspensions of suspected officials

<p>Since the 1996 Torture 
Compensation Act (TCA) 
entered into force, several

had been taken. However, 
compensation was only paid in 
one case.

<p><b>Steps taken to implement the recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>Impunity   
(b) The highest authorities, particularly those 
responsible for law enforcement activities, 
should declare <b>unambiguously</b> that the culture 
of impunity must end and that torture and ill-
treatment by public officials will not be tolerated 
and will be prosecuted. The <b>message</b> should be 
spread that torture is an extremely serious crime 
which will be punished with severe (long-term) 
prison sentences 
</p>
<p>No unequivocal condemnation of torture and its 
qualification as a most serious crime. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b><i>: Torture and other 
forms of ill-treatment are still widespread. The 
different kinds of torture methods include, inter 
alia, beatings, clubbing of the sole of the feet or 
ankles, suspension, submersion in water; rape, 
mock executions, shooting into the feet, burning 
with cigarettes or hot irons.</i> 
</p>
<p>(c) The crime of torture should be defined as a 
matter of priority in accordance with article 1 of 
the Convention against Torture, with penalties 
commensurate with the gravity of torture 
</p>
<p>There was no provision specifically 
criminalizing torture as defined in article 1 of 
the Convention against Torture. The latter has 
not been incorporated in domestic laws, which 
therefore does not provide for penalties related 
specifically to acts of torture. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b><i>: The Senate 
Committee on Judiciary indicated in October 2008 
that it intended to pursue the adoption of 
legislation specifically criminalizing torture.</i> 
</p>
<p>(d) An effective and independent complaints 
system for torture and abuse leading to criminal 
investigations should be established, similar to 
the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Perpetrators were in general not held 
accountable due to the lack of functioning 
complaint mechanisms and remedies; 
victims were found to have accepted that 
impunity was the natural order of things 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Attempts to register complaints were often 
met with intimidation, or investigations 
lacked independence as they could be 
conducted by the police themselves 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Upon request by the Government, on 5 
April 2007, the UN Special Rapporteur 
forwarded a draft law on the establishment 
of a Torture investigation commission

</p>
<p>(g) All detainees should be effectively 
guaranteed the ability to <b>challenge the 
lawfulness of the detention</b> before an 
independent court, e.g. through habeas corpus 
proceedings 
</p>
<p>De facto the vast majority of detainees did not 
have the ability to challenge the lawfulness of 
their detention, due to the lack of financial 
means, the overload of the entire judicial system 
as well as a climate of fear. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(h) <b>Judges and prosecutors</b> <b>should routinely 
ask</b> persons brought from police custody how 
they have been treated and, even in the absence 
of a formal complaint from the defendant, order 
an independent medical examination in 
accordance with the Istanbul Protocol 
</p>
<p>While in principle empowered to do so, judges 
and prosecutors did not ex-officio enquire about 
potential torture and ill-treatment in police 
custody. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(i) Those legally arrested should not be held in 
facilities under the control of their interrogators 
or investigators for more than the time required 
by law to obtain a judicial warrant of pretrial 
detention, which should <b>not exceed 48 hours</b>. 
After this period they should be transferred to a 
pretrial facility under a different authority, where 
no further unsupervised contact with the 
interrogators or investigators should be permitted 
</p>
<p>While legal provisions foresaw that persons 
arrested or detained shall be brought before a 
judge within one or two days, the majority of 
suspects was deprived of their liberty for longer 
periods without the required judicial oversight. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b><i>: Extended detention at 
police stations was the norm. Numerous people 
awaiting trial spend weeks in the police station 
after their arrest, without seeing a judge despite 
the constitutional guarantee to be brought before a 
judge within 48 hours. Police routinely detain 
suspects and witnesses prior to investigation, 
including for non-serious offences and offences for 
which suspects ought to be granted bail; this has 
led to a situation where even family members or 
witnesses can end up behind bars.</i> 
</p>
<p>(j) The maintenance of <b>custody registers</b> should 
be scrupulously ensured, including recording of 
the time and place of arrest, the identity of the 
personnel, the actual place of detention, the state 
of health upon arrival of the person at the 
detention centre, the time at which the family 
and a lawyer were contacted and visited the

<p>The Criminal Code stipulated the keeping of

proceedings despite existing legal safeguards. 
The criminal justice system relied heavily on 
confessions.

of convictions are based on confessions. Even 
in those cases in which allegations of torture 
are raised on the defendant&#8217;s behalf, and 
investigations regarding such allegations take

are declared admissible by the judiciary in 
most cases

policy in place focusing especially on the release of 
members of vulnerable groups. 
Several states have commuted sentences or 
released detainees under amnesties, however this 
is not done as a matter of routine or in any 
coordinated way across the federation. It is 
dependent on the mercy committees of individual 
states and the benevolence of the state governor

(u) Abolish all forms of <b>corporal punishment</b>, 
including sharia-based punishments 
</p>
<p>Corporal punishment, such as caning, and 
sharia-based penal code punishments in the 
northern states (i.e. amputation, flogging and 
stoning to death), were lawful in Nigeria.

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b><i>: Sharia-based 
punishments remain on the statute books.</i>

(v) Abolish the <b>death penalty</b> de jure, 
commute the sentences of prisoners on <b>death 
row to imprisonment</b>, and release those aged 
over 60 who have been on death row for 10 years 
or more 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Capital punishment was still available under 
the laws of Nigeria, but there was a policy 
not to carry out executions. However, 
persons continued to be sentenced to death, 
which led to the steady growth in numbers 
of persons languishing on death row for 
many years in inhuman conditions 
</p>
<p>&#8226; By letter dated 14 September 2007 the 
Government stated that it had, as part of the 
decongestion process, released all prisoners 
over 60 and 70 years old, as well as all 
prisoners on death row who had served for 
more than 10 years. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b><i>: No action has

acceptance. No effective mechanisms to enforce 
existing prohibitions were in place.

d&#8217;organiser des campagnes de sensibilisation, et 
faire une &#233;tude pour &#233;valuer la pr&#233;valence des 
mutilations g&#233;nitales au Togo.

<p>La pratique de la mutilation g&#233;n&#233;rale persistait et 
continuait d&#8217;&#234;tre accept&#233;e par la soci&#233;t&#233;, et les

</p>
<p>100. Le Gouvernement devrait faire en sorte que 
les personnes plac&#233;es en d&#233;tention pr&#233;ventive 
comparaissent rapidement devant un juge et 
soient inform&#233;es en tout temps de leurs droits et 
de l&#8217;&#233;tat d&#8217;avancement de leur affaire, fixer des

soient respect&#233;s en organisant p&#233;riodiquement 
des inspections ind&#233;pendantes. 
</p>
<p>Dans de nombreux cas, la dur&#233;e maximale de la 
garde &#224; vue dans les postes de police ou de 
gendarmerie (quarante-huit ou quatre-vingt-
seize heures) &#233;tait expir&#233;e et qu&#8217;elle n&#8217;avait pas 
&#233;t&#233; prolong&#233;e par le minist&#232;re public comme la 
loi l&#8217;exige. Cela signifiait que de nombreux 
d&#233;tenus passent de longues p&#233;riodes dans des 
conditions &#233;pouvantables sans aucun fondement 
juridique; 
De nombreux prisonniers en d&#233;tention avant 
jugement ont d&#233;clar&#233; qu&#8217;ils n&#8217;avaient pas &#233;t&#233; 
pr&#233;sent&#233;s &#224; un juge ou un procureur m&#234;me apr&#232;s 
plusieurs semaines ou mois de d&#233;tention. 
Beaucoup ne connaissaient pas l&#8217;&#233;tat de leur 
affaire m&#234;me s&#8217;ils &#233;taient d&#233;tenus depuis 
longtemps.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Gouvernement</b> : Des mesures ont &#233;t&#233; prises 
pour am&#233;liorer la prise en charge judicaire 
des d&#233;tenus et les conditions de d&#233;tention. 
Les procureurs de la R&#233;publique et les juges 
d&#8217;instruction font des visites p&#233;riodiques et 
inopin&#233;es dans les centres de d&#233;tention 
(commissariats, brigades de gendarmerie et 
prisons). De plus, le Programme nationale 
de modernisation de la justice pr&#233;voit que 
l&#8217;effectif des magistrats sera augment&#233; de 25 
personnes chaque ann&#233;e (concours de 
recrutement) sur les cinq prochaines ann&#233;es. 
Les magistrats en fonction suivent des 
formations continues dans le cadre du 
Programme nationale de modernisation de 
la justice.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; En outre, la r&#233;vision du Code de proc&#233;dure 
p&#233;nale est en cours (voir recommandation 
93). La r&#233;habilitation des prisons est faite

<p>permettre, entre autre, la tenue r&#233;guli&#232;re et 
en temps r&#233;el des audiences p&#233;nales.  
</p>
<p>101. Le Gouvernement devrait modifier la 
l&#233;gislation de sorte qu&#8217;aucune condamnation ne 
puisse reposer sur des preuves obtenues sous la 
torture et que les aveux ne constituent pas le 
motif principal des condamnations; il devrait 
d&#8217;ores et d&#233;j&#224; donner aux tribunaux des 
directives claires &#224; ce sujet. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Souvent les aveux constituaient le principal 
&#233;l&#233;ment de preuve.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Dans la plupart des locaux de garde &#224; vue 
des mauvais traitements &#233;taient inflig&#233;s 
quotidiennement, essentiellement pour 
arracher des aveux.  
</p>
<p><b>Gouvernement :</b> La r&#233;vision du Code de 
proc&#233;dure p&#233;nale est en cours. De plus, la 
Commission Nationale des Droits de l&#8217;Homme 
(CNDH), appuy&#233;e par le HCDH-OHCHR, 
organise des sessions de sensibilisation sur 
l&#8217;interdiction de la torture et des mauvais 
traitements et de renforcement des capacit&#233;s des 
magistrats et des officiers de police judiciaire 
(OPJ).  
</p>
<p>102. Le Gouvernement togolais devrait faire 
passer les infractions mineures du champ de la 
justice r&#233;pressive &#224; celui de la justice r&#233;paratrice, 
&#233;largir l&#8217;application des mesures de substitution 
&#224; la d&#233;tention pr&#233;ventive et des peines non 
privatives de libert&#233;, rendre obligatoire le

moins qu.il n&#8217;existe des raisons imp&#233;rieuses de 
placer le pr&#233;venu en d&#233;tention. 
</p>
<p> <b>Gouvernement :</b> La r&#233;vision du Code p&#233;nal 
pr&#233;voit l&#8217;introduction des peines alternatives non 
privatives de libert&#233; pour les infractions 
mineures.  
</p>
<p>103. Le Gouvernement togolais devrait 
poursuivre ses efforts en vue d&#8217;am&#233;liorer les 
conditions de d&#233;tention, en particulier, fournir 
des soins m&#233;dicaux, traiter les malades mentaux 
au lieu de les punir et prendre les mesures 
voulues pour les prot&#233;ger de la torture et des 
mauvais traitements, am&#233;liorer la quantit&#233; de 
nourriture et la qualit&#233;, &#233;ventuellement en cr&#233;ant 
des fermes p&#233;nitentiaires o&#249; les d&#233;tenus doivent 
cependant pouvoir &#234;tre admis sans 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>Les conditions de d&#233;tention pendant la garde &#224; 
vue dans les locaux de la police ou de la 
gendarmerie, mais aussi dans la plupart des 
&#233;tablissements p&#233;nitentiaires, constituaient un 
traitement inhumain. En particulier, le 
surpeuplement de la plupart des prisons &#233;tait 
dramatique, les conditions d&#8217;hygi&#232;ne 
d&#233;plorables, la nourriture de mauvaise qualit&#233; et 
insuffisante et l&#8217;acc&#232;s aux services m&#233;dicaux 
difficile. 
</p>
<p><b>Gouvernement </b>: La plupart des prisons

bient&#244;t construites (appui Union Europ&#233;enne) 
afin d&#8217;am&#233;liorer les conditions de d&#233;tention. Par 
ailleurs, le Gouvernement a inform&#233; le

m&#233;dicaments. Le budget de la sant&#233; p&#233;nitentiaire 
a &#233;t&#233; sensiblement revu &#224; la hausse dans la loi 
sur les finances dans l&#8217;ann&#233;e 2009.  
</p>
<p>104. Le Gouvernement devrait s&#233;parer les 
prisonniers en d&#233;tention pr&#233;ventive des 
condamn&#233;s et former et d&#233;ployer du personnel 
f&#233;minin dans les quartiers des prisons et les 
locaux de garde &#224; vue r&#233;serv&#233;s aux femmes. 
</p>
<p>Contrairement &#224; ce qu&#8217;exigent les normes 
internationales minima, il n&#8217;y avait pas de 
personnel f&#233;minin dans les prisons ni dans les 
locaux de garde &#224; vue de la police ou de la 
gendarmerie. Le Gouvernement avait indiqu&#233; 
que ce probl&#232;me &#233;tait en train d&#8217;&#234;tre r&#233;solu avec 
la cr&#233;ation d&#8217;un corps sp&#233;cial de surveillants 
relevant du Minist&#232;re de la justice, qui 
comprendrait des surveillants des deux sexes. 
</p>
<p><b>Gouvernement :</b> Un d&#233;cret portant sur la 
cr&#233;ation du corps des surveillants des 
&#233;tablissements p&#233;nitentiaires a &#233;t&#233; adopt&#233; par le 
conseil des ministres le 14 janvier 2009. Le 
recrutement comprendra du personnel f&#233;minin.  
</p>
<p>105. Les autorit&#233;s togolaises devraient faire en 
sorte que les d&#233;tenus ne soient pas obliges de se 
d&#233;shabiller lorsqu&#8217;ils sont plac&#233;s en garde &#224; vue 
dans les locaux de la gendarmerie. 
</p>
<p>Une instruction sp&#233;ciale de la 
gendarmerie visant &#224; pr&#233;venir les suicides, 
&#233;taient, par certains responsables, interpr&#233;t&#233;e 
comme signifiant que les d&#233;tenus devaient rester 
nus jour et nuit dans leur cellule. Or, d&#8217;apr&#232;s le 
Gouvernement, la gendarmerie n&#8217;avait jamais 
donn&#233; l&#8217;ordre de laisser nues les personnes en 
garde &#224; vue. 
</p>
<p><b>Gouvernement :</b> Depuis les recommandations 
formul&#233;es en avril 2007 par le Rapporteur 
sp&#233;cial, les dispositions pratiques ont &#233;t&#233; prises 
par les autorit&#233;s au niveau de la gendarmerie et 
de la police. En vertu de ces dispositions, les 
d&#233;tenus sont dans leurs tenues lorsqu&#8217;ils sont en 
garde &#224; vue au bureau en attendant les 
instructions. Lorsqu&#8217;ils doivent &#234;tre intern&#233;s 
dans la chambre de suret&#233;, ils sont fouill&#233;s et 
d&#233;barrass&#233;s de tout objet pouvant leur permettre 
de se suicider. Ainsi, ils sont gard&#233;s en short de 
sport ou en culotte, mais jamais nus.  
</p>
<p>106. Le Gouvernement togolais devrait veiller &#224; 
ce que le principe de non-discrimination soit 
respect&#233; &#224; tous les niveaux du syst&#232;me de justice 
p&#233;nale, lutter contre la corruption qui touche

<p>corruption des agents de l&#8217;&#201;tat, 
mais &#233;galement des hauts responsables de 
l&#8217;administration p&#233;nitentiaire. 
107. Le Gouvernement devrait pr&#233;ciser le statut 
de la gendarmerie et d&#233;terminer 
clairement les responsabilit&#233;s de la gendarmerie 
et celles de la police, s&#233;parer les fonctions 
militaires et les fonctions de maintien de l&#8217;ordre, 
cr&#233;er des cha&#238;nes de commandement claires dans 
les &#233;tablissements p&#233;nitentiaires, et veiller &#224; ce 
que dans les prisons le pouvoir soit d&#233;tenu par 
les autorit&#233;s et non par les hi&#233;rarques de la 
population carc&#233;rale. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Manque de clart&#233; dans le partage des 
responsabilit&#233;s entre la police et la 
gendarmerie - en principe la gendarmerie 
op&#233;rait essentiellement dans les zones 
rurales, mais la distinction entre police et 
gendarmerie est devenue tr&#232;s floue et les 
deux intervenaient simultan&#233;ment dans les 
m&#234;mes zones (en particulier &#224; Lom&#233;). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Dans les prisons, le pouvoir &#233;tait 
syst&#233;matiquement d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233; au &#171; bureau 
interne &#187; , c&#8217;est-&#224;-dire aux d&#233;tenus les plus 
hauts dans la hi&#233;rarchie de la prison, ce qui 
&#233;tait n&#233;cessairement source de corruption, 
de violence entre d&#233;tenus et de d&#233;pendance 
de certains d&#233;tenus &#224; l&#8217;&#233;gard de leurs 
cod&#233;tenus. 
</p>
<p><b>Gouvernement </b>: La loi No. 2007-010 du 1er 
mars 2007, d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233; et adopt&#233; par l&#8217;Assembl&#233;e 
nationale et promulgu&#233; par le Pr&#233;sident de la 
R&#233;publique, fixe le statut g&#233;n&#233;ral du personnel 
militaire des Forces Arm&#233;es Togolaises duquel 
d&#233;coule le statut particulier de la gendarmerie 
nationale. Ce statut fixe clairement et 
distinctement les missions et les responsabilit&#233;s 
de la gendarmerie. Calqu&#233; sur le mod&#232;le 
fran&#231;ais, la gendarmerie est un corps des Forces 
Arm&#233;es Togolaises dont le minist&#232;re de la 
s&#233;curit&#233; et de la protection civile dispose pour 
emploi notamment en maintien de l&#8217;ordre pour 
la s&#233;curit&#233;. La gendarmerie op&#232;re en zone rurale. 
Les missions essentielles sont : les missions de 
police judicaire, missions de police 
administrative, missions militaires. 
</p>
<p>108. Le Gouvernement devrait am&#233;liorer la 
formation des forces de l&#8217;ordre et du 
personnel p&#233;nitentiaire et int&#233;grer les droits de 
l&#8217;homme dans les programmes 
correspondants. 
</p>
<p>Le type de formation dispens&#233; aux membres des 
forces de l&#8217;ordre semble aussi &#234;tre 
excessivement militaris&#233;, puisqu&#8217;il accorde 
beaucoup de place aux aptitudes militaires et 
peu &#224; la pr&#233;paration aux t&#226;ches complexes li&#233;es 
&#224; l&#8217;enqu&#234;te p&#233;nale ou au maintien de l&#8217;ordre. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Gouvernement </b>: Depuis le recrutement de 
2005 dans le corps de la gendarmerie et de 
la police, le niveau minimum exig&#233; est le 
Brevet d&#8217;Etudes du Premier Cycle (BEPC). 
Avec ce niveau de formation les recrues 
sont intellectuellement aptes pour 
comprendre et assimiler les cours et les 
notions sur les modules des droits de 
l&#8217;homme, le maintien de l&#8217;ordre avec des 
armes, les relations civilo-militaires, le droit 
international humanitaire (DIH), le droit

<p>&#8226; Les corps des gardiens de pr&#233;fecture (GP), 
dont l&#8217;une des missions est la garde des 
prisons et la gestion des prisonniers, suivent 
les m&#234;mes formations que les forces de

tr&#232;s bien impr&#233;gn&#233;s des m&#234;mes modules.  
</p>
<p>109. Le Gouvernement togolais devrait ratifier 
le Protocole facultatif se rapportant &#224; la 
Convention contre la torture et cr&#233;er des 
m&#233;canismes nationaux en mesure d&#8217;effectuer 
des visites inopin&#233;es dans tous les lieux de 
d&#233;tention. 
</p>
<p> <b>Gouvernement </b>: En juin 2008, un projet de loi 
autorisant la ratification de l&#8217;OPCAT a &#233;t&#233; 
adopt&#233; par le Conseil des Ministres et a &#233;t&#233; 
soumis &#224; l&#8217;Assembl&#233;e nationale en vue de son 
adoption. 
</p>
<p>110. S&#8217;agissant des mineurs, le Togo devrait 
sans tarder prendre des mesures pour que la 
privation de libert&#233; ne soit utilis&#233;e qu&#8217;en dernier 
recours, pour la dur&#233;e la plus courte possible et 
dans des conditions appropri&#233;es. 
</p>
<p>Le Togo ne disposait pas d&#8217;un syst&#232;me de 
justice pour mineurs compatible avec les 
dispositions et principes de la Convention 
relative aux droits de l&#8217;enfant, ce qui signifie 
qu&#8217;il n&#8217;y avait pratiquement pas d&#8217;alternative &#224; 
la d&#233;tention pour les mineurs en conflit avec la 
loi et qu&#8217;il n&#8217;existait aucune mesure de 
protection particuli&#232;re &#224; l&#8217;&#233;gard des personnes 
de moins de 18 ans.  
</p>
<p><b>Gouvernement</b> : En 2007, le minist&#232;re de la 
justice a command&#233; une &#233;tude sur l&#8217;&#233;tat de la 
justice des mineurs au Togo dont les 
recommandations serviront &#224; formuler un

<p>113. Le Togo devrait abolir la peine de mort. Le Code p&#233;nal togolais (articles 17, 45, 222, 
223, 233 et 234) pr&#233;voyait la peine de mort pour 
un certain nombre d&#8217;infractions. Le Togo &#233;tait 
abolitionniste dans la pratique et l&#8217;abolition de

</b></p>
<p><b>GUIDELINES FOR THE SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION ON 
THE FOLLOW-UP TO THE COUNTRY VISITS OF THE 
SPECIAL RAPPORTUER ON THE QUESTION OF TORTURE 
</b></p>
<p>1. Follow-up is a key-element in ensuring the effectiveness of recommendations of Special 
Procedure mechanisms. In this context, all Governments are urged to enter into a constructive 
dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on torture with respect to the follow-up to his 
recommendations, so as to enable him to fulfil his mandate more effectively. 
</p>
<p>2. To obtain a comprehensive picture, the Special Rapporteur welcomes written information 
from international, regional, national and local organizations regarding follow up measures. The 
Special Rapporteur encourages information submitted through national coalitions or committees. 
</p>
<p>3. A summary of the content of the submissions from non-State sources is integrated in the 
follow-up table, which is then forwarded to the concerned State for its input and comments. In 
particular, States are requested to provide information on the consideration given to the 
recommendations, the steps taken to implement them, and any constraints which may prevent 
their implementation. 
</p>
<p>4. For a given country visit report, written information regarding follow-up measures to each 
of the recommendations should be submitted to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights. Submissions should not exceed 10 pages in length. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur will include summaries of the written information submitted to 
him in the addenda on the follow-up to country visits of the report to the Human Rights Council.
