<p><b>  Mission to El Salvador</b>* ** 
</p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers undertook an 
official visit to El Salvador from 19 to 26 November 2012. The purpose of the mission was 
to examine the progress made and the challenges encountered by the country in 
strengthening the independence of judges, prosecutors and lawyers. During her visit to San 
Salvador and Santa Ana, she met with a wide range of high-ranking Government officials, 
the Procurator for the Defence of Human Rights (Ombudsman), judges and magistrates 
from various levels of the courts, prosecutors, lawyers, academics, international and local 
non-governmental organizations and United Nations agencies. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the progress made by El Salvador since the 
signature of the Chapultepec Peace Accords in 1992 in ensuring the independence of the 
judiciary, which constitutes an essential prerequisite to the rule of law. The Constitution 
contains detailed provisions on the independence of judges and prosecutors. Domestic 
legislation also ensures that the judiciary is institutionally separated from the other 
branches of powers, and is autonomous in its functioning and in the decision of internal 
matters.

</p>
<p>Despite the progress made, a number of challenges remain to fully guarantee the 
independence and impartiality of judges and prosecutors in practice. 
</p>
<p> The recent institutional crisis between the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme 
Court of Justice and the Legislative Assembly demonstrates the level of politicization of 
the judiciary and how it has affected the role of the key actors of the justice system in 
combating impunity and human rights violations. 
</p>
<p> The current procedure for the appointment of magistrates of the Supreme Court, 
other judges and magistrates, and the key actors of the justice system does not provide 
sufficient guarantees to eliminate pressure and interference from political parties and 
economic groups and to ensure that they are selected on the basis of fair and objective 
criteria. It also does not ensure the institutional independence of the judiciary from the 
other branches of power, in particular the legislative power. The lack of transparency and 
public scrutiny in the process of selection continues to perpetrate a system based on 
patronage and political favours.  
</p>
<p> The current regime for disciplinary, suspension or removal proceedings against 
judges and magistrates is not fully in compliance with some of the due process and fair trial 
guarantees set out in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
and in the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, which provide that 
individual judges can only be dismissed or suspended on serious grounds of misconduct or 
incompetence and in accordance with fair procedures ensuring objectivity and impartiality. 
</p>
<p> The composition of the National Council of the Judiciary and the current procedure 
to select and appoint its members do not offer sufficient guarantees to enable this institution 
to adequately represent the interests of the judiciary and to protect its independence from 
other branches of power. 
</p>
<p> The Attorney General, the Procurator-General and the Ombudsman do not have 
adequate human, technical and financial resources to carry out their constitutional 
mandates. The lack of adequate coordination between prosecutors and the National Civil 
Police and the limited technical capacity of the police to investigate crimes and collect 
evidence result in very low conviction rates, and heightens the general feeling of impunity 
among the population. 
</p>
<p> Existing training institutions do not have sufficient human, technical and financial 
resources to provide adequate training opportunities, including continuing and specialized 
training, and other kinds of capacity-building for all the actors of the judicial system 
(judges, prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers).  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur concludes the report with recommendations for 
strengthening the judicial system and the independence of judges, magistrates, prosecutors 
and lawyers.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Gabriela Knaul, 
undertook an official visit to El Salvador from 19 to 26 November 2012. She examined the 
progress made by the country in implementing its obligations under human rights law to 
ensure the independence and impartiality of judges, magistrates and prosecutors and the 
free exercise of the legal profession by lawyers, as well as the challenges which prevent 
actors of the judicial system from discharging their functions efficiently, effectively, 
adequately and appropriately. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur visited San Salvador and Santa Ana. She met with a number 
of senior Government officials, including the Minister of Justice and Public Security; the 
President and members of the Legislative Assembly; the President and various magistrates 
of the Supreme Court of Justice, including justices of the Constitutional Chamber (Sala de 
lo Constitucional); magistrates and judges of different courts and tribunals; the president 
and counsellors of the National Council of the Judiciary (Consejo Nacional de la 
Judicatura); prosecutors from the Office of the Attorney General (Fiscal&#237;a General de la 
Rep&#250;blica); the Office of the Procurator-General (Procurador&#237;a General de la Republica); 
the Procurator for the Defence of Human Rights (Procurador para la Defensa de los 
Derechos Humanos), who serves as the Ombudsman, and his staff; lawyers; representatives 
of professional associations of judges; bar associations; non-governmental organizations; 
academics; and United Nations agencies.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur would like to express her gratitude to the Government of El 
Salvador for its invitation and for the support provided to her throughout the visit. The 
standing invitation addressed to special procedures mandate holders in February 2010 and 
the openness shown by the Government before and during the mission demonstrate its 
commitment and willingness to cooperate with international human rights mechanisms in 
the solution of the challenges that the country faces in the field of administration of justice. 
She also wishes to thank the United Nations Development Programme in El Salvador and 
the Regional Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for 
Central America for their valuable cooperation and assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International obligations 
</b></p>
<p>4. El Salvador is a party to eight core international human rights treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Pursuant to these treaties, El Salvador 
has undertaken to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its 
jurisdiction all rights related to the proper administration of justice, including the principles of 
equality before the law, the right to an effective remedy, the right to liberty and security, the 
presumption of innocence, the right to a fair and public hearing without undue delay by a 
competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law, the fundamental procedural 
guarantees of persons charged with a criminal offence, and the principle of legality. 
</p>
<p>5. Pursuant to the human rights treaties to which it is a party, El Salvador is also under 
an obligation to adopt all appropriate legislative, administrative, judicial and other measures 
to ensure the establishment of an independent and impartial judiciary and the proper 
administration of justice. The protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
requires a strong, fair and independent judiciary that is able and willing to uphold human 
rights and hold anyone accountable for breaches of law. Without an independent and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>impartial justice system, the rule of law can be seriously impaired, and there can be no 
protection or redress for human rights violations, be they of civil, cultural, economic, 
political or social nature.  
</p>
<p>6. In accordance with article 144 of the Constitution, international treaties ratified by El 
Salvador constitute laws of the Republic, and can be directly applied in the domestic legal 
order. National legislation cannot modify or repeal what was agreed in a ratified international 
treaty. In case of conflicts, international treaties take precedence over national legislation. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The justice system 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Chapultepec Peace Accords of 1992 brought peace to El Salvador after more 
than a decade of civil war. They set the basis for a number of constitutional reforms aimed 
at achieving peace through the building of a democratic State firmly grounded on the 
respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The reform of the judiciary constituted 
an important part of the Peace Accords. 
</p>
<p>8. The political and legal system is based on the 1983 Constitution, amended in 1992 
to reflect the agreement reached through the Peace Accords. This set the basis for the 
separation of powers and for the consolidation of the independence of the judiciary, which 
constitute essential prerequisites to the rule of law. Title II of the Constitution incorporates 
the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the person, including the rights relating to 
the administration of justice that are enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>9. The Constitution contains detailed provisions on the independence of the judiciary. 
It establishes the judicial career to ensure the functional independence of judges and 
magistrates. In order to enable the judiciary to properly perform its functions, the 
Constitution also provides that the judiciary shall receive an annual allocation of no less 
than 6 per cent of the current income of the State budget.  
</p>
<p>10. The structure and functioning of the judiciary are further delineated in secondary 
legislation. The Law on the Judiciary1 regulates the functions and competences of the 
various courts that integrate the judicial system. The Law on the Judicial Career2 contains 
specific provisions to ensure that judges and magistrates are enabled to decide matters 
before them impartially and without any restriction, pressure or interference, as well as to 
guarantee their security, adequate remuneration and conditions of service. It also regulates 
the promotion, assignment, transfer, suspension and removal of judges and magistrates. 
</p>
<p>11. The judicial system of El Salvador consists of the Supreme Court of Justice, the 
courts of appeal, the tribunals and the justices of the peace.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. The Supreme Court of Justice  
</b></p>
<p>12. The Supreme Court of Justice consists of 15 justices distributed among four 
chambers: Constitutional, Criminal, Civil and Administrative. The Constitutional Chamber 
is the only one which is explicitly established by the Constitution, and is composed of five 
magistrates. The President of the Constitutional Chamber is also the President of the 
Supreme Court and the Judicial Branch (<i>&#211;rgano Judicial</i>). The Civil and Criminal 
Chambers consists of three magistrates each, while the Administrative Chamber is 
integrated by four magistrates.  
</p>
<p>  
 1 Legislative Decree No. 123 of 6 June 1984. 
 2 Legislative Decree No. 536 of 12 July 1990. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>13. According to the Constitution, the Supreme Court has the power to hear <i>amparo</i> 
proceedings; adjudicate on conflicts of jurisdiction among national tribunals and courts; 
grant permission to carry out decisions issued by foreign courts; ensure the prompt and 
complete administration of justice; and exercise the other functions entrusted to it by the 
Constitution or the law.  
</p>
<p>14. The Constitutional Chamber is competent to control the constitutionality of laws, 
decrees and regulations; hear individual petitions for the protection of constitutional rights 
(<i>amparo</i> and habeas corpus writs); adjudicate on any disputes between the Legislative and 
the Executive Branches; and decide cases of suspension or loss of the rights of citizenship, 
as well as of the corresponding rehabilitation. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Courts of appeal </b></p>
<p>15. Courts of appeal have jurisdiction over appeals from first-instance tribunals. They 
also adjudicate as first-instance courts on cases against the State, and decide other cases 
falling within their jurisdiction in accordance with the Constitution and the law. Each court 
of appeal consists of two magistrates. There are 27 courts of appeal in the country. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Tribunals  
</b></p>
<p>16. Tribunals (<i>juzgados</i>) have general jurisdiction to decide in first instance all disputes 
that do not fall within the jurisdiction of the justices of the peace, and to adjudicate in 
second instance upon specific cases provided for by the law. Each tribunal consists of a 
monocratic judge. There are 218 tribunals.    
</p>
<p><b> 4. Justices of the peace 
</b></p>
<p>17. Justices of the peace (<i>juzgados de paz</i>) are monocratic judges who have jurisdiction 
over minor civil and commercial claims, as well as over minor criminal offences provided 
for by the law. There are 322 courts of the peace.  
</p>
<p><b> C. National Council of the Judiciary  
</b></p>
<p>18. According to the Constitution, the National Council of the Judiciary is an 
independent institution in charge of proposing candidates to serve as justices on the 
Supreme Court and magistrates and judges for the lower courts. The Council is also 
responsible for maintaining and updating the registry of lawyers operating in the country; 
cooperating with the Supreme Court in ensuring the prompt and effective administration of 
justice; collaborating with and facilitating the coordination of the different actors of the 
justice system; and organizing and operating the Judicial Training School (Escuela de 
Capacitaci&#243;n Judicial), whose purpose is to provide initial and continuing professional 
training to judges and other judicial officers. 
</p>
<p>19. The National Council of the Judiciary is composed of seven counsellors: three 
lawyers designated by the organization representing lawyers; an academic from the Faculty 
of Law and Social Sciences of the University of El Salvador; an academic from the law 
department of a private university; a lawyer designated by the Public Ministry; and a 
representative elected by magistrates and judges. 
</p>
<p><b> D.  The Public Ministry  
</b></p>
<p>20. The Public Ministry (Ministerio P&#250;blico<i>) </i>consists of three institutions which are 
independent from the three branches of government: the Attorney General of the Republic, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>the Procurator-General of the Republic and the Procurator for the Defence of Human 
Rights.   
</p>
<p><b> 1. The Attorney General  
</b></p>
<p>21. The Attorney General is responsible for, inter alia, defending the interests of the 
State and society; initiating criminal proceedings and legal action in defence of the law and 
public interest; directing criminal investigations in collaboration with the National Civil 
Police; and promoting the prosecution and punishment of persons accused of crimes against 
national authorities.3   
</p>
<p><b> 2. The Procurator-General   
</b></p>
<p>22. The Procurator-General is an independent institution charged with defending the 
family and the interests of children and persons unable to defend their interests 
autonomously; providing free legal assistance to persons who do not have sufficient means 
to pay for it in order to defend their fundamental liberties and labour rights; and exercising 
the other functions established by law.4 
</p>
<p><b> 3. The Procurator for the Defence of Human Rights  
</b></p>
<p>23. The Procurator for the Defence of Human Rights (Ombudsman) is an independent 
national human rights institution established in compliance with the principles relating to 
the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris 
Principles). The Ombudsman is mandated to, inter alia: promote the respect and protection 
of human rights; investigate complaints of human rights violations and assist victims; 
promote administrative or judicial remedies for the protection of human rights and 
measures it deems necessary to prevent human rights violations; and present its views on 
draft legislation that may affect the exercise of human rights.5 
</p>
<p><b> III. Challenges to the independence and impartiality of 
magistrates, judges and prosecutors 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The institutional crisis between the Supreme Court of Justice and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Legislative Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>24. Judicial independence has a crucial role to play in upholding the rule of law, 
combating impunity and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms at all times. Its 
implementation requires the creation of an environment conducive to independent, 
impartial and fair decision-making that enables judges and magistrates to &#8220;decide matters 
before them impartially, on the basis of facts and in accordance with the law, without any 
restrictions, improper influences, inducements, pressures, threats or interferences, direct or 
indirect, from any quarter or for any reason&#8221; (principle 2, Basic Principles on the 
</p>
<p>Independence of the Judiciary).  
</p>
<p>  
 3 Law on the Attorney General of the Republic, Legislative Decree No. 1037 of 27 April 2006. 
 4 Law on the Procurator-General of the Republic, Legislative Decree No. 775 of 3 December 2008. 
 5 Law on the Procurator for the Defence of Human Rights, Legislative Decree No. 183 of 
</p>
<p>20 February 1992. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>25. The recent institutional crisis between the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme 
Court and the Legislative Assembly represents a vivid example of the serious interference 
to which the judiciary is exposed from other powers of the State.   
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur was informed that the crisis originated from a decision of 
the Constitutional Chamber on the electoral system of El Salvador.6 The Chamber declared 
the unconstitutionality of various provisions of the Electoral Code that did not allow 
individuals not affiliated to any political party to run for elections. Before the official 
notification of the decision, the Legislative Assembly modified the Constitution in an 
emergency session held on the same night the Constitutional Chamber adopted its decision, 
and established that an individual could run for a political position only if she or he is 
affiliated to a political party.     
</p>
<p>27. In June 2011, the Legislative Assembly adopted Legislative Decree No. 743, aimed 
at obstructing the Constitutional Chamber by requiring that all decisions on 
constitutionality be taken unanimously. Only after two months of persistent national and 
international protests was this decree revoked. 
</p>
<p>28. The tension between the Legislative Assembly and the Constitutional Chamber 
reached its peak in June 2012, when the Chamber declared that the appointments of 
Supreme Court magistrates and their alternates made in 2006 and 2012 were 
unconstitutional on account of the fact that the Assembly could proceed to the election of 
new Supreme Court magistrates only once for each legislative period (members of the 
Assembly are elected for a three-year period). The Chamber also declared unconstitutional 
the transfer of its president to another chamber of the Supreme Court, due to the fact that 
the president is elected for a period of nine years and has guaranteed tenure until the expiry 
of his term of office.7  
</p>
<p>29. The Legislative Assembly decided to challenge the legality of these decisions before 
the Central American Court of Justice (CACJ), established by the States parties to the 
Organization of Central American States to resolve disputes concerning the interpretation 
and application of the regional community law.8 On 21 June, the CACJ admitted the request 
of the Legislative Assembly, and issued an interim measure to suspend the effects of the 
decision of the Constitutional Chamber.  
</p>
<p>30. Four days later, the Constitutional Chamber declared the decision of the regional 
court unconstitutional, and ordered the Legislative Assembly to carry out its decision of 5 
June 2012. In turn, the Legislative Assembly refused to receive the notification of this 
decision, claiming that it was for the plenary of the Supreme Court, and not for the 
Constitutional Chamber, to decide on the constitutionality of the decision of the CACJ. In a 
public statement, the President of the Republic affirmed that decisions of the Central 
American Court of Justice had to be complied with. 
</p>
<p>31. On 28 June, the Legislative Assembly adopted Legislative Decree No. 43 of 29 June 
</p><p>2012. The aim of this decree was to allow the magistrates elected in 2012 to take up their 
duties despite the decision of the Constitutional Chamber that declared their appointment 
unconstitutional. It made this possible by authorizing any member of the Supreme Court to 
convoke a session of the plenary of the court without the president having to be present; the 
magistrates elected in April 2012 thus took up their duties on 1 July 2012. As a result, El 
Salvador ended up with two Supreme Courts: one composed of the magistrates whose 
</p>

 7 Decisions 19-2012 and 23-2012 of 5 June 2012. 
 8 See article 12 of the Tegucigalpa Protocol to the Charter of the Organization of Central American 
</p>
<p>States. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>elections had been declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Chamber, and another 
consisting of the Constitutional Chamber integrated by alternates.9  
</p>
<p>32. On 15 August, the CACJ pronounced its decision.10 The Court (a) declared itself a 
supranational constitutional tribunal with full competence to resolve the conflict between 
the Legislative Assembly and the Supreme Court of Justice; (b) found admissible the claim 
lodged by the Legislative Assembly; and (c) declared inapplicable the decisions adopted by 
the Constitutional Chamber on 5 June 2012. This ruling sparked an outcry among various 
elements of academia and civil society.11 
</p>
<p>33. On 24 July, the President of the Republic organized a private meeting at his 
residence with the leaders of the political parties to find a political solution for the 
institutional conflict between the Legislative Assembly and the Supreme Court. After a 
number of meetings behind closed doors, the President announced on 19 August that an 
agreement had been reached among the six political parties represented in the Legislative 
Assembly. On 21 August, the Assembly ratified this agreement.  
</p>
<p>34. The composition of the Constitutional Chamber remained virtually untouched. The 
justices elected in 2006 and 2012 were invited to take the oath and took up their duties on 
22 August. One of the justices elected in 2012 was designated as the new president of the 
Constitutional Chamber.12  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that this agreement played an instrumental 
role in solving the institutional crisis that paralysed the administration of justice for more 
than two months. However, she considers that in the absence of clearly defined rules and 
procedure for the selection and appointment of Supreme Court magistrates, the agreement 
reached at the presidential residence establishes a dangerous precedent that risks 
undermining further the independence of the judiciary from the other branches of power. 
The agreement also shows the high level of politicization in this appointment procedure.   
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the refusal of the Legislative 
Assembly to comply with the sentence issued by the Constitutional Chamber on 5 June 
2012 seriously undermined the independence of the judiciary and the principle of 
separation of powers.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur considers that it was not for the Legislative Assembly to 
assess whether the decisions adopted by the Constitutional Chamber were consistent with 
the mandate entrusted to it by article 183 of the Constitution. In this regard, the Basic 
Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary clearly affirm that the judiciary has 
jurisdiction over all issues of a judicial nature, as well as &#8220;exclusive authority to decide 
</p>
<p>whether an issue submitted for its decision is within its competence as defined by law&#8221; 
(principle 3). 
</p>
<p>38. During her mission, the Special Rapporteur heard testimonies about other serious 
pressures, threats and interferences with the independence of the judiciary, including: legal 
proceedings brought against the magistrates of the Constitutional Chamber alleging abuse 
of power; a threat to remove the magistrates of this Chamber in accordance with article 
186, paragraph 2, of the Constitution; refusal of the Legislative Assembly to receive

<p>notification of the Court&#8223;s decisions and to publish its sentences in the official <i>Gazette</i>; and 
the creation of a special commission within the Legislative Assembly to assess the legality 
of the elections of Supreme Court magistrates of 2009 (when four out of five magistrates of 
the Constitutional Chamber were elected).  
</p>
<p>39. One of the most disturbing events that occurred during the institutional crisis was 
the unprecedented decision of the Legislative Assembly to bring a case against the 
Constitutional Chamber before the Central American Court of Justice.13 The very decision 
to bring a case before the CACJ showed a profound disrespect for the authority of the 
Constitutional Chamber, which is the country&#8223;s highest legal authority for the interpretation 
of the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur has made efforts to monitor the independence and 
impartiality of international and regional courts and also has requested that their 
independence be respected and observed by States. 
</p>
<p>41. Existing international human rights standards, such as the Basic Principles on the 
Independence of the Judiciary, state that all governmental and other institutions have to 
respect and observe the independence of the judiciary, and establish that inappropriate or 
unwarranted interferences with the judicial process are inadmissible (principles 1, 2 and 4). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Procedure for the appointment of key actors in the justice system 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the current procedures for the 
selection and appointment of judges and magistrates, members of the National Council of 
the Judiciary and chiefs of the Public Ministry institutions do not provide sufficient 
guarantees to ensure their institutional independence, in particular from the legislative 
power.  
</p>
<p>43. Candidates for these positions must possess the qualifications listed in the 
Constitution and secondary legislation. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that most of 
these requirements are too broad or generic. Furthermore, neither the Constitution nor the 
law provide any guidance on how to assess some of the requirements, such as &#8220;well-known 
morality and competence&#8221;, &#8220;high level of professional and academic experience&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>&#8220;integrity&#8221; (<i>honorabilidad</i>). This means that in practice, candidates for the above-
mentioned functions are currently selected solely on the basis of formal and overly general 
requirements that do not allow a proper assessment of the moral integrity, independence 
and professional qualifications of the candidate. 
</p>
<p>44. With the exception of magistrates and judges of lower courts and tribunals, 
candidates to the top positions of the justice system are elected by the Legislative Assembly 
with a qualified majority of at least two thirds of its members. The Special Rapporteur is 
concerned that the lack of appropriate selection criteria and procedures facilitates 
interference from political parties and economic groups in the selection process.  
</p>
<p>45. The lack of transparency and public scrutiny in the selection process continues to 
perpetrate a system based on patronage and political favours. Pressure and interference 
from political parties and economic groups in the selection of magistrates and other actors 
of judicial institutions generate corruption and nepotism and hamper the institutional 
independence of the judiciary and other institutions of the justice system. The Special 
</p>
<p>  
 13 This situation caused the resignation of magistrate Mar&#237;a Silvia Guill&#233;n, elected in 2006 to represent 
</p>
<p>El Salvador in the CACJ. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>Rapporteur considers that the current methods for the selection should be reviewed to avoid 
any risk of appointments for improper motives. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Appointment of justices of the Supreme Court of Justice 
</b></p>
<p>46. Magistrates of the Supreme Court are elected for a period of nine years and may be 
re-elected. Their appointment consists of two distinct phases: the &#8220;pre-selection&#8221; and the 
selection. The pre-selection aims at preparing the list of candidates that the National 
Council of the Judiciary is required to present to the Legislative Assembly. Half of the 
candidates included in this list are designated by an organization representing lawyers 
(Federation of Lawyers&#8223; Associations of El Salvador &#8211; FEDAES), and the other half by the 
Council. The &#8220;selection&#8221; is made by the Legislative Assembly, which designates five 
justices and five alternates every three years.    
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the involvement of different entities in 
the selection and appointment of Supreme Court magistrates aims at ensuring the 
institutional independence of the judiciary. However, the current procedure does not offer 
sufficient guarantees to eliminate interferences from political parties in the election of those 
magistrates.  
</p>
<p>48. According to the internal regulation of the Legislative Assembly, the selection of 
candidates should be transparent and open to public scrutiny. In practice, however, political 
parties only proceed to an evaluation of the formal requirements of the candidates based on 
their curricula and, in some cases, short interviews behind closed doors. In many cases, 
members of the evaluation committee do not have sufficient legal knowledge or expertise to 
adequately assess the candidates. As a result, candidates proposed to the plenary of the 
Legislative Assembly are identified mainly on the basis of their actual or perceived political 
affiliation, rather than on their integrity, ability and appropriate qualifications and 
professional experience.  
</p>
<p>49. In previous reports, the Special Rapporteur has noted that there exists a variety of 
systems for the selection and appointment of judges worldwide (A/HRC/11/41, para. 24). 
One of these systems consists in the establishment of an independent authority charged with 
the selection of judges, which can be composed of judges only or be a judicial council with 
plural representation. Since the involvement of the legislature in judicial appointments 
inevitably risks politicizing the process, the Special Rapporteur considers that the power to 
select and appoint Supreme Court magistrates could be entrusted to an independent 
authority, such as the National Council of the Judiciary. Nevertheless, the current 
composition of the Council should be changed (see para. 62 below). 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Appointment of judges and magistrates of courts of appeal, tribunals and justices of 
</b></p>
<p><b>peace 
</b></p>
<p>50. Similar considerations apply to the selection and appointment of magistrates of 
courts of appeal, judges of first-instance tribunals and justices of the peace, who are 
selected by the Supreme Court from a list of candidates prepared by the National Council of 
the Judiciary. The selection criteria for these posts are defined in the Constitution. Such 
criteria only allow assessing the academic and professional achievements of the candidate, 
but not his or her independence and integrity. Furthermore, the lack of guidance in 
secondary legislation on how to evaluate these requirements results in the conferring of a 
wide discretionary power to the Supreme Court. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Appointment of counsellors of the National Council of the Judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>51. The qualifications required to be elected as a counsellor are the same as those 
identified in the Constitution to become magistrate of the Supreme Court. In addition, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>counsellors designated by academic institutions must have taught at the university for at 
least five years before their election. The Special Rapporteur considers that the current 
criteria to select the counsellors are not sufficient to ensure that nominees possess the 
requirements of independence, integrity and competencies required for this position. 
</p>
<p>52. Counsellors are selected from the lists prepared by the different sectors represented 
in the Council (academia; judges and lawyers). The Special Rapporteur was informed that 
some candidates to the Council organize very expensive election campaigns which are 
allegedly sponsored by political parties or economic groups.  
</p>
<p>53. The current procedure to select and appoint counsellors presents the same risks as 
those identified for the appointment of justices of the Supreme Court. For example, the 
Special Rapporteur was informed that some private universities have been allegedly 
established for the sole purpose of presenting candidates to the Council (so-called &#8220;garage 
universities&#8221;).  
</p>
<p>54. In previous reports, the Special Rapporteur has noted that if the body is primarily 
composed of political representatives, there is always a risk that these &#8220;independent bodies&#8221; 
</p>
<p>might become merely formal or legal rubber-stamping organs behind which the 
Government exerts its influence indirectly (A/HRC/11/41, para. 28).  
</p>
<p>55. Members of the Council are elected and dismissed by the Legislative Assembly with 
a qualified majority of at least two thirds of its members. The Special Rapporteur also 
considers that the selection of counsellors by the Legislative Assembly, which also retains 
the power to dismiss them, weakens the independence of the Council. In order to ensure 
that this body is apt to identify suitable candidates for the Supreme Court and lower courts 
in an objective, fair and independent manner, she considers that the judiciary and other 
parties directly linked to the system of administration of justice should also be involved in 
the selection and appointment of the counsellors.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 4. Appointment of chiefs of Public Ministry institutions 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Attorney General, the Procurator-General, and the Procurator for the Defence of 
Human Rights are appointed by the Legislative Assembly for a period of three years, and 
may be re-elected. Candidates to the first two posts must possess the same requirements as 
candidates to the Supreme Court. The selection criteria for the post of Procurator for the 
Defence of Human Rights are set out in secondary legislation.14  
</p>
<p>57. With regard to the process of appointment, the Special Rapporteur considers that 
entrusting the power to appoint the chief of each of these organizations to the Legislative 
Assembly may hamper the independence of the candidates and, in turn, of the institutions 
they represent. In relation to the term of office, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that 
the limited duration of the mandate entrusted to the heads of each of these institutions may 
prevent them from developing and carrying out a coherent and uniform policy to strengthen 
their respective organization and support the achievement of its institutional goals.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Appointment of the new Attorney General 
</b></p>
<p>58. On 24 April 2012, just before the end of the legislature, the Legislative Assembly 
elected the new Attorney General for the period 2012-2015. However, as was the case for 
the election of the Supreme Court magistrates, on 10 July 2012 the Constitutional Chamber 
declared unconstitutional the election carried out by the Legislative Assembly, on account 
of the fact that the same legislature could not proceed to the election of a new Attorney 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.1

</b></p>
<p>General more than once. When the previous Attorney General left office on 17 September 
2012, the post remained empty, and its functions were temporarily exercised by the 
Assistant Attorney General. In November 2012, the latter transferred the management of 
the Attorney General&#8223;s Office to the Auditor-General due to health-related issues. 
</p>
<p>59. At the end of her visit, the Special Rapporteur expressed her concerns about the 
failure of the Legislative Assembly to find an agreement on the appointment of the new 
Attorney General, and warned that that situation risked triggering a new institutional crisis. 
She also stressed that the Attorney General plays a crucial role in guaranteeing legality, 
combating corruption and impunity and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
and called on the Legislative Assembly to proceed without further delay to the appointment 
of the new Attorney General.15 
</p>
<p>60. She is pleased to note that on 4 December 2012, the Legislative Assembly elected 
the new Attorney General. Such an agreement put an end to months of confrontation and 
mutual attacks between the major political forces represented in the Legislative Assembly. 
She is particularly pleased that the Legislative Assembly elected the new incumbent by 
unanimity.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Administration of the justice system  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Composition of the National Council of the Judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>61. As an independent institution in charge of preparing the list of candidates to the 
Supreme Court and the lower courts, the Special Rapporteur considers that the National 
Council of the Judiciary has a crucial role to play in ensuring the institutional independence 
of the judiciary from the other branches of powers. 
</p>
<p>62. However, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the current composition of 
the Council, which includes only one representative of the judiciary among its seven 
counsellors, is not adequate to allow this institution to represent and defend adequately the 
independence of the judicial system. While a genuinely plural composition of this body is 
recommended, with judges, prosecutors, lawyers and academics represented in a balanced 
way, she considers that it is important to ensure that magistrates and judges constitute the 
majority of the body, so as to avoid any political or other external influence.  
</p>
<p>63. According to article 24 of the Law on the National Council of the Judiciary,16 the 
counsellor designated by judges and magistrates cannot be elected as president of the 
Council. In order to allow the Council to defend adequately the interests of the judiciary, 
the Special Rapporteur is of the view that the presidency of the Council should be exercised 
by a magistrate or judge.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Administrative functions of the Supreme Court of Justice 
</b></p>
<p>64. Besides its jurisdictional functions, the Supreme Court has a number of 
administrative functions, such as appointing, suspending and removing judges and 
magistrates of lower courts and tribunals; authorizing lawyers to exercise their profession; 
and suspending, removing and rehabilitating lawyers in cases provided for by the law. The 
Court also carries out administrative attributions in relation to the administration and

<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>functioning of the Institute of Legal Medicine and the transfer of detainees (<i>traslado de 
reos</i>). 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the administrative functions currently 
entrusted to the Supreme Court may be detrimental to the exercise of its jurisdictional 
competences and the effective and efficient functioning of the entire judicial system. This 
may adversely affect the duration of court proceedings due to an inappropriate allocation of 
budgetary resources. In that sense, she learned that many cases are pending in the lower 
courts and hearings have to be postponed generally because defendants are absent due to 
the delay of their transfer. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur encourages the Supreme 
Court to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the functioning of the entire judicial 
system to identify challenges, gaps and opportunities to improve the administration of 
justices, and to assess which administrative functions could be transferred to other 
institutions.  
</p>
<p>66. In previous reports, the Special Rapporteur advocated that a fixed percentage of the 
gross domestic product be allocated to the judiciary to ensure its institutional independence 
from other branches of power (A/HRC/11/41, paras. 37 ff.). She considers that the 
allocation of 6 per cent of the current income of the State budget to the judiciary (see para. 
9 above) represents a good practice in promoting the independent and autonomous 
functioning of the judiciary. Nevertheless, she is concerned about the management of the 
budget, which should be better organized and distributed in order to improve the conditions 
of service in the entire justice system and make it work more expeditiously, efficiently and 
effectively. Allegedly, according to information received, the financial resources are mostly 
concentred in the Supreme Court, which creates a lack of support for the adequate 
functioning of the courts of appeal, tribunals and justices of the peace.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. The judicial career 
</b></p>
<p>67. The judicial career is established in the Constitution and further regulated in the Law 
on the Judicial Career, which contains specific provisions on the selection, assignment, 
transfer, promotion, suspension and removal of judges and magistrates. The aim of the 
judicial career is to ensure that judges and magistrates are able to exercise their functions 
independently and impartially and enjoy adequate conditions of service, including long-
term security of tenure and adequate remuneration.  
</p>
<p>68. The Supreme Court of Justice is responsible for the administration of the judicial 
career. It appoints, promotes, suspends and removes judges and magistrates, coroners, legal 
officers and employees of lower courts and tribunals. The National Council of the Judiciary 
manages and oversees the access to the judicial career, which consists of a competitive 
examination and, in some cases, an initial professional training at the Judicial Training 
School.  
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur was informed that there are four different categories for 
each instance of jurisdiction, and that the only difference among them is the salary, since 
the competences and workload are the same. She was also informed that promotions and 
transfers have been used on some occasions as a means to control judicial decisions and/or 
exercise reprisals. She observes that this represents a kind of internal interference in the 
judicial system by the Supreme Court, which undermines the independence of judges and 
magistrates of the courts of appeal, tribunals and courts of peace. 
</p>
<p>70. The technical selection process is aimed only at ascertaining that the candidate 
meets the minimum requirements set out in the Constitution and secondary legislation for 
the position for which he or she is applying. The Special Rapporteur considers that the lack 
of specific selection criteria aimed at assessing the independence and integrity of the 
candidate and the lack of an appropriate competitive examination conducted at least partly </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>in a written and anonymous manner confer a wide discretionary power on the National 
Council of the Judiciary, and may lead to the selection of candidates who do not possess the 
integrity, independence and ability required for the post.  
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned that the system of promotion of judges and 
magistrates does not seem to be based on objective factors, such as ability, integrity and 
experience. She wishes to underscore that while adequate experience is an essential 
prerequisite for promotion, it should not be the only factor taken into account in such 
decisions. Promotion, like initial selection and appointment, should be merit-based, having 
regard to qualification, integrity, ability and efficiency (A/HRC/11/41, para. 72).  
</p>
<p>72. In order to strengthen the functional independence of judges and magistrates, the 
final decisions on promotions should preferably be taken by an independent body in charge 
of the selection of judges, and not by the Supreme Court.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Disciplinary proceedings 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the current regime for disciplinary 
measures against judges and magistrates is not fully in compliance with the provisions of 
the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, which provide that individual 
judges can only be dismissed or suspended on serious grounds of misconduct or 
incompetence and in accordance with fair procedures ensuring objectivity and impartiality 
(principles 17-20). 
</p>
<p>74. Magistrates of the Supreme Court can be removed from their office only for specific 
causes previously established by the law. Decisions concerning their dismissal are adopted 
by the Legislative Assembly with a qualified majority of at least two thirds of its members. 
The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that existing legislation does not indicate 
expressly on which grounds these magistrates can be dismissed,17 nor does it establish any 
due process and fair trial guarantees, including an independent review of the decision of the 
Assembly. This legislative vacuum can lead to improper threats and interferences with the 
independence of the judiciary, as already pointed out above. In previous reports, the Special 
Rapporteur has stressed that in case of dismissal by political bodies, it is even more 
important that their decision be subject to judicial review (A/HRC/11/41, para. 61).  
</p>
<p>75. The disciplinary, suspension and removal proceedings against judges and 
magistrates of lower courts are regulated in the Law on the Judiciary. The Department of 
Judicial Investigation of the Supreme Court is the body responsible for the management and 
discipline of the judiciary.  
</p>
<p>76. As noted in previous reports, the Special Rapporteur considers that the law must 
give detailed guidance on the infractions by judges triggering disciplinary measures, 
including the gravity of the infraction which determines the kind of disciplinary measure to 
be applied in the case at hand (A/HRC/11/41, para. 57). She considers that some of the 
infractions set out in the Law on the Judiciary, such as &#8220;threat or harm to the correct 
administration of justice&#8221; or &#8220;social scandal&#8221;, are not sufficiently defined by the law, and 
</p>
<p>therefore risk undermining the independence of the judiciary.  
</p>
<p>77. It is worrisome that the disciplinary procedure regulated in chapter XI of the Law on 
the Judicial Career is not fully in compliance with some of the due process and fair trial 
guarantees set out in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
such as (a) the right to be promptly notified of the charges, (b) to have access to documents

<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>or other evidence, and (c) to be tried within a reasonable time. She further notes that 
decisions in disciplinary, suspension and removal proceedings are not subject to 
independent review, since they are considered and adjudicated by the Supreme Court itself.  
</p>
<p>78. Finally, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about allegations that in some cases 
judges and magistrates have been subject to disciplinary proceedings or removed from 
office because of errors in judicial decisions or because their decisions have been 
overturned on appeal or review by a higher judicial body. She would like to emphasize that 
the principle of irremovability should be adopted and respected as a fundamental guarantee 
of the real independence of the judicial career.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Prosecutors 
</b></p>
<p>79. The proper functioning of the Attorney General&#8223;s office is an important factor in 
ensuring the proper administration of justice and the fight against impunity. During her 
meetings with prosecutors, the Special Rapporteur became aware of a number of problems 
affecting the capacity of prosecutors to initiate legal proceedings in the protection of public 
interest, including the lack of adequate human, technical and financial resources and the 
role of public prosecutors in criminal proceedings, particularly in relation to the 
investigation of crimes and the initiation of criminal proceedings.  
</p>
<p>80. The Public Ministry receives an annual allocation of 2 per cent of the State&#8223;s budget, 
which has to be divided among the three institutions. The institutions do not own the 
premises where they are located, and this significantly affects the resources available for 
their functioning.  
</p>
<p>81. The lack of adequate human and financial resources for the Attorney General&#8223;s 
Office has an adverse impact on the capacity of prosecutors to initiate criminal proceedings. 
This results in an extremely low conviction rate, and heightens the general feeling of 
impunity among the population. For instance, the Special Rapporteur was informed that, 
despite the Supreme Court decision about the Amnesty Law of 1993, the Attorney 
General&#8223;s Office has not yet initiated any investigation in relation to the crimes against 
humanity that occurred during the civil war. The Attorney General&#8223;s Office receives an 
annual allocation of 0.1 per cent of the GDP. In 2012, the previous Attorney General 
requested a budget allocation of US$ 73 million for 2013, but only received $35 million. In 
November 2012, there were 745 prosecutors to deal with over 140,000 criminal cases.  
</p>
<p>82. Insufficient budgetary allocation also affects the remuneration and the general 
conditions of service of prosecutors, as well as their initial and continuing legal and 
professional training. A study carried out by a special commission established by the 
Attorney General to assess the functioning of the public prosecution services showed that, 
in general terms, salaries of prosecutors are 30 per cent inferior to those received by judges 
and magistrates.18  
</p>
<p>83. According to the principle of &#8220;functional direction&#8221;, prosecutors supervise the 
National Civil Police in the investigation of crimes and collection of evidence. The Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that since the police operates under the authority of the Ministry of 
Justice and Public Security, this principle has at times been undermined when the police 
does not follow the prosecutors&#8223; orders in a timely manner, thus creating a lack of 
accountability for criminal investigations.  
</p>

Salvador, 2001). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the creation of specialized investigation units 
focused on organized crime (homicide, extortion, drug trafficking, money laundering). 
These units are assigned one or more prosecutors, which facilitates a closer coordination 
between the prosecutor and the police. However, the lack of adequate coordination between 
prosecutors and the National Civil Police and the limited technical capacity of the police to 
investigate crimes and collect evidence continue to contribute to a general feeling of 
impunity and lack of confidence in the institutions among the population.  
</p>
<p>85. Regarding this coordination, the Special Rapporteur would like to highlight the 
Executive Technical Unit of the Justice Sector (Unidad T&#233;cnica Ejecutiva del Sector 
Justicia-UTE), a body created with the aim of improving the coordination of activities 
among the different justice institutions through the management and provision of technical 
and administrative support. She is of the view that the work of the Unit, which is an 
institutional space for improving such coordination, should be better leveraged.19  
</p>
<p>86. With regard to the collection of evidence, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that 
the National Civil Police tend to rely mainly on witnesses to provide evidence of crimes 
and neglect the collection of scientific evidence, mainly because the vast majority of police 
officers lack the technical skills to collect such evidence. This tendency also contributes to 
the extremely low conviction rate existing in the country, since in many cases witnesses 
decide against providing evidence in courts for fear of retaliation against themselves or 
their families. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Access to justice 
</b></p>
<p>87. The Office of the Procurator-General plays a vital role in ensuring access to justice 
for those who are unable to defend their interests autonomously and in providing free legal 
assistance for persons who do not have sufficient financial means to defend their 
fundamental liberties and labour rights in courts. The right of access to legal assistance is a 
fundamental element of the right to a fair trial recognized, inter alia, in article 10 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 14 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights. The Special Rapporteur observes, however, that the annual 
budget of the Office of the Procurator-General &#8211; US$ 19.4 million in 2012 &#8211; is insufficient 
to enable the Office to carry out its institutional role.  
</p>
<p>88. Similar considerations apply with regard to the Office of the Procurator for the 
Defence of Human Rights. The Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction the efforts made 
by the Ombudsman to investigate complaints of human rights violations, provide assistance 
for victims and promote administrative or judicial remedies for the protection of human 
rights. Nevertheless, she considers that the annual budget of this institution, which 
amounted to US$ 8.3 million in 2012, is also not adequate to allow the Ombudsman to 
discharge his or her functions.20

</p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption in November 2010 of the law on 
violence against women,21 which represents another important step to promote, without 
discrimination, access to justice for women who are victims of violence. In her previous 
thematic report on gender and the administration of justice, the Special Rapporteur stressed 
that preventing all forms of sexual and gender-based violence constitutes a prerequisite for 
overcoming impunity and guaranteeing women&#8223;s equal access to courts and tribunals 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/17/30 and Corr.1, para. 34). In this regard, she would like to highlight the law&#8223;s 
provisions on criminal proceedings, which are aimed at guaranteeing the fundamental rights 
of victims of violence during criminal investigation and trial, as well as the measures to 
promote the participation of women in the administration of justice. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>90. Lawyers constitute a fundamental pillar for maintaining the rule of law and ensuring 
the effective protection of human rights. Lawyers also play an essential role in the right to 
justice, in access to justice and, especially, in the effective exercise of the right to defence. 
There are some 24,000 lawyers exercising the legal profession in El Salvador.  
</p>
<p>91. According to the Constitution, the Supreme Court is the institution empowered to 
authorize lawyers to exercise the legal profession and suspend them for violation of their 
professional duties or behaviours that render them unfit to discharge their duties in cases 
provided for by the law.  
</p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur considers that the overall control exercised by the Supreme 
Court on lawyers may hinder the free exercise of the legal profession, and in turn, have an 
adverse effect on the effective access to justice. She is of the view that the legal profession 
itself is best placed to determine its rules of admission, and should therefore be responsible 
for administering examinations and granting certificates to legal practitioners, as well as for 
adopting a code of ethics for the legal profession. In her view, disciplinary proceedings 
against lawyers should be brought before an impartial disciplinary committee established 
by the legal profession, and should be subject to an independent judicial review. 
</p>
<p>93. Since the establishment of the mandate, the importance of an organized legal 
profession has constantly been emphasized (see for example A/64/181). The Basic 
Principles on the Role of Lawyers state that lawyers are entitled to form and join self-
governing professional associations (principle 24). The aim of these organizations is 
twofold: safeguarding the professional interests of lawyers and protecting and strengthening 
the integrity and independence of the legal profession. It is the duty of State authorities to 
support the establishment and work of professional associations of lawyers without 
interfering in their activities. 
</p>
<p>94. There is no single bar association responsible for the regulation of the legal 
profession. Lawyers are free to form and join professional associations, and there are many 
associations created for the defence of their interests. The Federation of Lawyers&#8223; 
Associations of El Salvador comprises eight lawyers&#8223; associations in the country. However, 
since many professional organizations of lawyers are not part of the Federation, the Special 
Rapporteur is concerned that this institution may not be in a position to promote and protect 
the professional interests of all lawyers.  
</p>
<p>95. She is particularly concerned about the role that the Federation plays during the pre-
selection of candidates to the Supreme Court. According to information received, the 
</p>
<p>  
 21 Ley Especial Integral para una Vida Libre de Violencia para las Mujeres, Legislative Decree No. 520 
</p>
<p>of 25 November 2010. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>selection of candidates is not always merit-based, having regard to qualification, integrity, 
ability and efficiency. Furthermore, it appears that candidates who are members of the 
Federation have an advantage over candidates from other associations.   
</p>
<p><b> V. Capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur wishes to underline the importance of quality legal 
education, legal and professional training, including continuing and specialized training, 
and other kinds of capacity-building for all the actors of the judicial system (judges, 
prosecutors, public defenders and lawyers). Various stakeholders have expressed concern 
about the fact that legal education remains poor in the country, especially at the university 
level, and highlighted the need for reform of the legal education system. They have also 
informed the Special Rapporteur that existing training institutions do not have sufficient 
human, technical and financial resources to provide adequate training opportunities for 
those involved in the administration of justice. 
</p>
<p>97. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the introduction in 2001 of the Initial 
Programme for Judges (PFI), which had been established to provide initial professional 
training for candidates for judicial office. The two-year programme was organized and run by 
the Judicial Training School. She was informed that, despite its high quality, the programme 
had ceased to function.  
</p>
<p>98. Currently, in another training programme, each year 35 lawyers have access to the 
Judicial Training School through a competitive process. The Special Rapporteur is 
concerned that the limited financial resources available to the school have restricted 
training opportunities to a limited number of candidates for judicial office. She is also 
concerned about the lack of transparency in the selection of candidates. So far, none of the 
105 trainees who have graduated from the Judicial Training School has had access to the 
judicial career upon completion of their training course.  
</p>
<p>99. Similar considerations apply to the Training School for Prosecutors (Escuela de 
Capacitaci&#243;n Fiscal), established in 2010 to provide initial training for candidates to the 
prosecutorial service and continuing and specialized training for prosecutors and 
administrative officers of the Attorney General&#8223;s Office. The Special Rapporteur was 
informed that the School does not have its own budget, and relies almost entirely on 
technical cooperation from international organizations and institutions to carry out its 
training activities. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> The Special Rapporteur would like to commend El Salvador for its efforts in 
building a democracy since the Chapultepec Peace Accords of 1992, which set the 
</b></p>
<p><b>basis for the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary, essential 
</b></p>
<p><b>prerequisites to the rule of law. 
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> Although relevant reforms have been undertaken in the framework of the 
Peace Accords, the current reality presents several new challenges as regards 
</b></p>
<p><b>strengthening the independence and impartiality of the judicial system in practice. 
</b></p>
<p><b>One of these challenges is related to the need to respect and observe the independence 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the judiciary. The institutional crisis between the Supreme Court of Justice and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Legislative Assembly is an example of how the judicial system has become politicized. 
</b></p>
<p><b>This affects the role of the key actors of the judiciary in combating impunity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights violations. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>102.<b> Further reforms are necessary to eliminate any improper interference with the 
judiciary. Such reforms are essential to strengthen the proper functioning of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>administration of justice system, the institutional and functional independence and 
</b></p>
<p><b>impartiality of judges and prosecutors and the free exercise of the legal profession by 
</b></p>
<p><b>lawyers.  
</b></p>
<p><b> VII. Recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> The Special Rapporteur wishes to make the following recommendations with a 
view to contributing to the development of an independent, impartial and effective 
</b></p>
<p><b>system of administration of justice. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Judicial independence 
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> All State institutions should respect and observe the independence of the 
judiciary. Interference and threats to the institutional independence of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be assessed and addressed as a matter of urgency.  
</b></p>
<p>105.<b> National authorities should comply with, and implement in good faith, the 
decisions of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Supreme Court of Justice 
</b></p>
<p>106.<b> The Supreme Court of Justice should direct its efforts to its judicial functions, 
thus refraining from taking care of administrative procedures that can be delegated 
</b></p>
<p><b>or transferred to other institutions. 
</b></p>
<p>107.<b> The Supreme Court should assess how its budget could be better managed to 
ensure that human and financial resources are duly allocated to the entire judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>system to improve the effectiveness and speedy functioning of its jurisdictional 
</b></p>
<p><b>competence. 
</b></p>
<p>108.<b> The Constitutional Chamber has the exclusive authority to decide whether an 
issue submitted for its decision is within its competence. State institutions should 
</b></p>
<p><b>refrain from interpreting the decisions of the Constitutional Chamber with a view to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ascertaining whether they were consistent with the mandate entrusted to it by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Constitution. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Procedure for the appointment of judges and magistrates 
</b></p>
<p>109.<b> The appointment of judges and magistrates should follow objective criteria that 
are clearly defined in the rules and procedure of appointment. Such criteria should 
</b></p>
<p><b>require that persons selected for judicial office be individuals of integrity and ability 
</b></p>
<p><b>with appropriate training or qualifications in law.  
</b></p>
<p>110.<b> The Legislative Assembly should consider reviewing the procedure for the 
selection and appointment of magistrates of the Supreme Court, in order to avoid any 
</b></p>
<p><b>risk of appointments for improper motives. 
</b></p>
<p>111.<b> Transparency and public scrutiny shall guide the selection process of 
magistrates of the Supreme Court of Justice through public hearings with citizens, 
</b></p>
<p><b>non-governmental organizations and other interested parties to scrutinize the 
</b></p>
<p><b>independence, competencies and integrity of the candidates.  
</b></p>
<p>112.<b> The selection and appointment of judges and magistrates of lower courts 
should be transferred to an independent authority, such as the National Council of the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/23/43/Add.1  
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>Judiciary, and should be based on objective criteria in order to avoid improper 
</b></p>
<p><b>interference. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  National Council of the Judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>113.<b> In order to strengthen the independence of the National Council of the Judiciary: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Its composition should be reviewed, so as to ensure that the majority of 
</b></p>
<p><b>members are judges and magistrates. The presidency of the Council should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>exercised by a magistrate or judge; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The procedure of appointment of counsellors should be reviewed so as to 
</b></p>
<p><b>eliminate interferences from political parties and economic groups in the election of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the counsellors. The criteria to select the counsellors should also be reviewed to ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that candidates possess the qualifications, integrity, ability and efficiency required to 
</b></p>
<p><b>perform their tasks; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The judiciary and other parties directly linked with the justice system 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be given a more prominent role with respect to selecting and appointing the 
</b></p>
<p><b>counsellors. Public hearings of candidates should be held to guarantee the fairness, 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparency and independence of the procedure. 
</b></p>
<p>114.<b> The National Council of the Judiciary could assess the possibility of re-
introducing the Initial Programme for Judges (PFI) training. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Judicial career 
</b></p>
<p>115.<b> The security of tenure of judges and magistrates should be guaranteed through 
the adoption of all appropriate measures. 
</b></p>
<p>116.<b> The selection of candidates for the positions of judges and magistrates must be 
based on merit alone and undertaken through competitive examinations conducted at 
</b></p>
<p><b>least partly in a written and anonymous manner.  
</b></p>
<p>117.<b> Objective criteria for designation, nomination, transfer and promotion of 
judges and magistrates, such as ability, productivity, integrity and experience, should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be developed and implemented. The final decisions on promotions should be taken by 
</b></p>
<p><b>an independent body in charge of the selection of judges.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Disciplinary proceedings 
</b></p>
<p>118.<b> The current regime for disciplinary measures against judges and magistrates 
should be reviewed, so as to ensure that judges are dismissed or suspended solely on 
</b></p>
<p><b>serious grounds of misconduct or incompetence and in accordance with fair 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures ensuring objectivity and impartiality. Appropriate procedures should also 
</b></p>
<p><b>be established to allow for an independent review of the decisions in disciplinary 
</b></p>
<p><b>proceedings.  
</b></p>
<p>119.<b> The responsibility for disciplining judges and magistrates should lie with an 
independent body or mechanisms, such as the National Council of the Judiciary 
</b></p>
<p><b>(reviewed in accordance with the recommendations above). The procedure before 
</b></p>
<p><b>such a body must be in compliance with the due process and fair trial guarantees.  
</b></p>
<p><b>  The Public Ministry 
</b></p>
<p>120.<b> Adequate budgetary resources should be allocated to the Attorney General of 
the Republic, the Procurator-General of the Republic and the Procurator for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Defence of Human Rights (Ombudsman), so as to enable them to carry out their 
</b></p>
<p><b>constitutional mandates. </b></p>

<p>121.<b> The term of office of the chief of each of the three organizations should be

</b></p>
<p>124.<b> The State should investigate all grave human rights violations that occurred 
during the civil war.  
</b></p>
<p>125.<b> Training opportunities should be organized for both prosecutors and police 
officers on the collection of scientific evidence. 
</b></p>
<p>126.<b> The possibility of creating a judicial investigative police under the direct

<p><b>  Lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>128.<b> One autonomous professional organization should be established to represent 
the interests of lawyers, promote their continuing education and training and protect 
</b></p>

<p>129.<b> The administrative functions currently exercised by the Supreme Court with 
regard to the registration, suspension and rehabilitation of lawyers should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>transferred to such independent professional organization.

<p>130.<b> A code of ethics, applicable to all lawyers in the country, should be adopted.
