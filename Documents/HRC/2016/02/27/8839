<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its sixth session from 30 
November to 11 December 2009. The review of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
Korea (DPRK) was held at the 11th meeting on 7 December 2009. The delegation of DPRK 
was headed by H.E. Mr. Ri Tcheul, Ambassador and Permanent Representative DPRK 
Mission in Geneva. At its 16th meeting held on 9 December 2009, the Working Group 
adopted the present report on DPRK.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of DPRK: Mexico, Norway, and South Africa. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of DPRK: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with

Rights (OHCHR), in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/6/PRK/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR, in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/6/PRK/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, Canada, Czech Republic, 
Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, Norway, the Republic of Korea, the 
Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland was transmitted to DPRK through the troika. These questions are available on the 
extranet of the Working Group.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of DPRK stated that it appreciated this opportunity to participate in 
the sixth session of the Working Group.. As is known, at the Human Rights Council and the 
General Assembly the human rights situation of DPRK has been singled out for discussion 
every year out of purposes and motives irrelevant to genuine human rights, resulting in the 
adoption of the unjust &#8220;resolutions&#8221;. DPRK neither recognize nor accept such &#8220;resolutions&#8221;, 
and categorically reject them as the extreme manifestation of politicization, selectivity and 
double standards in the area of human rights.  
</p>
<p>6. However, DPRK has come to this session as it values the universal periodic review 
mechanism, which is impartially treating all United Nations Member States with different 
ideologies and systems, cultures and traditions. DPRK hopes that this session will serve as 
an excellent occasion for the international community to adopt a cooperative approach with 
a view to correctly understanding and impartially assessing the human rights ideas and 
policies DPRK people have chosen and the prevailing reality of the country.  
</p>
<p>7. DPRK has consistently maintained the principle of prioritizing human rights and 
honouring the United Nations Charter and the international human rights instruments. Its 
history has been the history of struggle to safeguard genuine human rights of its people.  </p>


<p>8. Immediately after the liberation from colonial rule in 1945, DPRK laid down a 
framework for establishing a democratic judiciary, instituted and promulgated the Decrees 
on Land Reform, Nationalization of Industries, Labour, and on Sex Equality, and carried 
out democratic elections.  
</p>
<p>9. DPRK honourably safeguarded its system and dignity in the three-year war imposed 
by foreign forces just five years after the country&#8217;s liberation. After the war, which turned 
everything to ashes, DPRK took active steps to raise the people&#8217;s deteriorated material and 
cultural living standard to the pre-war level. Its Government, even during the hard time of 
the war, effected human rights policies including through enforcing universal medical care 
and taking steps for the relief of war victims. 
</p>
<p>10. The Government laid foundation for ensuring, to a greater extent, the enjoyment by 
people of their human rights in material and cultural life, which, in the 1980s reached a 
heyday in the country&#8217;s economic power and people&#8217;s living. However, dissolution of 
socialist market in the early 1990s and consequences of natural disasters that hit our 
country repeatedly from the mid 1990s negatively affected economic and cultural rights in 
general.  
</p>
<p>11. It was also at this time that military pressure and threats of aggression by hostile 
forces reached an extreme, compelling DPRK people to choose whether to &#8220;defend their 
independent lives or fall into slavery&#8221;. They have made tireless efforts in hearty response to 
the <i>Songun</i> leadership of the great General KIM JONG IL, and as a result the country 
acquired a strong war deterrent that can firmly safeguard their human rights system.  
</p>
<p>12. Today DPRK people, with ever more heightened honour and pride, are working 
devotedly to make the country an economic power and to guarantee the effective enjoyment 
of their human rights in economic, social and cultural sectors.  
</p>
<p>13. The DPRK is a socialist State guided by the great <i>Juche</i> idea, the essence of which is 
that people are the masters of everything and decide everything. Its sovereignty resides in 
the workers, peasants, servicepersons intellectuals and all other working people. The legal 
system that has embodied the <i>Juche</i> idea stipulates democratic rights and duties, as well as 
guarantees, ways and means for their realization.  
</p>
<p>14. Every individual citizen is entitled to enjoy human rights and the State is obliged to 
ensure those rights-this is one of the important features of the system for the protection and 
promotion of human rights in our country.  
</p>
<p>15. The Government of DPRK will in the near future create a firm guarantee for the 
ensuring on a higher standard of a more affluent and civilized life for its people, their 
human rights and fundamental freedoms.  
</p>
<p>16. Finally, the delegation noted it will participate in the interactive dialogue in a 
constructive and sincere approach, convinced that it will serve as an occasion to facilitate 
understanding of the human rights situation of DPRK.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>17. Fifty-two countries took the floor during the interactive dialogue. A number of 
countries recognized the significant achievements by DPRK in the fields of health, 
education, gender equality. The decision of the Government to actively participate in the 
universal periodic review process was welcomed, as was the decision to engage in a 
dialogue with the Committee on the Rights of the Child. The Government was encouraged 
to intensify its efforts with a view to achieve the MDGs by 2015. A number of natural 
disasters, which consecutively hit the country in the nineties, gravely affected the economic </p>


<p>situation in addition to the loss of human life. Recommendations made during the 
interactive dialogue appear in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>18. Brazil considered DPRK&#8217;s participation in the UPR as an important step. It believes 
that through improved cooperation and genuine dialogue, including with Special 
Procedures, the UN and the international community would be able to assist the DPRK. 
Brazil asked about internal challenges to the promotion and protection of human rights and 
remained concerned about allegations of executions in political detention camps and the 
disparities in public distribution of food. Brazil hoped that DPRK authorities would 
reestablish full-fledged investigations on the abduction of Japanese nationals  
</p>
<p>19. Japan noted certain positive steps undertaken by DPRK such as engaging in 
dialogue with the Committee on the Rights of the Child and cooperating with UNICEF to 
improve health situation and quality education for children. Japan expressed its regret that 
DPRK did not fully respond to the various concerns of international community including 
punishment against those citizens expelled or returned from abroad, public executions, the 
abduction issue and the issue of detention facilities. Japan was also concerned about those 
who are suffering. 
</p>
<p>20. The Republic of Korea noted the recent positive efforts of DPRK to engage with the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child and to stipulate in the Constitution that the State shall 
respect and protect human rights. However, it remained concerned about the detention in 
political prison camps and violations of the freedoms of movement, expression, thought and 
religion; a huge gap between the recognition of human rights in legal codes and their actual 
implementation, and the situations of separated families, prisoners of war and abductees. It 
urged the Government to take all necessary measures at the grassroots level to uphold 
human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Constitution and domestic laws as 
well as in human rights treaties such as ICCPR, ICESCR, CEDAW and CRC, to which 
DPRK is a party. It strongly encouraged the Government to accept the technical assistance 
offered by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>21. Cuba noted that the imposition of a Special Rapporteur and the political 
manipulation vis &#224; vis DPRK does not lead to cooperation and dialogue. DPRK is a 
developing country, victim of imperialistic aggressive policies, and recurring natural 
disasters. DPRK works to consolidate a socialist and just society, which guarantees equality 
and social justice. Cuba highlighted, inter alia, the existence of a universal and free health 
system, the elimination of illiteracy and access to education for all. 
</p>
<p>22. The United States of America was concerned by reports on allegations of 
extrajudicial execution, torture, systematic deprivation of due process and of forced labour. 
It referred to the lack of remedies or transparent accountability in dealing with allegations 
of abuse and expressed concern about reports of violence against women. Urging DPRK to 
grant access to the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in DPRK, it 
enquired about efforts to deal with these issues.  
</p>
<p>23. Belgium noted the recent inclusion of human rights in the Constitution, but 
remained concerned by reports on the situation of political prisoners and the conditions of 
detention. It asked what mechanisms of control exist to ensure human conditions of 
detention specifically in camps of political prisoners. It asked about specific measures taken 
to combat food shortages. 
</p>
<p>24. Algeria requested more information about the <i>Juche</i> concept. It welcomed efforts to 
promote the right to education, which have allowed achieving the MDG for primary 
education for all. Algeria referred to difficulties in realizing the right to food, including for 
children suffering from malnutrition, due to natural disasters, famine and appeal the 
international community to provide DPRK population with food assistance.  </p>


<p>25. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela noted that DPRK has an index of 100 per 
cent of children attending primary school, compulsory, universal and free of charge, and at 
secondary school, eradicating completely the illiteracy in the country. 
</p>
<p>26. Pakistan noted that DPRK is party to core human rights instruments and that its 
Constitution guarantees full enjoyment of human rights. Pakistan appreciated the system of 
ensuring full access to health and education services, the strong emphasis on human rights 
education and the commitment to international cooperation on human rights through 
cooperative dialogue. 
</p>
<p>27. Belarus welcomed the determination of DPRK to achieve progressive realisation of 
material and cultural well-being of its nation. Belarus commended the efforts of DPRK in 
ensuring the principle of universal access to medical services and education. Belarus found 
it important that DPRK has continued its efforts to ensure food security in the country. 
</p>
<p>28. Turkey believed that acceding to CAT and cooperating with special procedures, 
including the Special Rapporteur on DPRK, will help the authorities address some 
shortcomings. Turkey shared the Secretary-General&#8217;s recommendation that DPRK extend 
free and full access to United Nations agencies and other humanitarian actors and asked 
about DPRK&#8217;s views on measures to enable it to benefit from OHCHR technical assistance. 
</p>
<p>29. Malaysia noted with encouragement the Government&#8217;s concerted efforts aimed to 
build a progressive and prosperous nation by 2012. It also encouraged DPRK to extend its 
engagement with the international community to address the many challenges it faces with 
a view to improve the overall human rights situation in the country.  
</p>
<p>30. The Syrian Arab Republic commended efforts to protect and promote all human 
rights and noted that the complete and universal free medical care and education and the 
law on gender equality show that DPRK is on the right track to achieve development 
despite illegal sanctions imposed on it. 
</p>
<p>31. Thailand noted that the Constitution contains provisions on human rights and that 
some domestic laws and policies have been adopted to protect specific groups. Health care 
and education are central parts of the social policies. It encouraged the country to do its 
utmost to address human rights and humanitarian concerns with a view to improving the 
well-being of its people. 
</p>
<p>32. France asked about reasons for imposing criminal sanctions on people who try to 
leave the country and about the number of persons condemned to death and executed over 
the last three years. France noted that freedom of expression is limited and systematically 
violated and enquired about the number of persons incarcerated for political reasons. It 
hoped that the right to food for the entire population be ensured. 
</p>
<p>33. Australia noted DPRK&#8217;s engagement with CRC, the drafting of a 2008-2010 work 
programme for persons with disabilities and cooperation with the UNFPA as positive 
developments. However, it remained disappointed by the Government&#8217;s refusal to engage 
with many other aspects of the United Nations system and the international community. 
</p>
<p>34. Sri Lanka enquired about the four unique characteristics of human rights mentioned 
in the national report and hoped that international mechanisms, based on mutual respect, 
domestic requirements and understanding, would facilitate DPRK efforts to enhance an 
environment conducive to continued improvement of human rights.  
</p>
<p>35. Myanmar welcomed efforts to attain the goal to build an economic power by 2012. 
Myanmar commended DPRK for tangible progress in ensuring the rights to education and 
health. It asked DPRK to further elaborate on the realization of universal free education at 
primary level. Myanmar encouraged DPRK to share lessons learned from its experience in 
training medical personnel. </p>


<p>36. Nicaragua highlighted DPRK&#8217;s legal and institutional framework which guarantees 
fundamental human rights to its citizens. It encouraged DPRK to continue strengthening the 
system of promotion and protection of human rights, in observance of the principles 
enshrined in the Charter and international human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p>37. The United Kingdom noted with concern the range of grave human rights problems 
raised in the stakeholders report. It inquired about the right to a fair trial and the prohibition 
of torture and about the ways to address the shortage of medicines.  
</p>
<p>38. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya mentioned that the Constitution guaranteed the respect 
of human rights and the necessity to take measures to that end and that the national report 
referred to the objective of achieving equality and dignity for all. 
</p>
<p>39. Mexico acknowledged progress achieved on health, education and gender equality in 
employment, despite the many challenges stemming from the deterioration of the economy, 
natural disasters and food scarcity. Mexico enquired about measures adopted to follow up 
on alleged of enforced disappearances and abductions. 
</p>
<p>40. The Islamic Republic of Iran noted the measures taken particularly in the field of 
economic, social and cultural rights and encouraged DPRK to intensify its efforts to 
achieve the MDGs. It recommended that the international community help DPRK to secure 
adequate food for its people. It noted with interest the special attention paid to improving 
the situation of women and children. 
</p>
<p>41. The delegation of DPRK noted that the Constitution provides in article 67 that 
citizens have the freedom of assembly, demonstration and association, and the State shall 
provide conditions for the free activities of democratic political parties and social 
organizations. Assemblies and demonstrations are permitted regardless of their forms and 
purposes unless they are contrary to the democratic principle and public order. 
</p>
<p>42. Freedom of opinion and expression are also constitutional rights. No civil servant or 
law enforcement official can restrict or suppress these rights. Any slight manifestation of 
restriction or persecution of these rights may invite public criticism or denunciation, and in 
serious cases, lead to legal punishment. 
</p>
<p>43. The Constitution provides in article 68 that citizens have freedom of religious belief, 
and these rights are granted by the State by approving the setting up of religious buildings 
and holding of religious ceremonies. The State treats all religions equally and does not 
interfere in the setting up and operating of religious buildings, nor in the organization of 
religious bodies and their activities. Citizens are free to believe in religion of their choice.  
</p>
<p>44. On alleged classifying people into categories and practicing discrimination, the 
Constitution provides in article 65 that citizens have equal rights in all fields of State and 
public life. Such practices are inconceivable. No one is privileged or particularly 
disadvantaged in their access to material and cultural conditions. 
</p>
<p>45. On the issue of &#8220;political prisoners&#8217; camps&#8221;, the delegation noted that freedoms of 
speech, press, assembly and demonstration and freedom of religious belief are the 
fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Exercising the rights to such freedom 
can never be criminalized. Thoughts and political views are not something that can be 
controlled by the law. The term &#8220;political prisoner&#8221; does not exist in DPRK&#8217;s vocabulary, 
and therefore the so-called political prisoners&#8217; camps do not exist. There are reform 
institutions, which are called prisons in other countries. Those who are sentenced to the 
penalty of reform through labour for committing anti-State crimes or other crimes 
prescribed in the Criminal Law serve their terms at the reform institutions. 
</p>
<p>46. Regarding the relations between <i>Songun</i> politics and enjoyment of economic, social 
and cultural rights, DPRK is pursuing the <i>Songun</i> politics to safeguard the supreme </p>


<p>interests of the State and secure firm guarantee for the safeguarding of the life and well-
being of its people. <i>Songun</i> politics also makes great contributions to the economic 
development and the improving of people&#8217;s living.  
</p>
<p>47. On specific measures the Government is taking to secure sufficient food for the 
population, the t DPRK has limited arable land, with 80 per cent of its land made up of 
mountainous areas. Moreover, the consecutive natural disasters during the past several 
years stood in the way of providing sufficient food to our people. The Government gave top 
priority to the solution of food problem, took a series of practical measures and put a lot of 
efforts into their implementation. The food aid provided by different countries and 
international organizations over the years greatly encouraged people in their efforts for the 
solution of food shortage. DPRK will, in the near future, meet the domestic demands for 
food on its own. 
</p>
<p>48. On the access to the sites of assistance by international aid agencies, the delegate 
noted that the principle of &#8220;no access, no aid&#8221; is a commonly recognized universal principle 
in cooperation activities of the international organizations including specialized agencies of 
the United Nations. In accordance with this principle, the Government has provided all 
necessary arrangements including on-site visits for the aid agencies operating in the country 
and will do so, in the future, too. 
</p>
<p>49. On cooperation with Special Rapporteur and other international human rights 
bodies,<b> </b>the delegation noted that the human rights situation of DPRK is selectively tabled 
and discussed every year at the Human Rights Council and General Assembly, resulting in 
the adoption of the unjust &#8220;resolution&#8221; thereon. The Special Rapporteur on DPRK 
mandated by the &#8220;resolution&#8221; also continues to present reports that decry the DPRK system 
and policies based on distorted information. For these reasons, DPRK totally rejects the 
&#8220;resolution&#8221; and does not accept the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. The DPRK will, in 
the future, too, reject the confrontational &#8220;resolution&#8221; and politicization of human rights and 
will strive to make genuine dialogue and cooperation a reality. It will also faithfully 
implement its obligations under the international human rights instruments, and thus do 
everything to ensure that its people enjoy full range of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms under any circumstances. 
</p>
<p>50. On accession to the international human rights instruments, the delegate noted that 
the greatest obstacle here is the selectivity and double standard applied continuously to the 
country on the United Nations human rights arena. However, it does not mean that DPRK is 
opposed to the purposes and requirements of the international human rights instruments. 
Although DPRK is not yet a party to several human rights instruments including the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Convention against Torture, 
their requirements are, in fact, incorporated in the national laws and implemented. Once the 
obstacles are removed and appropriate conditions and circumstances provided, DPRK will 
voluntarily accede to the conventions and protocols, not upon any request. 
</p>
<p>51. Viet Nam acknowledged efforts for the protection of the rights of women, children, 
persons with disability and the elderly, and the guarantee of health and education. Vietnam 
expressed readiness to share its experience with DPRK related to the cooperation with 
international community to solve humanitarian issues and development of agriculture and 
the guarantee of food security. 
</p>
<p>52. China appreciated that the Constitution and laws provide for respect for human 
rights. It noted that the protection and promotion of human rights are priority tasks of 
various State organs. DPRK has good educational and health-care systems and strategies 
are in place for the attainment of the MDGs. China called on the international community 
to provide humanitarian development assistance and support efforts of the Government to 
develop economy and improve peoples&#8217; life. </p>


<p>53. Zimbabwe noted the strides to improve the overall standards of living. DPRK has 
faced a number of challenges in implementing some of the rights, mainly due to some 
global economic and political factors. 
</p>
<p>54. Israel stressed that as a party to ICCPR, CRC, ICESCR and CEDAW, DPRK has an 
obligation to adhere to its international commitments and protect and promote human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>55. Indonesia enquired about plans of the Governments to accede to other core human 
rights instruments. Indonesia called upon DPRK to give due consideration to the legitimate 
concerns related to unresolved abduction cases, and in particular to speed up efforts to 
resolve them.  
</p>
<p>56. Norway recognized efforts on gender equality, child rights and legislative reforms. It 
noted that children face discrimination based on social origin and was concerned about 
State sanctioned extrajudicial activities. It appreciated that DPRK is a party to several 
human rights instruments and expressed deep concern about respect of the rights to freedom 
of opinion, expression, association and peaceful assembly. It enquired about legislative 
reforms, disparity in access to food, visits to detention facilities and the treatment of 
returnees.  
</p>
<p>57. Slovenia raised questions related to ratification of human rights treaties; plans for 
human rights education in schools, work place and legal community; human rights training 
for judiciary and law enforcement officials; the effect of the background of a child in access 
to education, food, health, jobs, marriage and party membership, measures for elimination 
of the use of forced abortions, measures for improvement of prison conditions. 
</p>
<p>58. Qatar noted that DPRK is a party to a number of human rights instruments, and 
hoped for more progress in the dialogue with the international community, on the basis of 
mutual respect. It encouraged DPRK to continue its efforts to promote and protect human 
rights, particularly economic and social rights, which will contribute to achieving the 
MDGs. 
</p>
<p>59. Yemen noted DPRK&#8217;s political will to achieve gender equality through legislation, 
free education for all, especially women and the provision of special services to women at 
the work place. DPRK is party to a number of international instruments. 
</p>
<p>60. Austria asked if the Government has any plans to effectively implement its 
obligations under the treaties it is party to. It was concerned by many reported cases of 
disappearances of political dissidents. 
</p>
<p>61. Germany requested information about how DPRK followed up on the measures 
urged by the Special Rapporteur on DPRK with regard to the consequences of the Korean 
War of 1950-1953, including the issues of missing persons and the reunification of families 
separated by the war. 
</p>
<p>62. Canada noted the emphasis placed on the provision of free universal medical care 
and welcomed the recent revision of the Constitution. Canada expressed concerns regarding 
to the overall lack of basic freedoms in DPRK and the humanitarian situation, in particular 
the chronic food shortage and inadequate access to safe drinking water. 
</p>
<p>63. The Netherlands expressed concerns related to reports on the possible use of torture, 
including inhuman condition of detention, public executions, extrajudicial and arbitrary 
detention, the absence of due process and the imposition of the death penalty for political 
and religious reasons. It was concerned about the safety and well being of nationals who 
have returned to the country, and food security of the population. 
</p>
<p>64. Chile expressed concern about reported extrajudicial executions carried out in public 
and in detention camps, discrimination in access to education, practice of forced labour and </p>


<p>violence against women. It was concerned about kidnappings and enforced disappearance 
of individuals.  
</p>
<p>65. The Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic noted progress in promoting economic, 
social and cultural rights and in addressing food security. It hoped that the Government will 
continue to fulfil its tasks of eradication of poverty and improving food security. 
</p>
<p>66. Sweden noted the cooperation of DPRK with the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child and collaboration with UNICEF and WHO to improve children&#8217;s health and 
education. Sweden expressed concerns regarding reports on forced labour, severe limits to 
freedom of information and reported restrictions to small-patch farming. 
</p>
<p>67. Italy was concerned about reports on public and extrajudicial executions and 
persecution for practicing a religion. It expressed concerns about reports of forced labour, 
very often involving children, despite the law prohibiting forced or compulsory labour and 
criminalizing child labour. 
</p>
<p>68. Ireland stressed that there is a genuine alarm at the extent of human suffering caused 
by human rights violations in DPRK. The Human Rights Council and the United Nations 
have the responsibility to continue paying close attention to these issues. It requested 
information about administration of justice issues and expressed a concern about 
persecution for practicing religion.  
</p>
<p>69. India noted that DPRK was commended by some treaty-bodies for its policy of 
providing 11 years of free compulsory education and its primary health care strategy. 
Concerns have been expressed about the quality of education, the severe impact of 
malnutrition on children, and the shortages and disparities in access to food. India requested 
information about plans to establish a national human rights institution, making easier 
travel abroad, and regular reunions of separated families. 
</p>
<p>70. Poland enquired about measures to secure the full enjoyment of the religious 
freedom. It referred to the existence of a large number of prison camps, the extensive use of 
forced labour and the harsh conditions imposed by the criminal justice system, giving rise 
to a plethora of abuses.  
</p>
<p>71. New Zealand expressed concerns about restrictions on freedoms of religion, 
expression, peaceful assembly and association, the right to privacy, equal access to 
information and the right to take part in the conduct of public affairs. The situation in 
labour camps, the incarceration of dissidents and their families and the continued use of 
torture, including public executions were matters of concern. It called on DPRK to work 
constructively with the Special Rapporteur on DPRK to help resolve human rights issues 
together. 
</p>
<p>72. Palestine noted that the Constitution guarantees full enjoyment of human rights to all 
citizens and that knowledge of human rights of the general public is high. Palestine 
appreciated the system of ensuring full access to health and education services and the 
commitment to international cooperation on human rights through positive dialogue. 
</p>
<p>73. Philippines noted achievements in education and women&#8217;s participation in 
economic, political, social and cultural life. Philippines enquired about the further plans to 
promote gender equality and the rights of women, and establish a national human rights 
institution. 
</p>
<p>74. Nigeria was encouraged that the Constitution provides protection of human rights. It 
was concerned on alleged human rights violations and hoped that the Government would 
address them. It supported the initiative of direct engagement by all to assist the 
government providing the enabling environment for the full enjoyment of human rights. </p>


<p>75. Spain mentioned that the Secretary-General noted with concern that the Government 
has not taken any significant initiative to end the systematic human rights violations. It 
requested information regarding practical measures to put an end to the early militarization 
of children in schools. 
</p>
<p>76. Lithuania made recommendations on implementation of international obligations, 
cooperation with international organisations on human rights, protection of rights of 
children and women, and death penalty. 
</p>
<p>77. Greece enquired about measures to ensure women&#8217;s rights and address the problem 
of violence against women, to ensure citizens&#8217; right to movement and to give access to the 
Special Rapporteur on DPRK and WFP. 
</p>
<p>78. Switzerland called upon the Government to undertake the implementation of 
international standards, put an end to human rights violations and prosecute those 
responsible for such abuses. It invited DPRK to cooperate actively with the international 
community. It noted restrictions on freedom of movement. It also indicated that the state 
distribution system is not in a position to guarantee acceptable living conditions for the 
population. 
</p>
<p>79. Hungary noted the importance of cooperation with OHCHR and enquired about 
plans to cooperate with United Nations mechanisms. It was concerned about restrictions on 
freedoms of religion and expression, the right to free access to information and freedom of 
movement. It considered that the DPRK failed to implement treaty bodies&#8217; 
recommendations and regretted that the family reunification process was stopped. 
</p>
<p>80. On establishing an independent human rights mechanism,<b> </b>the delegation<b> </b>noted that 
in DPRK much of the work for the protection and promotion of human rights are the 
responsibilities of the people&#8217;s committees at all levels, which are the people&#8217;s power 
organs. Dealing with complaints and petitions fairly are one of the functions of the people&#8217;s 
committees. The functions of the people&#8217;s power organs for the protection and promotion 
of human rights are not in conflict with the Paris Principle. However, DPRK will pay due 
attention to the establishing of independent human rights mechanism and conduct in-depth 
study in this regard.  
</p>
<p>81. On the issue of separated families, prisoners of war and abductions, the delegate 
noted that the Government of DPRK has consistently put forward initiatives and made 
sincere efforts to relieve the pains of the families and their relatives.  In particular, 
following the inter-Korean summit meeting on 15 July, 2000, reunions and video meetings 
of the separated families and relatives have been arranged scores of times. The issue of 
prisoners of war was already settled at the time of exchange of prisoners of war in 
accordance with the Armistice Agreement, and the issue of abduction does not exist. 
Solution of all problems between the north and the south lies in faithfully translating the 
June 15th Joint Declaration and the October 4th Declaration into reality in the spirit of &#8220;by 
our nation itself&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>82. The delegation<b> </b>commented on the concerns expressed about women and children 
suffering from continued malnutrition and in particular about violence against women and 
children. The country suffered from serious economic difficulties starting from the mid-
1990s, causing serious deterioration of the people&#8217;s health, in particular women and 
children. Supply of nutritious foods, nutritional and medical care, significantly improved 
the situation from the early 2000s. The issue of serious malnutrition is a thing of the past.  
Regarding the alleged forced enrolment of children in quasi-military organizations, the 
delegation stated that Children&#8217;s Unions are autonomous organizations of children aged 9 
to 13 through which children, with the help of their school administration board, arrange 
excursions, visits, field practices and other extracurricular activities. Allegations that DPRK 
conscripts children from and early age and militarizes them are very distorted information.  </p>


<p>83. On the issue of abduction of Japanese nationals, the delegation noted that on 17 
September 2002, DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration was adopted during the visit of the 
Japanese Prime Minister. In the declaration, DPRK side affirmed that it would take 
appropriate measures to prevent the recurrence of such unhappy issue. Thereafter, a special 
committee was formed, nationwide investigations were conducted and the result thereof 
was informed to the Japanese side. DPRK has faithfully fulfilled its obligations under the 
various DPRK-Japan agreements in the spirit of the Pyongyang Declaration, which resulted 
in the complete settlement of the abduction issue.  
</p>
<p>84. On the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, the delegation<b> </b>mentioned that 
the correct understanding of this issue can be provided through systematic interpretation of 
the relevant provisions of the Constitution of the DPRK, namely articles 11, 164, 166 and 
168.  The Central Court is held accountable before the Supreme People&#8217;s Assembly or the 
Presidium of the Supreme People&#8217;s Assembly not for the judicial proceedings, namely 
hearing of and passing judgement on cases, but for the administrative work related to 
justice, that is, recruitment and training of personnel and logistics. The Supreme People&#8217;s 
Assembly under no circumstances can get involved or interfere in the treatment of 
individual cases, that is, judiciary proceedings. With regard to the leadership of the ruling 
Workers&#8217; Party of Korea, its organizations can not operate outside the Constitution, as the 
Party itself exists within the State. The guidance of the Party over the judiciary is a policy 
guidance to ensure independence and law observance in the judicial activities.  
</p>
<p>85. On torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the delegate noted that 
Criminal Law of the DPRK in its article 253 defines as crimes such acts as interrogating 
persons by torture or other illegal methods and exaggerating or fabricating cases. The 
Criminal Procedures Law prohibits forcing a person to admit an offence by such coercive 
and conciliatory methods as torture or leading a statement, and provides that statements 
obtained by such methods are inadmissible as evidences. Any transgression of the 
regulations is liable to legal punishment of the person responsible. In DPRK, reform and 
detention facilities are operated by the people&#8217;s security organs, which were visited in the 
1990s by some international NGOs including Amnesty International and some Western 
personnel.  
</p>
<p>86. Regarding the cause of refugee outflows and &#8220;punishment&#8221; of people upon their 
return or repatriation, the delegate stated that the illegal border crossing in the northern 
border area of the country is, in nature, not the issue to be assessed in the light of the 1951 
Convention or 1967 Protocol on the Status of Refugees. In the mid-1990s the practices of 
illegal border crossing suddenly appeared due to economic reasons triggered by various 
factors. To cope with the situation, the government took a series of proactive measures. 
People&#8217;s power organs in the border areas conducted in-depth survey into the economically 
disadvantaged families and provided them with special support. In addition, the power 
organs made all necessary arrangements for the people to visit their relatives in the north-
eastern part of China upon their request.  
</p>
<p>87. Regarding women and human trafficking, the delegate welcomed international 
efforts to prevent and punish human trafficking and victims. DPRK strongly guard against 
the occurrence of such practices in the country. There are some people linked to outside 
forces seeking profit from human trafficking. DPRK is strongly against these practices and 
competent institutions are doing their best to identify and take necessary measures.  
</p>
<p>88. Regarding public executions, in some very exceptional cases, there are public 
executions for those criminals who committed very brutal violent crimes. These requests 
are often made by the families and relatives of the victims. In DPRK, death penalty is 
applied in very strictly limited crimes.  </p>


<p>89. On the alleged systematic violation of human rights, the delegate noted that, should 
anyone study the laws and regulations of DPRK, it would be clear that human rights 
violations are not systematic. This allegation is based on distorted facts or fabrication. 
Negative assessments of the human rights situation in DPRK are based on misinformation 
fabricated by those who betrayed their country.  
</p>
