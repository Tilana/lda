Exhibit 99.1
Energy Fuels Announces High-Grade Uranium Intercepts at Nichols Ranch ISR Project
LAKEWOOD, CO, Aug. 15, 2016 /CNW/ - Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE MKT: UUUU; TSX: EFR)
("Energy Fuels" or the "Company"), a leading producer of uranium in the United States, is
pleased to announce that it has intercepted several large and high-grade areas of mineralization
in the next wellfield expected to go into production at its Nichols Ranch ISR Project ("Nichols
Ranch") in Wyoming, USA.  On August 1, 2016, the Company began delineation drilling and the
installation of the wellfield to be associated with Header House 9 at Nichols Ranch.  Currently,
four rigs are being utilized to drill pilot holes, ream, case, and complete the injection and recovery
wells for this wellfield.  Header House 9 is expected to begin producing uranium later in 2016.
To date, a total of 52 holes in this new wellfield have been drilled.  Of the 52 holes, 46 have
encountered mineralization which is above the grade % x thickness ("GT") cut-off of 0.3.  This
includes one hole which encountered 5.0 feet of mineralization with an average grade of 2.40%
eU3O8.  In addition, many of the holes have encountered multiple intercepts above the GT cutoff. 
It is anticipated that a total of 120 wells will be incorporated into Header House 9.  The table
below contains data for the 10 best holes drilled to date in this wellfield:

* GT represents grade multiplied by the thickness and is calculated by multiplying eU3O8 grade
(in percent) by gamma anomaly thickness (in feet) as determined from down-hole radiometric
probing. For example, a drill hole that has 10 feet of 0.10% uranium mineralization has a GT of
1.0 and would be considered a good hole by ISR mining standards.

Stephen P. Antony, President and CEO of Energy Fuels stated:  "The drill results we are seeing
in the wellfield for Header House 9 at Nichols Ranch are very positive, and the uranium grades
and thicknesses are significantly exceeding expectations.  Indeed, it is quite rare to encounter
mineralization in U.S. ISR projects that have grades above 2.0% U3O8 and GT values above 10. 
Due to the size of the wellfield, expected number of wells, and the quality of mineralization we
are encountering, we expect this to be the largest and most productive portion of the wellfield at
Nichols Ranch to date.  Overall, the Nichols Ranch deposit continues to deliver results that
exceed our original expectations.  We look forward to producing uranium from this new wellfield
beginning later this year."
