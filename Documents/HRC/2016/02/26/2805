established to train members of the armed forces and, in some cases, the police. More than 
100,000 members of the armed forces have been trained through its courses. In 2010 and 
2011, curricular human rights training was imparted to some 460,000 participants, while 
318,000 benefited from extracurricular training activities.

service training include the role of values in public service, rights and duties of civil 
servants, codes of conduct and the principles of neutrality and non-discrimination. As

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The General Assembly, in resolution 59/113 A, launched the World Programme for 
Human Rights Education as a global initiative to advance the implementation of human 
rights education programmes in all sectors, structured in consecutive phases. The first phase 
(2005-2009) focused on integrating human rights education in primary and secondary 
school systems.  
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 12/4, the Human Rights Council focused the second phase 
(2010-2014) on human rights education in higher education and human rights training for 
teachers and educators, civil servants, law enforcement officials and military personnel. 
Pursuant to its mandate, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) prepared a draft plan of action (A/HRC/15/28) containing practical 
guidance for national implementation by Governments and other stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>3. In its resolution 15/11, the Human Rights Council adopted the above-mentioned 
plan of action and encouraged States to implement it. It recalled that Member States should 
also continue the implementation of human rights education in their school systems, as 
begun during the first phase, and requested OHCHR to prepare a progress report on the 
World Programme for submission in 2012.  
</p>
<p>4. In the present report, OHCHR outlines a range of national initiatives undertaken 
from January 2010 to May 2012 to implement human rights education in the 
above-mentioned sectors, as reported by Governments and national human rights 
institutions. It also describes related activities undertaken by OHCHR and other 
intergovernmental organizations from July 2011 to May 2012. International initiatives 
undertaken before July 2011 are included in the report of the Secretary-General on 
follow-up to the International Year of Human Rights Learning (A/66/225).  
</p>
<p>5. An important development that took place in the past year is the adoption by the 
General Assembly, in its resolution 66/137, of the United Nations Declaration on Human 
Rights Education and Training, which constitutes a new normative reference for the 
international community. 
</p>
<p><b> II. National initiatives reported by Governments and national 
human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>6. In February 2012, OHCHR circulated a note verbale inviting Member States to 
submit information on overall national strategies for implementing the plan of action for the 
second phase of the World Programme, and specific initiatives undertaken with regard to 
higher education, teachers and educators, civil servants, law enforcement officials and the 
military. As at 31 May 2012, information had been received from 34 Governments, 
including Member States&#8217; replies to a September 2011 letter from the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights. In February 2012, OHCHR also requested input from 
national human rights institutions on their related activities, in accordance with Human 
Rights Council resolution 15/11. As at 31 May 2012, 14 institutions had provided 
information. The list of respondents is found in the annex to the present report. 
</p>
<p>7. Reference is made herein to 45 countries; the material is organized thematically 
according to the target sectors of the second phase. Information from correspondence 
received after 31 May 2012 has not been included. While containing illustrative examples, 
the present report does not reflect all initiatives taking place worldwide. Furthermore, the 
information received has not been independently verified. Details of referenced national </p>


<p>initiatives can be found in the correspondence received by OHCHR, available on the web 
page dedicated to the World Programme, where a summary of information received on 
human rights education in the primary and secondary school systems and other areas 
beyond the second phase is also available.<footnote name="1">3 See www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/education/training/act.htm.  </footnote>    
</p>
<p><b> A. National focal points, strategies and plans of action  
</b></p>
<p>8. Various institutions have been designated to coordinate human rights education 
initiatives at the national level, depending on national institutional settings. For example, 
the Presidential Commission for Coordinating Executive Policy in the Field of Human 
Rights ensures the follow-up of the World Programme in Guatemala, while in Spain this 
role is played by the Office of the Deputy General for International Cooperation of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. In Australia, the Human Rights Policy Branch 
of the Attorney-General&#8217;s Department is responsible for a comprehensive range of human 
rights education activities. Two governmental agencies, the Discrimination Ombudsman 
and the Living History Forum, are tasked with enhancing human rights awareness in 
Sweden. In Switzerland, key institutions supported by the Government are the Service 
against Racism and the Foundation for Education and Development.<footnote name="2">7. Many countries include international human rights law in the training of their public 
servants, sometimes as a mandatory component (such as the Republic of Korea and 
Sweden). Basic human rights content is systematically included in the mandatory training 
for all civil servants in Slovenia, upon entry into service, and for senior managers in public 
administration. Dedicated institutions where human rights training is provided to State 
employees are, for example, the Central Officials Training Institute, the Judicial Research 
and Training Institute, and the Statistical Training Institute (Republic of Korea). The Civil 
Service Commission under the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan is responsible for 
the professional training of central and local Government officials concerning ethical 
conduct and their rights and duties as public servants. Citizens Advice Bureau officials in 
Mauritius have also received human rights training. 
</footnote> Divisions within 
ministries of education coordinate human rights education initiatives in Argentina (Office 
of the Under-Secretary for Equity and Education Standards), Georgia (General Education 
Development Division) and Thailand (Monitoring Committee of the World Programme for 
Human Rights Education, based in the Bureau of International Cooperation).  
</p>
<p>9. The first recommendation made in the World Programme plan of action was to 
review the status of human rights education, for example through a national baseline study. 
The Irish Human Rights Commission conducted in 2011 a comprehensive study giving an 
overview of human rights education in Ireland to provide a foundation for the development 
of a national action plan on human rights education.<footnote name="3">1. General vocational training for employees of State administration and Government 
service, programmed annually by the Human Resource Management Service of the 
Government of Serbia, introduces civil servants to notions of equal opportunities for all and 
gender equality, to the laws on civil servants and on the prohibition of discrimination, and 
to the Code of Conduct for Civil Servants. With UNICEF support, the Ministry of Health 
improved education of medical staff working with children and families in health 
institutions and focused on protecting children from abuse and neglect. The World Bank 
supported a project for training medical workers in the field of patients&#8217; rights.  
</footnote> In Slovenia, a governmental working 
group, comprising representatives of the ministries in charge of higher education, the public 
sector and foreign affairs, was tasked with mapping existing initiatives and gaps, and 
defining an implementation plan with possible measures for improving human rights 
education in the focus areas of the second phase.  
</p>
<p>10. The National Institute for Study and Action for Development in Education, under 
the Ministry of Education in Senegal, reported on a 2005 study of the situation concerning 
human rights education in the formal and non-formal education systems. Since 2008, 
efforts have been made to develop and pilot a plan of action for integrating human rights 
education into the Senegalese curricula for formal and informal education and related 
didactical tools, and to train education sector actors and ensure evaluation. The Swiss 
university network is mandated to carry out a national baseline study. Kyrgyzstan mentions 
a future study on human rights education to inform the development of new legislation and 
related steps.  
</p>
<p>11. Fewer States reported on existing overall strategies or plans of action for human 
rights education, often developed through collaborative efforts. For example, the Ministry 
of Education and Science of Armenia, assisted by the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP), formulated the National Plan of Action in the Area of Human Rights 
Education (2012-2015), which details activities for implementation concerning teachers and

<p>students. Developed with the support of OHCHR, the Colombian National Plan for Human 
Rights Education was launched in November 2009, followed by a decree institutionalizing 
the structures required to implement it. It was published and disseminated among 
Government institutions, civil servants, academic institutions and civil society 
organizations.<footnote name="4">6. In some countries, human rights training is a formal requirement for penitentiary 
staff. In Switzerland, for example, basic training of prison officials includes instruction on 
international human rights instruments and standards. In Monaco, draft guidelines define 
the duties and obligations of prison staff and appropriate training, taking into account the 
European Prison Rules. Training provided by the Educational Institute of the Prison Service 
in the Czech Republic reflects current applicable legal standards. In Germany, applicable 
United Nations and Council of Europe standards guide training programmes for prison 
officials and staff of psychiatric institutions.  
</footnote> Malta has plans of action against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
and related intolerance, and a plan of action promoting education for all. Japan&#8217;s Basic Plan 
for Human Rights Education and Encouragement, amended in 2011, includes training for 
public officials. 
</p>
<p>12. In Australia, human rights education is the centrepiece of the Human Rights 
Framework implemented by the Attorney-General&#8217;s Department since 2010.<footnote name="5">0. The Ministry of National Defence of Chile reports that the army, navy and air force 
include human rights content in training their members. The same is true in Colombia and 
the Republic of Korea, where human rights training has intensified in the armed forces 
since the 2008 Regulation on Human Rights Education in the Military. The Council for 
Human Rights Education in the Military convenes annual consultations on textbooks and 
training for the Ministry of National Defence in the Republic of Korea. In Azerbaijan, 
weekly humanitarian law lessons are taught to the armed forces in military units, 
formations and in special educational institutions. The Ministry of Defence of Armenia 
disseminates human rights information throughout the military to eliminate racial 
discrimination and xenophobia.  
</footnote> It aims to 
build a culture of respect for human rights as a responsibility of all Australians. In the 
Sudan, the Advisory Council for Human Rights under the Ministry of Justice has begun 
developing a national strategy on human rights education. Spain referred to its Strategic 
Plan for Citizenship and Integration 2011-2014. Switzerland&#8217;s National Plan for Education 
for Sustainable Development (2007-2014)6 comprises human rights and focuses on teacher 
training, supported by the Swiss Conference of Rectors of Universities of Teacher 
Education.  
</p>
<p>13. The National Human Rights Commission of Nigeria has a human rights education 
unit coordinating with various ministries, departments, agencies and civil society 
organizations on the National Action Plan for the Promotion and Protection of Human 
Rights in Nigeria. It also carries out public awareness and training activities for students 
and teachers at all levels, the military, civil servants, legislators, the private sector, oil and 
extractive industries, health-care workers and young people, among others. 
</p>
<p>14. The National Human Rights Commission of the Republic of Korea recommended in 
January 2012 that the Ministry of Justice should incorporate suggestions from the World 
Programme plan of action into the Human Rights National Action Plan, which is the basis 
for the National Human Rights Policy (2012-2016). In its own three-year plan for human 
rights promotion (2012-2014), the Commission plans to strengthen human rights education 
for selected target groups, revise school curricula, standardize teaching plans and make use 
of mass media.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Higher education 
</b></p>
<p>15. Several countries, including the Czech Republic, France, New Zealand, the Russian 
Federation and Slovenia, recalled the academic freedom enjoyed by their higher education 
institutions. Spain&#8217;s Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport is mapping the situation in 
the Spanish university system to identify areas for action. According to Spanish legislation, 
the design of new curricula follows the principle that respect and promotion of human 
rights should be encouraged in any professional activity.  
</p>
<p>16. Human rights are taught as an individual subject or as part of other related subjects, 
in particular law (in, for example, Azerbaijan, France, Ireland, Japan, Mauritius, the 
Republic of Moldova, Switzerland and the Sudan), political science (at, for example, 
institutes of political studies in France), international relations (Azerbaijan and Switzerland) 
and sustainable development (Switzerland), but also humanities/liberal arts (Japan) and at 
technical higher education institutions (Romania). In Germany, human rights education

<p>occurs in social sciences, humanities, philosophy, theology and health sciences. Georgian 
institutions teach subjects covering human rights protection and civic education. At Russian 
higher educational institutions, students are required to develop an understanding of the 
need to respect human rights in their professional lives. The Ministry of Education of the 
Republic of Moldova requested higher education institutions to have a framework course 
on human rights as an optional course in the social and humanistic component of the 
curricula. Extracurricular human rights activities are organized in cooperation with civil 
society.  
</p>
<p>17. Human rights research and graduate training are carried out in various Australian 
universities, including the Australian Centre for Human Rights Education (Royal 
Melbourne Institute of Technology) and the Centre for Human Rights Education (Curtin 
University of Technology). Swiss higher education institutions award master&#8217;s or doctoral 
</p>
<p>degrees in human rights, such as at the Graduate Institute of International and Development 
Studies, the Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights, and 
the University of Zurich Competence Center for Human Rights. In Spain, master&#8217;s degree 
programmes in human rights can be found at, for example, the University of Granada 
(master&#8217;s degree in culture of peace, conflicts, education and human rights). A Human 
Rights Chair exists at the University of Oran in Algeria. German university departments 
focusing on human rights education are the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Chair in Human Rights Education at Otto-von-Guericke 
University Magdeburg or the Chair in Human Rights and Human Rights Policies at the 
Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-N&#252;rnberg. In Germany, apart from formal 
instruction, seminars are often held on human rights themes and the theory and practice of 
human rights education. German higher institutions take part in international law 
competitions and engage in human rights research. Several German higher education 
institutions are also members of the Global Compact. 
</p>
<p>18. Human rights departments exist in numerous Russian higher education institutions, 
including the Moscow State Pedagogical University and the Moscow State Institute of 
International Relations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Perm State Pedagogical 
University and the Education Workers&#8217; Academy for Training and Continuous 
</p>
<p>Development offer courses and seminars on the theory of and methods for teaching human 
rights in schools, while similar courses have been held in other regions of the country. 
OHCHR supported the establishment of an international master&#8217;s degree in human rights in 
2009 by a group of Russian universities, assisted by an inter-institutional resource centre at 
the People&#8217;s Friendship University of Russia.  
</p>
<p>19. While few countries referred to specific higher education policies for human rights 
education, several references were made to provisions for protecting rights within 
universities. Ecuador&#8217;s current Higher Education Act (adopted in 2010) guarantees the right 
to higher education and promotes universal access with no discrimination. In Australia, 
measures in place to protect the rights of domestic and international students and staff 
include the Higher Education Support Act 2003, the Tertiary Education Quality and 
Standards Agency Act 2011 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000. 
The Code of Academic Ethics of the University of Montenegro defines rules for human 
rights protection. In accordance with the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany 
and other provisions, higher education institutions are committed to human rights and to 
ensuring the freedom of teaching, learning and research within a framework based on 
democratic principles.  
</p>

<p>Rights Procurator of Guatemala collaborate with universities on conferences and 
workshops and support human rights courses. The Office also has an internship agreement 
with the University of San Carlos. The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia has 
organized human rights awareness programmes for Malaysian students in polytechnic 
institutes and at public universities, including the National University of Malaysia. The 
National Human Rights Commission of the Republic of Korea created a local pool of 
specialized personnel in universities throughout the Republic of Korea and 10 universities 
now have their own human rights research departments. Human rights curricula are 
increasingly provided within disciplines educating future teachers, lawyers and social 
workers. Universities in the Republic of Korea have hosted international academic 
symposia, panel discussions and seminars on human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Teachers and educators 
</b></p>
<p>21. Specific legal provisions and regulations exist in some countries to govern human 
rights teacher training. In Sweden, the 2009 Education Act and the national curriculum 
stipulate that everyone who works in schools is obliged to promote respect for human 
rights. In France, initial training for teachers is subject to a decree that integrates human 
rights values and specifies the professional competences required of teachers as public 
officials, acting ethically and responsibly and promoting equality and non-discrimination. 
All Slovenian teachers receive human rights training before obtaining their licence, and 
candidates to be head teachers must take human rights courses. The Ministry of Education, 
Science and Technology of the Republic of Korea has included human rights content in the 
revised standard curricula for qualification training, which is required to qualify for the 
posts of head teacher, deputy head teacher and teacher. The Ministry also encourages 
municipal educational offices to create their own human rights programmes for teaching 
personnel under their jurisdiction. In Japan, specialist and technical training in social 
education, including human rights, is offered to social education specialists, including 
librarians, pursuant to the Social Education Act.  
</p>
<p>22. In-service training incorporating human rights is usually voluntary in France and 
Slovenia. In Monaco, in-service training promotes teaching methods encouraging student 
participation. In Estonia, subjects related to human rights are a priority in teachers&#8217; 
vocational and in-service training. In the Republic of Moldova, the Institute of Education 
Sciences undertook to revise in 2011 all in-service training programmes to include human 
rights education, with special attention paid to teaching staff dealing with children having 
special educational needs. Distance-learning courses are planned for 2012 on gender 
equality, children&#8217;s rights and other issues. The Ministry of Education of the Sudan is 
training teachers and educators in human rights issues, such as children&#8217;s rights and 
corporal punishment. The Italian ministers of education, university and research and of 
equal opportunities jointly issued a paper to all Italian schools to raise the awareness of 
teachers and head teachers of gender diversity. 
</p>
<p>23. The Ministry of Education of Jordan referred to integrating human rights into the 
curriculum of education sector employees and a 2010 training course held in Amman, 
which aimed at setting the concept of education in human rights and citizenship in the 
Jordanian context, promoting it in schools and enabling participants to integrate the 
concepts into the curricula. In Azerbaijan, 998 teachers participated in training courses for 
teaching life-skills-based education during the academic year 2009-2010. Various teaching 
aids and methodological tools have been developed, such as a textbook for teachers and a 
guide for students on the subject of human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>24. Training activities and projects are often developed in cooperation with national or 
international entities. For example, the National Directorate for Professional Development </p>


<p>under the Ministry of Education of Ecuador works with the non-governmental organization 
Fundaci&#243;n Esquel. The Ministry of Education and Science of Georgia implements projects 
in cooperation with the United States Agency for International Development and others, in 
the context of which four civic education textbooks were developed for students and 
teachers and a training programme for teachers of civic education is taking place 
throughout Georgia. The Montenegro Bureau for Education Services has conducted 
seminars for primary and secondary schools on the neglect and abuse of children and young 
people. The Ministry of Education and Sports, in cooperation with the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) Montenegro, has implemented a project on schools without 
violence, which includes training of mentors.  
</p>
<p>25. Several national human rights institutions reported on the provision of teacher 
training, sometimes in collaboration with the relevant ministries. The Estonian Institute for 
Human Rights implements in-service training with the Ministry of Education and Research. 
The Romanian Institute for Human Rights partners with the Ministry of Education, 
Research, Youth and Sports in running human rights training for both teachers/educators 
and pupils. Every other year, they hold a national competition for didactic creativity 
focusing on, among other things, developing supplementary human rights training material 
for secondary education. The National Human Rights Commission of the Republic of 
Korea has provided three online programmes to help teachers&#8217; self-study on human rights. 
The Office of the Human Rights Procurator of Guatemala delivered to the Ministry of 
Education educational modules on human rights training methodology in primary schools 
and also developed certificate-based courses for teachers. The Office also promotes 
specialized human rights and education methodology courses for teachers. The National 
Human Rights Commission of Djibouti mentioned a human rights educators network, 
seeking to reinforce the capacity of teaching staff in human rights knowledge and 
appropriate teaching methodologies.  
</p>
<p>26. Human rights education for educators is not limited to teacher training. National 
teacher competitions for good teaching practices in civic education have been held every 
other year in Bulgaria since 2003. The German Institute for Human Rights and the Free 
University Berlin collaborate to professionalize human rights education in work with 
children and young people, social work, social education and others. German universities of 
applied sciences, which train social workers and youth or child-care workers, make 
intercultural education, tolerance and education against discrimination a fixed part of the 
curriculum. In Berlin, three universities of applied sciences jointly offer a master&#8217;s degree 
in social work as a human rights profession.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Civil servants 
</b></p>

<p>of the mandatory training for civil servants when it drew up guidelines on education and 
training for civil servants for 2010-2011. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sweden noted 
measures taken to expand human rights training for public officials as a result of Sweden&#8217;s 
two national action plans for human rights. In Japan, relevant ministries and agencies are 
required to ensure training for public officers, as provided in the 2002 Basic Plan for 
Human Rights Education and Encouragement, and amended in 2011 by the Act for the 
Promotion of Human Rights Education and Encouragement. The National Personnel 
Authority offers a human rights curriculum in various training programmes for national 
public officers and instructs each ministry and agency to improve its human rights training. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs holds human rights seminars and lectures for new recruits

<p>29. The Human Rights Public Sector Education Programme in Australia enables 
public-sector officials to understand human rights obligations, strengthens their capacity to 
develop policies, programmes and legislation consistent with human rights and guides 
administrative decision makers on relevant human rights issues. The 2011 general human 
rights training programme for the Australian public sector involved 706 public-sector 
officials from 35 departments and was delivered in partnership with the Australian Centre 
for Human Rights Education and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. A human 
rights e-learning module will be disseminated among 200,000 public servants throughout 
Australia. The programme&#8217;s resources include a guide to human rights for Australian public 
servants and human rights guidance sheets.7 Romania&#8217;s National Agency of Civil Servants 
has provided training in the principles of non-discrimination and equal opportunities to 
12,<footnote name="49">. Several countries reported that military personnel received training in international 
human rights and humanitarian law. Institutions offering human rights training include the 
Estonian National Defence College, the Sudan Military College, the National Defence 
Academy of the Ministry of Defence of Japan, the Australian Defence Force Academy and 
the National Academy of Political and Strategic Studies in Chile. The Lebanese Army and 
the Directorate-General of Public Security have also taken steps in this regard.  
</footnote>3 civil servants. The Ecuadorian National Institute of Higher Education, with the 
Ministry of Justice, Human Rights and Worship, has delivered an initial course on human 
rights for civil servants, which reached 30 civil servants from several State institutions, 
including the armed forces.  
</p>
<p>30. Croatia has included human rights training courses in specialized university 
curricula for public and civil servants. In Switzerland, the Federal Department of Foreign 
Affairs offers a two-day human rights course to staff and interns of the federal 
administration. A two-week intensive course on human rights and gender issues is an

Rights Commission of Djibouti participates in training for civil servants of various 
ministries. The National Human Rights Commission of the Republic of Korea has 
developed six cybereducation courses for the human rights education of civil servants.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Law enforcement officials 
</b></p>
<p>35. Several countries reported on policies, guidelines and frameworks concerning 
human rights training of law enforcement officials and indicated institutional 
responsibilities for such training. For example, the Constitution of Ecuador states that 
national police officers have to be trained in democracy and human rights to be able to 
carry out their functions; human rights instructors are active in Ecuador&#8217;s 24 provinces. 
Human rights principles are enshrined in the Australian Federal Police Code of Conduct 
and in training given to its members. In the Czech Republic, the police education system is 
based on the 2001 strategy of life-long compulsory education of members and staff of the 
police and the Ministry of the Interior, which includes human rights training and is 
delivered by the Human Rights and Professional Ethics Centre of the Police College, in 
cooperation with governmental and non-governmental agencies, and the Police Academy. 
</p>
<p>36. In Switzerland, passing a human rights and ethics examination is a prerequisite for 
becoming a police officer. The Swiss Police Institute is preparing a reference manual for 
the federal professional exam on human rights and professional ethics. A training module 
on intercultural competence and diversity has been introduced at the canton and city levels. 
In France, initial training for police and the gendarmerie involves a module on the code of 
conduct, fundamental rights and communication techniques. In-service training &#8211; in 
particular the preparation for a professional examination to achieve the grade of police 
brigadier &#8211; also includes human rights.  
</p>

<p>37. German law enforcement personnel receive regular in-service training in which 
international human rights law plays an integral part, in particular the Code of Conduct for 
Law Enforcement Officials. The Ministry of Justice of Japan includes human rights 
protection and issues of trafficking in human beings in training programmes for the 
Immigration Bureau officers. The main pillar of the basic codes of professional ethics for 
the police in Japan is respect for human rights. Newly recruited police officers attend 
related lectures.  
</p>
<p>38. In Mauritius, human rights is essential in training police and prisons officers. In 
Monaco, the training of recruits to the Police Academy includes a programme on respect 
for human rights and physical integrity of human beings in all circumstances. The Human 
Rights Section in the Ministry of the Interior and Municipalities of Lebanon aims to prevent 
human rights violations by Internal Security Forces officials in Lebanon and raise 
awareness of human rights concepts through training; a working group recently drafted, in 
consultation with OHCHR, a code of conduct for the Internal Security Forces.  
</p>
<p>39. The Human Rights Department of the Chilean National Police was established in 
2011 to promote international standards for the police. Since 2012, the International 
Committee of the Red Cross has supported the police in integrating international human 
rights standards for policing into their training programmes, including training of trainers. 
The Ecuadorian police&#8217;s comprehensive continuing professional development programme 
is delivered by 126 human rights trainers from the Human Rights Department of the 
National Police&#8217;s National Directorate for Education. The programme reaches the entire 
police force, with 600 officers trained weekly.  
</p>
<p>40. Human rights have been part of regular in-service training curricula in the National 
Police Agency and Ministry of Justice in the Republic of Korea since 2003. At the Estonian 
Academy of Security Sciences, human rights are a subject in the curriculum for correctional 
officers, border guards and the police. The Algerian Police Academy provides human rights 
training to law enforcement agents of the National Security Directorate and the 
gendarmerie nationale.  
</p>
<p>41. A training centre within the Ministry of Justice of Serbia conducts regular human 
rights training programmes for security service employees and judicial wardens and has 
expanded to training trainers and heads of penal institutions and departments. The Centre 
for Specialized Training and Professional Development of the Ministry of the Interior has 
organized seminars on preventing harassment in the workplace. Training for police officers 
on the treatment of juveniles is mandatory. The Ministry has also implemented training 
programmes on human trafficking, in cooperation with United Nations agencies. In the 
Sudan, the Training Department of the Ministry of Justice and the Advisory Council for 
Human Rights provide training on administration of justice to police and security officers, 
among others. The syllabuses of police and security colleges include human rights law.  
</p>
<p>42. Reported recurring themes covered by initial and in-service training are human 
rights in policing, applicable international and regional human rights law, use of force and 
firearms, rules on detention and treatment of prisoners, torture, non-discrimination, 
trafficking, professional ethics and intercultural competence. Croatia&#8217;s Police Academy 
offers a compulsory subject entitled &#8220;Police authorities and human rights&#8221;. The curricula of 
police academies in Azerbaijan and Slovenia include human rights as a stand-alone subject. 
In Azerbaijan, a teaching aid on police and human rights was prepared by the pedagogical 
staff of the Police Academy with OHCHR assistance. In Bulgaria, the Academy of the 
Ministry of the Interior teaches human rights to staff as part of the initial and in-service 
professional training. Human rights training is mandatory for all Ministry staff officially 
authorized to carry a firearm. A separate distance-learning course on police close to society 
is also available to the Ministry staff.  </p>


<p>43. According to Colombia&#8217;s Directorate for Human Rights and International 
Humanitarian Law, the educational system of the national police aims to build a culture of 
respect for human rights, which are mainstreamed into training programmes for the police 
force. E-learning for the police includes a human rights course and a certificate-based 
course in pedagogy for teaching human rights. In Australia, training for all police before 
deployment on overseas missions includes human rights training delivered also through 
United Nations e-learning modules. 
</p>
<p>44. National human rights institutions actively promote human rights training of law 
enforcement officials. For instance, the Office of the Human Rights Procurator of 
Guatemala supports training at the Police Academy, facilitates workshops in police stations 
and supports courses for police officers seeking promotion. The National Advisory 
Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in Algeria has a permanent 
subcommission devoted to public information campaigns and training, including for law 
enforcement officials. The New Zealand Human Rights Commission has embedded human 
rights within induction, training and competency assessments undertaken by the New 
Zealand police. In 2010 and 2011, the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia conducted 
awareness-raising workshops for police, prison and immigration officials. In 2011, the 
Office of the Ombudsman in Panama trained in human rights 1,<footnote name="9">See www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/education/training/index.htm. </footnote>33 individuals, including 
law enforcement officials, penitentiary staff and civil servants. In Nigeria, the Human 
Rights Commission has organized human rights workshops for police and prison services 
aimed at improving their level of compliance with human rights standards in their duties. It 
has also worked on integrating human rights into the training curriculum of law 
enforcement agents, for whom it developed a training manual on women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights. 
</p>
<p>45. The National Human Rights Commission of the Republic of Korea has produced 
human rights materials, including guides to human rights for the police and for prison 
officials. Since 2011, the Commission has organized 89 special classes on human rights for 
over 8,000 police officials and provided 24 special courses within the Korea Police 
Investigation Academy, the Police Training Institute and the Korean National Police 
University. The Commission has also disseminated textbooks for law enforcement officials 
on investigation and human rights and security and human rights. In Djibouti, the National 
Human Rights Commission has developed two juridical guides on gender-based violence 
and organized trainings for the gendarmerie, the police, the military and prison staff.  
</p>

<p>48. The training system for prison officials in the College of Justice of the Estonian 
Academy of Security Sciences includes three years of professional higher education, 
vocational education and in-service training, all of which tackle human rights. Pre-service 
human rights training is compulsory. The Prisons Department of the Ministry of Justice 
carries out evaluation and impact assessments with regard to institutionalized human rights 
training. The code of ethics governing prison officials incorporates human rights standards. 
In the Ministry of Justice of Bulgaria, officials from the Chief Directorate &#8220;Execution of 
Judgments&#8221; are trained in, for example, the prevention of torture and use of force. Japanese 
correctional personnel attend lectures on the human rights of inmates. The Ministry of 
Justice in Algeria, responsible for penitentiary establishments, has developed a human 
rights training programme. The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia is drafting, with 
the Prison Department, a human rights curriculum for prison officials.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Military 
</b></p>

<p>Military Academy, the subject &#8220;right of defence and international humanitarian law&#8221; partly 
deals with human rights issues. Military personnel from the Czech Republic, Romania, 
Slovenia and Switzerland are acquainted with human rights issues before their international 
deployment in peace missions. The human rights strategies and policies of the Ministry of 
Defence and the armed forces in Ecuador are coordinated the United Nations and the 
International Committee of the Red Cross. A human rights training curriculum is being 
developed. 
</p>
<p>54. Among the national human rights institutions carrying out human rights training for 
military personnel are the Office of the Human Rights Procurator of Guatemala and the 
National Human Rights Commission in Djibouti. In the framework of the &#8220;Human Rights 
Month&#8221; declared by the Ombudsman of Azerbaijan in 2011, and based on the provisions of 
the National Action Plan on Human Rights Protection, seminars on human rights law were 
conducted for staff of the military prosecution office and the military tribunal. 
</p>
<p>55. Teaching tools include a Swiss interactive DVD on human rights that includes 
practical case studies, used by Swiss military personnel. In Armenia, a course on human 
rights for the military is conducted on the basis of a manual on human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, with a chapter on the rights of ethnic and linguistic minorities in the 
army.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Activities at the international level  
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1.  Global coordination of the World Programme 
</b></p>
<p>56. During the reporting period, OHCHR ensured global coordination of the World 
Programme. Following the adoption of the plan of action, OHCHR promoted its 
dissemination by reaching out, in October 2010, through the Global Human Rights 
Education listserv maintained by Human Rights Education Associates, to more than 10,000 
individuals and organizations engaged in human rights education worldwide. In September 
2011, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights addressed letters to all 
Permanent Representatives of Member States to encourage the national implementation of 
the World Programme.  
</p>
<p>57. OHCHR frequently interacted with many actors, such as Governments, United 
Nations entities, intergovernmental and civil society organizations, providing information, 
publications, advice and other support and participating in relevant events such as, at the 
international level, various parallel events during the sessions of the Human Rights Council 
and the annual meetings of the International Coordinating Committee of National 
Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>58. OHCHR and UNESCO developed a booklet containing the plan of action for the 
second phase accompanied by a short introduction highlighting its main elements. It will be 
published in 2012 and disseminated electronically, among other means. 
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Information sharing, tools and resources 
</b></p>
<p>59. OHCHR promoted sharing of information on human rights education initiatives at 
various levels through several activities, including a dedicated section of the OHCHR 
website.9 OHCHR expanded the World Programme web pages (in English, French and 
</p>

<p>Spanish) that provide, among other things, information on national initiatives related to 
human rights education and the text of national plans and strategies. 
</p>
<p>60. OHCHR developed and disseminated human rights training materials and 
methodologies based on good practice,<footnote name="10">Available from www.ohchr.org/EN/PublicationsResources/Pages/TrainingEducation.aspx. 
 11  See http://hre.ohchr.org/hret/intro.aspx. 
 12 Available from 
 
 www2.ohchr.org/english/ohchrreport2011/web_version/ohchr_report2011_web/index.html. </footnote> including the 2011 OHCHR/Equitas handbook 
<i>Evaluating Human Rights Training Activities: A Handbook for Human Rights Educators 
</i></p>
<p>and a forthcoming OHCHR/UNESCO self-assessment guide for Governments concerning 
human rights education in the school system. OHCHR is updating its 1999 publication <i>The 
Right to Human Rights Education</i>, in which it compiled provisions on human rights 
education adopted by Governments in the context of various intergovernmental 
mechanisms, to serve as an advocacy tool. OHCHR is also producing, together with two 
non-governmental organizations, <i>A Path to Dignity: The Power of Human Rights 
Education</i>, a film documenting the positive impact of human rights education on people&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>lives. As at May 2012, the film was at the post-production phase; its launch is expected in 
September 2012. 
</p>
<p>61. OHCHR manages a publicly accessible Resource Collection on Human Rights 
Education and Training, a section of the OHCHR Library comprising more than 3,100 
materials from around the world. The OHCHR online Database on Human Rights 
Education and Training provides information on around 300 regularly updated training 
programmes worldwide and more than 1,100 training and education institutions.11 OHCHR 
maintained an educational focus on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the Office 
hosts a collection of more than 350 related items (printed, audiovisual and commemorative 
materials) and a web page containing various resources, including 384 translations into 
national and local languages and dialects.  
</p>
<p><b> 3.  Supporting national capacity and civil society initiatives  
</b></p>
<p>62. OHCHR headquarters and field presences regularly support national capacity for 
human rights education and training through the provision of methodological and expert 
advice, in addition to the organization of training courses, workshops and other events on a 
broad variety of human rights topics and for many audiences. Details on OHCHR education 
activities are available in <i>OHCHR Report 2011</i>.12 
</p>
<p>63. Examples of international activities include the Human Rights Orientation 
Programme for Diplomats, implemented jointly with the United Nations Institute for 
Training and Research in Geneva and New York, to enhance Government officials&#8217; 
understanding of the United Nations human rights protection system; workshops for 
educators belonging to governmental and non-governmental organizations on evaluation of 
human rights training, co-organized with Equitas; cooperation with the European Agency 
for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member 
States of the European Union in developing human rights training materials for European 
Union border guards; and efforts to strengthen national capacity for human rights training 
of military, police and other staff deployed to peace missions. 
</p>
<p>64. OHCHR regularly responds to human rights education queries from Government 
and civil society entities and provides methodological advice, reference services and other 
guidance. OHCHR grants, publications and the participation of specialized OHCHR staff 
have supported international and regional human rights education activities organized by 
other actors. 
</p>

<p>65. The Assisting Communities Together Project is a joint initiative of OHCHR and 
UNDP awarding, since 1998, small grants to national and local civil society organizations 
in support of grass-roots human rights education initiatives in selected countries.13 In 
2011-2012, the grants supported activities countering discrimination; a total of 28 OHCHR 
and 20 UNDP grants were awarded in Cameroon, Cape Verde, the Central African 
Republic, Ecuador, Iraq, Kosovo, Mauritania, the Republic of Moldova, Senegal, the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Togo, Uganda and Uruguay. Under the eighth 
phase of the project (2012-2013), OHCHR and UNDP expect to award grants in Burkina 
Faso, Cameroon, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
the Republic of Moldova, the Sudan, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and 
Tunisia. 
</p>
<p><b> B. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
</b></p>
<p>66. As part of its education mandate, UNESCO promotes and supports national 
implementation of the World Programme by its member States, also through joint 
initiatives with OHCHR as mentioned above. It has developed materials to assist its 
member States to integrate education for peace and human rights in school systems, such as 
<i>Contemporary Issues in Human Rights Education</i> (June 2011). Another example is a short 
film Education for Human Rights&#8230; Young People Talking, produced in 2011 in 
cooperation with the national commissions for UNESCO and national coordinators of the 
UNESCO Associated Schools Project Network from Albania, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Burkina 
Faso, Canada, the Dominican Republic, France, Indonesia, Lebanon and Uganda. The film 
showcases schoolchildren&#8217;s key concerns from a human rights education perspective, 
</p>
<p>touching upon issues related to gender, violence, peace and diversity, among others.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Other intergovernmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization of 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE/ODIHR) has promoted human rights education 
and the World Programme in the OSCE area. It has organized national and regional events 
in Central Asia to present human rights education approaches in the school system and to 
assist States in integrating human rights into their formal curricula. ODIHR has also been 
developing guidelines for human rights education in the secondary school system, for law 
enforcement officials and for public health professionals, containing methodological 
guidance for quality human rights education.  
</p>
<p>68. The Council of Europe14 supports human rights education and the World Programme 
in Europe; in 2010 its 47 member States adopted, by recommendation CM/Rec(2010)7, the 
Charter on Education for Democratic Citizenship and Human Rights Education, whose 
implementation will be reviewed in late 2012. The Council&#8217;s numerous materials include 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;Charter for All&#8221;, presenting the document in a language accessible to young people, 
and a revised version of <i>Compass: A manual on human rights education with young people</i>. 
Among the Council&#8217;s many training activities are the Pestalozzi Programme,15 which 
develops competencies of education practitioners, and human rights training offered to 
judges, prison staff of national human rights institutions and other professional groups. 
Human rights education is also mainstreamed in the Council&#8217;s youth policy. 
</p>

<p>69. Upon the initiative of the Council of Europe, the International Contact Group on 
Citizenship and Human Rights Education was set up in 2011 with a view to ensuring close 
cooperation among relevant regional and international initiatives. It brings together 
OHCHR, UNESCO, OSCE/ODIHR, the European Commission, the European Union 
Agency for Fundamental Rights, the Arab League Educational, Cultural and Scientific 
Organization, the Organization of American States and the Council of Europe. Its first 
meeting was held in Strasbourg, France, in March 2012.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> With regard to the 45 countries considered and the information received, the 
analysis undertaken reveals that significant efforts are taking place worldwide 
</b></p>
<p><b>towards integrating human rights education into education and training for all the 
</b></p>
<p><b>focus sectors </b>of the World Programme&#8217;s second phase (2010<b>-2014) and beyond. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>report contains numerous examples of specific training initiatives promoting human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights standards and developed through collaborative and complementary efforts by 
</b></p>
<p><b>Governments, national human rights institutions, academic institutions and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international actors. While some national initiatives appear to have been inspired by 
</b></p>
<p>the World Programme&#8217;s global framework, in other cases existing practices emerged 
</p>
<p><b>independently from it. Irrespective of this, they nevertheless show increasing 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitment by States to advancing human rights education in all sectors. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular, a comparison with a human rights education survey undertaken by 
</b></p>
<p><b>OHCHR in 2000 (A/55/360) provides grounds for identifying an increasing trend in 
</b></p>
<p><b>terms of the institutionalization of human rights education and training. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>application of sound educational methodologies based on good practice and assessed 
</b></p>
<p><b>through continuing evaluation, in addition to regular cooperation, networking and 
</b></p>
<p><b>information sharing among all actors, represent key strategies to ensure the 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectiveness of these educational efforts.  
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> Given the many target sectors and various authorities and other actors 
involved at the national level, coherent national implementation of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>education may present a challenge, giving priority to ad hoc initiatives. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>formulation of national implementation strategies building on needs assessment and 
</b></p>
<p><b>including a monitoring and evaluation process, as proposed in the World 
</b></p>
<p>Programme&#8217;s plan of action, <b>is strongly encouraged to maximize the long-term impact 
</b></p>
<p><b>of human rights education towards the full realization of human rights.</b>  </p>
