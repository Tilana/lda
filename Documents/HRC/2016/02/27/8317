<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>3 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The year 2011 saw a number of positive developments concerning Nepal&#8217;s human 
rights protection framework. The Government started implementation of its three-year 
National Human Rights Action Plan and the Untouchability Act was passed in May, 
creating a more detailed and specific legislative framework for outlawing caste-based 
discriminatory practices. The Supreme Court of Nepal continued to show leadership in the 
promotion of human rights, with progressive decisions regarding economic, social and 
cultural rights, illegal arbitrary detentions and the promotion of accountability for 
perpetrators of human rights violations. Nepal participated in the universal periodic review 
in an open and serious manner, and accepted the majority of recommendations submitted 
by Member States. Although inter-party disputes continued to inhibit the achievement of 
peace process milestones, the parties remained genuinely committed to completing the 
peace process as a whole. 
</p>
<p>2. At the same time, there has been a concerning trend towards entrenching impunity 
for violations committed during the conflict, including withdrawing cases and granting 
amnesties and pardons. Of greatest concern is the indication that the laws establishing 
transitional justice mechanisms will likely include clauses allowing for amnesties in 
relation to serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. This has 
drawn significant opposition from civil society, national human rights institutions, the legal 
community and Nepal&#8217;s international partners. Despite legal guarantees regarding freedom 
of expression, human rights defenders and journalists continue to face risks in conducting 
their activities across Nepal; they are often forced to practice self-censorship in the absence 
of appropriate mechanisms for their protection. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights and the political situation 
</b></p>
<p>3. Nepal continues to consolidate peace in a post-conflict environment. However, a 
period of political uncertainty has persisted through much of 2011. Though the country did 
not witness any major political upheavals, differences in opinion among the three largest 
political parties persisted for most of the year. In August 2011, a senior leader of the 
Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) (UCPN-M), Baburam Bhattarai, was elected as 
the new Prime Minister, with the support of a coalition of several Terai-based political 
parties.  
</p>
<p>4. The Constituent Assembly elected in 2008 with a mandate to draft a new 
Constitution failed on three occasions during 2011 to meet drafting deadlines.1 This was 
due to political disagreements concerning unresolved aspects of the peace process, 
particularly the integration and rehabilitation of the Maoist army. The Assembly&#8217;s tenure 
was further extended on each occasion following agreements among the political parties to 
complete the outstanding tasks.2 The new Prime Minister announced that immediate steps 
would be taken to move the peace process forward. On 1 November, there was a major 
breakthrough with the signing of a seven-point agreement between the main political 
parties. The agreement deals with key issues of the peace process, including provisions for 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Article 64 of the 2007 Interim Constitution gave the Assembly  two years (until May 2010) to draft a 
</p>
<p>new constitution. The deadline has been extended four times, through amendments to the Interim 
Constitution. 
</p>
<p> 2 At the end of May, the deadline was extended by three months to 31 August, when it was extended 
again to 30 November. On 29 November, it was further extended for six months. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>the rehabilitation and integration of the former Maoist combatants, the establishment of two 
transitional justice commissions within one month, the return of property seized during the 
conflict and the drafting of the new Constitution. 
</p>
<p>5. Public security remains poor in several southern Terai districts. The local 
population, especially the business community, is frequently subjected to violent threats 
and intimidation by armed criminal groups, and kidnappings for ransom remain common. 
The response of the State also raises concerns as there have been allegations of extra-
judicial killings by the police.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for  
Human Rights in Nepal 
</b></p>
<p>6. OHCHR-Nepal&#8217;s mandate was extended in June 2011 for six months until 8 
December 2011, despite the High Commissioner&#8217;s request for a two-year extension. At the 
request of the Government, OHCHR submitted an exit strategy in which it proposed a 
continuation of its work until the promulgation of the new Constitution and the successful 
completion of parliamentary elections, expected by the end of 2012. OHCHR engaged in 
consultations with stakeholders regarding its future role. This revealed strong support from 
the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), other national human rights institutions 
(NHRIs), civil society, most major political parties and the international community for the 
Office to remain in the country to support the completion of the peace process. However, 
on 7 December 2011, the Government of Nepal decided not to renew the mandate of 
OHCHR-Nepal. The Office is currently finalizing its activities and will draw down its 
operations in due course. OHCHR will discuss alternative modalities with the Government 
to provide continued support to the human rights agenda in Nepal. 
</p>
<p>7. During 2011, OHCHR-Nepal consolidated its presence in Kathmandu, following the 
closure of its four field offices at the request of the Government. It continued to discharge 
its tasks of monitoring the human rights aspects of the peace process as mandated by the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (article 9.1). The Office maintained links with local 
stakeholders and undertook regular field missions across the country: 122 between January 
and December. OHCHR teams monitored protests, particularly around the drafting 
deadlines of the new Constitution in May and August. The Deputy High Commissioner for 
Human Rights visited to Nepal in April to assess the situation in the country.  
</p>
<p>8. In 2011, OHCHR-Nepal placed special emphasis on strengthening the national 
human rights protection system. Strengthening the role of the NHRIs, including the 
National Women Commission (NWC) and the National Dalit Commission (NDC) was 
prioritized, and numerous activities were undertaken jointly with NHRIs, including 
publishing legal analyses on key human rights issues. OHCHR-Nepal continued to assist 
the Government, including on issues related to the fulfilment of economic, social and 
cultural rights in Government policies, and provided significant support to the transitional 
justice process towards meeting international standards. To this end, it developed proactive 
collaboration with Nepal&#8217;s legal community and the judiciary on various issues, including 
public interest litigation. During 2011, OHCHR also strengthened its cooperation with the 
Office of the Attorney General.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Universal periodic review 
</b></p>
<p>9. Nepal&#8217;s first review by the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review 
occurred in January 2011. This provided an opportunity for the Government, NHRIs, civil 
society organizations (CSOs) and United Nations agencies to critically examine the human </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>rights situation in the country. OHCHR-Nepal supported the Government in preparing its 
report in 2010; a number of consultations were organized by CSOs and NHRIs, in which 
Government representatives also participated. In addition to the Government&#8217;s report, two 
joint reports were submitted by the three NHRIs and by a group of 238 CSOs, which 
encouragingly set aside political divisions to do so. OHCHR-Nepal facilitated the in-
country pre-review process, disseminating information, connecting relevant actors and 
clarifying the roles of each stakeholder. 
</p>
<p>10. The review took place on 25 January 2011; Member States submitted 135 
recommendations, to which the Government responded encouragingly by accepting 84 
recommendations initially, and another 12 recommendations at the plenary session in June. 
The Government recognized gaps in its promotion and protection of human rights, citing 
various factors, including the continuing political impasse, challenges to the peace process 
and a weak economy. This acknowledgement indicated the Government&#8217;s openness to 
engage in dialogue and its commitment to realize a series of human rights benchmarks over 
the coming four-year period. During the review process, civil society actors undertook 
proactive lobbying and advocacy, and effectively established a collective voice within 
Nepal&#8217;s human rights community. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Structure of the report 
</b></p>
<p>11. The present report is structured around 10 human rights topics prioritized in the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), the National Human Rights Action Plan and, 
most recently, the universal periodic review. These issues have been the central focus of 
OHCHR&#8217;s work in Nepal and the subject of many recommendations in its public reports. 
They have also been raised by the various human rights mechanisms, including the treaty 
bodies and special procedures. As Nepal proceeds towards the conclusion of its peace 
process, this report analyses the country&#8217;s achievements and challenges in relation to these 
ten topics throughout 2011. The report also highlights the support provided by OHCHR to 
key partners and actors, in particular the NHRC and the other NHRIs, to strengthen the 
national human rights protection system. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Constitution 
</b></p>
<p>12. The ongoing Constitution-drafting process offers a historic opportunity to build 
strong foundations for the State, grounded on respect for human rights and justice, and to 
address longstanding discriminatory practices in Nepal. During the universal periodic 
review, a number of States made recommendations calling for the timely completion of the 
new Constitution in line with international standards, and the full participation of the 
different ethnic groups and castes in the consultation process prior to its promulgation.3 The 
Government accepted all the recommendations of the review, except one on the issue of 
statelessness.4 
</p>
<p>13. The Constituent Assembly&#8217;s mandate was to draft the new Constitution and the 
drafting deadline was extended three times in 2011. The Supreme Court upheld the 
legitimacy of the extensions, but expressed concerns with the lack of progress to date.  
</p>

</p>
<p>(A/HRC/17/5), para. 106.1.

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.4 
</b></p>

</p>
<p>14. The current draft contains a number of important provisions, particularly with regard 
to non-discrimination and collective rights. However, gaps exist in relation to the protection 
of some rights, including the rights of non-citizens, the justiciability of economic, social 
and cultural rights and the right of women to enjoy equal access to citizenship. The possible 
inclusion of an amnesty clause for serious crimes in the draft bills to establish the 
transitional justice mechanisms &#8211; inconsistent with international law &#8211; is a major concern.5 
Furthermore, the unresolved issue of the principle of independent judicial review in 
interpreting the Constitution and the constitutionality of laws is of critical importance. The 
Constituent Assembly Committee on the Judiciary originally proposed that this authority 
should rest with a parliamentary committee; however, there has been growing consensus 
towards seeking an alternative that would maintain the principle of judicial review. 
Recognizing that discussions of these provisions are ongoing, the High Commissioner has 
called for the timely adoption of the Constitution, with provisions fully consistent with 
international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>15. Once the draft is finalized, a nationwide public consultation and a clause-by-clause 
discussion within the Assembly should follow. Despite time pressures, these processes 
remain essential in order to garner genuine public ownership. OHCHR-Nepal continued to 
provide technical assistance on critical human rights aspects of the Constitution throughout 
</p><p>2011. During her visit to Nepal in April, the Deputy High Commissioner directly engaged 
with Assembly members and other national partners on key human rights concerns in 
relation to the Constitution.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Gender equality 
</b></p>
<p>16. The promotion and protection of the human rights of women in Nepal remains a 
significant challenge. Discrimination against women, especially those belonging to 
vulnerable groups such as Dalits, remains widespread and includes allegations of 
witchcraft. The persistence of practices such as <i>kamlari</i>, a form of bonded child labour 
affecting girls from the Tharu indigenous community, and the growth of the dowry system 
are of particular concern. 
</p>
<p>17. During 2011, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
considered Nepal&#8217;s fourth and fifth periodic reports. While commending some positive 
developments in gender equality, the Committee raised a series of concerns regarding 
legislative shortcomings, including discriminatory provisions related to the right of a Nepali 
mother to transfer citizenship to her child. This issue is also controversial in the current 
draft Constitution which states that Nepali citizenship shall be granted to a child only if 
both parents are Nepali citizens. This is a notable regression from the 2007 Interim 
Constitution which requires only one parent to be a citizen, an important recognition of the 
independent identity and ability of Nepali women to transfer citizenship. OHCHR-Nepal 
and the NWC jointly advocated for equal and independent rights of women in the new 
Constitution, including through a publication on citizenship. Furthermore, the important 
2007 Supreme Court order to the Government to provide citizenship certificates to third 
</p>
<p>  
 5 There are no explicit provisions on amnesty or pardon, including in the context of serious crimes. The 
</p>
<p>draft text contains a provision granting the President sweeping authority in relation to pardons and 
clemency. Under international human rights law, States may not grant amnesty for gross violations of 
human rights and any such provision should be subject to the State&#8217;s overall responsibility to fulfil 
victims&#8217; rights to truth, justice and reparations. As such, the Constitution should explicitly provide for 
the impermissibility of amnesties, including pardon and withdrawal of criminal charges, for serious 
crimes such as enforced disappearance, torture, unlawful killing and rape. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>gender persons6 remains largely unimplemented, due to a lack of awareness among 
authorities and the failure of the Ministry of Home Affairs to issue clear directives on its 
interpretation. In July 2011, OHCHR-Nepal, in collaboration with civil society, organized a 
programme on challenges and best practices identified from the implementation of the 2007 
ruling. 
</p>
<p>18. Gender equality was the subject of the largest number of universal periodic review 
recommendations for Nepal. The Government accepted all the recommendations, including 
those to implement a legal and policy framework to end gender-based discrimination,7 
investigate and prosecute cases of gender-based violence, protect victims and ensure their 
access to justice,8 as well as a number of recommendations regarding sexual orientation, 
including the implementation of the 2007 Supreme Court decision.9 
</p>
<p>19. However, challenges remain and widespread impunity for perpetrators of gender-
based violence continues. Key challenges include the lack of access to justice for women 
victims, due in part to ineffective implementation of existing laws and policies, the failure 
of the police to take a gender-sensitive approach and a frequent resort to &#8220;mediation&#8221;. 
While the law allows for mediation in domestic violence cases with the consent of a victim, 
OHCHR found that pressure may be exerted on victims to accept mediation rather than to 
seek criminal justice in relation to other crimes, including sexual violence. Increased 
reports have been received of violence against women alleged to practice witchcraft. The 
victims are frequently women from weaker social-economic backgrounds, including single, 
older and/or Dalit women. Action against perpetrators is rare. One notable exception was 
the decision of a District Court to impose a prison sentence for the assault and displacement 
of a woman accused of practising witchcraft &#8211; the first custodial sentence for such a case.10 
</p>
<p>20. OHCHR, in partnership with the NWC, monitored the implementation of the Action 
Plan of the Office of the Prime Minister aimed at eliminating gender-based violence. The 
Government has established safe houses in 15 districts, and OHCHR supported capacity-
building of the staff of the safe houses and of law enforcement officials. OHCHR-Nepal 
further supported local networks in responding to sexual and gender-based violence and 
other forms of discrimination, including an initiative to declare one entire development area 
as &#8220;witchcraft violence free&#8221;.11 To further combat gender-based violence, the Committee on 
the Elimination of Discrimination against Women recommended the reform and 
implementation of relevant legislation and policies, as well as building the capacity of key 
actors. The Government has since submitted a draft bill to Parliament with the aim of 
amending provisions in 19 different laws. The High Commissioner hopes that the 
Government will develop a comprehensive strategy, with concrete goals and timetables, in 
order to work towards implementing this recommendation.

 10 On 19 June, the Lalitpur District Court sentenced the main perpetrator to six months imprisonment 
</p>
<p>and gave fines to all seven perpetrators. This verdict is the first in Nepal handing out a prison 
sentence under the Civil Code for crimes committed in relation to witchcraft allegations.  
</p>
<p> 11 In November 2010, OHCHR, in collaboration with women human rights defenders and the local 
community, launched a one-year campaign in Amgacchi village, Morang district, as a pilot project to 
create a model village development committee (VDC). The VDC will combat sexual and gender 
based violence, with the aim of declaring the village &#8220;free of allegations of witchcraft and related 
violence against women&#8221; within one year. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p><b> C. Caste-based discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>21. During 2011, OHCHR-Nepal continued to receive reports of incidents of caste-
based discrimination, including the killing &#8211; reportedly by the bride&#8217;s family &#8211; of the father 
of a Dalit man who had married a woman from a dominant caste. While the seriousness of 
the case and the publicity it generated has resulted in the detention of a number of alleged 
perpetrators, in general, access to justice for victims of caste-based discrimination is 
limited, with very few prosecutions taking place.12 
</p>
<p>22. An inadequate legislative framework has significantly contributed to this situation. It 
is therefore noteworthy that the Constituent Assembly adopted the Caste-Based 
Discrimination and Untouchability (Crime and Offences) Act in May 2011.13 This new law 
has been welcomed by Nepal&#8217;s human rights community as a significant step forward. It 
followed concerted advocacy efforts by a coalition of actors, including OHCHR and the 
NDC, and serves to prohibit the commission or incitement of caste-based discrimination 
and untouchability in both the public and private spheres. Furthermore, it provides for 
harsher punishment for public officials breaching it, and requires perpetrators to provide 
compensation to victims. In a welcome signal of its commitment to combat this problem, 
the Government accepted all recommendations related to caste-based discrimination made 
during the universal periodic review.   
</p>
<p>23. Following the successful enactment of the Untouchability Act, emphasis has now 
shifted to its proper implementation. It is critical to raise both the awareness and capacity of 
law enforcement officials, CSOs and the general public. To this end, OHCHR-Nepal and 
the NDC produced a joint publication on the new law and, in September 2011, launched a 
&#8220;100 Days&#8221; campaign, with the slogan &#8220;I commit to end caste-based discrimination and 
untouchability&#8221;. As part of the campaign, OHCHR-Nepal published a detailed report 
analysing the obstacles encountered by victims of caste-based discrimination in accessing 
justice and highlighting the critical role of the police in properly filing complaints, 
investigating cases and providing protection to victims and witnesses.14 It is imperative that 
the Government issue guidelines on the new law for State officials, provide specific 
training to law enforcement officials and comprehensively disseminate the law, in 
partnership with the NDC. OHCHR is ready to support these actions through capacity 
building for Government officials and CSOs. The Government recently established a centre 
to monitor untouchability in Kathmandu, but more are required across Nepal. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>24. Although there is no centralized data collected on persons with disabilities in Nepal, 
they constitute one of the most disadvantaged groups in the country. This is reflected in the 
literacy and employment indicators. For example, children with disabilities have lower 
</p>
<p>  
 12 The man was killed on 30 August following the inter-caste marriage of his son in Dailekh district. 
</p>
<p>Police arrested nine alleged perpetrators, five of whom remain in custody, while four have been 
released on bail. 
</p>
<p> 13 See A/HRC/17/5, paras. 106.24; 107.11, 12 and 13; 108.12. 
 14 In December 2011, OHCHR organized an event to launch its report with participants from across the 
</p>
<p>South Asia region. Best practices were shared and discussed and a Regional Action Plan developed to 
follow up recommendations in the report. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>enrolment and higher drop-out rates at schools.15 Gaps in physical facilities and information 
are the major obstacles for accessing the right to education, health and employment. 
</p>
<p>25. The Government took a significant step towards better protection and promotion of 
the rights of persons with disabilities by ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities in 2009, and the Optional Protocol in 2010. During the universal periodic 
review, the Government also accepted a number of general recommendations to protect the 
rights of persons with disabilities, although it rejected a specific recommendation to ensure 
their participation in vocational training, literacy and numeracy programmes, with 
measurable targets to be reached within one year.16 However, the Government indicated 
that an action plan is being developed to ensure access to vocational training, together with 
a mechanism for regular consultation with representatives of organizations of persons with 
disabilities. 
</p>
<p>26. In 2011, the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare initiated a programme 
to review and reform existing policies and legislation on disability to ensure consistency 
with the Convention. The Ministry of Health has undertaken a similar review in relation to 
the Mental Health Policy. OHCHR-Nepal continued its engagement with the Government 
and relevant organizations to support these reviews and to promote the consideration of 
disability issues throughout development planning.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>27. Nepal remains on the United Nations list of least developed countries. Some 
progress has been made in the fulfilment of economic, social and cultural rights, for 
example, the net enrolment rate in primary education in 2010 was recorded at 94.5 per cent, 
an increase of 7 per cent over five years.17 However, the lack of disaggregated data on the 
basis of caste, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, location and other economic and social 
factors makes it difficult to assess whether these improvements benefit all sections of 
society.18 
</p>
<p>28. Against this backdrop, a major accomplishment of OHCHR-Nepal in 2011 was the 
launch of a user&#8217;s guide, with indicators for the realization of the rights to adequate food, 
housing, health, education and work, for use by national stakeholders. Work on the guide 
was conducted in collaboration with the Working Group on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights Indicators, comprising the NHRIs, the Ministry of Health and Population and the 
Community Self-Reliance Centre. Aimed at monitoring the progressive realization of the 
above-mentioned rights, the guide identifies gaps and resources for the more marginalized 
sections of the population. The Government&#8217;s National Human Rights Action Plan for the 
next three years has already integrated some of these indicators. The Government is 
encouraged now to work towards establishing an effective data-generating mechanism and 
to identify appropriate national benchmarks for each indicator. 
</p>
<p>29. During the universal review process, the Government accepted recommendations for 
ensuring the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by all, and for stepping up 
efforts to ensure the enjoyment of these rights by marginalized and vulnerable groups.19

<p>Based on information collected by OHCHR, the number of indigenous peoples 
participating in decision-making processes of the Government remains low, particularly in 
relation to the management of national parks and neighbouring buffer zones where many 
indigenous peoples live. During 2011, OHCHR-Nepal continued its advocacy, thereby 
contributing to greater awareness among park authorities regarding the engagement of 
indigenous people, especially women, in park management. One result is the commitment 
by the head of the national park buffer zones in the Chitwan district to establishing one 
additional users&#8217; committee consisting of women, including indigenous women.

<p>30.<i> Haliyas</i> represent another group that suffers in relation to the enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights.20 Despite a 2008 Government decree formally 
&#8220;freeing&#8221; the <i>haliyas</i> from debt bondage, their abject living conditions have largely 
remained unchanged. Most <i>haliyas</i> have received little, if any, rehabilitation support, and 
face difficulties in accessing basic needs including food, shelter and health services as they 
have not been provided with identity cards. Many are compelled to continue as debt 
labourers with their former landlords. OHCHR-Nepal continues to monitor the situation, 
advocate with the Government and support the Federation of National Haliya Liberation 
Society in their activities. 
</p>
<p>31. In 2011, the Supreme Court issued a number of decisions relating to the enjoyment 
of economic, social and cultural rights, including a directive to the Government to 
formulate a comprehensive housing policy, based on the right to adequate housing, and to 
enact a law that protects the rights of persons living in rented accommodation. The Court 
also issued an interim order to the Government to continue deploying graduate medical 
doctors under a scholarship scheme to remote areas of Nepal. While the effective 
implementation of positive court verdicts in relation to the denial of economic, social and 
cultural rights remains a major challenge, in its comments to this report, the Government 
indicated that it had established a special mechanism giving each Ministry specific 
responsibilities to execute such court orders. OHCHR-Nepal also undertook activities 
aimed at enhancing the justiciability of these rights, including through promoting dialogue 
between the legal community, Government and NHRIs. For example, a declaration by law 
students on this issue was adopted, following a national conference on enhancing the 
justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights, organized with the Nepalese Law 
Students Association.  
</p>
<p><b> F. National human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>32. Although the NHRC, NWC and NDC are playing an increasingly important role to 
promote and protect human rights in Nepal, a number of factors continue to inhibit their full 
effectiveness. Both the NHRC and the NDC bills remained pending during the year. The 
NHRC has publicly raised concerns about the NHRC bill and its inconsistencies with the 
Paris Principles. Indeed, both bills contain provisions that are inconsistent with the Paris 
Principles,21 including the absence of an explicit designation as an &#8220;independent 
commission&#8221; and no explicit power to independently appoint their own staff. Insufficient 
financial and human resources further limit all three NHRIs from effectively discharging 
their mandates. Without the necessary legislation, the NHRC has been unable to recruit new 
staff and more than half of the posts remain vacant. The NWC remains active in protecting 
</p>
<p>  
 20 <i>Haliya</i> is a form of ancestral debt-bonded labour, mostly affecting the Dalit community in some hill 
</p>
<p>districts of Nepal. Despite its abolition by the 2008 Government Decree, many <i>haliya</i> families remain 
trapped in debt-bonded labour relationships and extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p> 21 Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions (The Paris Principles), General Assembly 
resolution 48/134 of 20 December 1993  </p>

<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>and promoting women&#8217;s rights, but its dependency on the Ministry of Women, Children 
and Social Welfare for financial and human resources has limited its effectiveness. 
Similarly, the NDC plays a critical role in protecting the rights of Dalits, including its new 
role under the Untouchability Act to facilitate access to justice by victims of caste-based 
discrimination and untouchability. However, human-resource and financial constraints also 
hamper its work. While the NHRC maintains regional offices, the NWC and NDC do not 
have similar regional presences, which severely limits their reach outside of the capital. 
</p>
<p>33. After an extended period of review by the International Coordinating Committee of 
NHRIs in June 2011, the NHRC retained &#8220;A&#8221; status accreditation, albeit conditional on 
another review, once the NHRC bill is passed. During the universal periodic review, the 
Government made commitments to pass the law and to implement certain recommendations 
made by the NHRC, concerning prosecutions and departmental actions.22 While neither 
commitment has been fully realized so far, in its comments to this report, the Government 
indicated that it had established a fast-track mechanism to ensure the implementation of 
recommendations related to compensation by the relevant Ministry, without having 
recourse to the Cabinet.  Subsequently, the Government reported that as of May 2011, 28 
per cent of NHRC recommendations issued in 2011 were fully implemented, a notable 
improvement on the 9 per cent reported between 2000 and 2010.23 However, this increase 
only concerns recommendations to provide compensation to victims. No NHRC 
recommendations to initiate prosecutions against alleged perpetrators have been 
implemented to date. 
</p>
<p>34. OHCHR continued to directly engage and strengthen its partnership, as well as 
increasingly undertake joint activities with the NHRC. In 2011, OHCHR and the NHRC 
advocated against the Government&#8217;s plan on the withdrawal of cases of human rights 
violations, and produced three joint publications and five press releases, including a 
publication on the NHRC bill. OHCHR also focused on developing the capacity of the 
NHRC, primarily through ongoing implementation of a programme in partnership with 
UNDP. In 2011, this included the development of the NHRC&#8217;s internal guidelines on 
handling complaints, and training manuals on human rights for Government and law 
enforcement officials. The NHRC also conducted a number of training sessions for 
Government officials and human rights defenders at the regional level, with the technical 
support of OHCHR.   
</p>
<p><b> G. Human rights defenders and journalists 
</b></p>
<p>35. Inadequate public security continues to be a serious issue for human rights 
defenders, particularly in some southern Terai districts where armed criminal groups 
remain active. During 2011, OHCHR received reports of intimidation, harassment, 
defamation and serious physical assault targeting human rights defenders. Impunity for 
perpetrators, in some cases due to political protection or the involvement of law 
enforcement officers, have eroded public confidence and left human rights defenders, 
particularly women, and journalists vulnerable. From January to September 2011, OHCHR 
documented 20 such cases against journalists and six cases of threats against human rights 
defenders. While victims have filed complaints with the police, to date no prosecutions 
have taken place. Alleged perpetrators included political parties and their youth wings, the 
</p>
<p>  
 22  A/HRC/17/5, paras. 106.7 and 25; 107.5. A commitment was also made to review and adopt 
</p>
<p>legislation on the NWC and NDC and to enhance their work through the provision of sufficient 
resources (paras. 106.8, 107.6, 108.11). 
</p>
<p> 23  National Human Rights Commission, <i>Summary Report of NHRC Recommendations upon Complaints 
in a Decade (2000-2010)</i> (Lalitpur, 2010). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>police, armed groups and businessmen. Some human rights defenders remain reluctant to 
file formal complaints due to the perceived involvement of the police or influential political 
leaders.  
</p>
<p>36. In response to a series of high-profile threats and attacks against journalists, in 
September 2011, the Minister of Communications and Information publicly called for new 
legislation to provide protection for human rights defenders and journalists. Such a law 
would be welcome and consistent with the universal periodic review recommendations 
accepted by the Government to ensure the security of human rights defenders.24  
</p>
<p>37. During 2011, OHCHR-Nepal frequently raised concerns with State authorities about 
the protection of defenders at risk. Following interventions in the eastern Terai region in 
August, some positive and concrete steps have now been taken by the Nepal Police to 
protect human rights defenders. For example, in two cases monitored by OHCHR-Nepal, 
the police deployed officers to protect journalists, thereby setting a positive precedent to 
law enforcement officials in other districts and building the confidence of human rights 
defenders to pursue their work with an increased sense of security. OHCHR-Nepal also 
conducted a range of capacity-building activities for human rights defenders, including 
releasing a toolkit and supporting defender networks at district and national levels. The 
Office also engaged police as resource persons in training activities to allow police officers 
and human rights defenders to openly discuss their roles, the problems they face and 
measures to address them.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Human rights violations committed by security forces 
</b></p>
<p>38. The practice of extra-judicial killings by security forces continued during 2011, 
mostly in the southern Terai region. An OHCHR report from 2010,25 documenting 57 
alleged extra-judicial killings between January 2008 and June 2010, recommended that full 
criminal investigations be initiated. However, more than one year later, the State had not 
taken appropriate action, and allegations of 16 new incidents that resulted in the death of 24 
individuals have been made. The Government continues to categorize the cases as 
accidental, &#8220;encounter&#8221; killings or self-defence. In April 2011, family members of victims 
filed a public interest litigation case with the Supreme Court demanding the establishment 
of an independent body to investigate the cases. The Supreme Court ordered the 
Government to respond, but has yet to give a final opinion. OHCHR-Nepal worked to build 
the capacity of human rights defenders and local offices of the Public Prosecutor to 
investigate these cases, although security concerns pose significant challenges. 
</p>
<p>39. During 2011, OHCHR-Nepal continued to receive allegations of ill-treatment of 
persons in custody. Fourteen cases were documented, including incommunicado detention, 
severe physical assault and the illegal use of private houses for interrogation by security 
forces. Despite sustained national and international advocacy, including recommendations 
accepted during the universal periodic review, Nepal has yet to criminalize torture. A new 
draft Criminal Code includes provisions to criminalize torture, but it has not yet been 
passed. The draft also contains a number of provisions, including the definition of torture, 
that fall short of international standards.26 During the review, Nepal rejected the

</i></p>
<p><i>of Concerns (July 2012)</i> (Kathmandu, 2010), available at http://nepal.ohchr.org. 
 26  OHCHR maintains that criminalizing torture in the Criminal Code alone is insufficient, and that there 
</p>
<p>is need for a specific law. The Government states that legislation is being drafted, but it has yet to 
share this publicly. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>recommendation to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.27 In its 
comments to this report, the Government indicated that it is in the process of finalizing a 
comprehensive bill criminalizing torture. 
</p>
<p>40. During the universal periodic review, the Government maintained that 
recommendations relating to investigations and prosecutions of law enforcement officials 
for human rights violations had already been implemented or were in the process of 
implementation, and defended existing mechanisms,28 such as internal inquiry, as adequate 
for dealing with complaints. Nevertheless, the Government stated that it would consider 
establishing a Police Service Commission to be responsible for, inter alia<i>,</i> recommendations 
for disciplinary action; to date there has been no progress on that front. OHCHR-Nepal 
continued to emphasize that internal investigation and disciplinary measures by the security 
forces could not replace independent and credible investigations under the regular criminal 
justice system nor satisfy the right of victims to an effective remedy, as required by 
international law. 
</p>
<p>41. One area where improvement has been noted is the policing of demonstrations. 
OHCHR-Nepal observed increasingly professional crowd-control by the Nepal Police and 
the Armed Police Force, with fewer examples of excessive use of force observed than in 
previous years. In general, the police now demonstrate greater restraint and focus on the 
prevention of possible violent incidents. However, in June 2011, there was an incident of 
excessive, indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force by the police at a Kathmandu 
university campus, which left more than 60 persons requiring medical treatment.29 
</p>
<p>42. OHCHR-Nepal continued to be concerned at the manner in which the police, under 
clear direction from the Ministry of Home Affairs, have prevented members of the Tibetan 
community from exercising their rights to freedom of movement, assembly and association. 
On key ceremonial occasions, including religious festivals and the birthday of the Dalai 
Lama, the police have prevented the participation of the Tibetan community in peaceful 
events through arbitrary arrests and other inappropriate methods. In June 2011, 12 Tibetans 
were detained for nearly three weeks under the Public Offences Act, after displaying the 
Tibetan flag. Their release was ordered by the Supreme Court, confirming that their 
detention had been illegal. That was the fourth time, at least, over the past three years that 
members of Nepal&#8217;s Tibetan community have been detained under the Public Offences Act 
or the Public Security Act and subsequently released, following an appeal to the Supreme 
Court. 
</p>
<p>43. OHCHR-Nepal continued to collaborate with the security forces in capacity-building 
activities, including supporting a reprint of the internal human rights booklet for the Police 
and conducting training for Nepal Army officers prior to their deployment to United 
Nations Peacekeeping Operations. While these capacity-building activities have served to 
educate and sensitize security forces on their human rights obligations and appropriate 
accountability mechanisms, OHCHR-Nepal notes that training alone will not bring about 
lasting change in the conduct of security forces. Revision of internal codes of conduct and 
credible external oversight mechanisms are essential to ensuring the rule of law, including

 29 The incident took place at the Shankardev university campus in Kathmandu, following a 
</p>
<p>demonstration by students protesting the arrest of a student leader. Demonstrators vandalized 
Government vehicles and threw stones at the police, who retaliated by chasing the students inside the 
campus. The police response left 63 persons requiring medical treatment, including several who had 
not been involved in the demonstration. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>through effective investigations and prosecutions when security forces are responsible for 
violations. 
</p>
<p>44. OHCHR, in coordination with UNICEF, continued to monitor the compliance of the 
UCPN-M party with regard to the demobilization of former child soldiers from the Maoist 
army, in accordance with the Action Plan on Security Council resolution 1612 (2005). The 
Special Representative of the Secretary General for children and armed conflict found that, 
while the discharge of Maoist army personnel verified as minors has been completed, there 
are indications of some continued links with the Maoist army, and that a small number of 
verified minors have returned to the cantonment sites.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Transitional justice 
</b></p>
<p>45. A key engagement of OHCHR-Nepal in 2011 focused on providing support for the 
establishment of the transitional justice mechanisms committed to under the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement, namely a Truth and Reconciliation Commission and a 
Commission of Inquiry on Disappearances. The Government of Nepal largely accepted the 
recommendations relating to transitional justice during the universal periodic review and 
committed to establishing the two commissions without delay, in accordance with 
international standards, ensuring independence from political interference, guaranteeing 
reparations to victims, and with no amnesty to perpetrators of grave human rights 
violations.30 Moreover, the Government agreed to remove obstacles faced by victims trying 
to access justice, and to &#8220;prosecute those responsible&#8221; for crimes during the conflict era. 
However, the Government rejected recommendations to ratify the International Convention 
for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.31 The Government 
maintains that allegations of violations committed during the conflict are already being 
investigated under national laws, despite the fact that to date no, or very few, perpetrators 
have being prosecuted before the courts of Nepal.32 
</p>
<p>46.  In recent months, OHCHR provided technical support to the parliamentary sub-
committee tasked with reaching consensus on a number of key issues in the bills for the two 
commissions. Following concerted advocacy, progress was made at the sub-committee 
level towards consistency of the transitional justice mechanisms with international law. 
However, political agreements made towards the end of the year raised serious concerns 
that the transitional justice commissions would serve as amnesty mechanisms, with a 
proposal to remove clauses prohibiting amnesty for serious violations of international 
human rights and humanitarian law from the bills. These concerns were exacerbated by 
public statements from the Prime Minister emphasizing reconciliation rather than justice 
and prosecutions. Other provisions of the bills do not meet international standards, 
including those concerning witness and victim protection, sentencing, the statute of 
limitations period in the Disappearances Commission bill and the public selection process 
for Commissioners. In its comments to this report, the Government indicated that it was in 
the process of drafting a specific law on witness protection. There are further concerns that 
the current interim relief programme might compensate &#8220;conflict-affected persons&#8221; and 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>thereby undermine the creation of a comprehensive and meaningful reparations programme 
which would also seek truth and accountability for victims of gross violations and abuses.33  
</p>
<p>47. To realize effective transitional justice mechanisms and move forward with the 
peace process, the Government must fully support the promulgation of legislation for the 
two commissions in full compliance with international norms and standards, and undertake 
efforts to advance the right of victims to truth and justice. These should include a detailed 
reconnaissance, based on existing data, of alleged grave sites with a view to identifying 
sites for full-scale forensic exhumations. Furthermore, the Government should make a full 
commitment to prosecutions initiated in relation to serious crimes committed during the 
conflict.  
</p>
<p>48. OHCHR-Nepal finalized a reference archive of documentation related to violations 
and abuses committed during the conflict and established a public transitional justice 
resource centre where resource materials on transitional justice are available. A grant 
programme awarded funds to 25 NGOs to implement projects in support of the transitional 
justice process.34 The Office further organized a series of workshops in Kathmandu on the 
bills concerning the two commissions, which culminated in a high-level interaction 
between victims and leaders of major political parties. The workshops provided a platform 
for victims to voice concerns regarding the bills and to submit their views and demands on 
the nature of the commissions. OHCHR-Nepal also assisted the Ministry of Peace and 
Reconstruction with the development of a comprehensive policy framework for reparations. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>49. Impunity remains an endemic problem in Nepal, denying access to justice and an 
effective remedy to victims, weakening the rule of law and perpetuating a cycle of further 
human rights violations and abuses. In 2011, OHCHR-Nepal continued to closely monitor 
and advocate for progress in the investigation and prosecution of serious human rights 
violations in a number of emblematic cases, including through frequent field missions and 
support to victims and their families. The Government accepted a number of general 
recommendations from the universal periodic review aimed at ensuring accountability and 
full respect for judicial decisions.35 However, OHCHR&#8217;s observations reveal that despite 
the commitments made by parties to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement to hold 
perpetrators of human rights violations to account, impunity continues for both conflict-
related and post-conflict cases. The lack of political will to address systematic failures in 
the investigation and prosecution of high-profile crimes has allowed human rights-related 
cases to languish in the hands of the police, who have been unable or unwilling to proceed 
with cases. Furthermore, the police continue to instigate ad hoc &#8220;mediation&#8221; processes 
outside of the criminal justice system, through which cases are informally settled, including 
serious human rights cases such as caste-based discrimination. Nonetheless, even when the 
police make genuine efforts to investigate serious crimes, they may be hindered by political 
interference. For example, in Morang district, police investigating a series of violent attacks 
against journalists were allegedly prevented from serving arrest warrants due to the high-
level political protection of a prime suspect.  
</p>
<p>  
 33 The interim relief programme has been in place since 2008 to provide monetary compensation to 
</p>
<p>victims and families for certain types of human rights violations; the programme does not cover 
torture and sexual violence. 
</p>
<p> 34  Financed through the United Nations Peace Fund for Nepal. 
 35  A/HRC/17/5, paras. 106.35 to 38. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/21/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>50. One troubling trend has been the continued attempts by various Government actions 
to provide amnesties, withdraw criminal cases against politically connected individuals or 
seek pardons in the rare instances where perpetrators have already been convicted. 
Examples include the appointment to Ministerial positions of two persons named in a 
complaint registered with the police concerning abduction and murder, for whom arrest 
warrants had been issued. Withdrawal proceedings have been initiated in relation to 
hundreds of cases over recent years and the September 2011 agreement that formed the new 
Coalition Government also called for the withdrawal of cases and granting of amnesties for 
all &#8220;political cadres&#8221; in relation to the conflict and &#8220;other social justice movements.&#8221; The 
promotion of members of the security forces allegedly implicated in serious human rights 
violations is also a cause for concern. Examples include the July 2011 promotion of a Nepal 
Army General facing allegations of command responsibility over multiple cases of torture 
and disappearances during the conflict, and the Government&#8217;s decision in November 2011 
to promote to the post of Additional Inspector General an officer of the Armed Police Force  
who was directly implicated in the killing of demonstrators during the 2006 pro-democracy 
movement, and for whom criminal prosecution was recommended by a Commission 
appointed by the Government. Furthermore, an alleged perpetrator in the disappearance of 
five students in 2005 was promoted to the post of Additional Inspector General of the Nepal 
Police in June 2011. In July 2011, the Supreme Court instructed the Government to 
guarantee the prompt and effective investigation of the charges against this officer, and to 
ensure that he did not interfere with the investigation. Nepal&#8217;s human rights community has 
reacted strongly against moves towards impunity for conflict-related cases.36 The most 
recent draft Criminal Procedure Code contains provisions that may serve to entrench 
impunity, including immunity from prosecution for State officials for &#8220;acts committed in 
</p>
<p>the discharge of their duties&#8221;. The draft further sanctions the withdrawal of criminal cases, 
unless explicitly prohibited, and fails to include, inter alia, torture and disappearances in the 
list of non-pardonable offences. 
</p>
<p>51. A positive development occurred in February 2011 when the Supreme Court ruled 
that formal permission from district courts is required for any withdrawal request by the 
Government; it ordered two district courts to review their decisions allowing case 
withdrawals. In June 2011, the Supreme Court further instructed that thorough and effective 
investigations could not be &#8220;deferred&#8221; to transitional justice mechanisms that have yet to be 
established, and that the police are obligated to carry out impartial investigations, at this 
time, that are free of political interference. Furthermore, in November 2011, the Supreme 
Court stayed a Government recommendation to pardon a member of the Constituent 
Assembly who had been convicted of murder, stating that such decision is subject to 
judicial review. Respect for the rule of law and accountability for serious crimes are 
necessary foundations for any transition into lasting peace. To guarantee the non-recurrence 
of such abuses, the Government must support cases advancing through the criminal justice 
system, prevent interference with the judiciary, and ensure that perpetrators are not 
receiving protection from political parties or State agents. 
</p>
<p><b> VI.  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>52. Although progress remains slow, Nepal&#8217;s peace process has continued to 
<b>advance. Commitments to completing the outstanding tasks, including the human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights elements, were expressed during the universal periodic review and Nepal has 
</b></p>
<p>  
 36  In June 2011, OHCHR-Nepal and the NHRC jointly launched a legal opinion and organized a public

</b></p>
<p>53.<b> However, a number of obstacles to ensuring a strong human rights framework 
persist. Lack of accountability for human rights violations, whether perpetrated

</b></p>
<p><b>withdraw cases from courts and efforts to provide amnesties and pardons, including

</b></p>
<p><b>structures, such as a police force that systematically resorts to ad-</b>hoc &#8220;mediations<b>,</b>&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>rather than pursue criminal justice, serve to perpetuate this trend. The Government

<p><b>must undertake coherent and systematic measures to effectively protect the human

<p><b>international human rights commitments undertaken by Nepal. Pending draft laws, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including those to establish the two transitional justice commissions and those to 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>55.<b> Pursuant to the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, the High Commissioner calls on the Government of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Nepal to develop a comprehensive strategy, with concrete goals and timetables, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure gender equality and address gender-based violence.  
</b></p>
<p>56.<b> The High Commissioner calls for a time-bound plan to be developed to provide 
</b>&#8220;reasonable accommodation&#8221; for persons with disabilities. Concerning indicators for 
</p>
<p><b>the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, appropriate national goals and 
</b></p>
<p><b>benchmarks should be identified. 
</b></p>
<p>57.<b> The High Commissioner welcomes the new Untouchability Act and calls for the 
comprehensive training of law enforcement officials on the legislation. Full 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation should be undertaken as a priority, including ensuring that the police
