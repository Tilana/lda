<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 68/237, 
entitled &#8220;Proclamation of the International Decade for People of African Descent&#8221;. In 
resolution 68/237, the Assembly requested the President of the Assembly, through the 
facilitator, to continue consultations with States members of the Assembly and other 
stakeholders, with a view to elaborating a programme for the implementation of the 
International Decade for People of African Descent, with a draft programme developed by 
the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action as its basis, to be finalized and adopted during the 
sixty-eighth session of the Assembly and not later than 30 June 2014.  
</p>
<p>2. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 25/33, entitled &#8220;International Decade 
for People of African Descent&#8221;, requested the Intergovernmental Working Group to 
dedicate its programme of work at its twelfth session to the purposes of elaborating a draft 
programme of activities for the implementation of the International Decade for People of 
African Descent.  
</p>
<p>3. In the present report, the Intergovernmental Working Group identifies objectives and 
concrete activities to be conducted at the national, regional and international levels during 
the International Decade for People of African Descent. The report is based on the 
contributions received by the Intergovernmental Working Group from Member States and 
other stakeholders during its twelfth session. It draws on the contributions submitted by the 
Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, the Secretary-General and the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.  
</p>
<p>4. The Intergovernmental Working Group takes note with appreciation of the work 
undertaken by the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent and the 
Secretary-General in their respective reports on the International Decade for People of 
African descent. The content of the draft programme of activities is firmly anchored in the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, the outcome document of the Durban 
Review Conference,1 the political declaration of the high-level meeting of the General 
Assembly to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action2 and the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination, among other important human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Draft programme of activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>5.<b> </b>The International Decade for People of African Descent to be observed from 2015 to 
2024, constitutes an auspicious period of history when the United Nations, Member States, 
civil society and all other relevant actors will join together with people of African descent 
and take effective measures for the implementation of the programme of activities in the 
spirit of recognition, justice and development. The programme of activities recognizes that 
the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action is a comprehensive United Nations 
framework and a solid foundation for combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 See A/CONF.211/8, chap.1. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 General Assembly resolution 66/3. </p>


<p>4  
</p>
<p>and related intolerance, and represent a new stage in the efforts of the United Nations and 
the international community to restore the rights and dignity of people of African descent.  
</p>
<p>6. The implementation of the programme of activities for the International Decade is 
an integral part of the full and effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action and in compliance with the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as the principal international instruments 
for the elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
Important synergies should therefore be achieved through the International Decade in the 
fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. 
</p>
<p>7. The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action acknowledged that people of 
African descent were victims of slavery, the slave trade and colonialism, and continue to be 
victims of their consequences. The Durban process raised the visibility of people of African 
descent and contributed to a substantive advancement in the promotion and protection of 
their rights as a result of concrete actions taken by States, the United Nations, other 
international and regional bodies and civil society. 
</p>
<p>8. Regrettably, despite the above-mentioned advances, racism and racial 
discrimination, both direct and indirect, de facto and de jure, continue to manifest 
themselves in inequality and disadvantage. People of African descent throughout the world, 
whether as descendants of the victims of the transatlantic slave trade or as more recent 
migrants, constitute some of the poorest and most marginalized groups. Studies and 
findings by international and national bodies demonstrate that people of African descent 
still have limited access to quality education, health services, housing and social security. In 
many cases, their situation remains largely invisible, and insufficient recognition and 
respect has been given to the efforts of people of African descent to seek redress for their 
present condition. They all too often experience discrimination in their access to justice, 
and face alarmingly high rates of police violence, together with racial profiling. 
Furthermore, their degree of political participation is often low, both in voting and in 
occupying political positions.  
</p>
<p>9. People of African descent can suffer from multiple, aggravated or intersecting forms 
of discrimination based on other related grounds, such as age, sex, language, religion, 
political or other opinion, social origin, property, disability, birth, or other status.  
</p>
<p>10. The promotion and protection of human rights of people of African descent should 
be a priority concern for the United Nations. In this regard, the international Decade for 
People of African Descent is a timely and important initiative, a unique opportunity to 
underline the important contribution made by people of African descent to our societies and 
to propose concrete measures to promote their full inclusion and to combat racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Theme of the International Decade 
</b></p>
<p>11. As proclaimed by the General Assembly in its resolution 68/237, the theme for the 
International Decade is &#8220;People of African descent: recognition, justice and development&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Objectives of the International Decade 
</b>12. Non-discrimination and equality before and of the law constitute fundamental 
principles of international human rights law, and underpin the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the main international human rights treaties and instruments. As such, 
the main objective of the International Decade should be to promote respect, protection and </p>


<p>fulfilment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by people of African descent, as 
recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This main objective can be 
achieved through the full and effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action, the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference, the 
political declaration commemorating the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action,2 and through the universal accession to or 
ratification of, and full implementation of the obligations arising under the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and other relevant 
international and regional human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p>13. The International Decade shall focus on the following specific objectives:  
(a)  To strengthen national, regional and international action and cooperation in 
</p>
<p>relation to the full enjoyment of economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights by 
people of African descent, and their full and equal participation in all aspects of society; 
</p>
<p>(b)  To promote a greater knowledge of and respect for the diverse heritage, 
culture and contribution of people of African descent to the development of societies;  
</p>
<p>(c)  To adopt and strengthen national, regional and international legal 
frameworks in accordance with the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 
and to ensure their full and effective implementation.

and relocation points, and by protecting related cultural sites. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Information-gathering 
</b>17. In accordance with paragraph 92 of the Durban Programme of Action, States should 
collect, compile, analyse, disseminate and publish reliable statistical data at the national 
and local levels, and take all other related measures necessary to assess regularly the 
situation of people of African descent who are victims of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance.

protection regulations and privacy guarantees. 
</p>
<p>[18. alt. Such statistical data should be disaggregated in accordance with national 
legislation, upholding the right to privacy and the principle of self-identification.] 
</p><p>19.  The information should be collected to monitor the situation of People of African 
Descent, assess progress made, increase their visibility, and identify social gaps. It should 
also be used to asses and guide the formulation of policies and actions to prevent, combat 
and eradicate racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance;  
</p>
<p><b>(d) Participation and inclusion 
</b>20. States should adopt measures to enable the full, equal and effective participation of 
people of African descent in public and political affairs without discrimination, in 
accordance with international human rights law. 
</p>
<p><b>  2. Justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>  (a) Access to justice

administering justice; 
</p>
<p>(b) Designing, implementing and enforcing effective measures to eliminate the 
phenomenon popularly known as &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; and comprising the practice of police 
and other law enforcement officers [relying, to any degree] [based solely] [placing 
unwarranted reliance] on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin as the basis for 
subjecting persons to investigatory activities or for determining whether an individual is 
engaged in criminal activity; 
</p>

tribunals just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for any damage suffered as a result of 
such discrimination;  
</p>
<p>(e) Adopting effective and appropriate measures, including legal measures as 
appropriate, to combat all acts of racism, in particular the dissemination of ideas based on 
racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial hatred, violence or incitement to racial 
violence, as well as racist propaganda activities and participation in racist organizations. 
States are also encouraged to ensure that such motivations are considered an aggravating 
factor for the purpose of sentencing; 
</p>
<p>(f) Facilitating access to justice for people of African descent who are victims of 
racism by providing the requisite legal information about their rights, and providing legal

tribunal, guarantees of justice, and all the rights to which prisoners are entitled;  
</p>
<p>(i) Acknowledging and profoundly regretting the untold suffering and evils 
inflicted on millions of men, women and children as a result of slavery, the slave trade, the 
transatlantic slave trade, colonialism, apartheid, genocide and past tragedies, noting that 
some States have taken the initiative to apologize and have paid reparation, where 
appropriate, for grave and massive violations committed, and calling on those that have not 
yet expressed remorse or presented apologies to find some way to contribute to the 
restoration of the dignity of victims; 
</p>
<p>(j) Inviting the international community and its members to honour the memory

to this end, appreciate those countries that have done so;  
</p>
<p>(k) Calling upon all States concerned to take appropriate and effective measures 
to halt and reverse the lasting consequences of those practices, bearing in mind their moral 
obligations.  
</p>
<p><b>   (b)  Special measures 
</b>22. The adoption of special measures, such as affirmative action, where appropriate is 
essential to alleviating and remedying disparities in the enjoyment of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms affecting people of African descent, protecting them from 
discrimination and overcoming persistent or structural disparities and de facto inequalities 
resulting from historical circumstances. As such, States should develop or elaborate 
national plans of action to promote diversity, equality, social justice, equality of opportunity </p>


<p>and the participation of all. By means of, inter alia, affirmative or positive actions and 
strategies, these plans should aim at creating conditions for all to participate effectively in 
decision-making and to realize civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights in all 
spheres of life on the basis of non-discrimination.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  3. Development 
</b></p>
<p>  <b>(a)  Right to development and measures against poverty 
</b>23. Consistent with the Declaration on the Right to Development, States should adopt 
measures aimed at guaranteeing active, free and meaningful participation by all individuals, 
including people of African descent, in development and decision-making related thereto 
and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom.  
</p>
<p>24. Recognizing that poverty is both a cause and a consequence of discrimination, States 
should, as appropriate, adopt or strengthen national programmes for eradicating poverty and 
reducing social exclusion that take account of the specific needs and experiences of people 
of African descent, and should also expand their efforts to foster bilateral, regional and 
international cooperation in implementing those programmes. 
</p>
<p>25. States should implement actions to protect ancestral groups of people of African 
descent. 
</p>
<p>  <b>(b) Education 
</b>26. States should take all necessary measures to give effect to the right of people of 
African descent, particularly children and young people, to free primary education and 
access to all levels and forms of quality public education without discrimination. States 
should: 
</p>
<p>(a) Ensure that quality education is accessible and available in areas where 
communities of African descent live, particularly in rural and marginalized communities, 
with attention to improving the quality of public education; 
</p>
<p>(b) Take measures to ensure that public and private education systems do not 
discriminate against or exclude children of African descent, and that they are protected 
from direct or indirect discrimination, negative stereotyping, stigmatization and violence 
from peers or teachers; to this end, training and sensitization should be provided to teachers 
and measures should be taken to increase the number of teachers of African descent 
working in educational institutions. 
</p>
<p>  <b>(c) Employment 
</b>27. States should take concrete measures to eliminate racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance in the workplace against [all workers of African 
descent, including migrants of African descent,] [all workers, in particular people of 
African descent, including migrants,] and ensure the full equality of all before the law, 
including labour law, and eliminate barriers, where appropriate, to participation in 
vocational training, collective bargaining, employment, contracts and trade union activity; 
access to judicial and administrative tribunals dealing with grievances; seeking employment 
in different parts of their country of residence; and working in safe and healthy conditions. 
</p>
<p>  <b>(d) Health 
</b>28. States should take measures to improve access to quality health services to people of 
African descent. 
</p>
<p><b>(e) Housing</b> </p>


<p>10  
</p>
<p>29. Recognizing the poor and insecure housing conditions in which many people of 
African descent live, States should develop and implement policies and projects as 
appropriate aimed at, inter alia, ensuring that they gain and sustain a safe and secure home 
and community in which to live in peace and dignity.  
</p>
<p><b>  4. Multiple or aggravated discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>30. States should adopt and implement policies and programmes that provide effective 
protection for, and review and repeal all policies and laws that could discriminate against, 
people of African descent facing multiple, aggravated or intersecting forms of 
discrimination based on other related grounds, such as sex, language, religion, political or 
other opinion, social origin, property, birth, disability or other status. 
</p>
<p>31. States should mainstream a gender perspective when designing and monitoring 
public policies, taking into account the specific needs and realities of women and girls of 
African descent, including in the area of sexual and reproductive rights, and ensure 
adequate access to maternal health care. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Regional and international levels 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Steps to be taken by the international community, and international and regional 
organizations 
</b></p>
<p>32.  The international community, international and regional organizations, in particular 
relevant United Nations programmes, funds, specialized agencies and other bodies, 
international financial and development institutions, regional organizations and other 
international mechanisms within their areas of competence should give high priority to 
programmes and projects specifically tailored for combating racism and racial 
discrimination against people of African descent, taking fully into account the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action, the outcome document of the Durban Review 
Conference, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination and the political declaration of the high-level meeting of the General 
Assembly to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action, and, should, inter alia: 
</p>
<p>(a) Take measures to raise awareness about the International Decade, including 
through awareness-raising campaigns, and organizing and supporting other activities, 
bearing in mind the theme of the Decade;  
</p>
<p>(b) Continue to disseminate widely the Durban Declaration and Programme of 
Action, the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference and the political 
declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly to commemorate the tenth 
anniversary of the adoption of the on the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action; 
</p>
<p>(c) Continue to raise awareness about the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination;  
</p>
<p>(d) Assist States in the full and effective implementation of the obligations 
arising under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, and in ratifying or acceding to the Convention, with a view to attain its 
universal ratification;  
</p>
<p>(e) Assist States in the full and effective implementation of their commitments 
under the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action; 
</p>
<p>(f) Incorporate human rights into development programmes, including in the 
areas of access to and enjoyment of the rights to education, employment, health, housing, 
land and labour; </p>


<p>(g) Assign particular priority to the projects devoted to the collection of 
statistical data; 
</p>
<p>(h) Support initiatives and projects aimed at honouring and preserving the 
historical memory of people of African descent; 
</p>
<p>(i) Use the Decade as an opportunity to engage with people of African descent 
on issues of [their concern] [reparation and reconciliation for slavery, the slave trade and 
the transatlantic slave trade in captured African people] and, to this end, ensure the 
participation of and consultation with non-governmental organizations, other stakeholders 
and civil society at large; 
</p>
<p>(j) In planning activities for the Decade, examine how existing programmes and 
resources might be utilized to benefit people of African descent more effectively; 
</p>
<p>(k) Give due consideration to the goals and objectives aimed at the elimination of 
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against people of African 
descent in the discussions held by the United Nations on the post-2015 development 
agenda.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Steps and measures to be taken by the General Assembly 
</b>33. The General Assembly should: 
</p>
<p>(a) Appoint the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to act as 
coordinator of the Decade in order to follow up on the implementation of activities in the 
framework of the Decade; 
</p>
<p>(b) Request the Secretary-General to present an annual progress report on the 
implementation of activities of the Decade, taking into account information and views 
provided by States, relevant human rights bodies, organs and mechanisms of the United 
Nations, specialized agencies, funds and programmes, international, regional, subregional 
and non-governmental organizations, including organizations of people of African descent, 
national human rights institutions and other stakeholders;  
</p>
<p>(c) Request the Department of Public Information, in collaboration with the 
United Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization, the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and regional and subregional organizations 
to launch an awareness-raising campaign to inform the general public of the history, 
contributions, including to the global development, challenges, contemporary experiences 
and situation of human rights of people of African descent;  
</p>
<p>(d) Encourage the issuance of a stamp by the United Nations postal

<p><b>Annex I  
  Letter dated 16 May 2014 from the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective 
Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme 
of Action addressed to the President of the Human Rights 
Council 
</b></p>
<p>The General Assembly, in its resolution 68/237 of 23 December 2013, requested the 
Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the Durban 
Declaration and Programme of Action to develop a draft programme for the 
implementation of the International Decade for People of African Descent, to be finalized 
and adopted during the sixty-eighth session of the Assembly and not later than 30 June 
</p><p>2014.  
</p>
<p>In its resolution 25/33 of 28 March 2014, the Human Rights Council emphasized the 
need to urgently heed the instruction of the General Assembly, and in this regard requested 
the Intergovernmental Working Group to dedicate its programme of work at its twelfth 
session to the for purposes of elaborating a programme of activities for the implementation 
of the International Decade for People of African Descent and to present its final report in 
this regard to the Council at its twenty-sixth session for adoption and transmission to the 
General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>The Intergovernmental Working Group held its twelfth session from 7 to 17 April 
</p><p>2014. Further consultations were also held from 29 April to 2 May 2014 and on 8 and 9 
May 2014. The report of the Intergovernmental Working Group (A/HRC/26/55) contains a 
draft programme of activities for the International Decade for People of African Descent. 
The draft programme identifies objectives and concrete activities to be conducted at the 
national, regional and international levels.  
</p>
<p>As requested by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 25/33, the draft 
programme draws from the already developed and existing draft programme of action for 
the Decade for People of African Descent (A/HRC/21/60/Add.2) as already elaborated by 
the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent and discussed in the report of 
the Secretary-General on how to make the International Decade for People of African 
Descent effective (A/67/879). Written contributions were received from some Member 
States and regional groups. The Working Group took also into account the contributions 
previously received from the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Some 
non-governmental organizations also attended the session. 
</p>
<p>While the Intergovernmental Working Group has made significant progress, the 
draft programme still contains some paragraphs (contained inside square brackets) on 
which consensus was not reached. On these particular paragraphs and issues, further 
consultations will be needed during the session of the General Assembly, as provided for in 
Assembly resolution 68/237, in which the Assembly requested the President of the 
Assembly, through the facilitator, to continue consultations with States members of the 
Assembly and other stakeholders, with a view to elaborating a programme for the 
implementation of the International Decade, with a draft programme developed by the 
Intergovernmental Working Group as its basis, to be finalized and adopted during the sixty-
eighth session of the Assembly and not later than 30 June 2014. 
</p>
<p>While there is a clear need for broader and deeper consultations, I would strongly 
recommend that such consultations focus on the bracketed paragraphs, as reflected in the 
report of the Intergovernmental Working Group. 
</p>
<p>Taking into account General Assembly resolution 68/237 and that the programme 
needs to be adopted by the Assembly not later than 30 June 2014, it is important that the </p>


<p>14  
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council consider the report and take appropriate action on item 9 of its 
agenda at the earliest date possible. I therefore request you, Mr. President, to discuss 
urgently this issue with the Bureau of the Council.
