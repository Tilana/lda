<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>     Eleventh Session  
</b></p>
<p><b> Resolution 11/8.  Preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and human rights 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the Programme of Action of 
the International Conference on Population and Development and their Review Conferences and 
the targets and commitments regarding the reduction of maternal mortality and universal access 
to reproductive health, including those contained in the 2000 Millennium Declaration 
(General Assembly resolution 55/2) and the 2005 World Summit Outcome (General Assembly 
resolution 60/1), 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the Goals on improving 
maternal health, promoting gender equality and empowering women, reducing child and infant 
mortality and the development of a global partnership,<b>1</b>  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the obligations of States parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Their Families, 
</p>
<p> <i>Convinced</i> that increased political will and commitment, cooperation and technical 
assistance at the international and national levels are urgently required to reduce the 
unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the leading role of the World Health Organization in maternal health and the 
work under the annual World Health Assembly agenda item on the monitoring of the 
achievement of the health-related Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing also</i> that the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal mortality 
and morbidity is a health, development and human rights challenge, and that a human rights 
analysis of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and the integration of a human rights 
perspective in international and national responses to maternal mortality and morbidity could 
contribute positively to the common goal of reducing this rate, with a view to eliminating 
preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> the ongoing efforts of the United Nations human rights treaty bodies to 
highlight the human rights aspects of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity, including 
those of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Human Rights 
Committee, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Committee on Economic, Social and 
                                                 
<b>1</b>  Millennium Development Goals 5, 3, 4 and 8, respectively. </p>

</p>
<p>Cultural Rights, and of the special procedures, in particular those described in the report of the 
Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard 
of physical and mental health (A/61/338), 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the Council has a constructive role to play in raising awareness of the 
human rights aspects of the unacceptably high global rate of maternal mortality and morbidity 
and in supporting, promoting and enhancing existing national and international efforts to reduce 
this rate, 
</p>
<p> <i>Welcoming</i> its initiative to hold an interactive dialogue at its eighth regular session on 
maternal mortality and the human rights of women, on 5 June 2008, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that preventable maternal mortality and morbidity affects women and their 
families in all regions and cultures, and that it is exacerbated by factors such as poverty, gender 
inequality, age and multiple forms of discrimination, as well as factors such as lack of access to 
adequate health facilities and technology, and lack of infrastructure, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Expresses grave concern</i> at the unacceptably high global rate of preventable maternal 
mortality and morbidity, noting in this regard that the World Health Organization has assessed 
that over 1,500 women and girls die every day as a result of preventable complications occurring 
before, during and after pregnancy and childbirth, and that, globally, maternal mortality is the 
leading cause of death among women and of girls of reproductive age; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recognizes</i> that most instances of maternal mortality and morbidity are preventable, 
and that preventable maternal mortality and morbidity is a health, development and human rights 
challenge that also requires the effective promotion and protection of the human rights of women 
and girls, in particular their rights to life, to be equal in dignity, to education, to be free to seek, 
receive and impart information, to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress, to freedom from 
discrimination, and to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, 
including sexual and reproductive health; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> all States to renew their political commitment to eliminating preventable 
maternal mortality and morbidity at the local, national, regional and international levels, and to 
redouble their efforts to ensure the full and effective implementation of their human rights 
obligations, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the Programme of Action of the 
International Conference on Population and Development and their review conferences, and the 
Millennium Declaration and the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the Goals on 
improving maternal health and promoting gender equality and empowering women,<b>2</b> including 
through the allocation of necessary domestic resources to health systems; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also requests</i> States to give renewed emphasis to maternal mortality and morbidity 
initiatives in their development partnerships and cooperation arrangements, including by 
honouring existing commitments and considering new commitments, and the exchange of 
effective practices and technical assistance to strengthen national capacities, as well as to 
integrate a human rights perspective into such initiatives, addressing the impact that 
discrimination against women has on maternal mortality and morbidity; 
</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>2</b>  Millennium Development Goals 5 and 3. </p>

<p> 3
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages</i> States and other relevant stakeholders, including national human rights 
institutions and non-governmental organizations, to give increased attention and resources to 
preventable maternal mortality and morbidity in their engagement with the United Nations 
human rights system, including with the human rights treaty bodies, the universal periodic 
review and special procedures; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
prepare a thematic study on preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and human rights, in 
consultation with States, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund, 
the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund, the World Bank and all other relevant stakeholders, and 
requests that the study include identification of the human rights dimensions of preventable 
maternal mortality and morbidity in the existing international legal framework; an overview of 
initiatives and activities within the United Nations system to address all causes of preventable 
maternal mortality and morbidity; identification of how the Council can add value to existing 
initiatives through a human rights analysis, including efforts to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goal on improving maternal health,<b>3</b> and recommended options for better 
addressing the human rights dimension of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity 
throughout the United Nations system; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Decides</i> to address the thematic study requested in paragraph 6 above within the 
programme of work of its fourteenth session, and to consider taking further possible action on 
preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and human rights at that session, and invites the 
Office of the High Commissioner, the World Health Organization, the United Nations 
Population Fund and the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the 
highest attainable standard of physical and mental health to participate in an interactive dialogue 
on the study in the Council.
