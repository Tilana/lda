<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 25/32. 
</p>
<p>It builds upon a report of the previous mandate holder (A/HRC/15/53), in which the then 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur discussed, among other issues, the question of racial profiling by law 
</p>
<p>enforcement agencies, and expressed concern about individuals from minority groups or 
</p>
<p>migrant backgrounds regularly being subjected to stops and searches, interrogations and 
</p>
<p>arrests by police and immigration officials, in a discriminatory manner, on the basis of their 
</p>
<p>perceived ethnic or religious affiliation. It also builds upon reports on country visits 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/20/33/Add.1 and A/HRC/23/56/Add.2), and takes into account recent 
</p>
<p>developments and information gathered, notably through an expert meeting and additional 
</p>
<p>research on the phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>2. Racial and ethnic profiling is commonly understood to mean a reliance by law 
</p>
<p>enforcement, security and border control personnel on race, colour, descent or national or 
</p>
<p>ethnic origin as a basis for subjecting persons to detailed searches, identity checks and 
</p>
<p>investigations, or for determining whether an individual is engaged in criminal activity. 
</p>
<p>Racial and ethnic profiling has been a persistent and pervasive issue in law enforcement, 
</p>
<p>and its use has often arisen in connection with policies on national security and 
</p>
<p>immigration. Police, immigration and detention officials often target various ethnic, 
</p>
<p>religious or racial groups. Since 11 September 2001, in the United States of America and 
</p>
<p>other countries, new patterns and contexts of racial and ethnic profiling have reportedly 
</p>
<p>been affecting a growing number of individuals and minority groups. In Europe, law 
</p>
<p>enforcement officials have reportedly targeted similar groups, especially since the recent 
</p>
<p>economic crisis. Racial and ethnic profiling has also been reported in other parts of the 
</p>
<p>world, such as Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Racial and ethnic profiling can thus 
</p>
<p>exacerbate discrimination already suffered as a result of ethnic origin or minority status. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur is mandated by Human Rights Council resolution 7/34 of 
</p>
<p>28 March 2008 to address the practice of profiling and how it relates to counter-terrorism 
</p>
<p>measures. The successive mandate holders have addressed this issue through their country 
</p>
<p>visits and communications to Member States. The current Special Rapporteur drew 
</p>
<p>attention to the issue of racial profiling in a country visit report that he presented to the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council (A/HRC/23/56/Add.2). In various reports, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>has highlighted new exacerbating contexts and has urged States to undertake urgent and 
</p>
<p>comprehensive measures to combat this phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>4. Important measures have been taken at the international, regional and national levels 
</p>
<p>to address the challenge of racial and ethnic profiling, ranging from the elaboration of an 
</p>
<p>international legal framework, to regular assessments of States by United Nations and 
</p>
<p>regional mechanisms, to the enactment and strengthening of legislative and criminal justice 
</p>
<p>processes at the national level, to better collection of data and the training of law 
</p>
<p>enforcement officers. Nevertheless, racial and ethnic profiling has persisted and continues 
</p>
<p>to pose a serious challenge to the realization of the rights of individuals of some racial, 
</p>
<p>ethnic and religious groups, across the world, and particularly in the light of contemporary 
</p>
<p>counter-terrorism measures. 
</p>
<p>5. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur summarizes his activities, examines the 
</p>
<p>context that has led to the use of racial and ethnic profiling, and provides an overview of 
</p>
<p>the different manifestations of racial and ethnic profiling by law enforcement agencies such 
</p>
<p>as the police, immigration agencies and other security entities. He then provides an 
</p>
<p>overview of the legal, policy and regulatory frameworks prohibiting racial profiling and of 
</p>
<p>the relevant policies and laws that have been adopted at the international, regional and 
</p>
<p>national levels, before presenting different examples of good practices that have been </p>


<p>initiated and implemented to counter the use of racial profiling in law enforcement, by 
</p>
<p>international and regional organizations, Governments, law enforcement agencies 
</p>
<p>themselves, and civil society. The conclusions and recommendations are outlined in 
</p>
<p>section IV. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Greece and 
</p>
<p>welcomes the agreement on dates for his visit in May 2015. He also hopes to receive a 
</p>
<p>positive reply to his requests to make visits to Argentina and South Africa before the end of 
</p>
<p>2015.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur renewed his requests to visit Fiji, India, Japan and Thailand, 
</p>
<p>for which he was awaiting invitations at the time of writing.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur visited the Republic of Korea from 29 September to 
</p>
<p>6 October 2014 (see A/HRC/29/46/Add.1). He expresses his gratitude to the Government 
</p>
<p>for its cooperation and openness in the preparation and conduct of his visit.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Other activities 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur was the keynote speaker at a round table on racial and 
</p>
<p>ethnic profiling in police stop-and-search operations, organized by the Federal Anti-
</p>
<p>Discrimination Agency of Germany and held on 16 June 2014 in Berlin. The conference 
</p>
<p>brought together international experts and academics to discuss challenges and good 
</p>
<p>practices in Europe on this issue. 
</p>
<p>10. On the margins of the twenty-sixth session of the Human Rights Council, on 26 June 
</p>
<p>2014, the Special Rapporteur held a side event on racism on the Internet and social media, 
</p>
<p>with the participation of the Executive Secretary of the European Commission against 
</p>
<p>Racism and Intolerance, the Vice-Chair of the Federal Commission against Racism, of 
</p>
<p>Switzerland, and a representative of the Association for Progressive Communications 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/26/49). 
</p>
<p>11. On 24 and 25 March 2015, the Special Rapporteur was invited as a panellist to a 
</p>
<p>United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) round table 
</p>
<p>entitled &#8220;Fighting racism and discrimination: history, memory and contemporary 
</p>
<p>challenges&#8221;, held to commemorate International Day for the Elimination of Racial 
</p>
<p>Discrimination, at UNESCO headquarters in Paris. The conference examined the use of 
</p>
<p>archives relating to the slave trade for the preservation of historical memory and for 
</p>
<p>awareness and education.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Racial and ethnic profiling in law enforcement agencies 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Context 
</b></p>
<p>12. Racial profiling has been a long-standing issue of concern for this mandate. In a 
</p>
<p>report to the Human Rights Council on the manifestations of defamation of religions, and in 
</p>
<p>particular on the ongoing serious implications of Islamophobia, for the enjoyment of all 
</p>
<p>rights by their followers, the then Special Rapporteur highlighted some cases of racial and </p>


<p>ethnic profiling and stressed his concern about individuals from minority groups or migrant 
</p>
<p>backgrounds regularly being subjected to stops and searches, interrogations and arrests in a 
</p>
<p>discriminatory manner by law enforcement and immigration officials, solely on the basis of 
</p>
<p>their perceived ethnic or religious affiliation. He called upon States not to resort to these 
</p>
<p>practices, which were discriminatory and prohibited by international law (A/HRC/15/53 
</p>
<p>and Corr.1).  
</p>
<p>13. The current Special Rapporteur has, in various reports, highlighted the continuing 
</p>
<p>problem of racial and ethnic profiling. In particular, and with regard to counter-terrorism, 
</p>
<p>he has noted that migrants and minority groups are particularly vulnerable to these law 
</p>
<p>enforcement practices, and that the global economic crisis only exacerbated the 
</p>
<p>discrimination already taking place. The Special Rapporteur has continued to receive 
</p>
<p>reports of racial and ethnic profiling across the globe, which points to the persistence of the 
</p>
<p>problem in regular law enforcement activities, not only in the area of counter-terrorism. 
</p>
<p>14. The present report is intended to highlight the continuing violations, and to propose 
</p>
<p>measures to address the problem of racial and ethnic profiling. In the report, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur illustrates some manifestations of racial and ethnic profiling by different law 
</p>
<p>enforcement agencies in various parts of the world. He discusses the applicable legislation 
</p>
<p>and standards at the international, regional and national levels, and provides some examples 
</p>
<p>of good practices that have been implemented by Governments and local authorities as well 
</p>
<p>as by civil society actors.  
</p>
<p>15. The report builds on the work of previous mandate holders, on studies and reports 
</p>
<p>by other special procedures mandate holders, and on the current Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>previous studies. In order to discuss the different manifestations of profiling, and to look at 
</p>
<p>good practices undertaken, the Special Rapporteur held an expert meeting, in partnership 
</p>
<p>with the Faculty of Law of the University of California, Los Angeles, on 11 and 12 
</p>
<p>November 2014, that was attended by a wide range of experts, academics and 
</p>
<p>representatives of civil society organizations. Discussions were held on the key trends in 
</p>
<p>the different manifestations of racial and ethnic profiling in police activities, at border and 
</p>
<p>immigration facilities, and in detention facilities, on the impunity and lack of accountability 
</p>
<p>for such acts committed by law enforcement agents, and on the need for disaggregated data 
</p>
<p>collection and analysis to document these manifestations and the need to propose 
</p>
<p>alternative law enforcement methods. Views were exchanged on the key legal and policy 
</p>
<p>measures that had been taken at the international, regional and national levels, and on some 
</p>
<p>good practices in combating racial and ethnic profiling that had been taken by States, 
</p>
<p>international and regional organizations, civil society and the private sector. Some of those 
</p>
<p>practices are included in the present report. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Faculty of 
</p>
<p>Law of the University of California, Los Angeles for its assistance in the successful 
</p>
<p>outcome of the expert meeting.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Manifestations of racial and ethnic profiling by law enforcement 
</b></p>
<p><b>agencies  
</b></p>
<p>16. Police, immigration and detention officials frequently employ racial and ethnic 
</p>
<p>profiling, in many different and pernicious ways. Government policies may also facilitate 
</p>
<p>discretionary practices that allow law enforcement authorities to target groups or 
</p>
<p>individuals on the basis of their skin colour, dress or facial hair or the languages they speak. 
</p>
<p>Implicit biases also sometimes motivate profiling. Although some studies have 
</p>
<p>demonstrated how ineffective racial and ethnic profiling is, officials continue to use the </p>


<p>practice.1 One manifestation is the use of stop and frisk or stop and check mechanisms to 
</p>
<p>target minorities. This practice results in the disproportionate targeting of these often 
</p>
<p>vulnerable populations.2 For example, in one South Pacific State, black males were subject 
</p>
<p>to field contact by police officers at a rate 2.4 times higher than their representation in the 
</p>
<p>general population.3 In Europe, Roma communities are subjected to unequal levels of 
</p>
<p>identity checks, and in some cases, the police stop Roma pedestrians three times more often 
</p>
<p>than non-Roma pedestrians.4 In one North American state, despite accounting for only 
</p>
<p>24 per cent of the population, persons of African descent were the subject of 63.3 per cent 
</p>
<p>of stops of civilians by the police.5 
</p>
<p>17. Additionally, the police may disproportionately target certain minority groups for 
</p>
<p>traffic stops. In one North American state, observers have documented police targeting 
</p>
<p>drivers unevenly on the basis of their appearance.6 The observers found no statistically 
</p>
<p>significant difference in driving behaviour, yet 73.2 per cent of those stopped and arrested 
</p>
<p>were persons of African descent even though such persons comprised only 13.5 per cent of 
</p>
<p>all drivers and passengers.7 Another report found that, in a municipality where this group 
</p>
<p>made up 67 per cent of the population, 85 per cent of cars stopped by the police were from 
</p>
<p>this group, as were 90 per cent of those summoned to court and 93 per cent of those 
</p>
<p>arrested; in addition, the use of force by police officers was, in 88 per cent of cases, 
</p>
<p>directed against persons of African descent. Similarly, in the judicial system in the same 
</p>
<p>city, this group accounted for 95 per cent of convictions for pedestrian offences and 92 per 
</p>
<p>cent of offences of disturbing the peace.8 
</p>
<p>18. A related manifestation of racial and ethnic profiling occurs when officials perform 
</p>
<p>identity checks, ostensibly to address irregular immigration. In these types of stops, police 
</p>
<p>or immigration authorities demand the production of identity documents to verify residence 
</p>
<p>status in the country. Authorities use identity checks to target these persons and to stop and 
</p>
<p>arrest asylum seekers.9 In Europe, authorities are more likely to stop males of African and

<p>Middle Eastern origin and from other minority populations on the basis of their appearance. 
</p>
<p>A study in one Eastern European State showed that the police there disproportionately 
</p>
<p>targeted persons of non-Slavic appearance on the metro.10 Law enforcement officials have 
</p>
<p>also targeted persons on the basis of their religion and conducted mass identity checks 
</p>
<p>outside mosques.11  
</p>
<p>19. Another manifestation of racial and ethnic profiling is the increased use of force 
</p>
<p>against minority populations by law enforcement officials.12 In one Latin American State, 
</p>
<p>persons of African descent were subjected to lethal force by the police at a rate that was two 
</p>
<p>times higher than their overall representation in the population.13 In the country concerned, 
</p>
<p>lethal force by the police is frequently targeted at minority communities, often with the 
</p>
<p>justification of controlling riots between those communities and the native population. 
</p>
<p>20. Racial and ethnic profiling in the context of immigration takes place at points of 
</p>
<p>entry into States &#8212; official border crossings, and transportation hubs such as airports, 
</p>
<p>railway stations and bus depots. At these locations, customs and border agencies force 
</p>
<p>particular individuals or groups to undergo additional security checks and interviews. Often 
</p>
<p>these persons are targeted because of the interrelatedness of immigration status with 
</p>
<p>nationality, race or ethnicity. Security measures and surveillance policies enacted in relation 
</p>
<p>to counter-terrorism efforts also motivate the use of racial and ethnic profiling. Indeed, 
</p>
<p>around the world, States have regularized these processes such that they have become 
</p>
<p>permanent fixtures of immigration systems.14 
</p>
<p>21. Within States, national and local authorities employ racial and ethnic profiling in 
</p>
<p>their enforcement of immigration rules (A/HRC/17/33/Add.4). In some federal States, 
</p>
<p>agreements between the central government and local police agencies lead to the 
</p>
<p>overdelegation of front-end authority to persons likely to engage in profiling &#8212; a situation 
</p>
<p>where non-immigration officials are directly enforcing immigration policy. Provinces and 
</p>
<p>municipalities have enacted policies aimed at supplementing federal legislation, too. In both 
</p>
<p>scenarios, discretionary powers enable profiling at the stop, arrest, investigation and 
</p>
<p>prosecution stages.15 
</p>
<p>22. Profiling in immigration also limits the ability of victims to travel. For instance, 
</p>
<p>States&#8217; refusal to issue birth registration and identification documents to members of 
</p>
<p>particular ethnic groups impedes the movement of persons across borders and their access 
</p>
<p>to State benefits (A/69/398). Sometimes, States permit or facilitate the use of racial and 
</p>
<p>ethnic profiling by private actors. One Middle Eastern State allegedly restricts the 
</p>
<p>movements of travellers of a particular ethnicity, including its own citizens. Furthermore, it 
</p>
<p>reportedly allows an airline to subject this group to extensive search procedures 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/67). Profiling by private and governmental actors may also be facilitated by 
</p>
<p>technology. Corporations have developed &#8220;risk profiling&#8221; software that they sell to law

<p>enforcement agencies for use at border checkpoints and in criminal databases. This has led 
</p>
<p>to concerns about profiling being institutionalized.16  
</p>
<p>23. Racial and ethnic profiling is also manifested in the broad discretion allowed in 
</p>
<p>States&#8217; criminal justice systems. Studies have identified a strong correlation between 
</p>
<p>minority status and harsher criminal sentences.17 Evidence from some States shows that 
</p>
<p>implicit bias, including stereotypes that people of colour are violent, affects criminal 
</p>
<p>investigations.  
</p>
<p>24. High levels of discretion in States&#8217; criminal justice systems facilitate racial and 
</p>
<p>ethnic profiling and result in a disproportionate representation of minority populations in 
</p>
<p>detention facilities.18 In 2014, 60 per cent of those incarcerated in one North American state 
</p>
<p>were members of racial and ethnic minorities.19 Additionally, several states have initiated 
</p>
<p>campaigns to crack down on drug use. Those campaigns have resulted in a severe 
</p>
<p>disproportionality of minorities in the composition of prison populations.20 For example, 
</p>
<p>one study carried out in a North American state found that males of African descent were 
</p>
<p>nearly 12 times more likely to be sent to prison for a drug offence than other men, despite 
</p>
<p>surveys showing that both groups used and sold drugs at roughly the same rates.21 
</p>
<p><b> C. Legal policy and regulatory frameworks prohibiting racial and ethnic 
</b></p>
<p><b>profiling, and similar measures, policies and laws adopted at the 
</b></p>
<p><b>international, regional and national levels 
</b></p>
<p>25. In response to the manifestations of the phenomenon described above, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur recalls that international and regional organizations and States have adopted a 
</p>
<p>variety of laws and instruments to combat and prohibit the use of racial and ethnic 
</p>
<p>profiling. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. International legal policy and regulatory frameworks 
</b></p>
<p>26. Racial and ethnic profiling is prohibited under international human rights law and is 
</p>
<p>contrary to various provisions such as the right to live free from racial discrimination, the 
</p>
<p>right to equality before the law, the right to personal freedom and security and the right to 
</p>
<p>the presumption of innocence. More specifically, the International Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination prohibits, in its articles 2, 4, 5 and 7, the 
</p>
<p>use of racial profiling. Furthermore, the general equality provision of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (art. 26) and other specific guarantees therein

</p>

</p>
<p>grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law&#8221; (art. 9 (1)).  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur recalls that a number of United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms have addressed the issue of the use of racial and ethnic profiling in the police, 
</p>
<p>at immigration and border controls and in detention facilities. More specifically, the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has made it clear that the 
</p>
<p>International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
</p>
<p>prohibits States parties from carrying out profiling on the basis of race or ethnicity. In its 
</p>
<p>general recommendation No. 13 on the training of law enforcement officials in the 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights, the Committee recalled the provisions of article 2 of the 
</p>
<p>Convention, which require States parties to ensure that public authorities and institutions do 
</p>
<p>not engage in racial discrimination, and the undertaking by States parties to guarantee the 
</p>
<p>rights, protected under article 5 of the Convention, to equality before the law, without 
</p>
<p>distinction as to race, colour or national or ethnic origin. The Committee also explained that 
</p>
<p>those obligations relied on national law enforcement officers who should be properly 
</p>
<p>informed of their State&#8217;s obligations and of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement 
</p>
<p>officials (see General Assembly resolution 34/169, annex).   
</p>
<p>28. Furthermore, the Committee reiterated its position on racial and ethnic profiling in 
</p>
<p>its general recommendation No. 31 on the prevention of racial discrimination in the 
</p>
<p>administration and functioning of the criminal justice system. The Committee advised that 
</p>
<p>States should prevent questioning, arrests and searches that are based solely on the physical 
</p>
<p>appearance of a person which exposes the person concerned to greater suspicion. 
</p>
<p>Specifically, the relevant State officials include the police, army personnel, customs 
</p>
<p>authorities, and persons working in airports, penal institutions and social, medical and 
</p>
<p>psychiatric services. The Committee has directly applied these recommendations on racial 
</p>
<p>and ethnic profiling to its evaluations on individual States parties.  
</p>
<p>29. The Human Rights Committee concluded in 2009 that a case of racial profiling in 
</p>
<p>the context of immigration control constituted discrimination. In that particular case, 
</p>
<p>specifically assessing identity checks for immigration purposes in the light of articles 2 (3) 
</p>
<p>and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Committee 
</p>
<p>considered that: 
</p>
<p>Identity checks carried out for public security or crime prevention purposes in 
</p>
<p>general, or to control illegal migration, serve a legitimate purpose. However, when 
</p>
<p>the authorities carry out such checks, the physical or ethnic characteristics of the 
</p>
<p>people subjected thereto should not by themselves be deemed indicative of their 
</p>
<p>possible illegal presence in the country. Nor should they be carried out in such a way 
</p>
<p>as to target only people with specific physical or ethnic characteristics. To act 
</p>
<p>otherwise would not only negatively affect the dignity of the people concerned, but 
</p>
<p>would also contribute to the spread of xenophobic attitudes in the public at large and 
</p>
<p>would run counter to an effective policy aimed at combating racial discrimination.22 
</p>
<p>30. Other United Nations mechanisms have also affirmed States&#8217; obligations to 
</p>
<p>eliminate racial and ethnic profiling. In the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p>States were explicitly called upon to design, implement and enforce effective measures to 
</p>
<p>eliminate this phenomenon.23 The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review has 
</p>
<p>regularly reminded States of their obligations to combat racial and ethnic profiling. In 2007, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
22 Communication No. 1493/2006, <i>Rosalind Williams Lecraft</i> v. <i>Spain,</i> Views adopted on 27 July 2009. 
</p>
<p> 23 See A/CONF.189/12 and Corr.1, chap. I, para. 72. </p>


<p>the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent devoted its sixth session to this 
</p>
<p>issue and adopted the definition of the practice outlined in the Durban Declaration and 
</p>
<p>Programme of Action. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human 
</p>
<p>rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism called attention to this issue 
</p>
<p>too, in the context of &#8220;terrorist profiles&#8221; (A/HRC/13/37). 
</p>
<p>31. Finally, in the Rabat Plan of Action on the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial 
</p>
<p>or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence,24 as a 
</p>
<p>result of the collaboration of several special procedures mandate holders, it was 
</p>
<p>recommended that States enhance their engagement in broad efforts to combat negative 
</p>
<p>stereotypes of, and discrimination against, individuals and communities on the basis of their 
</p>
<p>nationality, ethnicity, religion or belief.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Regional legal policy and regulatory frameworks 
</b></p>
<p>32. As regards Europe, the European Convention on Human Rights does not contain 
</p>
<p>explicit provisions regarding racial and ethnic profiling. However, a number of rights 
</p>
<p>protected by the Convention are relevant to making legal arguments and claims in relation 
</p>
<p>to the practice, in particular provisions such as the right to liberty and security (art. 5), the 
</p>
<p>right to respect for private and family life (art. 8), the right to an effective remedy (art. 13) 
</p>
<p>and prohibition of discrimination (art. 14). Moreover, there are two relevant protocols to the 
</p>
<p>European Convention on Human Rights, which provide for freedom of movement (protocol 
</p>
<p>No. 4) and a general prohibition on discrimination (protocol No. 12).25  
</p>
<p>33. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled on an application regarding racial 
</p>
<p>profiling. It found that the practice constituted unlawful discrimination.26 
</p>
<p>34. The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, established in 1993 by 
</p>
<p>the Council of Europe, underlined, in its general policy recommendation No. 11 on 
</p>
<p>combating racism and racial discrimination in policing, that racial and ethnic profiling was 
</p>
<p>not an acceptable or valid response to the challenges of the everyday reality of combatting 
</p>
<p>crime, including terrorism. The Commission stressed that racial and ethnic profiling was a 
</p>
<p>form of racial discrimination, and thus violated human rights, reinforced stereotypes and 
</p>
<p>lacked effectiveness, and led to less human security (para. 25). Moreover, the Commission 
</p>
<p>has issued four specific recommendations to members of the European Union on this issue, 
</p>
<p>namely that member States should &#8220;clearly define and prohibit racial and ethnic profiling 
</p>
<p>by law&#8221; (para. 1); &#8220;carry out research on racial profiling and monitor police activities in 
</p>
<p>order to identify racial profiling practices, including by collecting data broken down by 
</p>
<p>grounds such as national or ethnic origin, language, religion and nationality in respect of 
</p>
<p>relevant police activities&#8221; (para. 2); &#8220;introduce a reasonable suspicion standard, whereby 
</p>
<p>powers relating to control, surveillance or investigation activities can only be exercised on 
</p>
<p>the basis of a suspicion that is founded on objective criteria&#8221; (para. 3); and &#8220;train the police 
</p>
<p>on the issue of racial profiling and the use of the reasonable suspicion standard&#8221; (para. 4).

</p>
<p>Judgment of 13 December 2005. </p>


<p>35. The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe has consistently 
</p>
<p>condemned the practice of racial and ethnic profiling and has stated that it constitutes a 
</p>
<p>potential violation of article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The 
</p>
<p>Commissioner has warned about the underlying assumption behind terrorist profiling and 
</p>
<p>has denounced the large number of innocent people harassed as a result of the practice. The 
</p>
<p>Commissioner has also questioned the effectiveness and results of the practice, warned 
</p>
<p>against its deleterious effects on police&#8211;community relations, and recommended that 
</p>
<p>effective policing methods be developed that are based on individual behaviour or 
</p>
<p>accumulated intelligence or both. Similarly, the Commissioner has stated that stop-and-
</p>
<p>search actions based on ethnic or religious grounds are counterproductive and violate 
</p>
<p>human rights standards. The Commissioner has called for the establishment of a reasonable 
</p>
<p>suspicion standard as the basis for stop and search by law enforcement officials. Finally, the 
</p>
<p>Commissioner has denounced ethnic profiling practices targeting Roma, including special 
</p>
<p>(biometric) databases, police raids and discriminatory border checks, as well as the 
</p>
<p>disproportionate levels of stop and search, and has called for an end to these practices, and 
</p>
<p>has recommended the monitoring of police activities, in particular through the collection of 
</p>
<p>disaggregated data.27 
</p>
<p>36. The European Union has adopted a legal framework with provisions against racial 
</p>
<p>and ethnic profiling, including in the consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union 
</p>
<p>and the consolidated Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Moreover, the 
</p>
<p>Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has provisions for guaranteeing 
</p>
<p>equality before the law and prohibiting discrimination. In addition, the Council of the 
</p>
<p>European Union adopted its racial equality directive on 29 June 2000, which enshrines the 
</p>
<p>principle of equal treatment of persons, irrespective of their racial or ethnic origin.28  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur also notes that the European Parliament issued a 
</p>
<p>recommendation on profiling, in particular on the basis of ethnicity and race, in counter-
</p>
<p>terrorism, law enforcement, immigration, customs, and border control, stating that racial 
</p>
<p>and ethnic profiling raised &#8220;deep concerns about conflict with non-discrimination norms&#8221;.29 
</p>
<p>The European Parliament stressed that the use of ethnicity, national origin or religion as 
</p>
<p>factors in law enforcement investigations &#8220;must pass the scrutiny tests of effectiveness, 
</p>
<p>necessity and proportionality&#8221;, warned that &#8220;profiling based on stereotypical assumptions 
</p>
<p>may exacerbate sentiments of hostility and xenophobia in the general public&#8221;, and 
</p>
<p>recommended the adoption of a clear definition of profiling, the use of anonymous ethnic 
</p>
<p>statistics to identify discrimination in law enforcement practices, the establishment of 
</p>
<p>strong safeguards, and effective and accessible redress mechanisms for victims of profiling. 
</p>
<p>38. The European Union Network of Independent Experts on Fundamental Rights 
</p>
<p>issued an opinion on racial and ethnic profiling in 2006, in which it recommended the 
</p>
<p>adoption of a legal framework to prohibit this practice, to the extent that factors such as 
</p>
<p>race or ethnicity or religion or national origin should not be used as indicators of criminal 
</p>
<p>behaviour, either in general or in the specific context of counter-terrorism. It also 
</p>
<p>recommended the use of statistics to highlight the discriminatory attitudes of law 
</p>
<p>enforcement agencies practising racial profiling. The Network recommended States to 
</p>
<p>define with the greatest clarity possible the conditions under which law enforcement

</i></p>
<p>(Strasbourg, Council of Europe Publishing, 2012), p. 84. 
</p>
<p> 28 Council directive of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons 
</p>
<p>irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (2000/43/EC). 
</p>
<p> 
29 European Parliament recommendation to the Council of 24 April 2009 on the problem of profiling, 
</p>
<p>notably on the basis of ethnicity and race, in counter-terrorism, law enforcement, immigration, 
</p>
<p>customs and border control (2008/2020(INI)). </p>


<p>authorities may exercise discretionary powers in areas such as identity checks or stop-and-
</p>
<p>search procedures and to sanction any behaviour amounting to racial or ethnic profiling, not 
</p>
<p>only through the use of criminal penalties but also by providing civil remedies to victims or 
</p>
<p>by means of administrative or disciplinary sanctions.30 
</p>
<p>39. In 2010, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights issued a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive report on racial and ethnic profiling that made reference to European Union 
</p>
<p>norms on the protection of personal data and non-discrimination. The Agency has warned 
</p>
<p>that stop and search motivated &#8220;solely or mainly&#8221; on the basis of one&#8217;s race, ethnicity or 
</p>
<p>religion constitutes discrimination and is unlawful. In its report, the Agency suggested that 
</p>
<p>suspicion should be based on individual behaviour (that does not include physical 
</p>
<p>appearance) and has warned about the damaging effects of ethnic profiling on community 
</p>
<p>relations and about the inefficiency of the practice. The Agency recommended that officers 
</p>
<p>receive training on racial and ethnic profiling and that their stop-and-search operations be 
</p>
<p>monitored through the collection of racially disaggregated data, provided that anonymity 
</p>
<p>and informed consent are guaranteed.31 
</p>
<p>40. The African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights is intended to promote and 
</p>
<p>protect human rights and basic freedoms on the continent. This instrument contains 
</p>
<p>provisions that contribute to the prohibition of racial and ethnic profiling, such as those on 
</p>
<p>the right to freedom from discrimination (art. 2); the right to equality before the law and 
</p>
<p>equal protection of the law (art. 3); the right to personal liberty and protection from 
</p>
<p>arbitrary arrest (art. 6); and the right to freedom of movement (art. 12).32 
</p>
<p>41. The Organization of American States has several human rights instruments to 
</p>
<p>combat discrimination. The American Convention on Human Rights contains provisions on 
</p>
<p>the right to personal liberty (art. 7); the right to privacy (art. 11); freedom of movement and 
</p>
<p>residence (art. 22); and the right to equal protection (art. 24). In 2006, the Permanent 
</p>
<p>Council of the Organization of American States set up a working group to draft the Inter-
</p>
<p>American Convention against Racism, Racial Discrimination and Related Forms of 
</p>
<p>Intolerance, which was adopted by the Organization&#8217;s General Assembly on 5 June 2013 
</p>
<p>and provides a consolidated legal framework to eradicate racism and intolerance in the 
</p>
<p>Americas, although at the time of writing the present report it had not entered into force.33 
</p>
<p>42. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, in 2009, defined racial and 
</p>
<p>ethnic profiling as a tactic &#8220;adopted for supposed reasons of public safety and protection&#8221; 
</p>
<p>that is &#8220;motivated by stereotypes based on race, colour, ethnicity, language, descent, 
</p>
<p>religion, nationality, place of birth, or a combination of these factors, rather than on 
</p>
<p>objective suspicions&#8221;, and that &#8220;tends to single out individuals or groups in a discriminatory 
</p>
<p>way based on the erroneous assumption that people with such characteristics are prone to 
</p>
<p>engage in specific types of crimes&#8221;.34 Similarly, the Inter-American Commission, in a report 
</p>
<p>on the situation of persons of African descent, stated that such persons were more likely to 
</p>
<p>be suspected, chased, prosecuted and condemned, compared to the rest of the population. 
</p>
<p>The Commission has received reports detailing the selective arrest of such persons on the

</p>
<p><b> D. Examples of initiatives taken at the national level  
</b></p>
<p><b>to counter and challenge racial and ethnic profiling 
</b></p>
<p>43. In the section below, the Special Rapporteur presents an overview of a number of 
</p>
<p>legislative, policy and institutional initiatives that have been taken by States, and other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders including civil society actors, to counter and challenge racial and ethnic 
</p>
<p>profiling. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. National legal frameworks 
</b></p>
<p>44. The issue of racial and ethnic profiling has been addressed through national 
</p>
<p>frameworks and different initiatives such as guides and recommendations published by 
</p>
<p>Governments. In the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Race 
</p>
<p>Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 extended the prohibition on racial discrimination to the 
</p>
<p>performance of public functions by public authorities, including the police, the border 
</p>
<p>control agency and other government departments. Section 19B (1) of the Act now provides 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;it is unlawful for a public authority in carrying out any functions of the authority to do 
</p>
<p>any act which constitutes discrimination&#8221;.35 
</p>
<p>45. Also in the United Kingdom, the Equality Act 2010 unifies existing non-
</p>
<p>discrimination laws under a single act and has established a legal framework to protect 
</p>
<p>individual rights and advance equal opportunity. The Act applies to all organizations 
</p>
<p>providing a public service, including the police service, customs and excise officers, tax 
</p>
<p>officers, health and safety officers, immigration authorities, and the prisons and probation 
</p>
<p>service.36 The aims of the Act are to eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment and 
</p>
<p>victimization and other conducts prohibited under its provisions, to advance equality of 
</p>
<p>opportunity for minority groups and to foster good relations between minorities and the rest 
</p>
<p>of the community. 
</p>
<p>46. In 2003, the Government of the United States issued a guidance note in 2003 
</p>
<p>regarding interactions between different races and officers of the federal law enforcement 
</p>
<p>agencies. The guidance note, which was updated in December 2014, originates from the 
</p>
<p>Department of Justice37 and establishes mechanisms to combat racial and ethnic profiling in 
</p>
<p>law enforcement. In regard to routine or spontaneous law enforcement decisions, the 
</p>
<p>guidance note states that federal law enforcement officers may not use race or ethnicity to 
</p>
<p>any degree in a specific suspect description. In conducting activities in connection with a 
</p>
<p>specific investigation, federal law enforcement officers may consider race and ethnicity 
</p>
<p>only to the extent that (a) there is trustworthy information; (b) the information is relevant to 
</p>
<p>the locality or time frame; and (c) the information links persons of a particular race or 
</p>
<p>ethnicity to an identified criminal incident, scheme, or organization. Where there are 
</p>
<p>investigations or situations of threat regarding national security, catastrophic events or 
</p>
<p>border control matters, federal law enforcement officers may not consider race or ethnicity 
</p>

<p>except to the extent permitted by the Constitution and laws. The guidance note only applies 
</p>
<p>to federal agencies and not to state and local authorities, which conduct the vast majority of 
</p>
<p>the law enforcement functions, but the updated version now applies to Department of 
</p>
<p>Homeland Security and intelligence activities. The Special Rapporteur is pleased with this 
</p>
<p>updated and comprehensive version and hopes that it may serve as a model of good practice 
</p>
<p>for other authorities, as well as in other countries.  
</p>
<p>47. In the United States of America, states and local authorities have enacted legislation 
</p>
<p>that outlaws racial profiling while requiring data collection. At the federal level, the End 
</p>
<p>Racial Profiling Act was introduced into the Senate in May 2013; at the time of the writing 
</p>
<p>of the present report, it was still under discussion. This Act would prohibit law enforcement 
</p>
<p>personnel and agencies from engaging in racial profiling and would require federal law 
</p>
<p>enforcement agencies to maintain adequate policies and procedures to eliminate racial and 
</p>
<p>ethnic profiling and to cease the existing practices that at present allow it to continue. The 
</p>
<p>Act would also require state or local government entities or tribal councils applying for 
</p>
<p>grants or federal funding to certify that they maintain adequate policies and procedures for 
</p>
<p>eliminating racial and ethnic profiling and have eliminated any such existing practices.38 
</p>
<p>Finally, the Act would authorize the Attorney-General to award grants and contracts for the 
</p>
<p>collection of data relating to racial and ethnic profiling and the development of good 
</p>
<p>practices and systems to eliminate such practices.  
</p>
<p>48. With regard to Sweden, the Aliens Act provides that a person may not be stopped or 
</p>
<p>checked solely on account of his or her skin colour, name, language or other similar 
</p>
<p>characteristic. In that connection, standards and guidance can provide officers with clear 
</p>
<p>instructions on permissible versus impermissible uses of ethnicity, race and national origin 
</p>
<p>in conducting their work.39 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Policy and institutional standards 
</b></p>
<p>49. In some countries, codes of conduct have been developed for law enforcement 
</p>
<p>agents which prohibit the use of ethnicity, religion and national origin in targeting persons 
</p>
<p>as suspects, which also include the requirement that law enforcement officers base their 
</p>
<p>decisions on reasonable suspicion.40 In France, the code of conduct of the national police 
</p>
<p>prohibits discrimination and calls for polite and respectful treatment of the public and 
</p>
<p>anyone apprehended. This code applies to all national law enforcements officials, including 
</p>
<p>those carrying out immigration and counter-terrorism functions.41 Police codes of conduct 
</p>
<p>set out similar standards in Austria and in Northern Ireland.  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur has been informed that a number of good practices based on 
</p>
<p>behavioural profiles have been implemented in immigration enforcement. This is important 
</p>
<p>in focusing officers&#8217; attention on behavioural risk factors rather than on assumptions about 
</p>
<p>nationality, race or ethnicity. For instance, Brussels Airport&#8217;s information-based 
</p>
<p>behavioural profiling system is an example of an intelligence-based system of profiles that 
</p>
<p>uses behavioural factors.  
</p>
<p>51. The use of strategic action plans appears to be among the positive steps taken by 
</p>
<p>States in response to an identified problem; such plans are sometimes politically mandated 
</p>
<p>but are also undertaken by senior law enforcement leadership. They represent a political

<p>commitment to take steps to address a problem and can serve as a foundation and road map 
</p>
<p>for action for tackling racial and ethnic profiling.42  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Oversight and equality bodies 
</b></p>
<p>52. A number of States have established law enforcement oversight bodies and 
</p>
<p>complaints mechanisms to address racial and ethnic profiling. Such mechanisms play an 
</p>
<p>important role in identifying and drawing attention to discriminatory law enforcement 
</p>
<p>practices and in proposing remedies. These institutions can be national equality bodies, or 
</p>
<p>specialized police complaint and oversight bodies. In the United Kingdom, the Independent 
</p>
<p>Police Complaints Commission investigates complaints and allegations of misconduct and 
</p>
<p>can make policy recommendations. The Commission has overall responsibility for the 
</p>
<p>police complaints system, and is charged by law with increasing public confidence in the 
</p>
<p>police complaints system in England and Wales. The Commission is independent from the 
</p>
<p>police or government.43  
</p>
<p>53. In addition to external civilian oversight of law enforcement, two other models exist 
</p>
<p>in Europe. Denmark, Norway and Sweden have special law enforcement officers attached 
</p>
<p>to the Prosecutor-General&#8217;s office who receive and investigate complaints against police 
</p>
<p>officers.44 In France, the National Commission on Police Ethics, an independent 
</p>
<p>administrative authority created in 2000, ensures compliance with ethics rules by French 
</p>
<p>law enforcement officers. Individuals can present complaints to the Commission via a 
</p>
<p>member of the National Assembly or the Senate, the Ombudsman&#8217;s office, the High 
</p>
<p>Authority against Discrimination and for Equality, the Children&#8217;s Defender, or the General 
</p>
<p>Supervisor of Places of Detention and Deprivation of Liberty.  
</p>
<p>54. Other countries have set up equality bodies that undertake investigations or provide 
</p>
<p>redress in cases of discrimination. Many have powers to investigate practices, review 
</p>
<p>policies and issue recommendations. In that connection, in Canada, the Ontario Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Commission published recommendations to end racial and ethnic profiling in a 2003 
</p>
<p>report entitled &#8220;Paying the price: the human cost of racial profiling&#8221;.45 In the Netherlands, 
</p>
<p>the Dutch National Bureau against Discrimination has wide-ranging powers which include 
</p>
<p>oversight of law enforcement. In Sweden, the Ombudsman against Discrimination may deal 
</p>
<p>with complaints against the police under the 2010 anti-discrimination law. In Northern 
</p>
<p>Ireland, the Human Rights Commission examines cases of racial and ethnic profiling at 
</p>
<p>borders by immigration officers, using direct observation and interviews with immigration 
</p>
<p>officers about their decision-making.46 
</p>
<p>55. Also regarding the United Kingdom, the Metropolitan Police Authority in London 
</p>
<p>has set up a scrutiny panel on stop and search, which has statutory responsibility to hold the 
</p>
<p>Metropolitan Police Service accountable for its performance. In the United States, the 
</p>
<p>American Civil Liberties Union, a non-governmental organization (NGO), has taken a lead 
</p>
<p>role in advocating for investigations by police&#8211;community advisory bodies.47 In Germany,

<p>the Bureau for the Implementation of Equal Treatment NGO48 has successfully challenged, 
</p>
<p>in the administrative courts, the practice of identity checks carried out by the border police 
</p>
<p>in trains and train stations solely on the basis of racial and ethnic criteria and in a 
</p>
<p>discretionary and discriminatory manner. Finally, in Australia in 2013, the Victoria Police 
</p>
<p>made groundbreaking announcements that it would invite communities to comment about 
</p>
<p>its practices and then undertake a self-examination, set up a policy on field contacts, which 
</p>
<p>would include data collection, provide cross-cultural training to its agents, and publish a 
</p>
<p>public report on the results of the exercise.49 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Training and awareness-raising 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur was made aware of different examples of training 
</p>
<p>undertaken by law enforcement agencies to eliminate racial and ethnic profiling carried out 
</p>
<p>by their staff. However, it is important to note that this practice is difficult to eradicate by 
</p>
<p>training measures alone, and that these should be combined with other measures to reduce 
</p>
<p>the use of profiling, such as good supervisory practices and clear operational procedures. 
</p>
<p>Diversity and sensitivity training can also be found in other parts of the public sector, 
</p>
<p>beyond law enforcement. Cultural sensitivity training seeks to educate officers about the 
</p>
<p>cultures of specific ethnic groups with whom they have frequent contact but with whom 
</p>
<p>they lack personal familiarity.50  
</p>
<p>57. In Ireland, and in Northern Ireland (United Kingdom), the &#8220;Diversity Works&#8221; 
</p>
<p>training, developed jointly by the two police agencies, provides intercultural and diversity 
</p>
<p>training for law enforcement officers. In Sweden, officers receive &#8220;specific police tactics&#8221; 
</p>
<p>training, which addresses racial and ethnic profiling and explains applicable standards and 
</p>
<p>practical examples to eliminate the practice.51 As regards Belgium, the Belgian Federal 
</p>
<p>Judicial Police has two experts on Islam (trained in Islamic and Arabic studies), who 
</p>
<p>provide advice and training to police officers with counter-terrorism responsibilities and 
</p>
<p>encourage them not to rely on stereotypes or profiling when making assessments of 
</p>
<p>individuals or organizations.52 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur was informed that another set of measures that have been 
</p>
<p>taken by some States concern policy audits to identify institutional factors that may be 
</p>
<p>driving or permitting racial and ethnic profiling. Such audits provide policy 
</p>
<p>recommendations for addressing racial and ethnic profiling. They give law enforcement 
</p>
<p>institutions the opportunity to review their policies both force-wide and at the local level, to 
</p>
<p>learn how policies are translated into practice, to assess their effectiveness, and to measure 
</p>
<p>their impact on different communities.53 
</p>
<p>59. Such audits have been used to address ethnic profiling by police forces in Canada 
</p>
<p>and in the United Kingdom, more specifically to review the use of stop-and-search powers 
</p>
<p>by these law enforcement agencies. In Northern Ireland, the Police Service is required to 
</p>
<p>consult on the impact of all changes to policies; those found to have a disproportionate

<p>impact on specific communities have been amended as a result.54 In the Netherlands, the 
</p>
<p>Amsterdam Police has contracted independent auditors to examine the organization and its 
</p>
<p>work. One of the auditors focused on the information and preconceptions that drive police 
</p>
<p>choices about interventions. That research was followed up by a qualitative study involving 
</p>
<p>interviews with between 50 and 60 police officers about their rationale for deciding who to 
</p>
<p>stop and search.55 As regards Romania, the Romanian Police Strategic Initiative developed 
</p>
<p>a similar model for assessing the policing of Roma persons.56 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Reaching out to minorities 
</b></p>
<p>60. Another important good practice is the recruitment of persons from minority 
</p>
<p>backgrounds to law enforcement agencies. Some States, for example in Europe, have set up 
</p>
<p>specialized diversity units to fight racial and ethnic profiling and to increase their agencies&#8217; 
</p>
<p>representativeness and diversity. These units can address diversity issues within the law 
</p>
<p>enforcement agency, and through outreach to minority communities.  
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur considers that community outreach and involvement 
</p>
<p>constitute another set of good practices. Efforts to address racial and ethnic profiling should 
</p>
<p>involve local communities at the grass-roots level; this includes the law enforcement 
</p>
<p>agencies, which must be engaged within their communities in order to gain their trust and 
</p>
<p>respect. In the United Kingdom, the West Yorkshire Police regularly holds &#8220;street 
</p>
<p>briefings&#8221;, where senior officers give briefings in public places such as parks, community 
</p>
<p>centres and commercial thoroughfares. Members of the public can listen to the briefing, 
</p>
<p>which is given by officers before they go on patrol, and are invited to join in and highlight 
</p>
<p>local issues and concerns. The reaction to these briefings has been positive, as they increase 
</p>
<p>visibility and help officers to understand and target local issues.57 In the Netherlands, the 
</p>
<p>National Diversity Expertise Centre has an expert group of approximately 50 police officers 
</p>
<p>of different ethnic backgrounds who are seconded to the group for up to 80 hours a year on 
</p>
<p>an as-needed basis. The expert group can be called on to troubleshoot problems in multi-
</p>
<p>ethnic areas. It not only addresses issues as they arise, but also assists the police service in 
</p>
<p>identifying any relevant findings, such as a lack of minority representation in law 
</p>
<p>enforcement.58 In Ireland, the interracial cultural office holds annual consultations with 
</p>
<p>ethnic minority communities to discuss good practices, minorities&#8217; needs and concerns, and 
</p>
<p>the work of ethnic liaison officers, among other topics.59 Other positive examples identified 
</p>
<p>include working with traditionally marginalized groups such as young people, travellers 
</p>
<p>and irregular migrants. In South Africa, the African Centre for Migration and Society has 
</p>
<p>worked with members of migrant communities who have been victims of xenophobic 
</p>
<p>attacks and whose shops have been targeted, together with local police and community 
</p>
<p>leaders, to end discrimination, promote dialogue and enquire into policing practices. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Data collection 
</b></p>
<p>62. Finally, the Special Rapporteur wishes to recall the importance of disaggregated data 
</p>
<p>collection in regard to racial and ethnic profiling, which is essential in order to measure the 
</p>

<p>actions of law enforcement agencies, particularly in connection with discretionary actions 
</p>
<p>such as identity checks and stop and search. Data collection can serve as a tool to increase 
</p>
<p>the transparency and accountability of law enforcement agencies. In Europe, the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom is the only country to systematically gather national data on law enforcement and 
</p>
<p>ethnicity under legal mandate. British law requires police forces in England and Wales to 
</p>
<p>gather ethnic data on police stop-and-search practices.60 The Suffolk County and West 
</p>
<p>Yorkshire police forces issue a receipt to persons who have been stopped, which records 
</p>
<p>details of the reason for the stop, and the identity both of the person concerned and of the 
</p>
<p>police officer. A similar initiative has been developed in the municipality of Fuenlabrada, 
</p>
<p>Spain, with the support of the European Commission. Such data collection can be a tool to 
</p>
<p>reduce ethnic profiling and to improve trust in the police within minority communities. In 
</p>
<p>the United States, in New York, the Legal Aid Society has launched the &#8220;Cop 
</p>
<p>Accountability Program&#8221;, a database containing information about wrongdoing by New 
</p>
<p>York City police officers, which was set up to help public defenders at court hearings to 
</p>
<p>contest the credibility of police officers who have engaged in misconduct and 
</p>
<p>misbehaviour. Using such information to monitor the performance of law enforcement 
</p>
<p>agents can reduce their individual discretionary powers and oblige them to rely on objective 
</p>
<p>indicators of suspicion rather than on subjective factors, when deciding whom to stop. This 
</p>
<p>good practice has been shown to lead to increased police efficiency. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>63. Racial and ethnic profiling in law enforcement constitutes a violation of human 
</p>
<p>rights for the <b>individuals</b> and groups targeted by these practices, because of its 
</p>
<p>fundamentally discriminatory nature and because it exacerbates discrimination 
</p>
<p>already suffered as a result of ethnic origin or minority status. Furthermore, racial 
</p>
<p>and ethnic profiling harms already tenuous relationships between law enforcement 
</p>
<p>agencies and <b>minority</b> communities, at a time when members of minority communities 
</p>
<p>need to be reassured about <b>their</b> inclusion and participation in society. Unfortunately, 
</p>
<p>the use of racial and ethnic profiling has increased following terrorist attacks in the 
</p>
<p>United States and in Europe. The practice has targeted particular individuals and 
</p>
<p>communities solely on <b>the</b> basis of their race, ethnicity, national origin or religion, and 
</p>
<p>has attracted disproportionate attention from law enforcement agencies at a time 
</p>
<p>when their resources are scarce<b>. 
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> </b>Combating the use of racial and ethnic profiling in law enforcement constitutes 
</p>
<p>a new and complex challenge. The Special Rapporteur nonetheless stresses that the 
</p>
<p>Durban <b>Declaration</b> and Programme of Action, other international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p><b>Racial</b> Discrimination and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p>and certain regional instruments referred to earlier provide a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>framework to combat the use of racial and ethnic profiling in law enforcement. To 
</p>
<p>that end, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the continued interest and attention of the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which has issued useful 
</p>
<p>general recommendations to States parties in this regard. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> </b>The Special Rapporteur notes the numerous legal and policy efforts that have 
</p>
<p>been initiated at the regional and national levels to address the use of racial and ethnic 
</p>
<p>profiling and to offer viable and credible alternatives. Legislative measures are <b>central</b> 
</p>
<p>to any strategy to combat discrimination and racism by law enforcement agencies; for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 60 Section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. </p>


<p>this reason, the Special Rapporteur encourages States that have not enacted specific 
</p>
<p>legislation outlawing the use of racial and ethnic profiling to consider doing so. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> </b>The Special Rapporteur recommends a clear and unequivocal prohibition of 
</p>
<p>the use of racial and ethnic profiling by law enforcement agencies. Outlawing racial<b> 
</b></p>
<p>and ethnic profiling would require modifying national legislation to incorporate an 
</p>
<p>express prohibition on the use of such profiling. The outlawing of racial and ethnic 
</p>
<p>profiling should also be considered at the regional level.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> </b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon political leaders and heads of law 
</p>
<p>enforcement agencies to speak out publicly against discrimination and to avoid 
</p>
<p>making statements linking race or ethnicity to criminal behaviour, irregular migration 
</p>
<p>or terrorism, in order to repair the harm caused to minority communities by the use 
</p>
<p>of racial and ethnic profiling and to ensure that these groups and individuals are able 
</p>
<p>to fully integrate into their societies.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> </b>The Special Rapporteur recommends to States to gather law enforcement data, 
</p>
<p>including <b>statistics</b> disaggregated by ethnicity and race, which are essential in order to 
</p>
<p>prove the existence and the extent of racial and ethnic profiling. Such statistics are an 
</p>
<p>essential tool for enabling the detection of law enforcement practices that focus 
</p>
<p>disproportionate and unwarranted attention on racial and ethnic minorities based on 
</p>
<p>stereotypes about ethnicity and crime. In order to properly collect such data, close 
</p>
<p>scrutiny of the three main stages of collection, storage and access is required, in order 
</p>
<p>to prevent any possible misuse of the data. This is particularly important in law 
</p>
<p>enforcement, where there are clear risks that ethnic data could be used to facilitate 
</p>
<p>racial and ethnic profiling, rather than to reduce it. Data protection standards must 
</p>
<p>balance the need of law enforcement to collect and retain data for the purposes of 
</p>
<p>detecting, preventing and investigating crime, against the right to privacy and the 
</p>
<p>presumption of innocence. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> </b>When statistics, disaggregated by race and ethnicity,<b> </b>are available on law 
</p>
<p>enforcement actions, they provide an important insight into law enforcement practices 
</p>
<p>and are the cornerstone that proves the use of racial and ethnic profiling. These 
</p>
<p>statistics can be useful for the development of new policies and practices, particularly 
</p>
<p>where census data are not available or appear to be inaccurate, or where there are no 
</p>
<p>available law enforcement data and there are concerns about racial profiling. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, sharing data with minority communities is a positive step taken by some 
</p>
<p>States <b>which</b> should be further encouraged. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> </b>Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur encourages investigative oversight bodies 
</p>
<p>to monitor the conduct and practices of law enforcement agencies and to investigate 
</p>
<p>individual complaints. Oversight bodies should have the authority to address 
</p>
<p>allegations of racial and ethnic profiling, and should inform practical 
</p>
<p>recommendations for policy changes in order to <b>eliminate</b> the use of racial and ethnic 
</p>
<p>profiling. Such bodies should also be able to collect data to monitor direct and indirect 
</p>
<p>discrimination and to conduct self<b>-</b>initiated investigations, as these are fundamental in 
</p>
<p>identifying discrimination such as profiling by law enforcement agencies. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>71<b>. </b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that law enforcement agencies adopt a 
</p>
<p>practical and holistic approach to training. Practical training linked to specific 
</p>
<p>powers, actions and activities of law enforcement is usually more effective than 
</p>
<p>general diversity training. Training should be combined with other complementary 
</p>
<p>measures to reduce ethnic profiling, such as supervisory practices and operational 
</p>
<p><b>procedures</b>, with the participation of minority communities.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur also strongly recommends that law enforcement 
</p>
<p>agencies provide their officers with clear standards and instructions on permissible </p>


<p>versus impermissible uses of ethnicity, race and national origin in conducting their 
</p>
<p>work. Requiring that law enforcement officers have objective grounds for reasonable 
</p>
<p>suspicion on the basis of a person&#8217;s behaviour rather than on the basis of their 
</p>
<p>appearance is a fundamental safeguard against ethnic profiling and should be clearly 
</p>
<p>established as a prerequisite before any police or immigration stop. Operational 
</p>
<p>protocols, regulations and training should provide detailed and practical guidance for 
</p>
<p>all law enforcement officers on how to carry out their duties in full compliance with 
</p>
<p>non<b>-</b>discrimination standards. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>73. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur calls for a limitation of the 
</p>
<p>discretionary powers of law enforcement agents to reduce the risks of racial and 
</p>
<p>ethnic profiling. There are several approaches to limiting discretion; they are not 
</p>
<p>mutually exclusive but can be used in a complementary manner. Such strategies may 
</p>
<p>include improving the quality and precision of intelligence<b>-</b>gathering and making sure 
</p>
<p>that law enforcement agents use this information in their decision<b>-</b>making, increasing 
</p>
<p>the supervision of law enforcement officers&#8217; discretionary decisions,<b> </b>and enhancing 
</p>
<p>civilians&#8217; understanding of their rights and responsibilities in encounters with law 
</p>
<p>enforcement agents and their ability to hold them accountable for their use of their 
</p>
<p>powers. Similarly, civilian monitors, civil society actors and international 
</p>
<p>organizations should be given the necessary access to monitor effectively<b> </b>the checks 
</p>
<p>and controls of the different types of law enforcement agencies<b>. 
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> </b>The Special Rapporteur reminds all stakeholders of the importance of 
</p>
