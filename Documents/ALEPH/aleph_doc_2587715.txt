Coal Prices and Sales
In the first half of 2012, the sluggish global economy has led to the weak demand for coal in the domestic and overseas markets and the
average coal price of the Group decreased as compared with that of last year.

CHAPTER 3 BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT – CONTINUED
The Group sold 42.47 million tonnes of coal in the first half of 2012, representing an increase of 15.81 million tonnes or 59.3% as compared
with that of the first half of 2011. The sales volume comprises of 0.62 million tonnes of internal sales and 41.85 million tonnes of external

of the first half of 2011; (3) coal sales volume of Ordos Neng Hua increased by 1.93 million tonnes as compared with that of the first half of
2011.

as compared with that of the first half of 2011. This was mainly due to: (1) the increase of policy expenditure by RMB5.63 in the cost of coal
sales per tonne, including: ​the increase of mining
Yanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited Interim Report 2012    13
CHAPTER 3 BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT – CONTINUED
rights fees of coal mines in the headquarters since 1 January 2012, which led to the increase of cost of coal sales per tonne by RMB2.80; ‚the
newly increased security deposit for environment management resulted in an increase in the cost of coal sales per tonne by RMB2.83; (2) the
increase in employees’ wages resulted in an increase in the cost of coal sales per tonne by RMB26.24. Deducting the policy expenditure
increase, the cost of coal sales per tonne of the Company was RMB312.85 in the first half of 2012, representing an increase of RMB26.65 or
9.3% as compared with that of the first half of 2011.

as compared with that of the first half of 2011. This was mainly due to the increase in sales volume of product coal by 0.51 million tonnes or
69.9% as compared with that of the first half of 2011, which led to the decrease of unit fixed cost.

(V) Outlook
1.
Market outlook of the second half of 2012
Outlook for coal market
China macro-economic growth has slowed down, coupled with broadly sluggish demand and supply relationship of coal market. With the
emerging impact of a series of policies and measures promoted by the government to sustain growth, it is expected that demand for coal is
likely to increase. As China is self-sufficient in coal production capacity, it is challenging to restrain the coal production volume in a short
time. With the price difference between domestic and overseas coal narrowing, the growth in coal import has slowed down. The continuous
concentration of the domestic coal industry and the central government’s promotion on consolidating coal resources to enhance the safety
management level of coal mining, increasing the entry threshold to the coal mining business, providing guiding instruction to cut down
production volume and implementing measures such as the total production volume control will be positive to the stabilization of the coal
market. It is expected that the domestic coal price will withhold from falling and become stabilized in the near future.
24    Yanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited Interim Report 2012
CHAPTER 3 BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT – CONTINUED
The global economy continues to be sluggish, coupled with abundant supply relative to the demand in the international coal markets. Demand
for coal in Asian region has increased. Affected by the European debt crisis and due to the change of consumption structure of traditional
energy, coal demand in European markets has decreased. Major coal exporting countries such as Australia, Indonesia, Mongolia and Russia
continue to increase coal production while the export of coal has significantly increased in the United States due to the enhanced exploration
and utilization of gas shale. With the combining influences caused by the changes in demand and supply, as well as the fluctuation of the
international crude oil price and freight fees, the international price of thermal coal has shown signs of stabilizing. It is expected that the
international coal prices will continue to fluctuate at the current low price range.
Outlook for the methanol market in China
Affected by the demand and supply situation, it is expected that the domestic methanol price will consolidate at its current bottom range in the
second half of 2012. The gradual utilization of existing and newly constructed methanol production capacity, as well as the steady import
volume of methanol from overseas will further increase the domestic supply of methanol. The demand for methanol will remain weak due to
subdued utilization of excessive production capacity of downstream products such as formaldehyde, dimethylether and acetic acid. Several
measures have been promoted by the government, including the accelerated elimination of outdated methanol production capacity, higher
threshold for new methanol projects and promotion of methanol fuel for vehicles. These will help to stabilize the domestic methanol sector.
However, with low international price of methanol, declining price of domestic coal, and reduced methanol cost, the price of domestic
methanol is unlikely to rise. It is expected that the price of domestic methanol will not dramatically change from its current state.
2.
Operating Strategies
For the second half of 2012, facing unfavorable conditions including the likely subdued global economy, slowing domestic economic growth
and supply broadly exceeding demand in both international and domestic coal markets, the Company will continue to implement operating
strategies through both external expansion and internal improvement, sustainably enhancing its profitability and shareholders’ return. The
Company will primarily focus on the implementation of following operating strategies:
Strengthening production and operation management of the Company and ensuring to deliver maximum economic benefits. Firstly, the
Company will enhance its fundamental safety management and precautionary measures to ensure a sustainable and stable development
environment. Secondly, the Company will continue to implement the production management strategy of “sustaining production within
Shandong Province, increasing production outside Shandong Province, and expanding production overseas” to achieve a stable increase in
total coal production volume. Thirdly, the Company will devote its energy on sales and marketing to achieve profit maximization. The
Company will fully leverage on the synergic advantages with presence in both international and domestic markets, accelerate its integration of
the domestic and international sales and marketing system, and keep optimizing marketing strategy through advanced judgment of market
conditions and adjustment of coal products and sales and marketing coverage based on changing demand situation. With improved sales and
marketing function, the production level of the Company can be sustained. The Company will continue to enhance product

CHAPTER 3 BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT – CONTINUED
quality control, and establish brand reputation and expand its market through product quality. Fourthly, the Company will enhance its
financial management. By focusing on cost control, the Company will strive to reduce costs and material consumption and to identify cost
synergies and improve efficiency. The Company will also further enhance the management of its capital spending budget, establish an early
warning system in relation to its cash management, ensure proper safeguard for its cash flow, and optimize the efficiency of its development
capital allocation.
The Company will enhance the capital management capability and deliver efficient and substantial growth. Firstly, the Company will broaden
its financing sources by fully utilizing its listing status in four domestic and overseas capital markets to raise development funds at low costs.
Secondly, supported by the four major domestic and overseas operating bases, the Company will adopt various capital management
measures with prudence and caution, to identify new development opportunities. Thirdly, by strengthening the promotion and the
capitalization of longwall top coal caving technique, the Company aims to achieve targeted production through the use of technology and
intellectual properties and to realize increased overall production and economic efficiency. Fourthly, through capital management, the
Company aims to improve the standard of its resources allocations so that its capital, technology and personnel resources are devoted to high
quality projects.
Project development and construction will be expedited to enhance the Company’s sustainable growth. With proper accountability, project
investment, construction and operations management will be strengthened to eliminate and mitigate investment risks. We will speed up the
application and approvals process for projects of Ordos Neng Hua Zhuan Longwan, Shilawusu and Ying Panhao coal field and the 0.6 million
tonnes methanol project. The construction of Wanfu coal mine of Heze Neng Hua and the comprehensive power plant project of Zhaolou will
be expedited. The application and approvals for the second stage expansion of Moolarben coal mine of Yancoal Australia as well as the
southeastern surface mine project of Ashton Coal Mine will be procured. Exploration of the Potash assets in Canada will be expedited.
The Company will strengthen the development of its management and control system, improve its operation standard, the corporate
governance system and operational mechanism to continuously improve the internal control process and system, as well as the internal risk
control and management system of domestic and overseas subsidiaries so as to improve the operating capability and profitability. Upon
completion of the merger of Yancoal Australia and Gloucester and its listing in Australia, the management system and business system will be
consolidated to build a control system in compliance with the requirements of listing regulations in the four listing jurisdictions and the
requirements stipulated by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. The Company will make efforts to avoid
foreign operation risk by focusing on offshore account management. The Company will adopt scientific approach to assess international
exchange rate trends, and utilize adequate hedging, foreign exchange future and optimized settlement method to mitigate foreign exchange
risks. The Company will also strengthen its management of significant risks by focusing on the risk prevention and control of investment,
financing, project constructing, operation of overseas assets and product trade in order to increase its risk prevention capability.

4.
Risks arising from exchange rate fluctuation
Exchange fluctuation risks that the Group faces are mainly about fluctuation of RMB exchange rate, as well as the fluctuation of US dollar and
Australian dollar exchange rates. With the increasingly fluctuation of international exchange rates, the impacts and risk concerning the
exchange gains and losses may gradually increase.
Counter-measures: The Company will strengthen scientific and effective monitoring; build the early warning mechanism for exchange rate
fluctuation risk; make market-oriented research and utilize financial instruments such as hedging, and other relevant means to manage such
risk.
5.
Risks arising from efficiency and effectiveness of management and control
With business expansion across domestic and overseas markets as well as industry sectors, it has become increasingly challenging for the
Group to make operating decisions, manage its operations and control risks. The efficiency and effectiveness of management and control will
directly affect our business operation quality and impact the Group’s business performance.
Counter-measures: In the principle of executing appropriate management and control, separating rights and liabilities, standardized as well as
flexible and efficient operation, the Company will improve its overall management and control ability to meet the requirements of the
internationalized operation of the Group. The Company will establish a scientific and efficient management mode that is compliant with the

CHAPTER 7 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED
2.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 34
“Interim Financial Reporting” and with the applicable disclosure requirements of Appendix 16 of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities
on the SEHK.
3.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments,
which are measured at fair value, as appropriate.
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual financial statements for the year
ended 31 December 2011, except a number of accounting policies that are adopted by the Company and effective for annual periods beginning
on or after 1 January 2012.
In the current period, the Group had applied, for the first time, the new standards and interpretations and revised/ amended standards and
interpretations (the new “IFRSs”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (the “IASB”) and the International Financial
Reporting Interpretations Committee (the “IFRIC”) of the IASB, which are effective for the Group’s financial year beginning on 1 January 2012.
The new IFRSs relevant to these interim financial statements are as follows:
•
IFRS 7 – Disclosures – Transfers of financial assets (Amendment) enhances disclosures for financial assets. These disclosures relate to
assets transferred (as defined under IAS 39). If the assets transferred are not derecognised entirely in the financial statements, an entity has
to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to understand the relationship between those assets which are not
derecognised and their associated liabilities. If those assets are derecognised entirely, but the entity retains a continuing involvement,
disclosures have to be provided that enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, the entity’s
continuing involvement in those derecognised assets.
The adoption of the new IFRSs had no material effect on the results or financial position of the Group for the current or prior accounting
periods. Accordingly, no prior period adjustment has been recognized.
The Group has not early applied the new standards or interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective. The directors of the
Company anticipate that the application of these standards or interpretations will have no material impact on the results and the financial
position of the Group.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Group is engaged primarily in the coal mining business and the coal railway transportation business. The Company does not currently
have direct export rights in the PRC and all of its export sales must be made through China National Coal Industry Import and Export
Corporation (“National Coal Corporation”) or Minmetals Trading Co., Ltd. (“Minmetals Trading”) or Shanxi Coal Imp. & Exp Group Corp.
(“Shanxi Coal Corporation”). The final customer destination of the Company’s export sales is determined by the Company, National Coal
Corporation, Minmetals Trading or Shanxi Coal Corporation. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries and associates are engaged in trading and
processing of mining machinery and the transportation business via rivers and lakes and finance services in the PRC. No separate segment
information about these businesses is presented in these financial statements as the underlying gross sales, results and assets of these
businesses, which are currently included in the coal mining business segment, are insignificant to the Group. Certain of the Company’s
subsidiaries are engaged in production of methanol and other chemical products, and invest in heat and electricity.
For management purposes, the Group is currently organized into three operating divisions-coal mining, coal railway transportation and
methanol, electricity and heat supply. These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Principal activities are as follows:
Mining
Coal railway transportation
Methanol, electricity and heat
supply
–    
   –
–
Underground and open-cut mining, preparation and sales of coal and potash mineral exploration
Provision of railway transportation services
Production and sales of methanol and electricity and related heat supply services
Segment profit represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of corporate expenses and directors’ emoluments, results of
associates, interest income, interest expenses and income tax expenses. This is the measure reported to the chief operating decision maker
for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.

The Company and its subsidiaries incorporated in the PRC are subject to an income tax rate of 25% and subsidiaries established in Australia
are subject to a tax rate of 30%. The effective income tax rate of the Group for the current period is 1.85% (six months ended 30 June 2011:
28%).
Note:
During the period, the Australia Minerals Resources Rent Tax (“MRRT”) legislation was substantially enacted on 19 March 2012 and
will be effective from 1 July 2012. According to the relevant provisions of the MRRT tax laws, subsidiaries in Australia are required
to determine the starting base allowance on 30 June 2012. Book value or market value approach can be selected in calculating the
starting base and subsequently amortise within the prescribed useful life. Market value approach was selected for mines in Australia
such as Austar, Yarrabee, Ashton and Moolarben. Under the market value approach, base value is determined based on market
value of the coal mines on 1 May 2010 and amortise base on the shorter of the life of mining project, mining rights and mining
production. During the period, additional deferred tax has been recognised.

CHAPTER 7 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – CONTINUED
The bargain purchase arises because the consideration (number of shares to be issued) was fixed when the merger proposal was announced.
Upon the date of completion, the market capitalization and the market price of shares dropped and hence the total consideration paid were
less than the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired because there is no mechanism to adjust the number of shares to be issued.
During the period from the acquisition date to 30 June 2012, Gloucester did not have significant impact on the revenue and operating results of
the Group.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2012, consolidated revenue and net profit of the Group for the period ended 30 June 2012 would
have been RMB34,233,379,000 and RMB6,738,313,000 respectively. These amounts have been calculated using the Group’s accounting policies
and by adjusting the results of the subsidiary to reflect the additional depreciation and amortisation that would have been charged assuming
the fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment and mining tenements had applied from 1 January 2012, together with the
consequential tax effects.
The CVR shares will be redeemed by cash (or shares of Yancoal Australia held by the Company at the discretion of Yancoal Australia) if the
weighted average price of the shares are lower than AUD6.96 per share for continuous three months in next 18 months after the transaction and
the redemption price will not exceed AUD3 per share. The holders of the CVR shares do not have the power to vote at the shareholders’
meeting, except in the condition that is required by the ASX. Also, the holders of the CVR shares are not entitled to any dividend, right to enrol
the new securities and bonus shares that are distributed or issued by Yancoal Australia. The Company are committed to the obligations
related to the issuance of the CVR shares by Yancoal Australia.
The valuation of the shares issued by Yancoal Australia and the CVR shares are stated at market value.

is AUD. On the conversion method from AUD to RMB, please refers to Note “IV.5”.
3.
Basis of accounting and principle of measurement
The Company has adopted the accrual basis of accounting and used the historical cost convention as the principle of measurements for
assets and liabilities except for tradable financial assets, available-for-sale financial assets and hedging instruments, which are measured at
their fair values.
4.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash in cash flow are cash on hand and deposits available for payment at any time. Cash equivalents in cash flow are investments which are
short-term (normally become due within 3 months after purchasing date), highly liquid, readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
5.
Foreign currency and the translation of financial statements denominated in foreign currency
(1)
Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions are converted to the functional currency at the spot exchange rate of the day when the transaction occurs. At the
balance sheet date, foreign currency monetary items are translated to the functional currency using the spot exchange rate of the day.
Exchange differences arising are recognized in profit or loss for the current period, except for the exchange differences arising on the
borrowing costs eligible for acquisition, construction or production of assets which are qualified for capitalization. Foreign currency non-
monetary items measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the recognized fair value is determined. The
differences between the amount of the functional currency before and after conversion are recognized in profit or loss or interests of
shareholders as changes of fair value. Foreign currency non-monetary items measured at historical cost are translated at the spot exchange
rates at the date of the transactions, and do not change the functional currency amount.

Financial assets and financial liabilities
(1)
Financial assets
Upon initial recognition, financial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at ‘fair value through profit or loss’
(FVTPL), ‘held-to-maturity’ investments, ‘available-for-sale’ (AFS) financial assets and ‘loans and receivables’.
1)
Financial assets at FVTPL:
A financial asset is held for trading if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term and presented as the tradable
financial assets in the balance sheet. Except for the purpose of hedging, derivative financial instruments are classified into financial assets or
liabilities at FVTPL.
2)
Held-to-maturity investment
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity date that the enterprise
has the clear intention and ability to hold to maturity.

3)
Receivables:
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments are not quoted in an active market.
4)
AFS financial assets
AFS financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available for sale or are not classified as (1) financial
assets at FVTPL, (2) loans and receivables, or (3) held-to-maturity investments.
Financial assets are recognized in fare value in the balance sheet when the Group becomes a part of the contractual provisions of the
instrument. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than
financial assets at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets, as appropriate, on
initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are
recognized directly in profit or loss. Financial assets are no longer recognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets expire or,
the financial assets are transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets.
Financial assets and AFS financial assets at FVTPL are subsequently measured at fair value. The receivables and held-to-maturity investments
are carried at the amortized cost using the effective interest rate method.
Changes in fair value of financial assets at FVTPL are included in profit or loss for the period at fair value. The received interest during the
period holding assets shall be recognized as investment income. On disposing of it, the difference between fair value and initial accounting
value shall be recognized as in profit or loss statements on investment, and the profit or loss at the fair value is also adjusted accordingly.
Other than impairment loss and exchange gains and losses arising from foreign currency monetary financial assets, the changes in fair value
of AFS financial assets are recorded in the shareholder’s equity. When the financial assets are derecognized, the calculated amount of
changes in fair value of AFS financial assets should be recorded into current profits or losses. The interest of AFS liability instruments
calculated by actual interest rate during the holding period and the cash dividends declared and issued by the investee on available-for-sale
equity instruments should be included in current profit or loss as investment income.

IV.
The Company estimates the carrying amount of a financial asset at the balance sheet date (other than those at FVTPL). If there is objective
evidence that the financial asset is impaired, the Company shall determine to accrue the amount of any impairment loss. When the financial
assets carried at amortized cost impaired, they should be accrued impairment provisions at the amount of the difference that the estimated
future cash flow (exclusive not yet occurred credit loss) lower than the present value. If the amount of impairment loss decreases and the
decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss
should be reversed through current profit and loss. If the fair value of an AFS financial asset declines substantially or non-temporarily, the
accumulated loss arising from this decline that had been recognized directly in shareholders’ equity shall be recognized in the profit or loss
statement. For the AFS liability instrument investment which has been recognized impairment loss, if the fair value increases in the
subsequent period and the increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized, the previously
recognized impairment loss should be reversed through current profit and loss. For the AFS equity instrument investment which has been
recognized impairment loss, the fair value increase in the subsequent period should be directly included in shareholders’ equity.
Financial assets should be derecognized when: (1) the rights to receive cash flows from the assets expired; or (2) the financial assets have
been transferred and the Group has substantially transferred all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets; (3) the financial assets have
been transferred, the Group has neither transferred nor keep almost all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets but gave up the
control of the financial assets.
If the enterprise neither transferred all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets nor gave up the control of the financial assets, the
related financial assets should be recognized based on the degree of involvement into the transferred financial assets by the enterprise, the
related liabilities should be recognized as well. The degree of involvement into the transferred financial assets means the risk level faced by
the enterprise, which was caused by the value change of such financial assets.
If the holistic transfer of financial assets meets the conditions of derecognition, the difference between the carrying value of transferred
financial assets and the sum of consideration from the transfer and the accumulated amount of fair value change originally included in other
comprehensive income should be included into the current loss and profit.
It the partial transfer of financial assets meets the conditions of derecognition, the entire carrying value of transferred financial assets should
be apportioned between the portion whose recognition has been stopped and the portion whose recognition has not been stopped according
to the respective fair value. The difference between the sum of consideration from the transfer and the accumulated amount of fair value
change of the derecognized portion which has been originally included in other comprehensive income and the carrying value of the
derecognized portion before apportionment should be included into the current loss and profit.

Financial assets and financial liabilities – continued
(2)
Financial liabilities
Upon initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL) or ‘other
financial liabilities’.
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL. Financial
liabilities at FVTPL are subsequently measured at fair value, with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value as well as dividends and
interest income related to such financial liabilities recognized in profit or loss for the period.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at unamortized cost using the effective interest method.
When the present obligation of financial liability entirely or partly discharged, the whole financial liability or the part of the financial liability of
which present obligation has been partly discharged should be derecognized. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial
liability derecognized and the consideration paid shall be included in current profit and loss.
(3)
Method of fair values recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities
If there is an active market for financial instrument, the quoted market price in an active market is used to determine the fair value of the
financial instrument. In the active market, financial assets held or financial liabilities intending to bear by the Group take the current quoted
price as the fair value of the relevant assets and liabilities. Financial assets intending to buy or financial liabilities borne by the Group take the
current offer price as the fair value of the relevant assets and liabilities. If there are no quoted price and offer price for financial assets and
liabilities, and the economic conditions do not change significantly after the latest transaction, the latest quotation is used to determine the
fair value of such financial assets or liabilities. If the economic conditions changed significantly after the latest transaction, the fair value of
such financial assets or financial liabilities should be determined by adjusting the quoted price of the latest transaction through preferring to
the current price or interest of the similar financial assets or financial liabilities. If the Group has sufficient evidence to prove that the quoted
price of the latest transaction did not based on fair value, the fair value of such financial assets or financial liabilities should be determined
through appropriate adjustment on the quoted price of the latest transaction.
If there no active market for financial instrument, the fair values are determined by evaluation method, including to consult the latest prices in
the marketing transaction by the parties who are familiar with the market and make the transaction Voluntarily, the current fair values of the
other identified financial assets, discounted method of cash flow and options pricing modes.

Method of fair values recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities – continued
The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts of the Company and its overseas subsidiaries Yanzhou Coal Mining Company Limited
Australia and the belonging subsidiaries (the Australian subsidiaries) are subject to the discounted cash flow between the contracted exchange
rate and present value of forward exchange rate. Fair values of interest swap contracts are subject to the discounted cash flow between the
floating interest rate and fixed interest rate.
7.
Accounting method for bad debt provisions of the receivables
The following situations are considered as criterion of recognizing bad debt as loss of receivables: revocation, bankruptcy, insolvency,
seriously shortage of cash flows, out of business caused by serious natural disaster and unable to pay off the debt within the foreseeable time
of the debtors, other solid evidence indicating that debt can’t be recovered or be of a slim chance.
The allowance method is applied to the possible loss of bad debt, the impairment shall be assessed separately or in combination, the
Company shall be determined to accrue the bad debt provisions which shall be calculated into the current profits and losses. If there is
defined evidence for the receivables not to or not likely to be received, which shall be classified into the loss of bad debt and write off the
accrued bad debts provisions after going through the approval procedure of the Company.
(1)
The receivables with individual significant amount accruing bad debts provisions
Judgment basis or amount standards of individual significant

The receivables with more than RMB8 million individual amount
shall be classified into the significant receivables;
The accruing method of the receivables with individual significant

Inventories
(1)
the classification of inventories: The inventories include the raw materials, coal stock, low value consumables and so on.
(2)
(3)
(4)
the pricing method of receiving and issuing inventories: The Company adopts a perpetual inventory system to calculate its inventory,
using the actual cost pricing for procurement and inventories, and weighted average approach for consumptions and delivery of
inventories.
The end-of-period inventories are measured at the lower one between the cost and the convertible net value. If the inventories are
damaged, become partially or completely obsolete or sold at price lower than cost, unrecoverable cost shall be estimated and
recognized as a provision for decline in value. The excess of cost over the convertible net value is generally recognized as provision
for decline in value of inventories on a separate inventory item.
Net realisable value of inventories directly for sale, such as commodity stocks and materials for sale, is the estimated selling price
less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale and other related taxes; Net realisable value of material stocks for product is
the estimated selling price less the estimated costs, the estimated marketing cost and other related taxes of the finished production
occurred

Long-term equity investments
Long-term equity investments mainly includes equity investments held by the Group which exercise control, joint control or significant
influence on the investee, which has no control, joint control or significant influence on the investee, and which has no offer in active market
and whose fair values cannot be reliable measured.
Joint control means mutual control over certain economic activities under contract. The main basis to define joint control is that any party of
the joint venture cannot control the production and business operations of the venture individually, and the decisions involving the basic
production and business operations need the unanimous consent from all parties.
Joint control represents a contractual agreed common control over an economic activity. Joint control exists when neither party has
independent power to control the operating activities and the decision making relating to the operating activities of the jointly controlled entity
require unanimous consent of the parties.
Significant influence means that the investor has the right to participate decision-making for the finance and operating policies of investee and
has no control or joint control with other parties on policies-making. The main basis to define significant influence is that the Group holds
directly or indirectly through subsidiaries above 20% (included) but less than 50% voting shares of investee. Significant influence cannot be
recognized if there is solid evidence indicating that the investor cannot participate in the decision-making of investee.

Long-term equity investments – continued
For a business combination involving enterprise under common control, the initial investment cost of the long-term equity investment is the
carrying amount of the owner’s equity of the party being absorbed at the combination date. For a business combination not involving
enterprises under common control, the initial investment cost of the long-term equity investment acquired is the aggregate of the fair value, at
the acquisition date, of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
For a long-term equity investment acquired by cash payment, the initial investment cost shall be the actual purchase price that has been paid.
Initial investment cost also includes those costs, taxes and other necessary expenditures directly attributable to the acquisition of the long-
term equity investment. For a long-term equity investment acquired by the issue of equity securities, the initial investment cost shall be the fair
value of the securities issued. A long-term equity investment invested by investors, the initial investment cost use the values described in
investment contract or agreement. For a long-term equity investment acquired by debts reorganization or non-currency assets transaction, the
initial investment cost shall be recognized in accordance with relevant accounting standards.
The cost method is applied in calculating the subsidiaries investment, equity method used in adjusting the consolidated financial statements.
If the Company does not have joint control or significant influence over the investee, the investment is not quoted in an active market and its
fair value cannot be reliably measured, a long-term equity investment shall be calculated using the cost method. If the Company does not have
control, joint control or significant influence over the investee and the fair value of the long-term equity investment can be reliably measured,
the investment shall be calculated as an available-for-sale financial asset.
Under the cost method, long-term equity investments are measured at initial investment cost, and the investment cost shall be adjusted when
the investments are added and recovered. Under the equity method, the current investment profit and loss are the net profits and losses
created by the investee and shared by the Company. The share of net profits or losses from the investee should be confirmed, based on the
fair values of identifiable assets on the acquisition date, according to the accounting policies and accounting period of the Group, offsetting
inter-segment transactions profit and loss created by joint venture and associated enterprises which belong to the investor in terms of shares
proportion, and after adjusting the net profit from investee. The Group shall, if there is debt balance relating to the long-term equity investment
on the joint venture and associates hold before the executing date, deduct the debt balance which should amortize within remaining term, and
recognize the investment profits and losses.

For the reason of decreasing investment, the Group no longer has any joint control or significant influence on the investee, and in active
market the long-term equity investment, which has no offer and fair values and cannot be reliably measured, shall be measured by cost
method. For the reason of increasing investment, the Group is able to exercise control over the investee, the measurement shall be changed
into cost method. For the reason of increasing investment, the Group is able to exercise joint control or significant influence but unable to
exercise control on the investee, or for the reason of disposal of investment, the Group is unable to exercise control but able to exercise joint
control or significant influence over the investee, the measurement shall be changed into cost method.
When long-term equity investment is disposed, the difference between the carrying value and the actual consideration is recognized as
investment return of the period; under equity method, the long-term equity investments, which is recognized as shareholder’s equity of the
investor arising on the change of investee’s shareholder equity (other than net loss and profit), is included in investment return of the period
according to the relevant proportion.

Recognition of fixed assets: Fixed assets are tangible assets that are held for production or operation, and have a service life more
than one accounting year.
Category of fixed assets: Buildings, coal mine buildings, ground buildings, railway structure, harbour works and craft, plant,
machinery and equipment, transportation equipment, land etc.
Measurement of fixed assets: The fixed assets shall be initially measured at actual cost of acquisition considering the effect of any
expected costs of disposing the asset. Among these, the costs of outsourcing fixed assets include duties and expenses such as
purchasing cost, VAT, import tariff, other expenses incurred to ensure estimated usage of the fixed assets that can be directly
included in the assets. The costs to build the fixed assets include necessary expenses incurred to ensure the usage status of the
assets. The accounting value of the fixed assets invested by the investors shall be accordance with the values specified in the
investment contract or agreement, while for not fair value specified in the contract or agreement, shall be regarded as fair value in
accounting value. Fixed assets by financial lease are recognized at the lower of fair value of such assets at leasing date and the
present value of minimum lease payment.

With regard to the replaced parts, the carrying value shall not be recognized and other subsequent costs incurred shall be recognized
in the gain and loss in the period.
Depreciation approach of fixed assets: The depreciation is provided to all fixed assets except those that have already accrued
depreciation and lands category. The mining structures are depreciated using the estimated production capacity method, and other
fixed assets using the average service life method, calculating depreciation rate by month and record it into the current cost or
expenses of relevant assets according to their various purposes. The Group’s estimated residual value for fixed assets is 0-3%, the

(6)
The Company shall review the useful life and estimated net residual value of a fixed asset and the depreciation method applied at
least at each financial year-end. A change in the useful life or estimated net residual value of a fixed asset or depreciation method
used shall be treated as a change in an accounting estimate.

shall be no longer recognized. When a fixed asset is sold, transferred, scraped or damaged, the enterprise shall recognize the
amount of any proceeds on disposal of the asset net of the carrying value and related taxes in profit or loss for the current period.
Recognition basis and measurement method of fixed assets by financial lease: Finance lease is a lease that substantially transfers
all risks and rewards relating to ownership of an asset. Fixed assets by financial lease are recognized at the lower of fair value of the
assets and the present value of minimum lease payment. The leased assets shall be depreciated at a straight-line basis over the
shorter of service life and leasing term. The net income, from sales and leaseback transaction which has been recognized as
financial lease, shall be recorded as deferred revenue on balance sheet, be amortized at a straight-line basis over the leasing term
and recognized in the income statements.
11.
Fixed assets under construction
(1)
the pricing approach of the fixed assets under construction: To be measured at the actual costs incurred for the construction. The
self-operated construction is recorded at all cost of direct materials, direct salary, and direct construction expenditures etc. And the
contracting construction is recorded at the payable construction cost and so on. The equipment installation cost is measured at value
of the installed equipment, installation cost, all expenses incurred for project test-run. The cost of fixed assets under construction
includes capitalized borrowing costs, gain and loss from currency exchange.
(2)
Standard and time of transfer from the fixed assets under construction to the fixed assets: The fixed assets under construction shall
be transferred to the fixed assets from the date of starting its estimated usable condition based on their construction budget,
construction pricing or project actual cost and so on, and its depreciation will begin from the next month. The difference of the fixed
assets original values shall be adjusted upon the resolution procedures of the project completion.
12. Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs include loan interests, amortization of premiums or discounts, auxiliary expenses and exchange differences arising on
foreign currency borrowing. When expenditures for the asset and borrowing costs are being incurred, activities relating to the acquisition,
construction or production of the asset that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale have commenced, borrowing costs,
which are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, shall be capitalized. Capitalization of
borrowing costs shall be discontinued when acquired and constructed production is available for use or sale. Other borrowing costs shall be
recognized as costs for the current period.

The amount of interest of specific borrowings occurred for the period shall be capitalized after deducting bank interest earned from depositing
the unused borrowings or any investment income on the temporary investment. The capitalized amount of general borrowings shall to be
determined at the basis that the weighted average (of the excess amounts of cumulative assets expenditures above the specific borrowings)
times capitalization rate (of used general borrowings). The capitalization rate shall be determined according to the weighted average interest
rates of general borrowings.
Assets eligible for capitalization represent fixed assets, investment property, inventories, etc, which shall take a long time (generally above
one year) for acquisition, construction or production to be ready for the specific use or sale.
If an asset eligible for capitalization is interrupted abnormally and continuously more than 3 months during the purchase, construction or
production, capitalization of borrowing costs shall be suspended until the above interrupted activities restart.
13.
Intangible assets
The pricing method of intangible assets: The intangible assets of the Group include mainly mining rights, unproved mining interests,
expenditure for the exploration and evaluation, the land use rights, patents and techniques etc. For purchased intangible assets, actual paid
cost and other relevant expenses are used as the actual cost. For intangible assets invested by investors, the actual cost is determined
according to the values specified in the investment contract or agreement, while for the unfair agreed value in contract or agreement, the
actual cost is determined at the fair value. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognized separately from goodwill are
initially recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).
(1)
(2)
Mining rights. Coal reserves are amortized over the life of the mine on a unit of production basis of the estimated total proven and
probable reserves or the Australia Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) reserves for the Groups subsidiaries in Australia.
Coal resources. Coal resources represent the fair value of economically recoverable reserves (excluding the portion of total proven
and probable reserves of coal mines of a mining right i.e. does not include the above coal reserves) of coal mines of a mining right
(Details are set out in the accounting policy of exploration and evaluation expenditure).
(3)
Land use rights. The land use rights are evenly amortized over the transferred term since the rights are obtained.

Talent, technology and other intangible assets. The patent and technology with limited life shall be amortized under composite life
method. The patent and technology with unsure life shall not be amortized. The amortized amounts shall be included in the cost of
related assets or profit or loss for the period in which they are incurred based on the beneficiary objects. For an intangible asset with
a finite useful life, the Company shall review the useful life and the amortization method applied at each financial year-end. A change
in the useful life or amortization method used shall be accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate. For an intangible asset
with an indefinite useful life, the Company shall reassess the useful life of the asset in each accounting period. If there is evidence
indicating that the useful life of that intangible asset is finite, the Company shall estimate the useful life of that asset and apply the
accounting requirements of the Standard accordingly.
14.
Exploration and evaluation expenditures
IV.
Exploration and evaluation activities include the search for mineral resources, identification of the technical feasibility and evaluation of the
commercial feasibility of the distinguished resource. Exploration and evaluation expenditures includes the direct costs of the following
activities: research and analysis of historical exploration data; data collection from the topography, geochemical and geophysical exploration
and research; exploration drilling, trenching and sampling; identifying and reviewing the amount and level of resources; measuring transport
and infrastructure requirements; and conducting market and financial research.
In the early stages of projects exploration, exploration and evaluation expenditures occurred is credited to profit or loss are incurred. When the
project has the technical feasibility and commercial viability, the exploration and evaluation expenditure (including the costs incurred for
purchase of exploration permit) are capitalised into exploration and evaluation assets by a single item.
Exploration and evaluation assets are collected into construction in progress. These assets are converted into fixed assets or intangible assets
when getting ready for their intended use, and accrued depreciation or amortization within operating life. The related unrecoverable cost shall
be immediately written off and credited as profit or loss when projects are abandoned.

Impairment of non-financial assets
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that the long-term equity investments measured by equity
method, investment property, fixed assets, and construction in progress and intangible assets with finite useful life may be impaired. If there
is objective evidence that one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that event has an impact on the
estimated future cash flows of the financial asset which can be reliably estimated, a financial asset is impaired. Goodwill arising in a business
combination and an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life shall be tested for impairment annually, irrespective of whether there is any
indication that the asset may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment assessment, goodwill shall be considered together with the related
asset groups or sets of asset group allocated with goodwill should be assessed for impairment at each financial year-end.
If the recoverable amount of the asset groups or set of asset groups is less than the book value, the difference will be recognized as
impairment loss and once an impairment loss is recognized, it shall not be reversed in a subsequent period. The recoverable amount of an
asset is the higher of its fair value cost of disposal and the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset costs
of disposal.
The signs of impairment are as follows:
(1)
The current market price of an asset substantially declines, exceeding obviously the expected decline caused by time changes or
normal application.
(2)
(3)
The current or future significant changes in the economic, technical or legal environment of the enterprise and in the market of an
asset shall have adverse impacts on the enterprise.
The improved market rate or other return on investment in the period shall have an effect on the discount rate used by enterprise to
calculate estimated cash flow present value, leading to substantial decline in recoverable amount of assets.
(4)
There is evidence to demonstrate that the assets have already gone absolute or its entity has already been damaged.
(5)
the assets have already been or will be left unused, or will stop using, or are under the plan to be disposed in advance.
(6)
the evidences of internal reports demonstrate that economic returns of assets have already been lower or will be lower than
expectations, for example, net cash flow created by assets or operating profit (or loss) realized by assets are much lower (or higher)
than expected amounts.
(7)
Other signs to indicate that assets value have already been impaired.

16. Goodwill
Goodwill means equity investment cost or the differences between the merger costs and the shareholder’s equity book value of the combined
party under the corporate merger not under the same control.
Goodwill related to subsidiaries shall be presented alone in consolidated financial statements, to joint ventures or associated companies shall
be included in the book value of long-term equity investment.
17.
Long-term deferred expenses
The Group’s long-term deferred expenses means mining rights compensations, but which should be undertaken in more than 1 year of
amortization period (not including 1 year) of the current and future periods, the expenses shall be amortized averagely in the benefit period. If
the project of long-term deferred expenses cannot make benefit in the future accounting periods, the unamortized value of the project will be
transferred to the profits or losses for the period.
18.
Employee benefits
In the accounting period in which an employee has rendered service to the company, the company shall recognize the employee benefits
payable for that service as a liability, and recorded into related assets or current profit or loss in accordance with the objects that benefited
from the service rendered by employees. Any compensation liability arising from the termination of employment relationship with employees
should be charged to the profit or loss for the current period.
Mainly include salary, bonus, allowance and subsidy, employee welfare expenses, social insurance cost, public accumulation fund for
housing construction, labour union expenditures, employee education funds, annual leave, sick leave, long service leave and other expenses
associated with service rendered by employees.
Employee benefits expected to be settled within 12 months are measured using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of
settlement. Provisions made in respect of employee benefits which are not expected to be settled within 12 months are measured as the
present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting
date.

Estimated liability
(1)
The recognition principles of the estimated liability: the Company recognizes it as a provision when an obligation related to an
contingency such as reclamation, disposal and environment restoring caused by mining, external guarantee, pending litigation or
arbitration, product quality warranty, downsizing scheme, loss contract, restructuring obligation and so on satisfy all of the following
conditions:
1)
The obligation is a present obligation of the Company;
2)
It is probable that an outflow of economic benefits from the Company will be required to settle the obligation;
3)
The amount of the obligation can be measured reliably.
(2)
The measurement approaches of the estimated liability: the estimated liability is primarily measured according to the estimated
optimal value paid to implement the relevant present obligations considering the factors such as the risks, uncertainties and currency
time values related to the contingencies. If the currency time value has major effects, the estimated optimal value is determined after
the discounting of the relevant future cash flow. If any change happens to the estimated optimal value during reviewing the carrying
amount of the estimated liabilities on the balance sheet date, the adjustment will be made to the carrying amount to reflect the
current estimated optimal value.
20. Overburden in advance
Overburden in advance comprises the accumulation of expenses incurred to enable access to the coal seams, and includes direct removal
costs, machinery and plant running costs. The deferred costs are then charged to the consolidated income statement in subsequent periods
on the basis of run-of-mine (ROM coal tonnes mined. This is calculated by multiplying the ROM coal tonnes mined during the period by the
weighted average cost to remove a bank cubic metre (BCM of waste by the stripping ratio (ratio of waste removed in BCMs to ROM coal tonnes
mined). The stripping ratio of the Company’s Australian subsidiaries is based on the JORC reserves of each mine

Land subsidence, restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs
The mining activities of the Group and the domestic subsidiaries may cause land subsidence of the underground mining sites. Usually, the
Group may relocate inhabitants from the land above the underground mining sites prior to mining those sites and compensate the inhabitants
for losses or damages from land subsidence. Depending on the experience, the management estimate and accrue an amount of payments for
restoration, rehabilitation and environmental protection of the land, which may arise in the future after the underground sites have been
mined.
In consideration of the time difference between the payments of the fees for relocation, restoration, rehabilitation and environmental protection
of the land and the mining of underground mines, the Group charges the prepayment of such fees regarding to future mining as a current
asset. Caused by the paid amount less than the accrued amount, the fees regarding to future payment for relocation, restoration, rehabilitation
and environmental protection of the land are accounted for as a current liability.
22.
Special reserves
(1)
Provision for production maintenance and production safety expenses
Pursuant to the rules and regulations jointly issued by Ministry of Finance, State Administration of Coal Mine Safety and related government
authorities in PRC, the Company has to accrue for production maintenance expenses (Wei Jian Fei) at RMB6 per ton of raw coal mined, which
is used to maintain production and technical improvement of coal mines. The Company also accrues for production safety expenses at RMB15
per ton raw coal mined (standards for the Company’s subsidiary Shanxi Heshun Tianchi Energy Company Limited is RMB50 per ton raw coal
mined) and is used for purchase of coal production equipment and safety expense of coal mining structure.
In accordance with the regulations of “the Interim Measures of financial management of costs of safety in the high-risk industries and
enterprises” (Caiqi [2012] No. 16) of the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Work Safety, as the subsidiaries of the Group, Hua
Ju Energy has a commitment to incur Work Safety Cost at the rate of: 4% of the sales income for the year below RMB10 million; 2% of the
actual sales income for the year between RMB10 million and RMB100 million (included); 0.5% of the actual sales income for the year between
RMB100 million and RMB1 billion (included); 0.2% of the actual sales income for the year above RMB1 billion.
The above accrued amounts, which have been charged in cost and unused, shall be presented separately in special reserves of shareholder’s
equity. Production safety expenses, which belong to cost of expenses, directly offset the special reserves. The accrued production safety
expenses, which is used by enterprises and formed into fixed assets, shall be charged in “construction in progress”, and recognised as fixed
asset when safety project is completed and reaches the expected operation condition; meanwhile, offset the special reserves according to the
cost forming into fixed asset, and recognise the same amount of accumulated depreciation. This fixed asset shall no longer accrue
depreciation in the following period.

23.
The Principles of Revenue recognition
The business revenues are generated mainly from sales of goods, rendering of services and alienating the right to use assets. The principles
of revenue recognition are as follows:
(1)
Revenue from sales of goods:
Revenue is recognized when the Company has transferred to the buyer the main risks and rewards of ownership of the goods, neither retains
continuing management usually associated with ownership nor effectively controls over the goods sold, and the amount of revenue can
reliably measured, the associated economic benefits are likely to flow into the enterprise, and the related to costs incurred can be reliably
measured.
(2)
Revenue from rendering of services:
When the provision of services is started and completed within the same accounting year, revenue is recognized at the time of completion of
the services. When the provision of services is started and completed in different accounting years and the outcome of a transaction involving
the rendering of services can be estimated reliably, revenue is recognized at the balance sheet date by the use of the percentage of completion
method.
(3)
Revenue from alienating the right to use assets
The revenue is recognized when the Company has received the economic benefits associated with the transaction, and can reliably measure
the relevant amount of revenue.

Government grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be received and the Group is able to comply with
the conditions attaching to them. Government grants in the form of monetary assets are recorded based on as the amount received, whereas
quota subsidies are measured as the amount receivable. Government grants in the form of non-monetary assets are measured at fair value or
nominal amount (RMB1) if the fair value cannot be reliably obtained.
Government grants received in relation to assets are recorded as deferred income, and recognised evenly in the income statement over the
assets’ useful lives. Government grants received in relation to revenue are recorded as deferred income, and recognised as income in future
periods as compensation when the associated future expenses or losses arise; or directly recognised as income in the current period as
compensation for past expenses or losses.
25. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
The deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences arising from the difference between the carrying amount
of an asset or liability and its tax base (temporary differences). For any deductible loss or tax deduction that can be deducted the amount of the
taxable income the next year according to the taxation regulations, the corresponding deferred income tax asset shall be determined
considering the temporary difference. On the balance sheet date, the deferred income assets and deferred income tax liabilities shall be
measured at the tax rate applicable to the period during which the assets are expected to be recovered or the liabilities are expected to be
settled.
An enterprise shall recognize the deferred income tax liability arising from a deductible temporary difference to the extent of the amount of the
taxable income which it is most likely to obtain and which can be deducted from the deductible temporary difference. For the recognized
deferred income tax asset, if it is unlikely to obtain sufficient taxable income to offset against the benefit of the deferred income tax asset, the
carrying amount of the deferred income tax assets shall be written down. Any such write-down should be subsequently reversed where it
becomes probable that sufficient taxable income will be available.

Leases
The Company classifies the leases into finance lease and operating lease on the lease beginning date.
Finance lease is a lease that substantially transfers all the risks and rewards incident to ownership of an assets. On the lease beginning date,
as the leaseholder, the Company recognizes the lower of fair value of lease assets and the present value of minimum lease payment as
financial leased fixed assets; recognizes the minimum lease payment as long-term payable, and recognizes the difference between the above
two as unverified financing costs.
Operating lease is the other lease except finance lease. As the leaseholder, the Company records lease payments into the related assets cost or
the profit or loss for the period on a straight-line basis over the lease term and; records lease income into revenue in the income statement on
a straight-line basis over the lease term.
27. Accounting calculation of the income tax
The accounting calculation of the income tax adopts the balance sheet liabilities approach. The income taxes include the current and deferred
income tax. The current income tax and deferred income tax expenses and earnings are recorded into the current profit and loss, except those
related to the transactions and events are recorded directly into the shareholder’s equity and the deferred income tax is adjusted into the
carrying amount of goodwill arising from the business combination.
The current income tax expense is the income tax payable, that is, the amount of the current transactions and events calculated according to
the taxation regulations paid to the taxation authorities by the enterprises. The deferred income tax is the difference between the due amounts
of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be recognized according to the balance sheet liabilities approach in the period end and the
amount recognized originally.
28. Minerals Resource Rent Tax
Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT) is levied by Australian government for all Australian mineral enterprises on the base of net mining profit
after deductible items, therefore the recognition, measurement and disclosure of relevant expenses, deferred assets and liabilities of MRRT are
consistent with income tax, refer to Note IV.25 and IV.27 for details.

Segment reporting
Reportable segments are identified based on operating segments which are determined based on the structure of the Group’s internal
organization, management requirements and internal reporting system. An operating segment is a component of the Group that meets the
following respective conditions:
(1)
Engage in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses;
(2)
Whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s management to make decisions about resource to be allocated to the
segment and assess its performance; and
(3)
For which financial information regarding financial position, results of operations and cash flows are available.
30. Operation Method of Hedges Business
The Group’s overseas subsidiaries use derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign exchange contracts, coal swap contracts,
interest rate swaps contracts to hedge cash flow for foreign exchange risks, fluctuations in coal prices and interest rate risk.
The relationship between hedging instrument and hedged item is recorded by the Group on hedging transaction date, including the target of
risk management and various hedging transaction strategies. The Group will regularly assess whether the derivatives can continuously and
effectively hedge cash flows of the hedged item during the period of hedging transactions. The Group uses the comparative method of the
principle terms of the contract to do the expected evaluation on the effectiveness of hedging, and uses ratio analysis method to do the
retrospective evaluation on the effectiveness of hedging at the end of the reporting period.
Net amounts receivable or payable of hedging transactions is recorded into the balance sheet as assets or liabilities from hedging transaction
date. The unrealized gain or loss shall be recorded into hedging reserve under equity. The change of fair values of forward foreign currency
contract, coal swap contract or interest swap contract shall be recognized through hedging reserve until the expected transactions occur.
Accumulated balance in equity shall be included in the income statement or be recognized as part of the cost in relation of its assets.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the
hedge accounting shall not be applicable. Accumulated gain or loss of hedging instruments is recorded in the equity and recognized when
transaction happens. Accumulated gain or loss, which is recorded in shareholder’s equity, shall be transferred in the profit or loss for the
period if transaction is not expected to make.

31. Business combinations
A business combination is a transaction or event that brings together of separate enterprises into one reporting entity. The Company
recognizes the assets and liabilities arising from the business combinations at the combinations date or acquisition date. Combinations date
or acquisition date is the date on which the absorbing party effectively obtains control of the party being absorbed.
(1)
(2)
Business combinations involving enterprises under common control: Assets and liabilities that are obtained by the absorbing party in
a business combination are measured at their carrying amounts at the combination date as recorded by the party being absorbed.
The difference between the carrying amount of the net assets obtained and the carrying amount of the consideration paid for the
combination is adjustment to capital reserve. If the capital reserve is not sufficient to absorb the difference, any excess shall be
adjusted against retained earnings.
Business combinations not Involving enterprises under common control: The cost of combination for a business combination not
involving enterprises under common control is the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of the assets given, liabilities
incurred or assumed, and equity securities issued by the acquirer. Where the cost of a business combination exceeds the acquirer’s
interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the difference shall be
recognized as goodwill. Where the cost of combination is less than the acquiree’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identified
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, after the reviewing, the acquirer shall recognize the remaining difference
immediately in profit or loss for the current period.
32.
Preparation methods for consolidated financial statements
(1)
(2)
The consolidated scope recognition principles: the Company takes the subsidiaries owning the actual controlling power and the main
bodies for the special purpose into the scope of the consolidated financial statements.
The accounting methods introduced in the consolidated financial statements: The consolidated financial statements are prepared
pursuant to Enterprises accounting criteria No.33-consolidated financial statements and relevant provisions. All major inter-segment
transactions, balances, income and expenses in the consolidation scope are eliminated in full on consolidation. Unrealized loss from
inter-segment transactions shall, if there is evidence that the loss is part of the related impairment, be recognized in full.
Shareholder’s equity in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries is identified separately from the Group’s equity therein.

Preparation methods for consolidated financial statements – continued
If the losses to the minority shareholders exceed their shares in the subsidiary’s equity, in addition to the part that minority shareholders have
an obligation to bear according to the articles of association or agreement and the minority shareholders have the ability to bear, the
remaining part shall offset the shareholders’ equity attributable to the parent company. If the subsidiary subsequently reports profits, all
profits are attributable to shareholders’ equity of the parent company before compensating the losses to the minority shareholders which were
borne by the shareholders’ equity of the parent company.
If any conflicts between the accounting policies or the accounting period introduced in the subsidiaries and those of the Company, the
necessary adjustment shall be made to the financial statements of the subsidiaries according to the accounting policies or the accounting
period in the Company during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
For those subsidiaries acquired not under common control, some few financial statements are adjusted based on the fair values of the
identifiable net assets after the acquisition date in preparing consolidated financial statements. For those subsidiaries acquired under
common control, which are considered to be existed at the opening of the consolidation period, the assets, liabilities, the operating results
and cash flows from the opening of the consolidation period are presented in the consolidated financial statement according to the original
carrying amounts.
33. Common control operation
There is common control operation in overseas subsidiaries of the Company. Common control operation means that a company uses its
assets or other economic resources with other cooperative parties to jointly do coal exploration, development, operation, or other economic
activities, and jointly control these economic activities in accordance with contracts or agreements.
The overseas subsidiaries are entitled to the profits created by joint controlled assets as per the shares controlled by them, and they shall
recognize revenue and costs in relation to common control operation in light of contracts or agreements.
34.
Significant accounting policies and accounting estimates
When use the above mentioned accounting policies and accounting estimate, because of the uncertainty of operation, the Group needs to
apply the judgments, estimates and assumptions to book value of inaccurate measured items, which was made on the basis of experiences of
the management and consideration of other related factors. However, the actual conditions are possibly different from the estimates.
The Group makes regulatory check on above mentioned judgments, estimates and assumptions. The Company confirms the influences of the
accounting modifications in the current and future of the modification time, dependently.

34.
Significant accounting policies and accounting estimates – continued
On balance sheet date, the key assumptions and the uncertainties leading to the possible major adjustments for the carrying amounts of the
assets, liabilities in the future are as follows:
(1)
Depreciation and amortization
Fixed assets and intangible assets are depreciated and amortized on the straight-line or production basis over their useful lives. The Group
shall regularly review the useful lives and economically recoverable coal reserves to determine the total amount of depreciation and
amortization which will be included in each period. Useful lives are calculated on the basis of the experience from similar assets and expected
change of technology. Economically recoverable coal reserves are calculated by the economically recoverable coal resources based on actual
measurement. If the past estimates change significantly, the depreciation and amortization shall be adjusted during future periods.
Estimates of coal reserves are involved in subjective judgment, because the estimating technology is inaccurate, so the coal reserves are only
approximate value. The recent production and technology documents shall be considered for the estimates of economically recoverable coal
reserves which will be updated regularly, the inherent inaccuracy of technical estimating exists.
(2)
Land subsidence, restoration, rehabilitation and environmental obligations
The Company needs to relocate the villages on the surface due to the underground coal mining, and bear the cost of relocation of villages,
ground crops (or attachments) compensation, land rehabilitation, restructuring and environmental management and other obligations. The
performance of obligation is likely to lead to outflow of resources, when the amount of the obligation can be measured reliably, it is
recognized as an environmental reclamation obligations. Depending on the relevance with the future production activities and the reliability of
the estimated determination, the flow and non-flow reclamation provision should be recognized as the profit and loss for the period or
credited to the relevant assets.
After taking into account existing laws and regulations and according to the past experience and the best estimate of future expenditures,
management determines Land subsidence, restoration, rehabilitation and environmental obligations. If the time value of money is material, the
expected future cash outflows will be discounted to its net present value. Following the current coal mining activities and under the condition
that the future impact on land and the environment has become evident, Land subsidence, restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs
may be amended from time to time. Discount rate used by the Group may change due to assessment on the time value of money market and
debt specific risks, when the estimate of the expected costs changed, it will be adjusted accordingly by the appropriate discount rate.

(3)
Impairment of non-financial long-term assets
As described in note 4 (16), at the date of the balance sheet the Group assesses impairment of non-financial assets to determine whether the
recoverable amount of assets fell less than its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the difference
is recognized as impairment loss.
The recoverable amount is the higher between the net amounts of fair value of the assets (or assets group) less disposal costs and the
estimated present value of future cash flow of the assets (or assets group). As the Group cannot reliably access the open market price of the
assets (or asset group), it is not reliable and accurate to estimate the fair value of assets. When estimating the present value of future cash
flows, the company needs to make significant judgments on the future useful life, the product yield, price, the related operating costs of the
assets (or assets group) and the discount rate used for calculating the present value. When estimating the recoverable amount, the Group will
use all possibly available information, including the product yield, price from the reasonable and supportable assumption and the forecast
related to operating costs.
(4)
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been
allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and
a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value. Expectation has been determined based on past performance and
management’s expectations for the market development.

CHANGE OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND CORRECTION OF EARLY ERRORS
1.
Changes of accounting policies and the impact
During the reporting period, the Group made no changes in accounting policies.

Changes in accounting estimates
Pursuant to “Notice of Provision and Use Management Method of Production Safety Expense” jointly issued by Ministry of Finance and the
State Administration of Work Safety (Caiqi 2012] No. 16), and upon approval at the Tenth Meeting of the Fifth Session of the Board, since
February 2012, the provision basis for accruing the Production Safety Expense for the Parent Company, Heze Nenghua, and Anyuan as well as
Wenyu Coal Mine which belong to Ordos Nenghua has been amended to be RMB15 per ton of ROM. This amendment of accounting estimate
will lead to an increase of cost of sales amounting to RMB121.11million for the reporting period (January-June, 2012). Meanwhile, it will lead to
a decrease of total profit and income tax expense of RMB121.11 million and RMB30.28 million, respectively; and will eventually result in a
decrease of net profit amounting to RMB90.83 million.

Note 1: The overburden on the coal seam of open-pits owned by overseas subsidiaries of the Company-Yancoal Australia shall be removed, which will
result in removal costs. Removal costs shall be recorded as profits or losses when respective coal seam is mined.
Note 2: To avoid the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation, overseas subsidiaries of the Company-Yancoal Australia entered into forward
foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risks: to exchange USD into AUD on the agreed date in the future at the agreed exchange
rate range, or the spot rate. On the balance sheet date, derivative financial assets or liabilities reflect the fair value of related outstanding
contracts. The fair value will be calculated on the difference between the forward foreign currency contract exchange rate on the balance sheet
date and on the contracts signing date.
Note 3:
It is the right of the subsidiary of the Company-Gloucester to collect the mining royalty of 4% of Free on Board Trimmed Sales (FOBT sales)
from Middlemount Coal Pty Ltd. The royalty receivable is measured based on management’s expectations of the future cash flows with gains
and losses recognized in the statements of comprehensive income at each reporting date.
As at June 30, 2012, the royalty receivable to be obtained during the next 12 months, amounting to AUD16.5 million, will be disclosed as other
current asset; the royalty receivable obtained after one year amounting to AUD 175.4 million, will be disclosed as other non-current asset.
Note 4: To meet the requirement of the acquisition of Yancoal Resources, Yancoal Australia borrowed a bank loan of USD3 billion. In July 2010, the
Company entered into interest rate swap contracts amounting to USD1.5 billion with Bank of China (BOC), China Construction Bank (CCB) and
China Development Bank (CDB). Pursuant to the contracts, the Company should pay interest expenses to BOC, CCB and CDB at the annual
rate of 2.755%, 2.42% and 2.41% respectively; BOC, CCB and CDB should quarterly pay interest expenses to the Company at the annual rate
of LIBOR plus 0.75% on the agreed date. All the contracts terms are within four years. At the end of June 2012, the fair value of the Contracts
was RMB167.25 million. Through the retrospective review, the Company considers that the hedge is effective and there is no invalid hedge had
been recognized in the income statement.
Note 5:
It is the deferred income recognized by Ashton Joint Venture, a company jointly controlled by the Company, amounting to AUD12.86 million,
which is the government subsidy granted by Australian Energy and Tourism Department to the coal mines with significant carbon emissions
before the execution of the carbon emission price. This subsidy will be used to recover the expense which may occur before June 30, 2013.

(1)
Contingent Value Right (CVR) is a guarantee that protects the value of the merged Yancoal Australia’s shares held by Gloucester’s
shareholders. Eighteen months after the merger, if the value of Yancoal’s shares (the last 3 months volume weighted average trading
price) is below AUD6.96 per share, Gloucester shareholders will be entitled to recoup the share value of up to AUD6.96 per share,
and the recoupment is up to AUD3 per share. However, shares held by Noble Group, the former major shareholder of Gloucester is
not entitled to enjoy this right.
This price guarantee mechanism also gives guarantee to the Company: if the value of Yancoal’s shares is at or above AUD6.96 per share in the
20 trading days out of 25 consecutive trading days after merger, the Company nearly won’t give any payment to Gloucester shareholders.
However, the Company shall give notice to the shareholders if the share price is above AUD6.96 per share in the 10 trading days out of 15
consecutive trading days.

Note: The share reform plan has been implemented by April 3, 2006. On the first trading day after the completion of the share reform, the shares owned
by Yankuang Group, the sole unlisted share holder of the Company, became tradable. However, Yankuang Group committed that it will not sell
these shares in 48 months after the implementation of the reform. Since Yankuang has finished the commitment on the reform of share equity
split, once the application of trading is made by Yankuang Group and approved by relevant regulatory authorities, its holding shares in the
Company can be immediately traded in the market. By the end of the reporting period, since Yankuang Group has not submitted such application,
its holding shares cannot yet be traded in the market.

Note: During the reporting period, share premium increased by RMB133.85 million is due to appropriation of the mining rights payment of Heshun
Tianchi by Yankuang Group; share premium increased by RMB687.25 million is due to the acquisition of Beisu Coal Mine and Yangcun Coal
Mine; share premium decreased by 430.97 million is due to the acquisition of Gloucester. The increase in other capital reserves was caused by
the change of fair value of available-for-sale financial assets and cash flow hedging contract held by the Group.

Note: Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT) is levied on the extraction of certain taxable resources of coal and iron ore in respect of a mining project
interest, and before any extensive processing and value-added activities. MRRT started to be effective from 1 July 2012 in Australia. According
to related MRRT law and regulations, Yancoal Australia is required to recognise starting base allowances from 30 June 2012. Either the market
value or book value method can be used to calculate starting base allowances, which will be amortised over a period of time. Yancoal Australia’s
subsidiaries Austar, Yarrabee, Ashton and Moolarben adopted the market value method, which requires the starting base allowances to be based
on the value of the mining assets as at 1 May 2012 and the market value to be amortised over the lower of life of project, life of mining rights and
life of the mine, The valuation results in the MRRT deferred assets of AUD 264.38 million, and total effect to current tax expense is AUD
(185.07) million after deducting the effect of income tax AUD 79.31 million.

Pursuant to CASs, when relevant assets and subsidiaries purchased from Yankuang Group come into combination with enterprises under the
common control, assets and liabilities of acquiree should be measured based on book value on the date of acquisition. The difference of book
value of net assets acquired by the Company and consolidation price paid was adjusted as capital reserves. While pursuant to IFRS, acquirees
recognize identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities according to the fair value on the date of acquisition. When the cost of a business
combination exceeds the acquirer’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable asset, liabilities and contingent liabilities, the difference
shall be recognized as goodwill.
As stated in Note IV. (22), in accordance with relevant regulations of the Chinese authorities for coal mining companies, provision for production
maintenance, production safety and other related expenditures are accrued base on coal production volume, and are presented in expenses of the
period and the amount that has been accrued but not used are presented in special reserve of owner’s equity. Fixed assets purchased with special
reserve, are presented in related assets and same amount of accumulated depreciation is recognized at the same time. While under IFRS, these
expenses are recognized when it occurs in the period, and relevant capital expenditures are recognized as fixed assets when they occur and
depreciated according to corresponding depreciation method.
The differences between the above mentioned standards bring differences in tax and influence of minority equity.
