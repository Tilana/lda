CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements
June 30, 2016
NOTE 1    THE SPIN-OFF AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The Separation and Spin-off
We are an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company operating
properties exclusively within the State of California. We were incorporated in Delaware as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Occidental) on April 23, 2014,
and remained a wholly-owned subsidiary of Occidental until our spin-off on November 30, 2014
(the Spin-off). Prior to the Spin-off, all material existing assets, operations and liabilities of
Occidental's California business were consolidated under us. On November 30, 2014,
Occidental distributed shares of our common stock on a pro rata basis to Occidental stockholders
and we became an independent, publicly traded company. Occidental initially retained
approximately 18.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock, which it distributed to
Occidental stockholders on March 24, 2016.
Except when the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated, all references to
‘‘CRC,’’ the ‘‘Company,’’ ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘us’’ and ‘‘our’’ refer to California Resources Corporation and its
subsidiaries.
Basis of Presentation
In the opinion of our management, the accompanying financial statements contain all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to fairly present our financial
position as of June 30, 2016, and the statements of operations, comprehensive income, and cash
flows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable. We have
eliminated all of our significant intercompany transactions and accounts. The loss and cash flows
for the periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the loss or cash
flows you should expect for the full year.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2016 presentation.
We have prepared this report pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission applicable to interim financial information, which permit
omission of certain disclosures to the extent they have not changed materially since the latest
annual financial statements. We believe our disclosures are adequate to make the information
not misleading. This Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated and
combined financial statements and the notes thereto in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015.
NOTE 2ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE CHANGES
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued rules that change how
entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are
not measured at fair value. These rules are effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We
are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our financial statements.
In April 2016, the FASB issued rules requiring that entities recognize revenue to depict the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, in
March 2016, the FASB issued rules intended to improve the operability and understandability of
the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and whether an entity
reports revenue on a gross or net basis. These rules have the same effective date, generally in
the first interim period of fiscal 2018, as the related revenue standard issued in 2014. We are
currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB simplified several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based
payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax
withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. These rules
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within
those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted these rules in the second
quarter of 2016 with no material changes reflected in our financial statements.
6
In February 2016, the FASB issued rules requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on
the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12
months and to include qualitative and quantitative disclosures with respect to the amount, timing,
and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These rules will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with
earlier application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our
financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued rules that modify how entities measure equity investments and
present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities. Unless the investments qualify for a
practicality exception, the new rules require all equity investments to be measured at fair value
with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for
under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). Entities
will have to record changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities measured
under the fair value option in other comprehensive income. These new rules become effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with no early adoption permitted. We are
currently evaluating the impact of these rules, but we do not expect them to have a significant
impact on our financial statements.
NOTE 3OTHER INFORMATION
Other current assets at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, include amounts due from joint
interest partners, net, of approximately $41 million and $42 million and deferred tax assets of $45
million and $59 million.
Other long-term liabilities include asset retirement obligations of $330 million and $343 million at
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
Other revenue largely comprised sales of the portion of electricity generated by our power plant
that is sold to third parties, and the related costs are included in other (income) expenses. In the
quarter and six months ended June 30, 2016, other (income) expenses also included a $31
million of gain from the sale of non-core assets, as well as $44 million and $133 million,
respectively, of gains related to the retirement of certain senior unsecured notes.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of cash and other on-balance sheet financial instruments, other than debt,
approximate fair value.
Supplemental Cash Flow Information
We did not make United States federal and state income tax payments during the six-month
periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Interest paid totaled approximately $180 million and
$149 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Reverse Stock Split
Our stockholders approved a reverse stock split at the Company's annual stockholders’ meeting
on May 4, 2016. Following this approval, our board of directors authorized a reverse split using a
ratio of one share of common stock for every ten shares then outstanding. The split occurred on
May 31, 2016 with trading on a post-split basis commencing the following day. Share and per
share amounts included in this report have been restated to reflect this reverse stock split.
The split proportionally decreased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 2.0
billion shares to 200 million shares and preferred stock from 200 million to 20 million shares. The
compensation committee of our board approved proportionate adjustments to the number of
shares outstanding and available for issuance under our stock-based compensation plans and to
the exercise price, grant price or purchase price relating to any award under the plans, using the
same reverse split ratio, pursuant to existing authority granted to the committee under the plans.

At June 30, 2016 deferred gain and issuance costs were $456 million net, consisting of $525
million of deferred gains offset by $69 million of deferred issuance costs. The December 31, 2015
deferred gain and issuance costs were $491 million net, consisting of $560 million of deferred
gains offset by $69 million of deferred issuance costs.
Credit Facilities
We have a credit agreement effective through September 2019. The credit agreement provides
for (i) a $939 million senior term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility) and (ii) a $1.6 billion senior
revolving loan facility (the Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the
Credit Facilities). All borrowings under the Credit Facilities are subject to certain customary
conditions. We amended the Credit Facilities effective as of February 2016, to change certain of
our financial and other covenants. We further amended these agreements in April 2016 to
facilitate certain types of deleveraging transactions. Borrowings under our Credit Facilities are
subject to a borrowing base which was reaffirmed at $2.3 billion as of May 2016. We have
granted our lenders a first-priority lien in a substantial majority of our upstream assets.
The Revolving Credit Facility includes a sub-limit of $400 million for the issuance of letters of
credit. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings under our
Revolving Credit Facility of $781 million and $739 million, respectively, and outstanding
borrowings of $939 million and $1 billion under the Term Loan Facility, respectively. We made
two scheduled $25 million quarterly payments on the Term Loan Facility during the quarters
ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 and an $11 million payment from the proceeds of non-
core asset sales.
8
Borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest, at our election, at either a LIBOR rate or an
alternate base rate (ABR) (equal to the greatest of (i) the administrative agent’s prime rate, (ii) the
one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.00% and (iii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%), in each
case plus an applicable margin. This applicable margin is based, while our total leverage ratio
exceeds 3.00:1.00, on our borrowing base utilization and will vary from (a) in the case of LIBOR
loans, 2.50% to 3.50% and (b) in the case of ABR loans, 1.50% to 2.50%. The unused portion of
the Revolving Credit Facility commitments, as limited by the borrowing base, is subject to a
commitment fee equal to 0.50% per annum. We also pay customary fees and expenses under the
Credit Facilities. Interest on ABR loans is payable quarterly in arrears.  Interest on LIBOR loans
is payable at the end of each LIBOR period, but not less than quarterly.
Our financial performance covenants through December 31, 2016 comprise an obligation to
achieve (i) a cumulative minimum EBITDAX during 2016 of $55 million through the first quarter,
$130 million through the second quarter, $190 million through the third quarter and $250 million
through the fourth quarter and (ii) a trailing four-quarter minimum interest coverage ratio of
2.00:1.00 as of the end of the first quarter of 2016, 1.50:1.00 as of the end of the second quarter,
1.25:1.00 as of the end of the third quarter, 0.70:1.00 as of the end of the fourth quarter and
2.00:1.00 thereafter as of each quarter end. Starting with the end of the first quarter of 2017, we
will be subject to a trailing four-quarter maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio of
2.25:1.00. Oil prices would need to increase significantly in order for us to comply with our
covenants at the end of the first quarter of 2017. Unless prices for our products increase
significantly, we expect we will need to amend the covenants under our credit facilities before the
end of March 2017 in order to remain compliant. We can give no assurances that our lenders will
amend our covenants. If we were to breach any of our covenants, our lenders would be permitted
to accelerate the principal amount due under the Credit Facilities and foreclose on the assets
securing them. If payment were accelerated under our Credit Facilities, it would result in a default
under our outstanding notes and permit acceleration and foreclosure on the assets securing the
secured notes.
Except as otherwise agreed with our lenders for specific transactions, our Credit Facilities require
us to apply 100% of the proceeds from asset sales to repay loans outstanding under the Credit
Facilities, except that we are permitted to use up to 40% of proceeds from non-borrowing base
asset monetizations to repurchase our notes to the extent available at a significant minimum
discount to par, as specified in the facilities. In addition, subject to compliance with our
indentures, we may incur additional indebtedness to repurchase our notes to the extent available
at a specified minimum discount to par, as follows: (i) up to $1 billion, which may be secured by
liens that are junior to the liens securing our Credit Facilities, provided that at least 60% of the
proceeds from such new debt is used first to repay loans outstanding under the Term Loan
Facility, and (ii) up to $200 million, which may be secured by first-priority liens on our non-
borrowing base properties. The Credit Facilities also permit us to incur up to an additional $50
million of non-Credit Facility indebtedness, which, subject to compliance with our indentures,
may be secured; and the proceeds of which must be applied to repay the Term Loan Facility. We
must apply cash on hand in excess of $150 million to repay amounts outstanding under our
Revolving Credit Facility. Further, we are restricted from (i) paying dividends or making other
distributions to common stockholders and (ii) making capital investments exceeding $100 million
during 2016.
Our borrowing base is redetermined each May 1 and November 1. The borrowing base will be
based upon a number of factors, including commodity prices and reserves levels. Increases in
our borrowing base require approval of at least 80% of our revolving lenders, as measured by
exposure, while decreases require a two-thirds approval. We and the lenders (requiring a request
from the lenders holding two-thirds of the revolving commitments and outstanding loans) each
may request a special redetermination once in any period between three consecutive scheduled
redeterminations. We will be permitted to have collateral released when both (i) our credit ratings
are at least Baa3 from Moody's and BBB- from S&P, in each case with a stable or better outlook,
and (ii) certain permitted liens securing other debt are released.
All obligations under the Credit Facilities are guaranteed jointly and severally by all of our
material wholly-owned subsidiaries. The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries not guaranteeing
the debt are de minimis.
Substantially all of the restrictions imposed by the February 2016 amendment to the Credit
Facilities, other than the requirement for semiannual borrowing base redeterminations, may
terminate in the future if we are able to comply with the financial covenants as they existed prior
to giving effect to the amendment.
At June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the financial and other covenants under our Credit
Facilities.

See Note 11 - Subsequent Events for discussion of our recently announced tender offer,
proposed syndicated loan facility and proposed amendment to our Credit Facilities.
Senior Notes
In October 2014, we issued $5.00 billion in aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured
notes, including $1.00 billion of 5% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2020 (the 2020
notes), $1.75 billion of 5 ½% senior unsecured notes due September 15, 2021 (the 2021 notes)
and $2.25 billion of 6% senior unsecured notes due November 15, 2024 (the 2024 notes and
together with the 2020 notes and the 2021 notes, the unsecured notes). The unsecured notes
were issued at par and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by
all of our material subsidiaries. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the unsecured
notes to make a $4.95 billion cash distribution to Occidental in October 2014.
In December 2015, we exchanged $534 million, $921 million and $1,358 million in aggregate
principal amount of the 2020 notes, the 2021 notes, and the 2024 notes, respectively, for $2.25
billion in aggregate principal amount of newly issued 8% senior secured second lien notes due
December 15, 2022 (the 2022 notes). We recorded a deferred gain of approximately $560 million
on the debt exchange, which will be amortized using the effective interest rate method over the
term of the 2022 notes. Additionally, we incurred approximately $28 million in third-party costs
which were fully expensed in 2015. The second lien notes are secured on a second-priority
basis, subject to the terms of an intercreditor agreement and collateral trust agreement by a lien
on the same collateral used to secure our obligations under our Credit Facilities.
During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we repurchased over $100 million in aggregate
principal amount of the senior unsecured notes for under $13 million in cash. During the three
months ended June 30, 2016, we entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements with a
holder of our 6% Senior Notes due 2024 and our 5 ½% Senior Notes due 2021 to exchange a
total of approximately 2.1 million shares of our common stock on a post-split basis for notes in the
aggregate principal amount of $80 million.
We will pay interest semiannually in cash in arrears on January 15 and July 15 for the 2020
notes, on March 15 and September 15 for the 2021 notes, on June 15 and December 15 for the
2022 notes and on May 15 and November 15 for the 2024 notes.
The indentures governing the senior unsecured notes and the second lien secured notes each
include covenants that, among other things, limit our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to
incur debt secured by liens. The indentures also restrict our ability to merge or consolidate with,
or transfer all or substantially all of our assets to, another entity. These covenants are subject to a
number of important qualifications and limitations that are set forth in the indenture. The
covenants are not, however, directly linked to measures of our financial performance. In addition,
if we experience a “change of control triggering event” (as defined in the indentures) with respect
to a series of notes, we will be required, unless we have exercised our right to redeem the notes
of such series, to offer to purchase the notes of such series at a purchase price equal to 101% of
their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture governing our second
lien secured notes also restricts our ability to sell certain assets and to release collateral from
liens securing the second lien secured notes.
Other
We estimate the fair value of fixed-rate debt, which is classified as Level 1, based on prices from
known market transactions for our instruments. The estimated fair value of our debt at June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, including the fair value of the variable rate portion, was
approximately $4.3 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, compared to a carrying value of
approximately $5.9 billion and $6.1 billion. A one-eighth percent change in the variable interest
rates on the borrowings under our Credit Facilities on June 30, 2016, would result in a $2.1
million change in annual interest expense.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit in the aggregate amount of
approximately $129 million and $70 million (including $120 million and $49 million under the
Revolving Credit Facility), respectively, which were issued to support ordinary course marketing,
insurance, regulatory and other matters.

NOTE 6    LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
We, or certain of our subsidiaries, are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits,
environmental and other claims and other contingencies that seek, among other things,
compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses,
punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
On April 21, 2016, a purported class action was filed against us in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all beneficial owners of our unsecured notes
from November 12, 2015 to the present.  The complaint alleges that our December 2015 debt
exchange excluded non-qualified institutional holders in violation of the Trust Indenture Act of
1939 and related law and, thereby, impaired their rights to receive principal and interest
payments.  The purported class action seeks declaratory relief that the debt exchange and the
liens securing the new notes are null and void and that the debt exchange resulted in a default. 
The plaintiff also seeks monetary damages and attorneys’ fees.  The Company plans to
vigorously defend against the claims made by the plaintiff.
We accrue reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
Reserves balances at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were not material to our balance
sheets as of such dates. We also evaluate the amount of reasonably possible losses that we
could incur as a result of these matters. We believe that reasonably possible losses that we could
incur in excess of reserves accrued on our balance sheet would not be material to our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
We, our subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specific liabilities those
parties might incur in the future in connection with the Spin-off, purchases and other transactions
that they have entered into with us. These indemnities include indemnities made to Occidental
against certain tax-related liabilities that may be incurred by Occidental relating to the Spin-off
and liabilities related to operation of our business while it was still owned by Occidental. As of
June 30, 2016, we are not aware of material indemnity claims pending or threatened against the
Company.
NOTE 7    DERIVATIVES
General
We use a variety of derivative instruments intended to improve the effective realized prices for oil
and gas and protect our capital program in case of price deterioration. Derivatives are carried at
fair value and on a net basis when a legal right of offset exists with the same counterparty. We
apply hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for cash-flow hedge treatment
and management elects and documents such treatment. Otherwise, we recognize any fair value
gains or losses, over the remaining term of the hedge instrument, in earnings in the current
period.

prices to protect our cash flows, margins and capital investment program and improve our ability
to comply with our credit facility covenants in case of further price deterioration.

NOTE 8    EARNINGS PER SHARE
We compute earnings per share (EPS) using the two-class method required for participating
securities. Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net
income in determining net income attributable to common stockholders. Restricted stock awards
are considered participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable
dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for common shares.
The denominator of basic EPS is the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the periods presented and vested stock awards that have not yet been issued
as common stock; however, it excludes outstanding shares related to unvested stock awards.
The denominator of diluted EPS is based on the basic shares outstanding, adjusted for the effect
of outstanding option awards, to the extent they are dilutive. The effect of the stock options
granted in August 2015 and December 2014 was anti-dilutive for the periods presented.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we issued approximately 86,000 shares and
184,000 shares, respectively, of common stock in connection with our employee stock purchase
plan. The effect of the employee stock purchase plan was anti-dilutive for both periods.

our defined benefit pension plans during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. We expect to satisfy minimum funding requirements with contributions of $2 million
to our defined benefit pension plans during the remainder of 2016. The 2016 and 2015
settlements were associated with early retirements.
NOTE 10    INCOME TAXES
As a result of the debt exchange in December 2015, we generated cancellation of debt income of
$1.39 billion for tax purposes, which represented the excess of the face value of the surrendered
notes over the fair value of the newly issued notes at the time of the exchange. The tax gain
exceeded our operating loss for the year. We reported the related $336 million of federal and
state taxes in current and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet at
December 31, 2015. During the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified this amount to deferred taxes
to reflect the reduction in the tax basis of our assets resulting from the exclusion of the $1.39
billion in cancellation of debt income from our 2015 taxable income. We also recorded a deferred
income tax benefit of approximately $78 million to reflect a change in the valuation allowance on
our deferred tax assets. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a full valuation
allowance against the deferred tax assets that resulted from current period tax losses.
15
NOTE 11    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
We announced the commencement on August 1 of our offers to purchase (Tender Offers) up to
the combined aggregate principal amount of our notes that can be purchased with $525 million in
cash at stated discounts to par. The offers are conditioned on, among other things, (i) entry into,
and effectiveness of, an amendment to our Credit Facilities and the availability of sufficient funds
from the Credit Facilities necessary to consummate the Tender Offers and (ii) a sufficient
aggregate principal amount of our notes being validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) to
result in a minimum of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of our notes being accepted for
purchase. Notes accepted for purchase by us would receive base consideration of $510 per
$1,000 in principal amount of our 2020 notes accepted, $490 per $1,000 in principal amount of
our 2021 notes accepted, $460 per $1,000 in principal amount of our 2024 notes accepted and
$625 per $1,000 in principal amount of our 2022 notes accepted, and an early participation
premium of $50 per $1,000, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We will not accept more than $200
million in aggregate principal amount of our 2022 notes under the Tender Offers.
We are concurrently seeking to amend our Credit Facilities to permit the consummation of these
offers and the incurrence of a new syndicated loan facility. We also expect that the amendment
will, among other things, reduce the Revolving Credit Facility commitments from $1.6 billion to
$1.4 billion, provide covenant relief until the end of the first quarter of 2018 and grant a lien on our
substantially all of our assets not currently pledged to secure the Credit Facilities.
We are seeking an aggregate principal amount of at least $700 million under the syndicated
facility, which will be secured by a first priority lien on the same collateral as used to secure the
Credit Facilities, but with “second out” collateral recovery pursuant to an intercreditor agreement
between the Credit Facility lenders and the syndicated facility lenders. We expect 25% of the
proceeds from the syndicated facility to be used to pay down the Term Loan Facility and the
balance to be used to pay down the Revolving Loan Facility.
We will consummate the Credit Facility amendment, the syndicated facility and the Tender
Offers, if we are able to successfully complete the marketing of the syndicated facility on
satisfactory pricing terms and conditions and achieve a successful outcome in the Tender Offers.
Our lenders, under the Credit Facilities or under the syndicated facility, may impose additional
restrictions that we have not described. Also, we may otherwise alter the terms of these
transactions in response to market conditions.

Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Except when the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated, all references to
‘‘CRC,’’ the ‘‘Company,’’ ‘‘we,’’ ‘‘us’’ and ‘‘our’’ refer to California Resources Corporation and its
subsidiaries.
The Separation and Spin-off
We are an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company operating
properties exclusively within the State of California. We were incorporated in Delaware as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Occidental) on April 23, 2014,
and remained a wholly-owned subsidiary of Occidental until the spin-off on November 30, 2014
(the Spin-off). Prior to the Spin-off, all material existing assets, operations and liabilities of
Occidental's California business were consolidated under us. On November 30, 2014,
Occidental distributed shares of our common stock on a pro rata basis to Occidental stockholders
and we became an independent, publicly traded company. Occidental initially retained
approximately 18.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock, which it distributed to
Occidental stockholders on March 24, 2016.
Business Environment and Industry Outlook
 
Our operating results and those of the oil and gas industry as a whole are heavily influenced by
commodity prices. Oil and gas prices and differentials may fluctuate significantly, generally as a
result of changes in supply and demand and other market-related uncertainties. These and other
factors make it impossible to predict realized prices reliably. Much of the global exploration and
production industry is challenged at current price levels, putting pressure on the industry's ability
to generate positive cash flow and access capital. Average oil prices continued the decline that
began in the last half of 2014 into the first quarter of 2016. While global oil prices improved
modestly in the second quarter of 2016 and started to trade in a narrower range, they were still
lower in the second quarter and first half of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.
Natural gas liquids (NGLs) prices have improved relative to crude oil prices over the last 12
months due to tighter supplies and better contract prices on natural gasoline.
Natural gas prices remained lower in the second quarter and first half of 2016 than comparable
periods in 2015. However, Henry Hub futures prices for the second half of the year started to
rebound strongly on lower production, higher demand and warmer weather forecasts. California
natural gas differentials for the second half of the year also started to improve primarily due to
storage-related issues in the state.

Oil prices and differentials will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including
consumption patterns, inventory levels, global and local economic conditions, the actions of
OPEC and other significant producers and governments, actual or threatened production and
refining disruptions, currency exchange rates, worldwide drilling and exploration activities, the
effects of conservation, weather, geophysical and technical limitations, refining and processing
disruptions, transportation bottlenecks and other matters affecting the supply and demand
dynamics for oil, technological advances, regional market conditions, transportation capacity and
costs in producing areas and the effect of changes in these variables on market perceptions.

We currently sell all of our crude oil into the California refining markets, which we believe have
offered relatively favorable pricing compared to other U.S. regions for similar grades. California
imports over 60% of its oil and approximately 90% of its natural gas. A vast majority of the oil is
imported via supertanker, with a negligible amount arriving by rail. As a result, California refiners
have typically purchased crude oil at international waterborne-based prices. We believe that the
limited crude transportation infrastructure from other parts of the country to California will continue
contributing to higher realizations than most other U.S. oil markets for comparable grades.
Beginning in late 2015, the U.S. federal government allowed the export of crude oil. As a result,
we are opportunistically pursuing newly opened export markets for our crude oil production to
improve our margins.
Prices and differentials for NGLs are related to the supply and demand for the products making
up these liquids. Some of them more typically correlate to the price of oil while others are affected
by natural gas prices as well as the demand for certain chemical products for which they are
used as feedstock. In addition, infrastructure constraints magnify pricing volatility.
Our earnings are also affected by the performance of our processing and power generation
assets. We process our wet gas to extract NGLs and other natural gas byproducts. We then
deliver dry gas to pipelines and separately sell the NGLs. The efficiency with which we extract
liquids from the wet gas stream affects our operating results. Additionally, we provide part of the
electricity output from our Elk Hills power plant to reduce Elk Hills field operating costs and
increase reliability.
Natural gas prices and differentials are strongly affected by local supply and demand
fundamentals, as well as availability of transportation capacity from producing areas. Due to
much lower levels of natural gas production compared to our oil production, the changes in
natural gas prices have a lower impact on our operating results.
Higher natural gas prices have a net positive effect on our operating results. In addition to selling
natural gas, we also use gas for our steamfloods and power generation. As a result, any positive
impact of higher prices is partially offset by higher operating costs. Conversely, lower natural gas
prices generally have a net negative effect on our operations, but lower the cost of our steamflood
projects and power generation.
We will continue to be strategic and opportunistic in implementing our hedging program as
market conditions permit. Our objective is to protect against the cyclical nature of commodity
prices to protect our cash flows, margins and capital investment program and improve our ability
to comply with our credit facility covenants in case of further price deterioration. We have crude
oil hedges in place for the remainder of 2016 consisting of Brent-based options and swaps,
representing average production of 30,500 barrels of oil per day at a weighted-average floor price
of $50.21 per barrel. We also have hedges in place for 2017 average production of 4,300 barrels
of oil per day at a weighted-average price of $50.00. In addition, we entered into calls on a small
portion of our 2017 and 2018 production as part of placing the 2016 hedges earlier in the year.
We have natural gas hedges in place for the third and fourth quarters of 2016 consisting of swaps
representing average production of 2,900 Million British Thermal Units (MMBTU) per day at a
weighted-average floor price of $3.48 per MMBTU. We also have forward contracts for 2017
average production of 6,200 MMBTU per day at a weighted-average floor price of $3.53.
We can give no assurances that these hedges will be adequate to accomplish our hedging
program objectives. Unless otherwise indicated, we use the term "hedge" to describe derivative
instruments that are designed to achieve our hedging program goals, even though they are not
necessarily accounted for as cash-flow or fair-value hedges.     
We respond to economic conditions by adjusting the size and allocation of our capital program,
aligning the size of our workforce with the level of activity, continuing to improve efficiencies and
cost savings and working with our suppliers and service providers to adjust the cost of goods and
services to reflect current market pricing. The reductions in our capital program will negatively
impact our production levels in the near term and sustained low-price periods may materially
affect the quantities of oil and gas reserves we can economically produce over the longer term.
Seasonality
 
While certain aspects of our operations are affected by seasonal factors, such as electricity costs,
overall, seasonality is not a material driver of changes in our quarterly earnings during the year.
18
Income Taxes
As a result of the debt exchange we completed in December 2015, we generated cancellation of
debt income of $1.39 billion for tax purposes, which represented the excess of the face value of
the surrendered notes over the fair value of the newly issued notes at the time of the exchange.
The tax gain exceeded our operating loss for the year. We reported the related $336 million of
federal and state taxes in current and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance
sheet at December 31, 2015. During the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified this amount to
deferred taxes to reflect the reduction in the tax basis of our assets resulting from the exclusion of
the $1.39 billion in cancellation of debt income from our 2015 taxable income. We also recorded
a deferred income tax benefit of approximately $78 million to reflect a change in the valuation
allowance on our deferred tax assets. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a full
valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that resulted from current period tax losses.
 
Operations
We conduct our operations through fee interests, land leases and other contractual
arrangements. We believe we are the largest private oil and natural gas mineral acreage holder
in California, with interests in approximately 2.4 million net acres, approximately 60% of which
we hold in fee. Our oil and gas leases have a primary term ranging from one to ten years, which
is extended through the end of production once it commences. We also own a network of
strategically placed infrastructure that is integrated with our operations, including gas plants, oil
and gas gathering systems, a power plant and other related assets, to maximize the value
generated from our production.
Our share of production and reserves from operations in the Wilmington field is subject to
contractual arrangements similar to production-sharing contracts (PSCs) that are in effect through
the economic life of the assets. Under such contracts we are obligated to fund all capital and
production costs. We record a share of production and reserves to recover such capital and
production costs and an additional share for profit. Our portion of the production represents
volumes: (1) to recover our partners’ share of capital and production costs that we incur on their
behalf, (2) for our share of contractually defined base production and (3) for our share of
production in excess of contractually defined base production for each period. We realize our
share of capital and production costs, and generate returns, through our defined share of
production from (2) and (3) above. These contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to us
and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on our economic interest as defined in
the contracts. Our share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when product
prices rise and increases when prices decline, however, our net economic benefit is greater
when product prices are higher. The contracts represented slightly less than 20% of our
production for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
Fixed and Variable Costs
Our total production costs consist of variable costs that tend to vary depending on production
levels, and fixed costs that typically do not vary with changes in production levels or well counts,
especially in the short term. The substantial majority of our near-term fixed costs become variable
over the longer term because we manage them based on the field’s stage of life and operating
characteristics. For example, portions of labor and material costs, energy, workovers and
maintenance expenditures correlate to well count, production and activity levels. Portions of
these same costs can be relatively fixed over the near term; however, they are managed down as
fields mature in a manner that correlates to production and commodity price levels. While a
certain amount of costs for facilities, surface support, surveillance and related maintenance can
be regarded as fixed in the early phases of a program, as the production from a certain area
matures, well count increases and daily per well production drops, such support costs can be
reduced and consolidated over a larger number of wells, reducing costs per operating well.
Further, many of our other costs, such as property taxes and oilfield services, are variable and
will respond to activity levels and tend to correlate with commodity prices. Overall, we believe
less than one-third of our operating costs are fixed over the life cycle of our fields. We actively
manage our fields to optimize production and costs. When we see growth in a field we increase
capacities, and similarly when a field nears the end of its economic life we manage the costs
while it remains economically viable to produce.

Our results of operations can include the effects of non-cash, unusual and infrequent transactions
and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature, timing, amount and
frequency. Therefore, management uses measures called adjusted net loss and adjusted
general and administrative expenses, both of which exclude those items. These measures are
not meant to disassociate items from management's performance, but rather are meant to provide
useful information to investors interested in comparing our performance between periods.
Reported earnings are considered representative of management's performance over the long
term. Adjusted net loss and adjusted general and administrative expenses are not considered to
be an alternative to net loss or general and administrative expenses, respectively, reported in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
20
The results for the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015,
reflected lower production costs, general and administrative expenses, ad valorem expense,
depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A), exploration expense and interest
expense, as well as gains on the retirement of notes and sale of non-core assets, more than
offset by lower oil and gas realized prices and lower volumes for all products. The overall
decrease in our realized oil prices included the effect of the cash received from our hedging
program. Our adjusted net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 excluded $137 million
of non-cash derivative losses on outstanding positions at June 30, 2016, $44 million of gains on
the retirement of notes, a $31 million gain on the sale of assets and $6 million of other non-
recurring charges. Our adjusted net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2015 excluded $17
million of after-tax non-recurring adjustments.
Daily oil and gas production volumes averaged 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent (Boe) for the
second quarter of 2016, compared with 161,000 Boe for the second quarter of 2015, representing
a 13% year-over-year decline rate. Average oil production decreased by 13% or 14,000 barrels
per day to 90,000 barrels per day for the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the
same period of the prior year. NGL production decreased by 11% to 16,000 barrels per day.
Natural gas production decreased by 14% to 202 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day. The second
quarter production declines reflected our decision to withhold development capital and
selectively defer workover and downhole maintenance activity for the first half of the year. We
began increasing our activity levels gradually towards the end of the quarter in response to the
improved price environment. Additionally, temporary California pipeline disruptions negatively
impacted our ability to sell all of the oil we produced for the second quarter of 2016, some of
which we held in inventory at the end of the quarter. As a result, the actual second quarter
production was slightly higher than the reported volumes, which represent sales. We expect this
inventory to be sold in the third quarter of 2016 and reported as production at that time.
Realized crude oil prices, including the effect of cash received from settled hedges, decreased
23% to $43.70 per barrel for the second quarter of 2016 from $56.73 per barrel for the second
quarter of 2015. The decrease in realized oil prices reflected the drop in global oil indexes.
Hedges in the second quarter of 2016 contributed $2.29 per barrel to the realized crude oil price,
compared with no effect in the second quarter of 2015. Realized NGL prices increased 10% to
$22.54 per barrel for the second quarter of 2016 from $20.47 per barrel for the second quarter of
2015. Realized natural gas prices decreased 33% for the second quarter of 2016 to $1.66 per
thousand cubic feet (Mcf), compared with $2.49 per Mcf for the same period of 2015.
The first six months of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, reflected lower production
costs, general and administrative expenses, ad valorem expense, DD&A, exploration expense
and interest expense, as well as gains on the retirement of notes and sale of non-core assets,
more than offset by lower oil, NGL and gas realized prices and volumes. The overall decrease in
our realized oil prices included the effect of the cash received from our hedging program. Our
adjusted net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 excluded $218 million of non-cash
derivative losses on outstanding positions at June 30, 2016, $133 million of gains on the
retirement of notes, a $63 million deferred tax valuation allowance reduction, a $31 million gain
on the sale of assets and $27 million of other non-recurring charges. Our adjusted net loss for the
six months ended June 30, 2015 excluded $20 million of after-tax non-recurring adjustments.
For the first six months of 2016, daily production averaged 144,000 Boe, compared with 163,000
for the first six months of 2015, representing a 12% year-over-year reduction. Average oil
production decreased 12,000 barrels per day, or by 11%, to 94,000 barrels per day for 2016. NGL
production decreased by 6% to 17,000 barrels per day and natural gas production decreased by
16% to 199 MMcf per day.
Realized crude oil prices, including the effect of cash received from settled hedges, decreased
23% to $39.90 per barrel for the first six months of 2016 from $51.51 per barrel for the first six
months of 2015. The decrease in realized oil prices reflected the reduction in global oil indexes.
Hedges for the first six months of 2016 contributed $4.38 per barrel to the realized crude oil price,
compared with $0.03 for the first six months of 2015. Realized NGL prices decreased 8% to
$19.35 per barrel for the first six months of 2016 from $21.00 per barrel for the first six months of
2015. Realized natural gas prices decreased 31% to $1.85 per Mcf in the first six months of 2016,
compared with $2.67 per Mcf for the same period of 2015.

Note:
MBbl/d refers to thousands of barrels per day; MMcf/d refers to millions of cubic feet per day;
MBoe/d refers to thousands of barrels of oil equivalent per day.
(a)
Natural gas volumes have been converted to Boe based on the equivalence of energy content
between six Mcf of natural gas and one barrel of oil. Barrels of oil equivalence does not
necessarily result in price equivalence. The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent
basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been
similarly lower for a number of years. For example, for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
the average prices of Brent oil and NYMEX natural gas were $41.03 per barrel and $2.02 per
Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil-to-gas ratio of approximately 20 to 1.

Recent Developments
Our stockholders approved a reverse stock split at the Company's annual stockholders’ meeting
May 4, 2016. Following this approval, our board of directors authorized a reverse split using a
ratio of one share of common stock
for every ten shares then outstanding. The split occurred on May 31, 2016 with trading on a post-
split basis commencing the following day. Share and per share amounts included in this report
have been restated to reflect this reverse stock split.
The split proportionally decreased the number of authorized shares of common stock from 2.0
billion shares to 200 million shares and preferred stock from 200 million to 20 million shares. The
compensation committee of our board approved proportionate adjustments to the number of
shares outstanding and available for issuance under our stock-based compensation plans and to
the exercise price, grant price or purchase price relating to any award under the plans, using the
same reverse split ratio, pursuant to existing authority granted to the committee under the plans.

See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for discussion of changes in our cash and cash
equivalents and long-term debt, net.
23
The decrease in other current assets was mainly due to a reduction in the value of our derivatives
and lower deferred tax assets resulting from the reclassification of our tax liabilities to deferred
taxes. The decrease in property, plant and equipment reflected DD&A for the period, partially
offset by capital investments. The decrease in other assets was mainly due to lower deferred tax
assets.
The decrease in accounts payable reflected lower capital investments and production costs in
2016. The increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due to the deferral of gains related to sales
of greenhouse gas allowances and the change in value of derivative liabilities, partially offset by
the effect of employee bonus payments in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in equity
primarily reflected the net loss for the six-month period in 2016, partially offset by the common
stock issued in the second quarter debt exchange.
Current income taxes and other long-term liabilities as of December 31, 2015 included $336
million in tax liabilities that have been reclassified to deferred taxes to reflect a reduction in the
tax basis of our assets as a result of excluding the 2015 $1.39 billion of cancellation of debt
income for tax purposes.

We define adjusted EBITDAX consistent with our Credit Facilities as earnings before interest
expense; income taxes; depreciation, depletion and amortization; exploration expense; and
other non-cash, unusual and infrequent items. Our management believes adjusted EBITDAX
provides useful information in assessing our financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows and is widely used by the industry and investment community. The amounts included in
the calculation of adjusted EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure
is a material component of our financial covenants under our Credit Facilities and is provided
in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income and liquidity measures calculated in
accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from adjusted EBITDAX are significant
components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a
company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and
depletable assets. Adjusted EBITDAX should be read in conjunction with the information
contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Three months ended June 30, 2016 vs. 2015
Oil and gas net sales decreased 35%, or $217 million, for the three months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to the same period of 2015, due to an approximately $193 million negative impact from
lower oil prices and volumes, $22 million from lower natural gas prices and volumes and $2
million from lower NGL prices. The lower realized oil prices resulted from a significant decrease
in benchmark indexes. Our realized oil prices in 2016 included $19 million of cash generated
from our hedging program. Daily oil and gas production volumes averaged 140,000 Boe in the
second quarter of 2016, compared with 161,000 Boe in the second quarter of 2015, representing
a 13% year-over-year decline rate. Average oil production decreased by 13% or 14,000 barrels
per day to 90,000 barrels per day in the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the
same period of the prior year. NGL production decreased by 11% to 16,000 barrels per day.
Natural gas production decreased by 14% to 202 MMcf per day, consistent with our focus on
liquids. The second quarter production declines reflected our decision to withhold development
capital and selectively defer workover and downhole maintenance activity in the first half of the
year. We began increasing our activity levels gradually towards the end of the quarter.
Additionally, temporary California pipeline disruptions negatively impacted our ability to sell all of
the oil we produced in the second quarter of 2016, some of which we held in inventory at the end
of the quarter. As a result, the actual second quarter production was slightly higher than the
reported volumes, which represent sales. We expect this inventory to be sold in the third quarter
of 2016 and reported as production at that time.
Derivative losses increased $101 million to $118 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016 due to volume and valuation changes in our outstanding derivative positions, partially offset
by cash settlements.
Production costs for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $54 million, to $188
million or $14.76 per Boe, compared to $242 million or $16.59 per Boe for the same period of
2015, resulting in a 22% decrease on an absolute dollar basis. The decrease was driven by cost
reductions across our operations, particularly in well servicing efficiency, field personnel and
lower natural gas prices, as well as management's decision to selectively defer workovers and
downhole maintenance activity.
25
Our general and administrative expenses were lower for the three months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to the same period of 2015, on a total dollar and per Boe basis, reflecting employee
and contractor cost-reduction initiatives. The three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
included severance and other employee-related costs of $4 million and $10 million, respectively.
The non-cash portion of general and administrative expenses, comprising equity compensation
and pension costs, was approximately $7 million and $9 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
DD&A expense decreased 45%, or $113 million, for the three months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to the same period of 2015. Of this decrease, approximately $93 million was due to a
decrease in the DD&A rate that resulted from asset impairments in the fourth quarter of 2015, and
approximately $20 million was attributable to lower volumes.
Taxes other than on income, which include ad valorem taxes, greenhouse gas emissions costs
and production taxes, decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the
same period of 2015, largely reflecting lower property taxes assessed in the lower price
environment.
Exploration expense decreased 29%, or by $2 million, for the three months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to the same period of 2015, primarily due to reduced exploration activity.
Interest and debt expense, net, decreased to $74 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016, compared to $83 million in the same period of 2015, due to amortization of the gain from
the fourth quarter 2015 bond exchange, slightly offset by higher interest rates on our senior
secured second lien notes and existing credit facility.
Other (income) expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 largely consisted of the $44
million gain on retirement of notes and $31 million gain on non-core asset divestitures. Other
expenses between the two periods were comparable.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we had no income tax benefit and a pre-tax loss of
$140 million. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a full valuation allowance against
the deferred tax assets that resulted from current period tax losses. For the same period of 2015,
we had a benefit of $46 million and a pre-tax loss of $114 million. We had no effective tax for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 due to the valuation allowance and a 40% effective tax rate
for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Six months ended June 30, 2016 vs. 2015
Oil and gas net sales decreased 37%, or $434 million, for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to the same period of 2015, due to an approximately $376 million negative impact from
lower oil prices and volumes, $48 million from lower natural gas prices and volumes and $10
million from lower NGL prices. The lower realized oil prices resulted from a significant decrease
in benchmark indexes. Our realized prices in 2016 included $75 million of cash generated from
our hedging program. Daily oil and gas production volumes averaged 144,000 Boe in the six
months ended June 30, 2016, compared with 163,000 Boe in the first half of 2015 representing a
12% year-over-year decline rate. Average oil production decreased by 11% or 12,000 barrels per
day to 94,000 barrels per day in the first six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same
period of the prior year. NGL production decreased by 6% to 17,000 barrels per day. Natural gas
production decreased by 16% to 199 MMcf per day, consistent with our focus on liquids.
Production declines in the first half of 2016 reflected our decision to withhold development capital
and selectively defer workover and downhole maintenance activity. We began increasing our
activity levels gradually towards the end of the second quarter.
Derivative losses increased $125 million to $143 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
due to volume and valuation changes in our outstanding derivative positions, partially offset by
cash settlements.
Production costs for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $112 million, to $372
million or $14.21 per Boe, compared to $484 million or $16.39 per Boe for the same period of
2015, resulting in a 23% decrease on an absolute dollar basis. The decrease was driven by cost
reductions across our operations, particularly in well servicing efficiency, field personnel, energy
use and lower natural gas prices, as well as management's decision to selectively defer
workovers and downhole maintenance activity.
26
Our general and administrative expenses were lower for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to the same period of 2015, on a total dollar and per Boe basis, reflecting employee
and contractor cost-reduction initiatives, as well as lower 2016 stock-based compensation costs
due to our lower stock price. The six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 included severance
and other employee-related costs of $18 million and $10 million, respectively. The non-cash
portion of general and administrative expenses, comprising equity compensation and pension
costs, was approximately $14 million and $18 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.
DD&A expense decreased 43%, or $219 million, for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to the same period of 2015. Of this decrease, approximately $183 million was due to a
decrease in the DD&A rate that resulted from asset impairments in the fourth quarter of 2015, and
approximately $36 million was attributable to lower volumes.
Taxes other than on income decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the
same period of 2015, largely reflecting lower property taxes assessed in the lower price
environment.
Exploration expense decreased 58%, or by $14 million, for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
compared to the same period of 2015, due to reduced exploration activity and lease rates.
Interest and debt expense, net, decreased to $148 million for the six months ended 2016,
compared to $162 million in the same period of 2015, due to the amortization of the gain from the
fourth quarter 2015 bond exchange slightly offset by higher interest rates on our senior secured
second lien notes and existing credit facility.
Other (income) expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 largely consisted of the $133
million gain from retirement of notes and the $31 million gain on non-core asset divestitures.
Other expenses between the two periods were comparable.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we had an income tax benefit of $78 million and a pre-
tax loss of $268 million. For the same period of 2015, we had a benefit of $115 million and a pre-
tax loss of $283 million. Our effective tax rate was 29% and 41% for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The lower rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016
reflected changes in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
The primary source of liquidity and capital resources to fund our capital program and other
obligations has been cash flow from operations. Operating cash flows are largely dependent on
oil and natural gas prices, sales volumes and costs. Oil and natural gas prices declined
significantly during fiscal year 2015 and declined further in early 2016, while rebounding
modestly in the second quarter of 2016. These lower commodity prices have negatively impacted
our revenues, earnings and cash flows, and sustained low oil and natural gas prices will have a
material and adverse effect on our liquidity position.
Much of the global exploration and production industry is challenged at current price levels,
putting pressure on the industry's ability to generate positive cash flow and access capital. If
commodity prices were to prevail through the year at about current levels, we would not
anticipate a significant draw down on our revolving credit facility for our annual cash needs,
including our current capital program. Our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility is
limited by the size of the facility, by our ability to comply with its covenants, including quarterly
financial covenants, and by our borrowing base. Effective May 2, 2016, the borrowing base under
our credit facilities was reaffirmed at $2.3 billion. As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately
$460 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.
Unless prices for our products increase significantly, we expect we will need to amend the
covenants under our credit facilities before the end of March 2017 in order to remain compliant.
We can give no assurances that our lenders will amend our covenants. If we were to breach any
of our credit facility covenants, our lenders would be permitted to accelerate the principal amount
due under the credit facilities and foreclose on the assets securing them. If payment were
accelerated under our credit facilities, it would result in a default under our outstanding notes and
permit acceleration and foreclosure on the assets securing the secured notes.
27
In response to commodity price declines, we budgeted $50 million for our 2016 capital program
compared to our 2015 capital investments of $401 million. In the first half of the year, we further
reduced the pace of our capital program to below our initially budgeted level of $50 million. We
have recently begun to increase our capital investments for the second half of the year to bring us
back to our initially planned annual level. Our slowing of asset development from late 2015
through the first half of 2016, coupled with the selective deferral of expense workover activity, has
led to a decline in production in the first half of 2016 that is in excess of our base decline range.
We cannot guarantee our planned increase in investments will result in a rapid reversal of, or a
significant increase in, production trends. Over the long term, if commodity prices fall again or
remain at depressed levels we may experience continued declines in our production and
reserves, which could reduce our liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt obligations by negatively
impacting our cash flow from operations, the value of our assets and our borrowing base.
We have taken a number of other steps to better align our cost structure with the current price
environment including a reduction of our workforce to below 1,500 employees as of June 2016.
As a result of these steps, in 2016, we have seen a reduction in our production costs and general
and administrative expense below 2015 levels. We expect that these measures will help offset
some of the cash flow effects of prolonged low or deteriorating commodity prices.
In our effort to delever our balance sheet, we took the opportunity to buy back over $100 million in
principal amount of our notes in the open market for less than $13 million in the first quarter and
to exchange approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $80 million in
principal amount of notes in the second quarter. We also had divestitures of several small non-
core assets. Given the state of the commodity markets, we believe we need to further strengthen
our balance sheet to competitively position the company for the longer term. As a result, we may
from time to time seek to further reduce our outstanding debt using cash from asset sales or other
monetizations, exchanging debt for other debt or equity securities or engaging in joint ventures.
Such activities, if any, will depend on available funds, prevailing market conditions, our liquidity
requirements, contractual restrictions in our credit facilities, perceived credit risk by
counterparties and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. However, we can give
no assurances that any of these efforts will be successful or adequately strengthen our balance
sheet.

syndicated loan facility and proposed amendment to our Credit Facilities.

We have a credit agreement effective through September 2019. The credit agreement provides
for (i) a $939 million senior term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility) and (ii) a $1.6 billion senior
revolving loan facility (the Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the
Credit Facilities). All borrowings under the Credit Facilities are subject to certain customary
conditions. We amended the Credit Facilities effective as of February 2016, to change certain of
our financial and other covenants. We further amended these agreements in April 2016 to
facilitate certain types of deleveraging transactions. Borrowings under our Credit Facilities are
subject to a borrowing base which was reaffirmed at $2.3 billion as of May 2016. We have
granted our lenders a first-priority lien in a substantial majority of our upstream assets.
The Revolving Credit Facility includes a sub-limit of $400 million for the issuance of letters of
credit. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had outstanding borrowings under our
Revolving Credit Facility of $781 million and $739 million, respectively, and outstanding
borrowings of $939 million and $1 billion under the Term Loan Facility, respectively. We made
two scheduled $25 million quarterly payments on the Term Loan Facility during the quarters
ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 and an $11 million payment from the proceeds of non-
core asset divestitures.
29
Borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest, at our election, at either a LIBOR rate or an
alternate base rate (ABR) (equal to the greatest of (i) the administrative agent’s prime rate, (ii) the
one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.00% and (iii) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%), in each
case plus an applicable margin. This applicable margin is based, while our total leverage ratio
exceeds 3.00:1.00, on our borrowing base utilization and will vary from (a) in the case of LIBOR
loans, 2.50% to 3.50% and (b) in the case of ABR loans, 1.50% to 2.50%. The unused portion of
the Revolving Credit Facility commitments, as limited by the borrowing base, is subject to a
commitment fee equal to 0.50% per annum. We also pay customary fees and expenses under the
Credit Facilities. Interest on ABR loans is payable quarterly in arrears.  Interest on LIBOR loans
is payable at the end of each LIBOR period, but not less than quarterly.
Our financial performance covenants through December 31, 2016 comprise an obligation to
achieve (i) a cumulative minimum EBITDAX during 2016 of $55 million through the first quarter,
$130 million through the second quarter, $190 million through the third quarter and $250 million
through the fourth quarter and (ii) a trailing four-quarter minimum interest coverage ratio of
2.00:1.00 as of the end of the first quarter of 2016, 1.50:1.00 as of the end of the second quarter,
1.25:1.00 as of the end of the third quarter, 0.70:1.00 as of the end of the fourth quarter and
2.00:1.00 thereafter as of each quarter end. Starting with the end of the first quarter of 2017, we
will be subject to a trailing four-quarter maximum first lien senior secured leverage ratio of
2.25:1.00. Oil prices would need to increase significantly in order for us to comply with our
covenants at the end of the first quarter of 2017. Unless prices for our products increase
significantly, we expect we will need to amend the covenants under our credit facilities before the
end of March 2017 in order to remain compliant. We can give no assurances that our lenders will
amend our covenants. If we were to breach any of our covenants, our lenders would be permitted
to accelerate the principal amount due under the Credit Facilities and foreclose on the assets
securing them. If payment were accelerated under our Credit Facilities, it would result in a default
under our outstanding notes and permit acceleration and foreclosure on the assets securing the
secured notes.
Except as otherwise agreed with our lenders for specific transactions, our Credit Facilities require
us to apply 100% of the proceeds from asset sales to repay loans outstanding under the Credit
Facilities, except that we are permitted to use up to 40% of proceeds from non-borrowing base
asset monetizations to repurchase our notes to the extent available at a significant minimum
discount to par, as specified in the facilities. In addition, subject to compliance with our
indentures, we may incur additional indebtedness to repurchase our notes to the extent available
at a specified minimum discount to par, as follows: (i) up to $1 billion, which may be secured by
liens that are junior to the liens securing our Credit Facilities, provided that at least 60% of the
proceeds from such new debt is used first to repay loans outstanding under the Term Loan
Facility, and (ii) up to $200 million, which may be secured by first-priority liens on our non-
borrowing base properties. The Credit Facilities also permit us to incur up to an additional $50
million of non-Credit Facility indebtedness, which, subject to compliance with our indentures,
may be secured; and the proceeds of which must be applied to repay the Term Loan Facility. We
must apply cash on hand in excess of $150 million to repay amounts outstanding under our
Revolving Credit Facility. Further, we are restricted from (i) paying dividends or making other
distributions to common stockholders and (ii) making capital investments exceeding $100 million
during 2016.
Our borrowing base is redetermined each May 1 and November 1. The borrowing base will be
based upon a number of factors, including commodity prices and reserves levels. Increases in
our borrowing base require approval of at least 80% of our revolving lenders, as measured by
exposure, while decreases require a two-thirds approval. We and the lenders (requiring a request
from the lenders holding two-thirds of the revolving commitments and outstanding loans) each
may request a special redetermination once in any period between three consecutive scheduled
redeterminations. We will be permitted to have collateral released when both (i) our credit ratings
are at least Baa3 from Moody's and BBB- from S&P, in each case with a stable or better outlook,
and (ii) certain permitted liens securing other debt are released.
All obligations under the Credit Facilities are guaranteed jointly and severally by all of our
material wholly-owned subsidiaries. The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries not guaranteeing
the debt are de minimis.
Substantially all of the restrictions imposed by the February 2016 amendment to the Credit
Facilities, other than the requirement for semiannual borrowing base redeterminations, may
terminate in the future if we are able to comply with the financial covenants as they existed prior
to giving effect to the amendment.
At June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with the financial and other covenants under our Credit
Facilities.
30
Senior Notes
In October 2014, we issued $5.00 billion in aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured
notes, including $1.00 billion of 5% senior unsecured notes due January 15, 2020 (the 2020
notes), $1.75 billion of 5 ½% senior unsecured notes due September 15, 2021 (the 2021 notes)
and $2.25 billion of 6% senior unsecured notes due November 15, 2024 (the 2024 notes and
together with the 2020 notes and the 2021 notes, the unsecured notes). The unsecured notes
were issued at par and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by
all of our material subsidiaries. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the unsecured
notes to make a $4.95 billion cash distribution to Occidental in October 2014.
In December 2015, we exchanged $534 million, $921 million and $1,358 million in aggregate
principal amount of the 2020 notes, the 2021 notes, and the 2024 notes, respectively, for $2.25
billion in aggregate principal amount of newly issued 8% senior secured second lien notes due
December 15, 2022 (the 2022 notes). We recorded a deferred gain of approximately $560 million
on the debt exchange, which will be amortized using the effective interest rate method over the
term of the 2022 notes. Additionally, we incurred approximately $28 million in third-party costs
which were fully expensed in 2015. The second lien notes are secured on a second-priority
basis, subject to the terms of an intercreditor agreement and collateral trust agreement by a lien
on the same collateral used to secure our obligations under our Credit Facilities.
During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we repurchased over $100 million in aggregate
principal amount of the senior unsecured notes for under $13 million in cash. During the three
months ended June 30, 2016, we entered into privately negotiated exchange agreements with a
holder of our 6% Senior Notes due 2024 and our 5 ½% Senior Notes due 2021 to exchange a
total of approximately 2.1 million shares of our common stock on a post-split basis for notes in the
aggregate principal amount of $80 million.
We will pay interest semiannually in cash in arrears on January 15 and July 15 for the 2020
notes, on March 15 and September 15 for the 2021 notes, on June 15 and December 15 for the
2022 notes and on May 15 and November 15 for the 2024 notes.
The indentures governing the senior unsecured notes and the second lien secured notes each
include covenants that, among other things, limit our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to
incur debt secured by liens. The indentures also restrict our ability to merge or consolidate with,
or transfer all or substantially all of our assets to, another entity. These covenants are subject to a
number of important qualifications and limitations that are set forth in the indenture. The
covenants are not, however, directly linked to measures of our financial performance. In addition,
if we experience a “change of control triggering event” (as defined in the indentures) with respect
to a series of notes, we will be required, unless we have exercised our right to redeem the notes
of such series, to offer to purchase the notes of such series at a purchase price equal to 101% of
their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture governing our second
lien secured notes also restricts our ability to sell certain assets and to release collateral from
liens securing the second lien secured notes.
Other
We estimate the fair value of fixed-rate debt, which is classified as Level 1, based on prices from
known market transactions for our instruments. The estimated fair value of our debt at June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, including the fair value of the variable rate portion, was
approximately $4.3 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, compared to a carrying value of
approximately $5.9 billion and $6.1 billion. A one-eighth percent change in the variable interest
rates on the borrowings under our Credit Facilities on June 30, 2016, would result in a $2.1
million change in annual interest expense.
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit in the aggregate amount of
approximately $129 million and $70 million (including $120 million and $49 million under the
Revolving Credit Facility), respectively, which were issued to support ordinary course marketing,
insurance, regulatory and other matters.

We define adjusted EBITDAX consistent with our Credit Facilities as earnings before interest
expense; income taxes; depreciation, depletion and amortization; exploration expense; and
other non-cash, unusual and infrequent items. Our management believes adjusted EBITDAX
provides useful information in assessing our financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows and is widely used by the industry and investment community. The amounts included in
the calculation of adjusted EBITDAX were computed in accordance with GAAP. This measure
is a material component of certain of our financial covenants under our Credit Facilities and is
provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income and liquidity measures calculated
in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from adjusted EBITDAX are significant
components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a
company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic cost of depreciable and
depletable assets. Adjusted EBITDAX should be read in conjunction with the information
(a)
contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the GAAP measure of net cash provided by
operating activities to the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted EBITDAX:

Our net cash provided by operating activities was $44 million and $232 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The first half of 2016, as compared with the same
period in 2015, reflected lower revenues of $374 million, primarily due to lower commodity prices
and volumes, net of cash generated from our hedging program, partially offset by lower
production costs of $110 million, general and administrative expenses of $30 million and taxes
other than on income of $30 million as well as the positive effect of working capital changes
primarily related to trade receivables and accrued liabilities.
Our net cash flow used by investing activities decreased $422 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2016, compared to the same period of 2015, primarily due to lower capital investments.
Our net cash flow used by financing activities of $36 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 included approximately $42 million in net proceeds on the Revolving Credit Facility, $61
million in payments on the Term Loan and $20 million in debt repurchases and other costs. Our
net cash flow provided by financing activities of $231 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015 included approximately $230 million in net borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.
32
2016 Capital Program
For 2016, we currently have a $50 million capital program designed primarily to maintain the
mechanical integrity of our facilities and systems and operate them safely. Our capital for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 was $26 million, of which $5 million related to the second quarter.
Of the total amount, $19 million was for the planned turnaround at our Elk Hills power plant, of
which payment of $14 million was deferred to future periods. The remaining amount is for other
mechanical integrity projects and workovers. We significantly slowed second quarter capital
investment in response to low commodity prices. Our decision to withhold development capital in
the first half of the year reduced our production levels, particularly in the second quarter. We are
increasing the level of our capital activity in the second half of the year to a pace that will bring
the full-year investment to a level consistent with the $50 million capital program. We expect that
this higher activity level will reduce our production decline rate in the second half of the year to
bring the full year decline to a range consistent with our stated decline range. However,
sustained low-price periods may materially affect the quantities of oil and gas reserves we can
economically produce over the longer term.
We focus on creating value and are committed to internally fund our capital budget with operating
cash flows. Our low decline assets plus our high level of operational control and absence of long
term commitments give us the flexibility to adjust the level of such capital investments as
circumstances warrant. In light of current commodity prices, we have built a dynamic budget for
2016 that can be adjusted to align investments with projected cash flows. We will monitor prices
and cash flow throughout the year and, if oil prices improve, may deploy additional capital
focusing on a combination of capital workovers and new wells that meet our Value Creation
Index (VCI) investment metrics, while abiding by our financial covenants.
Subsequent Events
We announced the commencement on August 1 of our offers to purchase (Tender Offers) up to
the combined aggregate principal amount of our notes that can be purchased with $525 million in
cash at stated discounts to par. The offers are conditioned on, among other things, (i) entry into,
and effectiveness of, an amendment to our Credit Facilities and the availability of sufficient funds
from the Credit Facilities necessary to consummate the Tender Offers and (ii) a sufficient
aggregate principal amount of our notes being validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) to
result in a minimum of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of our notes being accepted for
purchase. Notes accepted for purchase by us would receive base consideration of $510 per
$1,000 in principal amount of our 2020 notes accepted, $490 per $1,000 in principal amount of
our 2021 notes accepted, $460 per $1,000 in principal amount of our 2024 notes accepted and
$625 per $1,000 in principal amount of our 2022 notes accepted, and an early participation
premium of $50 per $1,000, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We will not accept more than $200
million in aggregate principal amount of our 2022 notes under the Tender Offers.
We are concurrently seeking to amend our Credit Facilities to permit the consummation of these
offers and the incurrence of a new syndicated loan facility. We also expect that the amendment
will, among other things, reduce the Revolving Credit Facility commitments from $1.6 billion to
$1.4 billion, provide covenant relief until the end of the first quarter of 2018 and grant a lien on
substantially all of our assets not currently pledged to secure the Credit Facilities.
We are seeking an aggregate principal amount of at least $700 million under the syndicated
facility, which will be secured by a first priority lien on the same collateral as used to secure the
Credit Facilities, but with “second out” collateral recovery pursuant to an intercreditor agreement
between the Credit Facility lenders and the syndicated facility lenders. We expect 25% of the
proceeds from the syndicated facility to be used to pay down the Term Loan Facility and the
balance to be used to pay down the Revolving Loan Facility.
We will consummate the Credit Facility amendment, the syndicated facility and the Tender
Offers, if we are able to successfully complete the marketing of the syndicated facility on
satisfactory pricing terms and conditions and achieve a successful outcome in the Tender Offers.
Our lenders, under the Credit Facilities or under the syndicated facility, may impose additional
restrictions that we have not described. Also, we may otherwise alter the terms of these
transactions in response to market conditions.

Lawsuits, Claims, Contingencies and Commitments
We, or certain of our subsidiaries, are involved, in the normal course of business, in lawsuits,
environmental and other claims and other contingencies that seek, among other things,
compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage or other losses,
punitive damages, civil penalties, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
On April 21, 2016, a purported class action was filed against us in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all beneficial owners of our unsecured notes
from November 12, 2015 to the present.  The complaint alleges that our December 2015 debt
exchange excluded non-qualified institutional holders in violation of the Trust Indenture Act of
1939 and related law and, thereby, impaired their rights to receive principal and interest
payments.  The purported class action seeks declaratory relief that the debt exchange and the
liens securing the new notes are null and void and that the debt exchange resulted in a default. 
The plaintiff also seeks monetary damages and attorneys’ fees.  We plan to vigorously defend
against the claims made by the plaintiff.
We accrue reserves for currently outstanding lawsuits, claims and proceedings when it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated.
Reserves balances at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were not material to our balance
sheets as of such dates. We also evaluate the amount of reasonably possible losses that we
could incur as a result of these matters. We believe that reasonably possible losses that we could
incur in excess of reserves accrued on our balance sheet would not be material to our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
We, our subsidiaries, or both, have indemnified various parties against specific liabilities those
parties might incur in the future in connection with the Spin-off, purchases and other transactions
that they have entered into with us. These indemnities include indemnities made to Occidental
against certain tax-related liabilities that may be incurred by Occidental relating to the Spin-off
and liabilities related to operation of our business while it was still owned by Occidental. As of
June 30, 2016, we are not aware of material indemnity claims pending or threatened against us.
Significant Accounting and Disclosure Changes
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued rules that change how
entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are
not measured at fair value. These rules are effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We
are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our financial statements.
In April 2016, the FASB issued rules requiring that entities recognize revenue to depict the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, in
March 2016, the FASB issued rules intended to improve the operability and understandability of
the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and whether an entity
reports revenue on a gross or net basis. These rules have the same effective date, generally in
the first interim period of fiscal 2018, as the related revenue standard issued in 2014. We are
currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB simplified several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based
payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax
withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. These rules
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within
those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted these rules in the second
quarter of 2016 with no material changes reflected in our financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued rules requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on
the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12
months and to include qualitative and quantitative disclosures with respect to the amount, timing,
and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These rules will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with
earlier application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our
financial statements.
34
In January 2016, the FASB issued rules that modify how entities measure equity investments and
present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities. Unless the investments qualify for a
practicality exception, the new rules require all equity investments to be measured at fair value
with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for
under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). Entities
will have to record changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities measured
under the fair value option in other comprehensive income. These new rules become effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 with no early adoption permitted. We are
currently evaluating the impact of these rules, but we do not expect them to have a significant
impact on our financial statements
Safe Harbor Statement Regarding Outlook and Forward-Looking Information
The information in this document includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties that could materially affect our expected results of operations, liquidity, cash flows
and business prospects. Such statements specifically include our expectations as to our future
financial position, liquidity, cash flows, results of operations and business prospects, budgets,
drilling and workover program, maintenance capital, projected production, projected costs, future
operations, hedging activities, future transactions, planned capital investments and other
guidance. Actual results may differ from anticipated results, sometimes materially, and reported
results should not be considered an indication of future performance. You can typically identify
forward-looking statements by words such as aim, anticipate, believe, budget, continue, could,
effort, estimate, expect, forecast, goal, guidance, intend, likely, may, might, objective, outlook,
plan, potential, predict, project, seek, should, target, will or would and other similar words that
reflect the prospective nature of events or outcomes. For any such forward-looking statement that
includes a statement of the assumptions or bases underlying such forward-looking statement, we
caution that, while we believe such assumptions or bases to be reasonable and make them in
good faith, assumed facts or bases almost always vary from actual results, sometimes materially.
Material risks that may affect our results of operations and financial position appear in Part I, Item
1A, Risk Factors of the 2015 Form 10-K.
Factors (but not necessarily all the factors) that could cause results to differ include: commodity
price fluctuations; the ability of our lenders to limit our borrowing capacity; other liquidity
constraints; the effect of our debt on our financial flexibility; limitations on our ability to enter
efficient hedging transactions; insufficiency of our operating cash flow to fund planned capital
expenditures; faster than expected production decline rates; inability to implement our capital
investment program; inability to replace reserves; inability to obtain government permits and
approvals; inability to monetize selected assets; restrictions and changes in restrictions imposed
by regulations including those related to our ability to obtain, use, manage or dispose of water or
use advanced well stimulation techniques like hydraulic fracturing; risks of drilling; tax law
changes; competition with larger, better funded competitors for and costs of oilfield equipment,
services, qualified personnel and acquisitions; the subjective nature of estimates of proved
reserves and related future net cash flows; risks related to our disposition and acquisition
activities; restriction of operations to, and concentration of exposure to events such as industrial
accidents, natural disasters and labor difficulties in, California; the recoverability of resources;
concerns about climate change and air quality issues; lower-than-expected production from
development projects or acquisitions; catastrophic events for which we may be uninsured or
underinsured; the effects of litigation; cyber attacks; operational issues that restrict market
access; and uncertainties related to the Spin-off and the agreements related thereto.  Readers
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of
the date hereof. We undertake no responsibility to publicly release the result of any revision of
our forward-looking statements after the date they are made.
All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this report are expressly
qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be
considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we
or persons acting on our behalf may issue.

As of June 30, 2016, we had derivative assets of $18 million and derivative liabilities of $99
million carried at fair value, as determined from prices provided by external sources that are not
actively quoted, which mature in 2016 through 2018.
Credit Risk
Our credit risk relates primarily to trade receivables and derivative financial instruments. Credit
exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances and current activity. For
derivative swaps and options entered into as part of our hedging program, we are subject to
counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty is unable to meet its settlement
commitments. We actively manage this credit risk by selecting counterparties that we believe to
be financially strong and continuing to monitor their financial health. Concentration of credit risk
is regularly reviewed to ensure that counterparty credit risk is adequately diversified.
As of June 30, 2016, the substantial majority of the credit exposures related to our business was
with investment grade counterparties. We believe exposure to credit-related losses related to our
business at June 30, 2016 was not material and losses associated with credit risk have been
insignificant for all years presented.
36
Item 4.Controls and Procedures
Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer supervised and participated in our evaluation of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation, our
President and Chief Executive Officer and our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
June 30, 2016.
There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the second quarter of
2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.
