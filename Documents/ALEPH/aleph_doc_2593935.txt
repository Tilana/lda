(d) On August 9, 2016, Chevron Corporation (“Chevron”) issued a press release announcing that,
on August 8, 2016, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) elected Dambisa Moyo to the Board,
effective October 11, 2016, and Wanda M. Austin to the Board, effective December 1, 2016. Dr.
Moyo will serve on the Audit Committee of the Board, and Dr. Austin will serve on the Board
Nominating and Governance Committee and the Public Policy Committee of the Board.
On August 8, 2016, the Board also approved, to be granted on the respective effective dates of
Dr. Moyo’s and Dr. Austin’s election to the Board, a prorated grant to each of Dr. Moyo and Dr.
Austin of the annual restricted stock unit award granted to non-employee Directors under the
Chevron Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan (the “NED Plan.”)
The number of restricted stock units to be received by each of Dr. Moyo and Dr. Austin shall be
determined by multiplying $225,000 by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
remaining in the Annual Compensation Cycle (as defined in the NED Plan) beginning on the
respective effective date of Dr. Moyo’s and Dr. Austin’s election to the Board and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the Annual Compensation Cycle, and dividing that
product by the closing Chevron common stock price on the effective date of the grant. Each of Dr.
Moyo and Dr. Austin will also be entitled to receive the annual cash retainer for non-employee
Directors, which will be prorated and paid in monthly installments of $12,500.
The press release announcing Dr. Moyo’s and Dr. Austin’s election to the Board is attached
hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
