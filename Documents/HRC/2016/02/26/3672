<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and relevant international human rights 
instruments,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the potential of sport as a universal language that contributes to 
educating people on the values of respect, diversity, tolerance and fairness and as a means 
to combat all forms of discrimination and promote an inclusive society, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that sport and major sporting events can be used to promote 
awareness, understanding and the application of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing further</i> the potential of sport and major sporting events in contributing 
to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and noting that, as declared at 
the 2005 World Summit, sport has the potential to foster peace and development and to 
contribute to an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding among peoples and nations,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the contribution of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on 
Sport for Development and Peace and the United Nations Office on Sport for Development 
and Peace to identify synergy and complimentarity between sport and the work of the 
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>United Nations to promote the values of diversity, tolerance and fairness and as a means to 
combat all forms of discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the need to combat discrimination and intolerance where they occur 
within and outside the sporting context, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 9/14 of 18 September 2008, in which 
the Council urged the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to take 
measures, in consultation with various international sporting and other organizations, to 
enable them to contribute to the struggle against racism and racial discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the imperative need to engage women and girls in the practice of sport 
for development and peace and, in this regard, welcoming activities that aim to foster and 
encourage such initiatives at the global level,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing also</i> that special attention needs to be paid to ensuring non-
discrimination, including the equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms by persons with disabilities, including their active participation in all aspects of 
society, including sports, 
</p>
<p> <i>Acknowledging </i>the potential of sport and mass sport events to educate the youth of 
the world and to promote their inclusion through sport practised without discrimination of 
any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires human understanding, tolerance, fair 
play and solidarity,  
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging also</i> the benefits of regular sport, physical activity and play in the 
realization of the right to health and as a means to prevent and treat illness and disease,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 65/4 of 18 October 2010 on sport as a means 
to promote education, health, development and peace, in which the Assembly emphasized 
and encouraged the use of sport as a vehicle to foster development and strengthen education 
for children and young persons; prevent disease and promote health, including the 
prevention of drug abuse; empower girls and women; foster the inclusion and well-being of 
persons with disabilities; and facilitate social inclusion, conflict prevention and 
peacebuilding, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>General Assembly resolution 64/4 of 19 October 2009, on the 
building of a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal and, in this 
context, welcoming also the adoption on the same date of resolution 64/3, in which the 
Assembly invited the International Olympic Committee to participate in its sessions and 
work in the capacity of observer,  
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> the valuable contribution that the appeal launched by the 
International Olympic Committee for an Olympic Truce could make towards advancing the 
purposes and principles of the Charter,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the need to observe, within the framework of the Charter, the Olympic 
Truce, individually and collectively, throughout the period beginning with the start of the 
Games of the XXX Olympiad and ending with the closing of the XIV Paralympic Games, 
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming </i>the hosting of the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympic and Paralympic 
Games in the cities of London and Rio de Janeiro, respectively, the hosting of the 2014 
Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in Sochi, and stressing the opportunity to make use 
of these events to promote awareness of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights among 
those watching and participating and of how the principles of the Olympic Charter, aimed 
at, inter alia, non-discrimination, equality, inclusion, respect and mutual understanding, 
relate to the Declaration and can translate into all aspects of society,  </p>


<p><i> Recognizing</i> therefore the need to reflect on the value of relevant principles 
enshrined in the Olympic Charter and on the value of good sporting example, in achieving 
the universal respect for and realization of all human rights, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Decides </i>to convene, within existing resources, at its nineteenth session, a 
high-level interactive panel discussion to highlight, examine and suggest ways in which 
sport and major sporting events, in particular the Olympic and Paralympic Games, can be 
used to promote awareness, understanding and the application of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to liaise with relevant special procedures, States and other stakeholders, including 
relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, with a view to ensuring their participation in 
the above-mentioned panel discussion;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Also requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a report on the 
outcome of the panel discussion in the form of a summary.
