<p><i>Summary 
</i>In the last decade, Iraq has been a major theatre of operations for private military and 
security companies. A series of high-profile incidents involving such companies, such as 
the Nissour Square shooting in 2007, have focused attention on the negative impact of their 
activities on Iraqis&#8217; human rights. Such incidents, as well as abuses reported in other parts 
of the world, have prompted efforts to ensure that security companies and their personnel 
are held responsible for violations of human rights.  
</p>
<p>During its visit to Iraq, the Working Group learned that the number of incidents involving 
private military and security companies had decreased in recent years.  This could be 
attributed to several factors:  the decrease in their military-related activities in Iraq; stricter 
regulation by the Iraqi authorities; and efforts by the United States of America to tighten 
oversight of its private security contractors operating in Iraq. The Working Group 
commends the efforts of the Iraqi and United States authorities in this regard.  
</p>
<p>Despite this decrease in incidents, Iraq continues to grapple with the grant of legal 
immunity extended to private security contractors under Order 17 issued by the Coalition 
Provisional Authority (CPA). This immunity prevented prosecutions in Iraqi courts. Nor

</p>
<p>have prosecutions in the home countries of such companies been successful.  Four years 
after Nissour Square, the case against the alleged perpetrators is still pending in United 
States courts. Other alleged perpetrators have not even been brought to court so far. The 
Working Group is deeply concerned about the lack of accountability for violations 
committed between 2003 and 2009 and recalls that the victims of such violations and their 
families are still waiting for justice. 
</p>
<p>In a welcome development, the 2009 Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between Iraq and 
the United States contains a provision removing the immunity of some private foreign 
security contractors in Iraq. It is not clear, however, whether this removal of immunity 
covers all contractors employed by the Government of the United States and whether it is 
fully applied in Iraqi courts. The Working Group recommends that this legal situation be 
clarified as a matter of priority. 
</p>
<p>CPA memorandum 17 deals with the licensing system for private military and security 
companies (PMSCs) operating in Iraq. Despite the fact that the CPA was dissolved several 
years ago, this memorandum remains the basis for the Iraqi Government&#8217;s regulation of 
private military and security companies. In the view of the Working Group, this is not a 
firm basis for regulation. Iraq has developed legislation regulating security companies, 
which has been under consideration since 2008.  The Working Group urges the 
Government of Iraq to take the necessary steps to ensure that legislation on PMSCs is 
adopted as a matter of priority. 
</p>
<p>The Working Group reiterates that providing security to its people is a fundamental 
responsibility of the State. Outsourcing security creates risks for human rights and the 
Government of Iraq must remain vigilant and devote the necessary resources to ensure that 
PMSCs &#8211; whether international or Iraqi &#8211; are stringently regulated and that they respect the 
human rights of the Iraqi people.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of Iraq, the Working Group on the use of 
mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the right of 
peoples to self-determination visited Iraq from 12 to 16 June 2011. In accordance with 
general practice, the Working Group was represented by two of its members, in this case, 
Jos&#233; Luis G&#243;mez del Prado and Faiza Patel.1  
</p>
<p>2. In accordance with Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/2 and Human Rights 
Council resolution 7/10, the Working Group is called upon to monitor mercenaries and 
mercenary-related activities in all their forms and manifestations in different parts of the 
world, as well as to study the effects of the activities of private companies offering military 
assistance, consultancy and security services on the international market on the enjoyment 
of human rights, particularly the right of peoples to self-determination. 
</p>
<p>3. In the present report, a private military and/or security company (PMSC) is to be 
understood as a corporate entity which provides on a compensatory basis military and/or 
security services by physical persons and/or legal entities. Military services include 
specialized services related to military actions including strategic planning, intelligence, 
investigation, land, sea or air reconnaissance, flight operations of any type, manned or 
unmanned, satellite surveillance, any kind of knowledge transfer with military applications, 
material and technical support to armed forces and other related activities. Security services 
include armed guarding or protection of buildings, installations, property and people, any 
kind of knowledge transfer with security and policing applications, development and 
implementation of informational security measures and other related activities.2  
</p>
<p>4. During the visit, the Working Group held meetings in Baghdad with representatives of 
the Ministries of Human Rights, Interior, Defence and Justice, members of the High 
Judicial Council, and members of the Committee on Defence and Security and the 
Committee on Human Rights at the Council of Representatives (the Parliament of Iraq). 
The Working Group regrets that the meeting with representatives of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs was cancelled and could not be rescheduled. The Working Group also had the 
opportunity to meet with representatives of civil society organizations, of the diplomatic 
community, of international organizations, and representatives of the private military and 
security industry. The Working Group would like to thank the United National Assistance 
Mission in Iraq (UNAMI) and especially its Human Rights Office for facilitating the 
mission. 
</p>
<p><b> II. International human rights commitments 
</b></p>
<p>5. Iraq has ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women. Iraq is also a party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, and the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child

 1 The Working Group is composed of five independent experts serving in their personal capacities. Jos&#233; 
</p>
<p>Luis G&#243;mez del Prado (Spain) was the Chairperson-Rapporteur between January and July 2011. 
During the same period, the other members were Amada Benavides de P&#233;rez (Colombia), Najat al-
Hajjaji (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), Faiza Patel (Pakistan) and Alexander Nikitin (Russian Federation).

<p>pornography. It has ratified the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime 
of Genocide. In 2010, Iraq ratified the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Most recently in 2011, Iraq acceded to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. 
</p>
<p>6. Iraq is not a party to the International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, 
Financing and Training of Mercenaries. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Private military and security companies operating in Iraq 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The context 
</b></p>
<p>7. In the last decade, Iraq has been a major theatre of operations for private military and 
security companies. The United States of America, which still has the largest military and 
diplomatic presence in Iraq, remains the most important user of private security in the 
country. PMSCs have been contracted by the United States to provide a wide range of 
military and security services in Iraq during the United States-led military operation 
launched in 2003 and its aftermath. The Department of Defense of the United States 
continues to be the main contractor of PMSCs. As the United States Armed Forces 
gradually withdraw from Iraq, the demand for the services of PMSCs by other stakeholders, 
such as the Department of State and USAID, strongly increases. This demand can be 
explained by several factors such as the lack of institution-building in law enforcement, the 
continuing situation of generalized violence, as well as the increase in United States  
Embassy activities in Iraq. The challenging security situation throughout most of the 
country also compels private businesses which are increasingly active in Iraq, to contract 
PMSCs. During the visit, the Working Group also heard that humanitarian agencies and 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as well as some journalists, use PMSCs to ensure 
their protection when working in Iraq. The Working Group was also informed that the 
United Nations does not currently use PMSCs in Iraq. 
</p>
<p>8. Despite some improvements in Iraq since 2007, which saw a peak in violence against 
civilians, the general security situation remains tense. In 2010, according to the United 
Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), almost 3,000 civilians were killed and 
almost 14,500 wounded. While these figures are significantly lower than those recorded for 
2007 when almost 18,000 people were reportedly killed, they still remain high. Many of the 
civilian casualties can be attributed to the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) by 
insurgent and terrorist groups.3 While general violence has decreased substantially since 
2007, assassinations, targeted killings and extrajudicial executions seem to be on the rise. 
According to UNAMI, at least 71 civilians were assassinated in 2010.4 
</p>
<p>9. As United States forces gradually withdraw from the country, Iraqi security forces will 
resume full and sole responsibility for ensuring the safety and security of all Iraqi citizens 
and foreigners in the country. Concerns have been expressed by various stakeholders over 
the lack of training of Iraqi security forces, structural problems and the lack of political 
leadership (since there have been neither a Minister of Defence, nor a Minister of the 
Interior since the March 2010 elections).5 Such a vacuum in law enforcement is filled by a 
continuing and even growing role of PMSCs in Iraq and this is a matter of great concern.

</p>
<p>10.  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and 
UNAMI have regularly reported on the impact of PMSCs on human rights in Iraq, in 
particular on civilian deaths involving contractors (see below). 
</p>
<p>11.  Concerns were raised about the impact of PMSCs on human rights when Iraq 
was reviewed by the Human Rights Council under its universal periodic review (UPR) in 
February 2010. The Council recommended that Iraq ensure that any collaboration 
agreement signed with other States or contracts concluded with private security companies 
guarantee the obligation of respecting international standards for the protection of human 
rights, as well as establish an adequate mechanism supervising the compliance with these 
standards by the actors involved&#8221;. Iraq supported this recommendation (A/HRC/14/14, 
para. 81.28).. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Mapping of private military and security companies operating in Iraq 
</b></p>
<p>12.  The Working Group was informed by the Ministry of the Interior that 117 
PMSCs are currently licensed (or in the process of renewing their license) in accordance 
with the procedure first established in 2004 by Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA)  
memorandum 17 to operate in Iraq (see section III.D below). Of these, 89 companies are 
Iraqi and 28 are foreign. 
</p>
<p>13.  According to the Ministry of the Interior, the total number of armed employees 
of the licensed PMSCs is about 35,000.6 As a point of comparison, as of March 2011, there 
were 303,000 agents in the Iraqi Police and another 45,000 in the Iraqi Federal Police.7  
</p>
<p>14.  Since 2003, the United States Departments of Defense and State and USAID 
have been the largest clients of PMSCs in Iraq.8 According to the Special Inspector General 
for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR), 77 PMSCs had direct contracts or subcontracts with the 
Department of Defence, the Department of State  and USAID between 2003 and 2008. 
They performed a range of security services, including providing static security (guarding 
sites), escorting individuals (personal security details), protecting convoys, as well as 
providing operational coordination, intelligence analysis, security advice and planning. In 
addition, another 233 PMSCs were contracted to provide various security services. In total, 
these 310 companies held contracts totalling almost $6 billion since 2003. The top 10 
PMSCs accounted for about 75 per cent of that total.9 
</p>
<p>15.  The number of PMSC employees contracted by the United States Government 
has declined over the last couple of years. According to the Department of Defense, there 
were 8,327 private security contractor personnel working for the Department in Iraq as of 
December 2010, down from a peak of 15,279 in June 2009.10  In comparison, there were 
47,300 American soldiers in Iraq at that date in 2010.

</p>
<p>16.  In addition to the employees of PMSCs contracted by the Department of 
Defense, the Working Group was told that there are an additional 3,500 employees working 
for PMSCs contracted by the Department of State. PMSCs contracted by the Department  
are hired under the Worldwide Personal Protective Service contract. They provide 
protection to American diplomats and foreign heads of State and static security for United 
States embassy facilities. It is expected that the number of private security contractors 
working for the Department of State will increase to as much as 5,500 in order to provide 
security to United States diplomats after their troops withdraw. 11  In this regard, the 
Working Group has noted discrepancies between various figures available for Department 
of State contractors.12 
</p>
<p>17.  The Government of Iraq also contracts some PMSCs to provide certain 
security services. For instance, during the visit, the Working Group was informed that the 
security firm G4S holds a large contract with the Iraqi Ministry of Transport to provide 
security at Baghdad International Airport. However, the Working Group did not receive 
detailed information on the type and amount of security services contracted by the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>18.  PMSCs have also been used by many other entities. The United Kingdom 
Foreign Office and Department for International Development have reportedly contracted 
some PMSCs in Iraq. 13  During the visit, the Working Group received information 
indicating that PMSCs are also increasingly being contracted by the private industry, 
including international oil and gas companies, but also by non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>19.  Previously, the majority of PMSCs operating in Iraq were based in the United 
States or the United Kingdom. The Working Group was informed that this has changed in 
recent years. There has been a growing number of &#8220;Iraqi&#8221; PMSCs: according to the figures 
provided by the Ministry of the Interior, they now form the great majority of PMSCs 
licensed in Iraq (89 out of 117). It is not clear to what extent the companies categorized as 
Iraqi are in fact owned and managed by Iraqi. For instance, some of these companies, such 
as Sabre International, present themselves as &#8220;Iraq-registered, foreign-owned and 
managed&#8221;.14 Others appear to be owned and managed by Iraqi nationals. 
</p>
<p>20. In terms of the nationality of the employees of PMSCs, the Working Group was 
informed by the Ministry of the Interior that the more than 35,000 PMSC employees in Iraq 
included 23,160 Iraqis and 12,672 foreigners.  The proportion of Iraqi employees has 
increased dramatically in recent years. In contrast, in Afghanistan, which was visited by the 
Working Group in April 2009, the overwhelming majority of private security personnel (85 
per cent) were Afghan nationals.15 
</p>
<p>21. For some contracts, however, third-party nationals dominate.  For example, the 
overwhelming majority (89 per cent) of the Department of Defenses&#8217;s 8,327 security 
contractor employees are third-country nationals; 9 per cent are Americans and only 1 per 
cent are Iraqis. 16  The Working Group received information that third-country national

<p>personnel were recruited from a broad range of countries, including Fiji, Nepal, South 
Africa, Sri Lanka, Uganda, Peru and other South American countries.17 There have been 
reports that nationals from some 30 countries have worked for PMSCs in Iraq.18 Despite 
American efforts in 2009 to increase the proportion of security personnel recruited locally, 
this proportion even decreased from 13 per cent to 1 per cent between 2009 and 2010. As of 
December 2010, there were only 113 Iraqi nationals employed by PMSCs contracted by the 
Department of Defense.19  In this regard, the Working Group was informed that while 
PMSCs contracted by the United States employed mainly foreigners, other PMSCs 
employed mainly Iraqis. 
</p>
<p>22. During the visit, the Working Group received information that the Government of Iraq  
has recently asked companies to terminate the employment of African and Asian personnel 
in an attempt to address the unemployment issue in the country. The licences of foreign 
companies, including security companies, which recruit these foreign workers, would be 
revoked.20 The Working Group is concerned about such reports and recalls the international 
obligation of the State, contained most notably in the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Racial Discrimination to which Iraq is a party, to apply all regulations in a non-
discriminatory manner. 
</p>
<p>23. The Private Security Companies Association of Iraq (PSCAI) was established in 2004 
&#8220;to discuss and address matters of mutual interest and concern to the industry conducting 
operations in Iraq&#8221;.21 More than 40 companies, Iraqi and foreign, are members of the 
PSCAI. It requires its members to be licensed or in the process of obtaining a license from 
the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior, or the Ministry of Interior of the Kurdistan Regional 
Government, or both.  
</p>
<p><b> C. The legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>24.  Between 2003 and 2004, the Coalition Provisional Authority issued some 100 
Orders,22 which were published in the <i>Iraqi Official Gazette</i> and were part of Iraqi law.  
</p>
<p>25.  CPA Order 17 on the status of the Coalition, Foreign Liaison Missions, Their 
Personnel and Contractors was signed on 23 June 2003 and revised on 27 June 2004. It 
provides that &#8220;contractors shall be immune from Iraqi legal process with respect to acts 
performed by them pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Contract or any sub-contract 
thereto&#8221; (Section 4(3)). CPA memorandum 17 deals with the licensing system for PMSCs, 
As the CPA was dissolved in June 2004, both CPA Order 17 and CPA memorandum 17 do 
not constitute a clear and solid legal basis for defining the status of PMSCs and regulating 
their activities in Iraq. 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 17 During the visit, the Working Group was informed by one PMSC that Fijians employees received 
</p>
<p>US$ 35 to 40,000 per year, while U.S. and E.U. employees could earn as much as US$ 75 to 100,000 
per year.

<p>26.  The Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period of 8 
March 2004 provided that CPA Orders would remain in force until rescinded or amended 
by legislation duly enacted and having the force of law (art. 26).  While this Law was 
annulled by virtue of article 143 of the new Constitution adopted in 2005, in practice it 
appears that CPA Orders are in force unless specifically annulled by Iraqi legislation. Since 
the transfer of authority to the Interim Government of Iraq in June 2004, some CPA Orders 
have been annulled by the Council of Representatives but others remain in force.  
</p>
<p>27.  The Iraq and United States Governments negotiated a bilateral agreement to 
come into force on 1 January 2009 which includes a provision removing the immunity of 
some private foreign security contractors in Iraq. The Agreement between the United States 
of America and Iraq on the withdrawal of American forces from Iraq and the organization 
of their activities during their temporary presence in Iraq (hereinafter the Status of Forces 
Agreement, or SOFA) was first approved by the Iraqi Council of Ministers and signed on 
17 November 2008. It was approved by the Iraqi Council of Representatives on 27 
November 2008 and by the Iraqi Presidential Council on 4 December 2008.23 
</p>
<p>28.  For purposes of the exercise of jurisdiction, the Status of Forces Agreement 
creates two distinct classes of individuals:  (a) United States forces, including the civilian 
component, and (b) American contractors and their employees. Iraq maintains exclusive 
jurisdiction over these contractors and their employees, but shares jurisdiction with the 
United States over forces, including the civilian component. As the term is defined in the 
agreement, &#8220;U.S. contractors and their employees&#8221; only applies to contractors that are 
operating under a contract/subcontract with or for the United States Forces.24 Therefore, 
United States  contractors operating in Iraq under contract to other U.S. 
departments/agencies are not subject to the terms of the Status of Forces Agreement.25 
During the visit, the Working Group was told that Department of State officials inform all 
their contractors that they are not immune from Iraqi jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the status of 
Department of State contractors, as well as that of contractors hired by other American 
agencies operating in Iraq, is not governed by the withdrawal of immunity in the Status of 
Forces Agreement and may well be governed by CPA Order 17.  This apparent gap in the 
withdrawal of immunity is of significant concern to the Working Group.  
</p>
<p>29.  There also appears to be some uncertainty as to whether the removal of 
immunity is fully applied in Iraqi courts. During the visit, the Working Group received 
inconsistent information in this regard. On the one hand, the Working Group heard from 
some representatives of the Iraqi authorities that the immunity clause contained in CPA 
Order 17 still applied because CPA Order 17 is still valid in its entirety until Iraqi 
legislation is adopted to annul it. On the other hand, the Working Group heard from other 
representatives of the Iraqi authorities that PMSCs were no longer immune from Iraqi 
jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p>30.  In 2008, draft legislation was proposed by the Government in order to clarify 
the issue of immunity of PMSCs. The draft Law on subjecting the private security 
companies to Iraqi law provides that such companies are subject to Iraqi Law and states 
explicitly that the CPA Order 17 shall not apply to them and their employees. It also states

<p>that private security companies and their employees shall not enjoy any immunity for their 
work. This draft law was transmitted by the then Minister of State for Council of 
Representatives (COR) Affairs to the President of COR on 11 February 2008.  The then 
Chair of the COR Committee on Security and Defence tabled the text for discussion in 
COR in May 2008. However, the Working Group was informed that the draft law has not 
been adopted so far. Because of the political situation in Iraq, several legislative proposals &#8211; 
including the draft legislation on subjecting PMSCs to Iraqi law -- have been delayed. In 
light of the lack of clarity concerning the continuing immunity of private security 
contractors in Iraq, this law should be adopted as a matter of priority. 
</p>
<p><b> D. The licensing process 
</b></p>
<p>31.  CPA Order 17 requires that private military and security companies and their 
employees operating in Iraq comply with all CPA Orders, Regulations, Memoranda, and 
any implementing instructions or regulations governing the existence and activities of 
private security companies in Iraq, including registration and licensing of weapons and 
firearms (Section 4 (4)). The 26 June 2004 memorandum 17 issued by the CPA details the 
registration requirements for PMSCs. It requires all PMSCs operating in Iraq to register 
with the Iraqi authorities. As envisaged in memorandum 17, in 2004 the Iraqi Ministry of 
Interior set up a licensing process for PMSCs. The Working Group was informed that a 
Directorate of Registration and Evaluation of Security Companies was established within 
the Ministry of the Interior according to ministerial order no.9887 on 27 September 2004 in 
order to examine applications for licensing. 
</p>
<p>32.  CPA memorandum 17 is the legal basis upon which the licensing process was 
developed. According to the memorandum, in order to obtain an operating licence from the 
Ministry of the Interior, PMSCs must first obtain a business licence from the Ministry of 
Trade. In addition to this license, PMSCs must provide the Ministry of the Interior with 
detailed information concerning the directors of the company, company officers and all 
employees. They must also provide information about the work to be carried out in Iraq, 
including copies of any contracts for services.  
</p>
<p>33.  CPA memorandum 17 requires that PMSCs and their employees are vetted by 
the Iraqi Ministry of Interior. Ministry vetting standards (Sect. 2, para.6) require that 
employees be older than 20; be mentally and physically fit for duties; not have any serious 
criminal convictions; have passed the firearms tests. They must also &#8220;be willing to respect 
the law and all human rights and freedoms of all citizens of the country&#8221;. In applying for a 
licence, PMSCs must provide a list of all weapons and vehicles to be used by the company. 
</p>
<p>34.  Before starting operations in Iraq, PMSCs have to submit a minimum 
refundable bond of $25,000 to the Ministry of the Interior. They lose the bond if they do not 
provide regular information to the Ministry or if they or their employees breach Iraqi or 
other applicable law. Bonds are refunded when PMSCs cease operations in Iraq. PMSCs 
also have to submit evidence that they have sufficient public liability insurance to cover 
possible claims against them. 
</p>
<p>35.  The PSCAI assists PMSCs in applying to the Ministry of the Interior for a 
licence to operate in Iraq. Amongst other things, it provides assistance to PMSCs in putting 
together their application. It maintains close contact with the Ministry in order to check on 
progress in the assessment of the application. According to the PSCAI, it attends the 
Ministry&#8217;s inspections and &#8220;investigative interviews&#8221;. All in all, the PSCAI seeks to 
facilitate the application process for PMSCs and serves as a link between PMSCs and the 
Ministry of Interior. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/32/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>36.  According to the PSCAI, there are at least two on-site visits by the Ministry of 
Interior to the PMSC applying for a license, one by the Ministry&#8217;s Office of PSC 
Registration and one by the MOI Intelligence Office. The visits aim to check, among other 
things, weapons and vehicles, and undertake a personnel database check. Some visits are 
scheduled, others are conducted without notice.26  
</p>
<p>37.  Licences are granted for a period of one year. At the end of that period, 
PMSCs have to apply to renew their licence. As of December 2010, the Ministry of Interior 
had issued a total of 129 licences since 2005. 27  The Working Group has requested 
information from the authorities on the number of applications denied and the reasons for 
any denials, but has not received it by the time this report was finalised. Most licences are 
renewed on a yearly basis. Some have been suspended or revoked by the Ministry of 
Interior in cases of breaches of CPA memorandum 17 or any other law in force in Iraq. For 
example, following the shooting of civilians in Nissour Square in 2007, Iraq refused to 
renew PMSC Blackwater&#8217;s application and the company no longer operates in Iraq.  
Approximately 30 PMSCs have either had their license revoked, let their license lapse or 
have gone out of business.28  
</p>
<p>38. It should be noted here that PMSCs operating in the Kurdistan Region must be 
registered with the Ministry of Interior of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). The 
registration requirements are quite similar to those of the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior.  
</p>
<p>39. CPA memorandum 17 is supplemented by instructions issued by the Iraqi Ministry of 
Interior. These instructions are updated and re-issued on a regular basis. The latest version 
of the Ministry&#8217;s instructions dates from 2 April 2011.29 These instructions emphasize that 
PMSCs should respect human rights. They also recall that only PMSCs licensed with the 
Ministry of Interior are allowed to operate in Iraq.  
</p>
<p>40. The Ministry of the Interior instructions deal mainly with practical issues regarding the 
operations of PMSCs in Iraq. One of the most prevalent complaints about PMSCs operating 
in Iraq in previous years was that they could not be identified by the civilians with whom 
they interacted.  In order to address this issue, Iraq now requires each PMSC to display the 
badge of the company on all its vehicles and to ensure that all employees wear the uniform 
of the company and carry ID cards issued by the Ministry. Employees must also carry valid 
weapons cards issued by the Ministry. The Working Group welcomes such measures which 
allow PMSC vehicles and employees to be clearly identifiable by the local population and 
for checks to be carried out easily. They contribute not only to transparency in the 
operations of PMSCs, but probably also have a deterrence value: individuals who are easily 
and publicly identifiable might be less inclined to commit crimes. During the visit, the 
Working Group has received information that Department of State contractors were 
somehow exempted from such requirements, although such information was denied by the 
United States authorities 
</p>
<p>41.  During the visit, the Working Group has heard that after a slow start, the 
licensing process was fully up and running in 2006-2007. The licensing requirements are

</p>
<p>quite stringent. According to the PSCAI, the Ministry of the Interior undertakes inspections 
to the licensed PMSCs at least once a year, and sometimes as often as every three months. 
The Ministry confirmed to the Working Group that inspections were carried out on a 
regular basis. The Working Group was told by one PMSC that it had been inspected five 
times in the last year and that some inspections (also described by some as &#8220;raids&#8221;) to the 
compounds of PMSCs even take place in the middle of the night. This has encouraged 
PMSCs to keep their records up-to-date and available for inspection at all times. The 
paperwork to be provided by PMSCs and to be obtained from the Ministry of Interior is 
extensive. The licensing process is clearly a time-consuming and resource-intensive 
exercise. Nonetheless, it allows for close regulation and scrutiny of all companies, their 
employees and their activities.  
</p>
<p>42.  While PMSCs are responsible for submitting all required documentation to the 
Ministry of the Interior and for maintaining their records, there is a corresponding 
responsibility on the part of the Ministry to process applications and issue the necessary 
cards in a timely manner. During the visit, the Working Group was told that Ministry  
regulations frequently change which leads to a lack of predictability for PMSCs. While 
regular briefings by the Ministry assist PMSCs in understanding new rules, further 
standardization of briefings and rules would no doubt contribute to the efficiency of the 
process.  The Working Group heard of recent difficulties linked to the fact that no Minister 
of the Interior has been appointed for more than a year after the March 2010 general 
elections. As a result, applications to renew licences cannot be approved and existing 
licences are extended only for short periods of time. This has created problems since new 
weapons cards cannot be issued until licences are formally renewed. Without the 
appropriate weapons cards, the weapons are confiscated by the authorities. 
</p>
<p>43.  The Iraqi authorities informed the Working Group that vetting requirements 
are strictly applied. The criminal records of all Iraqi employees are checked. With regard to 
foreign employees, the Working Group was informed that PMSCs have to submit a pledge 
that these employees have clean criminal records. However, the Working Group was also 
told by some representatives of the private military and security industry that they had been 
required to submit certificates proving the absence of criminal convictions. Considering 
that PMSC employees have often worked and lived in many different countries around the 
world and for several companies, the Working Group would recommend that PMSCs 
submit such certificates whenever possible.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Draft legislation on private military and security companies 
</b></p>
<p>44. As noted previously, CPA memorandum 17 remains the legal basis for the Iraqi 
Government&#8217;s regulation of private military and security companies. In the view of the 
Working Group, this is not a firm basis for regulation. In 2008, the Government introduced 
legislation on private security companies which would replace CPA memorandum 17. This 
legislation has been pending in the Council of Representatives since 2008.30  
</p>
<p>45. The draft legislation on the regulation of PMSCs incorporates all the elements 
contained in CPA memorandum 17. It introduces additional strictures for foreign PMSCs:  
Article 5 of the draft legislation provides that licences would only be granted to branches of 
foreign security companies &#8220;in cases of extreme security necessities with the approval of 
the Council of Ministers based on a proposal from the Minister of Interior&#8221;. In addition, 
there should be no objection from the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of State for 
National Security Affairs and approval should be obtained from the National Intelligence 
Agency (art. 9). The same process would be followed for employees of foreign PMSCs (art. 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 30 See UNAMI, Human Rights Report (1 January- 30 June 2008), para. 39. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/32/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>15). In order to ensure accountability, the draft legislation requires that PMSCs ensure that 
their employees are available to be brought before the competent authorities upon request. 
It also provides that a PMSC shall be jointly responsible with the employee for acts when 
committed in Iraq. 
</p>
<p>46.  Like the CPA rules, the draft legislation requires that licensed companies 
inform the Ministry of the Interior of any crime committed in the course of their activities. 
An important new element is the requirement that PMSCs organize training programmes 
for their personnel on respect for human rights in coordination with the Ministry (art. 20, 
para. 8). The draft legislation also provides that PMSCs would continue to be prohibited 
from taking any action that would violate the rights and freedoms of citizens (art. 23). Any 
breach of that obligation could result in the withdrawal or suspension of the license to 
operate in Iraq (art. 27). 
</p>
<p>47.  For reasons already mentioned above, the draft legislation has not been 
adopted yet. Although the Working Group was told by some Government officials that the 
draft legislation on PMSCs could be adopted before the end of the current parliamentary 
session which ends in November 2011, the prospects for adoption of this legislation remain 
unclear.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Human rights impact 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Impact of private military and security companies on the local 
population 
</b></p>
<p>48.  Between 2003 and 2007, PMSC employees were implicated in a series of 
high-profile incidents involving the killing and injuring of Iraqi civilians.31  While some of 
these involved traffic accidents, others were marked by allegations of unprovoked 
shootings and complicity in torture and inhumane treatment of detainees.   
</p>
<p>49.  Employees of the Titan Corporation and CACI International were allegedly 
involved in the torture and inhumane treatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison.  While 
the incidents at Abu Ghraib have led to the convictions of some United States military 
personnel, no contractors have been prosecuted yet. 32  
</p>
<p>50.  Blackwater, which used to have a large presence in Iraq, was implicated in 
several instances of human rights abuses.  Between January 2005 and September 2007 
alone, Blackwater employees were involved in 195 incidents involving firearms discharges. 
In the overwhelming majority of these incidents (84 per cent), they were the first to fire. 
These incidents resulted in significant Iraqi casualties and property damage. 33  Two 
incidents involving Blackwater employees received the most attention. 
</p>
<p>51.  On 24 December 2006, a Blackwater employee named Andrew Moonen 
reportedly shot dead Raheem Khalif Hulaichi, the bodyguard of the Iraqi Vice-President, 
Adil Abdul-Mahdi. The shooting took place near the Prime Minister&#8217;s compound in the 
Green Zone. Moonen was immediately flown out of the country, fired from the company

</p>
<p>and went on to work for another.34 On 18 October 2010, a United States prosecutor ruled 
that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him.35 
</p>
<p>52.  The most high-profile incident involving PMSCs was undoubtedly Nissour 
Square: on 16 September 2007, Blackwater employees killed 17 Iraqi civilians and injured 
many others at a crowded traffic circle in Baghdad.  There have been reports that the 
Blackwater employees believed that they had come under small-arms fire from insurgents, 
so they fired back with machine guns, grenade launchers and a sniper rifle.36 However, 
other reports indicate that the Blackwater employees opened fire first and then fired 
indiscriminately.37 At the time of the event, the Working Group expressed its concern over 
the incident.38 
</p>
<p>53.  Unfortunately, Blackwater was far from being the only PMSC involved in 
incidents causing civilian deaths. For instance, in 2006, it was reported that employees of 
Triple Canopy fired and killed Iraqi civilians for no apparent reason other than &#8220;for sport&#8221;. 
None of them were ever prosecuted.39 Another company, Unity Resources Group (URG) 
was also involved in two incidents in Baghdad, one in March 2006 in which an Australian 
national was shot and one in October 2007 which left two Iraqi women dead. 
</p>
<p>54.  While in Iraq, the Working Group learned that the number of incidents 
involving private military and security companies has decreased significantly in recent 
years and in fact, the Working Group was told by some interlocutors that there had been no 
incidents since 2009. This could be attributed to several factors:  the decrease in their 
military-related activities in Iraq (especially in mobile protection); stricter regulation by the 
Iraqi authorities; and efforts by the United States to tighten oversight of its private security 
contractors operating in Iraq.  
</p>
<p>55.  UNAMI reports confirm that the number of civilian deaths involving PMSCs 
has decreased since 2007. In the second half of 2007, there were at least five incidents 
allegedly involving PMSCs and resulting in the death of Iraqi civilians, including the 
Nissour Square incident.40 In 2008, three incidents occurred in which Iraqi civilians were 
reportedly killed or injured by PMSC employees.41 In 2009, there was only one report of 
killing involving PMSC employees and that concerned the shooting of three PMSC 
employees (including one Iraqi) by another PMSC employee (see section below).42 In 2010, 
UNAMI reported only one incident of a civilian casualty involving PMSCs:  On 8 July 
2010, some PMSC employees allegedly opened fire on a vehicle on the road to Baghdad 
airport, killing one civilian.43

<p>56.  The impact of PMSCs on the local population goes beyond the issue of civilian 
deaths and injuries. During the visit, the Working Group heard that PMSC employees 
entered or even damaged private properties, that they drove their vehicles carelessly and 
provoked traffic accidents, and that they behaved in a culturally insensitive manner towards 
the local population. According to a survey conducted amongst American military 
personnel, some felt that armed contractors behaved in a threatening, arrogant and even 
belligerent manner in Iraq.44 According to another survey conducted amongst United States  
diplomatic personnel, a majority thought that armed contractors did not &#8220;demonstrate an 
understanding and sensitivity to Iraqis and their culture&#8221;.45 There is little doubt that the Iraqi 
population shares these views. Indeed, although no similar survey was conducted amongst 
Iraqis, the Working Group was told that the local population was subject to provocations on 
the part of PMSC employees who, for instance, would point their guns towards people at 
checkpoints.  
</p>
<p>57.  During the visit, the Working Group found that the Iraqi population did not 
seem to make clear distinctions between PMSC employees and United States military 
personnel.  This confusion was particularly pronounced during the early years of the 
American presence when PMSCs frequently did not display identifying insignia.  PMSCs 
therefore seemed to have a negative impact on Iraqis&#8217; perceptions of the United States  
Army and the coalition forces in general.46 
</p>
<p><b> B. Monitoring and reporting incidents of potential human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>58.  In the aftermath of the Nissour Square shooting in 2007, the United States  
authorities have reviewed and made improvements in the reporting procedures and 
oversight mechanisms for PMSCs working for them in Iraq.47   For example, after the 
Nissour Square shooting, the Department of State required video-recording systems to be 
installed in all vehicles used by PMSCs when performing missions that directly support the 
Chief of the United States Mission (e.g. transporting State Department personnel, 
ambassadors, other diplomats, congressional delegations and other government employees). 
PMSCs are required to submit information on their movements to the United States forces 
in order to ensure coordination.48 
</p>
<p>59.  The licensing requirements put in place by the Iraqi authorities have been 
described in detail above. In addition, the Iraqi authorities have taken further measures to 
monitor the movements of PMSC employees. In this regard, the Working Group was 
informed that the Ministry of the Interior requires that PMSCs provide 72 hours&#8217; notice for 
any convoy movement and submit detailed information on the mission, including the route, 
the vehicles and weapons to be used. 
</p>
<p>60.  The Working Group received information that as of March 2010, the 
Government of Iraq required that all PMSCs place cameras on all vehicles in convoys. 
Ministry of the Interior instructions now require that monitoring cameras be installed in all

<p>61.  Iraqi authorities also informed the Working Group that a project on the 
monitoring of PMSC vehicles via satellite is under consideration. Through this project, the 
Iraqi authorities hope that PMSC vehicle locations would be determined through GPS 
equipment placed inside the vehicles. The vehicles&#8217; positions would be transmitted to 
control rooms monitored by the relevant Iraqi authorities. PMSC employees working in the 
vehicles could also be contacted from the control rooms. 
</p>
<p>62.  In terms of reporting, the Ministry of the Interior instructions require that the 
Ministry be notified immediately of any incident or crime occurring during the company&#8217;s 
work. The Working Group has requested information on the number of incidents reported 
to the Ministry and how these incident reports have been handled, but no information has 
been received so far. Whilst there had been instances in the past where PMSC employees 
would fire at Iraqi civilians from a moving vehicle and leave the scene,49 the Working 
Group was told by representatives of PMSCs that they clearly instruct their employees to 
remain at the scene of any incident until the Iraqi police arrives and investigates the 
incident. 
</p>
<p>63.  During the visit, the Working Group did not receive clear information on how 
complaints regarding human rights violations involving PMSCs were reported to the 
authorities by the local population. The Working Group was informed that incidents are not 
reported to the police because the local population reportedly has little trust in the criminal 
justice system. 
</p>
<p>64.  Overall, it appears that significant progress has been made in setting up 
systems for monitoring the activities of PMSCs, both by the Government of the United 
States (which is the largest employer of contractors in Iraq) and by the Iraqi authorities.  
With regard to reporting incidents involving PMSCs, the Working Group did not receive 
sufficient information about the reporting mechanisms and whether they actually provide 
the civilian population with an effective means of redress.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Accountability and compensation to victims 
</b></p>
<p>65.  In accordance with CPA Order 17, PMSCs contracted by the Government of 
the United States and operating in Iraq were immune from the Iraqi legal process until 
2009, so none of their employees could be prosecuted in Iraq for violations of the rights of 
Iraqi civilians. Such cases should, however, have been prosecuted in American courts. In 
this regard, the Working Group recalls that the United States has an obligation to respect 
and ensure the rights laid down in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
to individuals under its jurisdiction but outside its territory.50 This entails an obligation to 
investigate, prosecute and provide effective remedies for victims of violations committed 
by PMSCs contracted by the State and their employees.51 
</p>
<p>66.  In December 2008, the Department of Justice tried to prosecute five  
Blackwater employees under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000 for their 
involvement in the Nissour Square shooting. On 31 December 2009, the Federal District

<p>Court of Columbia dismissed the case on the ground that the evidence was inadmissible 
under the United States Constitution (A/HRC/15/25/Add.3, para. 89).  On appeal, the Court 
of Appeal for the D.C. Circuit decided that some of the evidence was still admissible and 
the case was re-instated in April 2011. Four years after Nissour Square, the case against the 
alleged perpetrators is therefore still pending in American courts. Notwithstanding this 
case, the Working Group notes that for many other incidents which took place in Iraq 
before 2009, no prosecution took place in American courts and therefore no one was held 
accountable for such incidents (see section IV.A above). 
</p>
<p>67.  The Working Group acknowledges that the Iraqi authorities could only take 
limited legal action with regard to PMSCs which were reportedly involved in human rights 
violations against Iraqi civilians before 2009. The Iraqis have, however, taken action 
against Blackwater, which is regarded by many as one of the main offenders.  On 10 
February 2010, the Iraqi Ministry of Interior ordered the firm Xe (formerly Blackwater) to 
leave the country with all its international employees within seven days. The Working 
Group was told by Iraqi authorities that they maintained lists of Blackwater employees so 
that they could not be hired by other PMSCs in Iraq.  Other information suggests, however, 
that some 250 former Blackwater employees remained in Iraq and transferred to other 
PMSCs.52  The Working Group was unable to ascertain whether the persons who remained 
were implicated in human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>68.  Even though PMSC employees cannot be prosecuted in Iraqi courts for 
incidents taking place before 2009, the Iraqi Ministry of Interior was notified of every such 
incident and could conduct an investigation in order to clarify the facts and identify those 
responsible.53  The Working Group was told by the Iraqi authorities that between 2003 and 
2009, PMSCs and the United States Army were reluctant to share information on 
investigations and prosecutions. Notwithstanding this reported lack of cooperation on 
behalf of the other parties involved, the Iraqi authorities could have shared the results of 
local investigations with the American authorities more systematically in order to facilitate 
prosecutions in their courts. In this regard, the Iraqi authorities could request information on 
the status of prosecutions in the United States and, on behalf of the victims, demand that 
prosecutions take place where it is not the case. While the Iraqi authorities have intervened 
with the American authorities in the Nissour square case,54 the Working Group did not 
receive any indication that they have systematically raised other cases with the United 
States  authorities.  
</p>
<p>69.  The combined effect of the immunity clause contained in CPA Order 17 and 
the failure to prosecute PMSC employees in home countries has led to impunity for human 
rights violations against Iraqi civilians between 2003 and 2009. The Working Group is 
deeply concerned about the ongoing failure to hold accountable those involved in such 
violations and to provide an effective remedy to the victims and/or their families. Some of 
the victims have filed civil claims in American courts (A/HRC/15/25/Add.3, para. 54).  
However, PMSC employees should still be prosecuted before United States courts for any 
crime committed in Iraq  
</p>
<p>70.  Since 1 January 2009, PMSCs and their employees (at least those contracted 
by the Department of Defense) can be prosecuted in the Iraqi legal system according to the 
provisions of the Status of Forces Agreement. While Iraqi courts have had jurisdiction since 
2009 over American contractors operating in Iraq, such contractors can only be prosecuted 
under the Iraqi Penal Code of 1969 since there is no specific Iraqi legislation on PMSCs.

<p>71.  On 3 June 2009, the Iraqi Ministry of Interior announced that the Iraqi Security 
Forces had arrested 5 employees of PMSC contracted by the United States in the course of 
an investigation into the killing of another PMSC employee, James Kitterman, an American 
national, in Baghdad&#8217;s Green Zone.55 It does not appear that this arrest has led to any 
prosecution. 
</p>
<p>72.  According to the information available to the Working Group, only one 
prosecution has taken place so far in Iraq since 2009.  Daniel Fitzsimons, a British national 
who was an employee of AmorGroup (now G4S), was convicted of killing Paul McGuigan 
(United Kingdom) and Darren Hoare (Australia) and injuring an Iraqi security guard. In 
February 2011, he was sentenced to 20 years&#8217; imprisonment.56  
</p>
<p>73.  While the number of incidents involving PMSCs has decreased substantially 
since 2009, some incidents have still occurred. For instance, as mentioned above, one 
incident of a civilian casualty involving PMSCs was reported to UNAMI in July 2010. 
During the visit, the Working Group requested information on this incident and its follow-
up, but has not received any information indicating that any PMSC employee had been 
prosecuted in this case (see para. 55 above). 
</p>
<p>74.  With regard to compensation to victims and their families, the United States  
Department of Defense requests PMSCs to make payments &#8220;as soon as possible&#8221; in cases 
of wrongful death, injury or serious damage to property. However, it gives no indication as 
to what would constitute an appropriate amount of payment.57 During the visit, the Working 
Group was told that the United States Embassy makes payments to families affected by the 
activities of their contractors ($10,000 for death, $5,000 for injury, $2,500 for damage to 
property),58 but did not receive detailed information on how many such payments have been 
made so far.  
</p>
<p>75.  Iraqi legislation was adopted in 2009 to compensating the victims of military 
operations, military mistakes and terrorist actions (Law No. 20). 59  The Law applies 
retroactively from 2003. However, the Working Group did not receive detailed information 
on whether and when this law has ever been used to pay compensation to victims or their 
families for deaths or injuries caused by PMSC employees.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>76.  As the discussion above demonstrates, the regulation of PMSCs in Iraq 
has come a long way from the situation that prevailed in the period 2003 to 2009.  
Prodded by public outrage over the Nissour Square shooting in 2007 and the general 
sense among the Iraqi population that contractors were acting with impunity, both the 
Government of the United States and Iraqi authorities have taken steps to tighten 
control over PMSCs.  These initiatives, as well as the decrease in PMSCs military-

</p>
<p><b>related activities are likely the reason for the decrease in the number of incidents 
involving PMSCs in the last couple of years.   
</b></p>
<p><b>77.  The Working Group welcomes these initiatives, but notes that 
accountability for human rights abuses committed during the 2003-2009 period 
remains elusive.  Because of the immunity extended to contractors in Iraq during this 
time period, prosecutions in Iraq were foreclosed.  This places an even greater 
responsibility on the home States of PMSCs to ensure prosecution of offenders.  
Unfortunately, such prosecutions have rarely been brought and have even more rarely 
been successful.  In several cases, the home States have conducted domestic 
investigations and simply decided not to proceed (see section IV.A above).  Even the 
prosecution for the shootings at Nissour Square &#8211; which were the catalyst for much of 
the regulation of PMSCs &#8211; remains mired in procedural battles in American courts.  
The Working Group remains deeply concerned about the lack of accountability for 
violations committed between 2003 and 2009 and recalls that the victims of such 
violations and their families are still waiting for justice. 
</b></p>
<p><b>78.  The Working Group is also concerned that the removal of immunity in 
the 2009 Status of Forces Agreement may not cover all private foreign security 
contractors in Iraq. Furthermore, it is not clear whether this removal of immunity is 
fully applied in Iraqi courts. The Working Group recommends that this legal situation 
be clarified as a matter of priority and urgency. 
</b></p>
<p><b>79.  The use of CPA Memorandum 17 as the legal basis for the Iraqi 
Government&#8217;s regulation of private military and security companies, in the view of 
the Working Group, should be regarded as an interim measure.  Iraqi legislation to 
replace CPA Memorandum 17 (which has been pending since 2008) should be adopted 
as a matter of priority. 
</b></p>
<p><b>80.  While PMSCs are generally seen as enhancing security, the example of 
Iraq demonstrates that such contractors may indeed increase insecurity amongst the 
local population. The Working Group reiterates that providing security to its people is 
a fundamental responsibility of the State. Outsourcing security creates risks for 
human rights and the Government of Iraq must remain vigilant and devote the 
necessary resources to ensure that PMSCs &#8211; whether international or Iraqi &#8211; are 
stringently regulated and that they respect the human rights of the Iraqi people. 
</b></p>
<p><b>81.  In light of the above observations, the Working Group recommends that 
the Government of Iraq: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Clarify as a matter of urgency the legal situation of PMSCs operating in the 
country and in particular whether any PMSCs are entitled to immunity, either 
under  CPA Order 17 or other agreements or legal instruments; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure the adoption of legislation on the regulation of PMSCs. The 
Government should also take the necessary steps to ensure its full 
implementation once the law is adopted; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Clarify as a matter of urgency whether all PMSCs operating in Iraq, including 
those that are supporting diplomatic missions, are subject to the licensing 
procedure of the Ministry of the Interior; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Continue its efforts to strengthen the monitoring and reporting mechanisms 
which have been put in place for PMSCs operating in the country, including 
vetting requirements for PMSC employees. The Government should also 
allocate sufficient resources to the Ministry of Interior which is in charge of 
these mechanisms; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/18/32/Add.4 
</b></p>
<p> <b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that CPA memorandum 17 and the regulations of the Ministry of the 
Interior concerning the licensing and regulation of PMSCs are applied in a 
non-discriminatory manner and are not used to target PMSC employees from 
particular regions; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Establish an independent, public and easy-to-access complaints mechanism 
through which the local population can report human rights violations 
involving PMSCs; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure prompt investigation of incidents involving casualties caused by PMSC 
employees, prosecution of those responsible and adequate remedies, including 
compensation, for the victims or their families; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Share with the relevant countries any information which might be relevant for 
the prosecution of PMSC employees involved in human rights violations in Iraq 
and request information on pending cases. The Government should also 
intervene with the relevant national authorities in order to encourage them to 
prosecute those PMSC employees responsible for human rights violations in 
Iraq, especially when these took place between 2003 and 2009; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Consider acceding to the 1989 International Convention against the 
Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Government is encouraged to seek the assistance of UNAMI in the 
implementation of these recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>82. The Working Group also makes the following recommendations to the 
international community, in particular to the United States: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Strengthen oversight mechanisms in any contracts with PMSCs, including 
vetting requirements for PMSC employees; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensure that PMSCs alleged to have been involved in human rights violations 
are fully investigated and that those responsible for such violations are 
promptly brought to justice, including for any violations that took place 
between 2003 and 2009. Where necessary, the relevant countries should request 
the cooperation of the Iraqi authorities in obtaining the information necessary 
to prosecute and secure convictions; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>In order to ensure that all citizens enjoy security, continue efforts to ensure 
that, particularly in conflict and post-conflict situations such as this one, 
priority is given to capacity-building activities and that national police forces 
are trained to respect human rights standards.
