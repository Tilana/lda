<p><b>Burundi 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication envoy&#233;e le 12 d&#233;cembre 2008 conjointement avec l&#8217;Expert ind&#233;pendant sur 
la situation des droits de l&#8217;homme au Burundi et la Rapporteuse sp&#233;ciale sur la vente 
d&#8217;enfants, la prostitution des enfants et la pornographie mettant en sc&#232;ne des enfants 
</b></p>
<p>2. Le titulaires de mandat de proc&#233;dures sp&#233;ciales ont adress&#233; une lettre d&#8217;all&#233;gation au 
Gouvernement du Burundi concernant la situation des personnes atteintes d&#8217;albinisme au 
Burundi et des cas r&#233;cents de violence contre ce groupe d&#8217;individus.  
</p>
<p>3. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, cinq personnes atteintes d&#8217;albinisme auraient &#233;t&#233; tu&#233;es au 
Burundi depuis septembre 2008. Ces personnes seraient cibl&#233;es pour leurs pouvoirs mystiques. 
Leurs membres ainsi que leur sang seraient revendus en Tanzanie, &#224; des fins de sorcellerie pour 
transmettre ces facult&#233;s. Dans les derniers &#233;v&#233;nements, une fille &#226;g&#233;e de six ans, dont l&#8217;identit&#233; 
est inconnue, a &#233;t&#233; tu&#233; &#224; Bweru, dans la province de Ruyigi, le 15 novembre 2008. Ses membres 
ont &#233;t&#233; enlev&#233;s et emmen&#233;s par les assaillants. En outre, une famille avec trois enfants albinos 
aurait &#233;t&#233; attaqu&#233;e le 17 novembre &#224; Cendajuru, dans la province de Cankuzo, mais a r&#233;ussi &#224; 
&#233;chapper &#224; l&#8217;attaque. En octobre, 24 albinos de la province de Ruyigi qui craignaient pour leur 
s&#233;curit&#233; se sont r&#233;fugi&#233;s dans la r&#233;sidence personnel du procureur de la R&#233;publique &#224; Ruyigi. Au 
d&#233;but novembre, ils auraient &#233;t&#233; transf&#233;r&#233;s temporairement &#224; une maison d&#8217;accueil s&#233;curis&#233;e par 
la police nationale. Outre les probl&#232;mes &#224; Ruyigi, des craintes auraient &#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;s par 
des albinos vivant dans d&#8217;autres r&#233;gions, en particulier aux provinces frontali&#232;res avec la 
Tanzanie.

</b></p>
<p>6. El Relator Especial, junto con la Representante Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los 
defensores de derechos humanos, el Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos 
y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas y el Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n y 
protecci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales en la lucha contra el 
terrorismo, envi&#243; un llamamiento urgente, se&#241;alando a la atenci&#243;n urgente del Gobierno la 
informaci&#243;n recibida en relaci&#243;n con la Sra. Patricia Roxana Troncoso Robles y otros presos 
mapuches que cumplen condenas de prisi&#243;n en la c&#225;rcel de Angol. 
</p>
<p>7. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas; los Sres. Jos&#233; Huenchunao Mari&#241;an, H&#233;ctor Llaitul 
Carrillanca, Jaime Marileo Saravia, Juan Millal&#233;n Milla y Patricia Roxana Troncoso Robles 
dieron inicio a una huelga de hambre seca el pasado 10 de octubre de 2007. Seg&#250;n las 
alegaciones, la huelga de hambre tendr&#237;a como objetivo, entre otros, denunciar la situaci&#243;n de los 
numerosos dirigentes y activistas mapuches condenados en los &#250;ltimos a&#241;os a penas de prisi&#243;n 
por actos de protesta asociados a reivindicaciones de derechos ind&#237;genas. El 8 de diciembre de 
2007, un equipo m&#233;dico independiente habr&#237;a emitido un informe sobre el estado de salud de los 
presos. Este informe habr&#237;a se&#241;alado que los presos se encontraban en un estado de salud cr&#237;tico, 
indicando p&#233;rdidas de peso de entre 13.4 y 22.6 Kg. El 15 de diciembre de 2007, al cabo de 
66 d&#237;as de huelga, los Sres. Jos&#233; Huenchunao, Jaime Marileo y Juan Millalen habr&#237;an 
abandonado la huelga de hambre, aceptando la mediaci&#243;n del Obispo de Temuco, Mons. Camilo 
Vial. El Sr. H&#233;ctor Llaitual y la Sra. Patricia Troncoso habr&#237;an decidido sin embargo continuar 
con la huelga de hambre. El 30 de diciembre de 2007, el Sr. H&#233;ctor Llaitual habr&#237;a desistido de la 
huelga de hambre ante la extrema gravedad de su estado de salud.  
</p>
<p>8. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, la Sra. Patricia Troncoso continuar&#237;a todav&#237;a en huelga 
de hambre. Seg&#250;n la revisi&#243;n del parte m&#233;dico independiente llevado a cabo el pasado 30 de 
diciembre de 2007, la Sra. Troncoso habr&#237;a perdido m&#225;s de 23 Kg., presentando un cuadro 
cl&#237;nico que indicar&#237;a un serio riesgo vital. Seg&#250;n las alegaciones, existe grave riesgo por la vida 
de la Sra. Patricia Troncoso tras 85 d&#237;as del inicio de su huelga de hambre, en particular teniendo 
en cuenta su delicado estado de salud como resultado de las huelgas de hambre emprendidas con 
anterioridad. 
</p>
<p>9. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, la Sra. Patricia Troncoso y el Sr. Jaime Marileo fueron 
condenados el 21 de agosto de 2004 a penas de 10 a&#241;os y un d&#237;a de prisi&#243;n por el supuesto delito 
de &#8220;incendio terrorista&#8221; en relaci&#243;n con el incendio del Fundo Poluco Pidenco, en aplicaci&#243;n de 
la Ley No. 18.314 (&#8220;Ley Antiterrorista&#8221;) que determina conductas terroristas y fija su penalidad. 
Los Sres. H&#233;ctor Llaitul y Jos&#233; Huenchunao fueron detenidos el 21 de febrero y el 20 de marzo 
del 2007 respectivamente, y se encuentran en prisi&#243;n para cumplir las condenas pronunciadas 
previamente en su ausencia en relaci&#243;n con los mismos hechos. El Sr. Jaime Marileo y la 
Sra. Patricia Troncoso participaron en una primera huelga de hambre iniciada junto con otros </p>

de promover las reformas legislativas necesarias para atender la situaci&#243;n de los presos 
mapuches cumpliendo condenas por supuestos delitos de terrorismo. El 15 de mayo de 2006, el 
Senador Navarro, junto con los Senadores Guido Girardi y Juan Pablo Letelier, habr&#237;a 
introducido en el Senado un proyecto de Ley &#8220;que permite conceder la libertad condicional a 
condenados por conductas terroristas y otros delitos, en causas relacionadas con reivindicaciones 
violentas de derechos consagrados en la Ley No. 19.253&#8221; (Bolet&#237;n 4188-07), que fue aprobado el 
17 de mayo de 2006 por la Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos del Senado y que desde entonces se 
encuentra en espera de tramitaci&#243;n parlamentaria. Dicho proyecto de ley, as&#237; como los proyectos 
de ley para la reforma de la Ley Antiterrorista presentados en mayo y julio de 2006 y tambi&#233;n 
pendientes de tramitaci&#243;n parlamentaria (Bolet&#237;n N&#176; 4199-07 y 4298-07, respectivamente) 
fueron objeto de la comunicaci&#243;n conjunta enviada por el Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de

<p>12. Mediante carta con fecha del 12 de marzo de 2008, la Misi&#243;n Permanente de Chile en 
Ginebra remiti&#243; la respuesta gubernamental a la carta m&#225;s arriba. La carta afirmaba que la 
Sra. Troncoso hab&#237;a puesto fin a una prolongada huelga de hambre el 26 de enero de 2008. 
Durante la duraci&#243;n de la huelga, el gobierno dijo haber adoptado las medidas necesarias para su

<p>15. El Relator Especial agradece al Gobierno de Chile por su respuesta a la comunicaci&#243;n

<p><b>Greece 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 20 July 2007 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on adequate 
housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living and the Independent 
expert on minority issues 
</b></p>
<p>16. On 20 July 2007, the Special Procedures mandate holders sent an allegation letter 
regarding information received on forced evictions of persons belonging to minority Roma 
communities in various locations around the country, including the city of Patras. The summary 
of this joint communication is contained in the communications report A/HRC/7/19/Add.1, 
paras. 34-39. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government sent on 26 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>17. In its reply, the Government stated that the integration of Roma into the society is a very 
complex, multi-faceted social problem which all European countries with a Roma population 
face. It can only be solved through the application of consistent efforts, financial support and a 
constructive attitude from all sides involved, including local societies and the Roma. Greek 
Roma, or Greek Gypsies, which is the term used in Greece by themselves in most cases are not 
registered separately from other Greek citizens, either during the national census, or in the 
municipal rolls. As a result, there is no precise official number of Roma populations as such. 
Some studies drawn up with a view to designing and implementing social actions and programs 
for the Roma indicate a population of approximately 250,000 to 300,000 persons all over Greece. 
The Government affirmed that Roma living in Greece are largely an integral part of the Greek 
population and they are protected against all forms of discrimination, by the Greek laws and the 
Constitution. They enjoy the same civil and political rights, they participate in Greek society, 
they organize themselves in associations, political parties, etc. Regarding the questions raised by 
the mandate holders, the Government provided the following information. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/36/Add.1 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Facts regarding the alleged forced evictions in Patras 
</b></p>
<p>18. According to recent data (field visit held on 14/04/2008 by the Public Health Directorate of 
the Region of Western Greece), the Municipality of Patras has one Roma settlement at the 
Riganokampos area, where 20 shacks and one prefabricated house exist. The members of the 
field visit team met with the people of the settlement who stated that those who have been 
granted a housing loan are already looking for a proper house to buy in order to move from the 
settlement. Based on the statistical data of the housing loans program (operated by the Ministry 
of the Interior) and the terms of the identification documents submitted (i.e. identity card, 
certificate of marital status, etc.) from 2002-2006, a total of 50 loans have been granted to an 
equal number of families residing permanently at or being registered with the Municipality of 
Patras. In 2007-2008, (second operation phase of the program), another 34 loans were also 
processed. Therefore, the number of families to have been granted a housing loan through the 
Municipality of Patras runs, to date, to a total of 84 families. It is necessary to note that the 
Ministry has issued and maintains a database with all necessary individual administrative 
documents for the qualification of the above-mentioned beneficiary families. We should take 
into consideration the fact that each application doesn&#8217;t always stand for one independent family. 
It should be pointed out that, for various reasons, many Roma/Gypsy families submitted more 
than one applications for housing loans per family (e.g. one application by the husband and 
another by the wife), not always to the same authorities, sometimes in spite of the fact that they 
have already been granted a housing loan (from the same project) in the past. Furthermore, in 
view of presenting quantity data on the number of the loans granted to Greek Gypsies, since the 
beginning of the program (2002-2008) and bearing in mind that the reference to the Roma 
&#8220;living in the greater area of Patras&#8221; lacks a precise geographical definition necessary for the 
retrieval of any such data, we herewith present the following statistical analysis based on 
research criteria related to &#8220;Patras greater area&#8221; and in particular. 
</p>
<p>19. Greek Gypsies with an affiliation to Patras (residing in or registered in) who applied for a 
loan at the Municipality of Patras or other municipalities, whether at the time of the submission 
of their application they were registered with the municipal rolls of Patras or other 
municipalities. 
</p>
<p>20. Greek Gypsies who submitted their application to a Municipality belonging to the greater 
area of Western Greece, bearing in mind that neither the loan nomination, nor any other 
provision restricts the settlement or even the use of the loan to the settling down to a particular 
region of the Greek territory. This has also been apparent from table 1, where it is shown that 
citizens of non-neighboring or adjacent municipalities to the Municipality of Patras submitted, 
however, their applications to the latter. According to the relevant figures it is noted that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 881 families registered in the municipal rolls of a municipality in the Region of 
Western Greece applied successfully for a loan to a number of municipalities within or 
out of that region (45 municipalities, including Patras). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; 866 families applied and got nominated for a loan through 33 different municipalities of 
Western Greece Region (including the Municipality of Patras). 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In Achaia Prefecture alone to which the Municipality of Patras belongs, 285 beneficiary 
families submitted an application to a Municipality falling within that territory. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/36/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Finally, it is stated that the above-mentioned Housing Loans Program addresses housing 
needs of all Greek Gypsies residing in the Greek territory, regardless of their religion or 
beliefs, and, to date, has granted a total of 6.984 loans to an equal number of gypsy 
families (beneficiaries). Among them, a total of 5.689 beneficiaries have disbursed their 
loans from the banks cooperating with the Program. The disparity between the loans 
granted and the disbursements is explained by the fact that the disbursement is 
processed upon the beneficiaries&#8217; responsibility and initiative. Practically, this means 
that the disbursal of the loan depends on the submission of the proper documentation for 
the house to be purchased/built/completed, by the interested persons to the bank. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Facts regarding alleged pattern of forced evictions of Roma in Greece 
</b></p>
<p>21. In the case of the Roma/Gypsies that used to live in shanks at the banks of Gallikos river, 
the solution has been given, as already pointed out in the Special Procedures&#8217; mandate holders&#8217; 
letter, by relocating them to a former military barracks (Gonos military camp). The municipal 
authorities have been improving the living conditions both in the camp and in the wider area 
outside the camp by performing infrastructure works (roads, electricity, medical - social services, 
playgrounds, etc.) In the case of the 200 Roma/Gypsies that used to live in shanks at the Olympic 
complex in Maroussi, Athens, they were relocated to rented homes where the rent was paid by 
the Municipality of Maroussi for an initial period of time and not indefinitely since lifetime 
payment of financial rental benefits to the Roma (in addition to those provided as social benefits 
for the whole population and, therefore, to the Roma too) only leads to a dangerous distortion of 
the State&#8217;s obligation toward the fighting against social exclusion and the equal treatment for all. 
Let alone that, in parallel, a housing loan program, guaranteed by the State budget, was offered 
to those interested; as a result, 21 out of the 34 applications submitted, were approved by the 
banks, that is, to all interested individuals that submitted the relevant documentation. As regards 
the case of the area of Votanikos, central Athens, where Albanian speaking Roma have settled 
arbitrarily on private property, a special Committee has been set up, by decision of the Secretary 
General for the District of Attica, due to the seriousness of the said case (the Roma/Gypsies 
being recognized as a socially vulnerable group). The Committee was set up under article 2 of 
the Amendment CP/23641 of the Sanitary Provision A5/696/25.4.83 on the organized settlement 
of itinerant populations (Official Gazette of the Hellenic Republic 973/B/15.7.03). The 
Committee, in its meeting of 5.3.08 expressed the view that the importance of the matter calls for 
the preparation of a study which, upon consideration of the specifications of the relevant 
ministerial decree as well as other sanitary parameters, shall recommend appropriate areas for the 
relocation of the Roma in question. Furthermore, the Municipality of Athens undertook to 
cooperate with the Union of Municipalities of the Wider District of Attica to prepare a draft 
recommendation for finding areas for the rehabilitation of the Roma. On a more general note, the 
case of Patras served as a priority and at the same time as a case study. In this context, with 
regard to the funds allocated for the establishment of a settlement for itinerant populations 
(regardless of nationality and thus for Albanian Roma too), bearing in mind that, to date, the 
effort made by the local and regional administration in western Greece didn&#8217;t achieve the 
desirable results, the Secretary General of the Ministry of Interior called for a [second] meeting 
in January 2008 (the first one took place in Nov. 2007) among the local relevant authorities 
(Region of Western Greece, Municipality of Patras) in order to speed up the process for the 
rehabilitation of the Romas in the wider area of Western Greece, The meeting&#8217;s scope was to 
renew the commitment undertaken by the local authorities in the past towards permanently </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/36/Add.1 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>addressing the situation. To this end, it was made clear that cooperation among all parties 
involved is necessary for maintaining as well as enhancing the efforts and measures of a 
temporary nature undertaken already (e.g. subsidy of rent, provision of school and social 
aid, etc.) It was also stressed that central administration remains supportive to the proposals the 
parties are going to come up with, on the condition that there will be full consensus by all parties 
concerned (i.e. the local authorities and the gypsies residing in the area.) In this context, the 
Ministry of Interior reiterated its commitment to grant the amount of 320.000&#8364; for the 
construction of the necessary infrastructures for the establishment of the above-mentioned 
settlement for temporary residing of itinerant populations. It is also worth noting that the 
Committee established to this end at regional level did not yield the results expected, since the 
proposals put forth by local authorities were not met with consensus by the parties concerned. 
Another meeting with similar objectives took place, late 2007, upon the initiative of the National 
Committee of Human Rights, where all parties concerned participated, such as Roma 
representatives, NGOs and representatives from central and local government. The local 
government bears the responsibility for addressing its local issues, based on the principles of 
subsidiarity and citizen&#8217;s proximity. To this end, we note the recent legislative reform on local 
government responsibilities (article 75, Law 3463/2006) with regard to the living conditions of 
their citizens. In this context, the central government undertakes all necessary financial and 
legislative measures for the proper support of the proposals made by local authorities. It should 
be made clear that the Ministry of the Interior stands ready to support with the necessary funds 
the commitments undertaken already by the local authorities, as well as their proposals aiming at 
the improvement of the existing living conditions in the area and at permanently addressing the 
rehabilitation issue in question. 
</p>
<p>22. In any case, as regards the implied alleged systematic infringement of the right to adequate 
housing and the existence of discriminatory acts or even failure to act due to discrimination, we 
would like to emphasize the following: 
</p>
<p> (a) Article 21&#167;4 of the Greek Constitution stipulates that |obtaining a house for those 
who lack of or who are inadequately housed is under the special care from the State.&#8221; However, 
this doesn&#8217;t imply &#8220;neither that everyone may demand from the State to provide him a house, nor 
that if someone doesn&#8217;t possess a house may by right occupy a private or public land&#8221; (see 
Chapman v. United Kingdom (2001) of the European Court of Human Rights). In other words, 
the obligation of the State should not be confused with the alleged right to encroach on other 
parties&#8217; rights whether these parties are individuals or the public sector. The Court goes on to say 
that &#8220;&#8230; even if [it involves people] of a particular racial origin or of other special characteristics, 
any such rights couldn&#8217;t be legally recognized. Claiming the right to housing, state subsidy or to 
encroach on foreign property on the pure basis that the claimant is for example of Rom origin 
constitutes a mere infringement of the principle of equal treatment for all at the expense of all the 
others&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (b) Detailed data on the projects implemented by the state to the benefit of the socially 
vulnerable group of Greek Gypsies have been supplied by previous communication (our Note 
Verbale ref. 6171.13/45/A5 1586 dated 28 July 2006). Nevertheless, selective reference to 
specific problematic situations by some seems to be part of an effort to try to establish an overall, 
deliberate, discriminatory attitude toward the group in question. For instance, the decrease of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/36/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>number of homeless people in particular settlements, such as the one in Patras, is often leading 
one to the hasty conclusion that this is the result of a racist policy and not the possible effect of 
the improvement of their living conditions (e.g. through the use of the housing loans offered and 
the transition to a different living status); 
</p>
<p> (c) Further on, while talking about insufficient state measures, it is worth mentioning the 
implied request for multiple parallel settlements for those deciding to be travelling within the 
territory (itinerant populations) due to temporary work as well as the selective reference to 
people who although already qualifying for a loan, they are presented as abandoned (by the state) 
to reside in settlements. Yet, the picture is slightly different if one takes into account, as an 
indication, the fact that names of representatives [and residents] of Riganokampos settlement (in 
Patras, Prefecture of Achaia), Ms. Maria Vasilari and Ms. Eleftheria Georgopoulou seem to be 
identical with particular name data of beneficiaries qualified for housing loans in neighboring 
municipalities also, both in the Prefectures of Achaia and Ilia; 
</p>
<p> (d) With regard to &#8220;forced evictions&#8221; in Greece, it is worth mentioning that eviction is 
closely related to the title-right to property. In that sense according to article 17&#167;2 of the Greek 
Constitution, and article 1&#167;2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 
article 1 of the first Optional Protocol of the European Convention on the Protection of Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms &#8220;... nobody may be deprived from his property unless for 
reasons of public interest which has been adequately proved as provided by law and on the 
precondition of former adequate compensation&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (e) In this context, it is inaccurate to use the term &#8220;unlawful eviction&#8221; when the relevant 
administrative act of expulsion comes in response to the unlawful occupancy of land and to the 
arbitrary and illegal settlement in tracts of land that are not owned by the occupants. Eviction, in 
the sense of the law, may be lawful in cases of: a. lack of property titles, b. illegal settlement in 
an area or c. of works of public interest concerning the property in question. In any case, the 
same legal framework applies to all citizens residing in the Greek territory, including Greek 
gypsies. It is evident that all citizens, including Greek Gypsies, have the right to appeal against 
administrative decisions before the courts. The cases in question refer to situations of lawful 
eviction or administrative removal from private or public lands. In such cases, anyhow, the 
Ministry of Interior tries to properly relocate the persons concerned, if possible in prior 
agreement with local authorities and those concerned, with a view to their permanent relocation; 
</p>
<p> (f) With regard to police behavior, it is to be noted that standard orders from the 
Hellenic Police Headquarters to all regional police departments are for absolute respect of one&#8217;s 
personality and their human rights and of equal treatment of all regardless of racial or ethnic 
origin, religious beliefs, disabilities, age or sexual orientation. Those orders are based on article 4 
of the Greek Constitution, they are within the framework of Law 3303/2005 on &#8220;equal treatment 
regardless of racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, disabilities, age or sexual orientation&#8221; and 
article 5&#167;3,4 of the Presidential Degree 254/2004 on &#8220;Policemen Professional Ethics Code&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>23. In conclusion, the success of the measures undertaken by the State should not be reduced 
to mere budget allocations or to participation in decision-making bodies; it necessitates the 
political will of all parties concerned, as well as the unanimous action from a wide range of 
Roma collective bodies. In light of those mentioned above, the state does not wish to deny its 
own obligations and responsibilities and does not consider that all measures taken so far have </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/36/Add.1 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>yielded the anticipated results. It fully recognizes the need for combating any form of social 
exclusion and it deploys considerable efforts to this end. However, a number of positive 
measures and actions have been implemented. The attached Integrated Action Plan has entered, 
since 2005, its second phase of the implementation process. The overall aim is to encourage and 
promote Romas/Gypsies; inclusion in the Greek society, in terms of equity and active 
participation in all aspects and spheres of daily life.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government&#8217;s detailed response and for the 
information provided concerning specific actions to promote the inclusion of the Roma 
community in Greek society. The Special Rapporteur notes that public policies directed to the 
Roma community should bear in mind General Recommendation XXVII of the Committee on 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, particularly paragraph 31 in relation to adequate 
housing, in which the Committee recommended States &#8220;[t]o act firmly against any 
discriminatory practices affecting Roma, mainly by local authorities and private owners, with 
regard to taking up residence and access to housing; to act firmly against local measures denying 
residence to and unlawful expulsion of Roma, and to refrain from placing Roma in camps 
outside populated areas that are isolated and without access to health care and other facilities.&#8221; 
</p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 25 January 2008 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Special Procedures mandate holders sent an allegation letter concerning 
Mr. <b>Panayote Dimitras</b>, spokesperson for the Greek Helsinki Monitor and a member of the 
OMCT Assembly of Delegates, Ms. <b>Andrea Gilbert</b>, GHM&#8217;s specialist on anti-Semitism, and 
Messrs. <b>Moses Konstantinis</b>, <b>Benjamin Albala</b>, <b>Abraham Reitan</b> and <b>Leon Gavriilidis</b>, four 
members of the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece (<i>Kentriko Israilitiko 
Symvoulio </i>- KIS). 
</p>
<p>26. According to the information received, the aforementioned persons testified against 
Mr. Kostas Plevris on 4 December 2007 during a trial against him and the extreme-right 
newspaper Eleftheros Kosmos which had published articles from Mr. Plevris&#8217; anti-Semitic book 
entitled The Jews - The whole truth. In the book, Mr. Plevris reportedly alleges that &#8220;Jews are 
sub-human, mortal enemies and worthy of the firing squad&#8221;, that &#8220;Hitler is only criticized for not 
clearing Europe of the Jews&#8221; and that &#8220;[Auschwitz] is rightly preserved in good condition, 
because nobody knows what might happen in the future&#8221;. Mr. Plevris was convicted of 
&#8216;incitement to racial violence and hatred and for racial insult&#8217; and was reportedly given 
a 14-month suspended sentence. 
</p>
<p>27. Following the trial on 4 December, Mr. Dimitras was verbally abused by a journalist who 
reportedly tried to assault him. Later that evening, a video showing the attempted assault was 
uploaded on the internet with messages inciting viewers to take action against Mr. Dimitras. 
Threatening messages have also been found on fora linked to extremist right movements in 
Greece. Mr. Plevris has also reportedly taken legal action against the aforementioned, accusing </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/36/Add.1 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>them of defamation. Further complaints have been filed by Mr. Plevris against GHM and NGOs 
in general reportedly claiming they are redundant, illegal and implying they are foreign agents. It 
is alleged that these complaints again contain racist and defamatory comments; however trial 
dates have reportedly been set for later in 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government dated 18 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>28. In its response, the Government informed that Mr. Plevris was sentenced by the Court of 
Appeals of Athens to fourteen months of imprisonment, with suspension, on the grounds that he 
&#8220;publicly and intentionally incited, through the press, the commission of acts and activities 
conducive to discrimination, hatred and violence against persons and groups of persons, on the 
sole basis of their racial and national origin, while at the same time expressed ideas which are 
insulting against a group of persons due to their racial and national origin, namely the Jews.&#8221; 
The Government expressed that this sentence was in conformity with the Greek 
constitution and Law No. 927 of 1979 which criminalizes acts or activities aiming at 
racial discrimination. 
</p>
<p>29. The Government also noted that in the case against Mr. Plevris, the prosecution for 
anti-Semitic propaganda took place <i>proprio motu</i> in application of the provisions of the 
above-mentioned law.  
</p>
<p>30. The Government further informed that there is no information with regard to Mr. Dimitras&#8217; 
claims about verbal attacks and threats against him as described in the letter sent by the Special 
Procedures mandate holders, and that no relevant complaint has been filed to the Greek 
competent authorities. 
</p>
<p>31. The Government also provided information concerning two lawsuits and complaints filed 
by Mr. Plevris in order to restore the moral damage which he claims to have suffered due to the 
alleged malicious defamation to his person by Mr. P. Dimitras and others mentioned in the 
communication sent by the Special Procedures mandate holders. The basis of these lawsuits 
would be that the above-mentioned persons testified against him in his trial and, as he claims, 
systematically and publicly support views in a manner which constitutes an insult against his 
personality. The Government informed that these cases are still pending. 
</p>
<p>32. The first lawsuit was filed by Mr. Plevris on 12 January 2007 against 
Mr. Moses Konstantinis, Mr. Benjamin Albala, Mr. Abraham Reitan, Mr. Leon Gavriilidis, 
Ms. Andrea Gilbert and Mr. Panayote Dimitras. The case was scheduled to be discussed on 
24 January 2008 but the court decided not to go ahead with the case. The second lawsuit was 
filed by Mr. Plevris on 25 January 2007 against Mr. Dimitras and the Greek Helsinki 
Monitor. The case was scheduled to be discussed on 7 February 2008, but the defendants did 
not appear and a request for postponement was filed. The case is now to be tried 
on 10 October 2009. 
</p>
<p>33. The Government further reiterated that it is the right of any Greek citizen to launch judicial 
proceedings and this cannot in any way be considered as a judicial harassment. </p>

</b></p>
<p>35. In 2007, the Special Procedures mandate holders sent an allegation letter to the 
Government concerning allegations of violence against Dalit women in India (see 
A/HRC/7/19/Add.1, paras. 64-70). 
</p>
<p><b>Response from the Government sent on 29 April 2008 
</b></p>
<p>36. In its response, the Government noted that the communication sent by the Special 
Procedures mandate holders did not include any information on the places of occurrence of these 
cases. The Government requested that details pertaining to place of occurrence of each case be 
provided to facilitate investigations by authorities. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of India for its letter 
dated 29 April 2008 but regrets that the Government failed to address the general situation of 
Dalits and in particular Dalit women in India. The communication makes reference to the general 
descent-based discrimination that Dalit women and men suffer, the lack of proper 
implementation of existing legislation as well as the lack of police and judicial action to protect 
the rights of Dalits. In addition, the mandate holders referred to a large number of cases in the 
communication in order to illustrate the extent and variety of allegations of violence against 
Dalit women in India. In most cases the name of the victim(s), the alleged perpetrator(s) as well 
as in some cases, the location of the incident, were reported. However, it was not possible to 
provide the full details of each individual case, either because the victims did not wish to reveal 
their full identity for privacy or safety concerns or because the source providing the information 
did not have the full details for each of the cases. While it is not excluded that each of these cases 
be subsequently addressed on a case by case basis, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government 
of India to provide information regarding the measures taken to guarantee the rights and 
freedoms of the Dalits. 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur would also like to make reference to the report presented by his 
predecessor at the 7th session of the Human Rights Council where he analyzed the issue of 
discrimination on the grounds of caste (see A/HRC/7/19, paras. 69-71) and stated that &#8220;the main 
human rights bodies working in the area of racism and discrimination have stated clearly that 
prohibition of this type of discrimination falls within the scope of existing instruments, in 
particular the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination&#8221;. In particular, reference was made to General Recommendation XXIX (2002) of 
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which strongly reaffirms that </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/36/Add.1 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>&#8220;discrimination based on &#8216;descent&#8217; includes discrimination against members of communities 
based on forms of social stratification such as caste and analogous systems of inherited status 
which nullify or impair their equal enjoyment of human rights&#8221;. 
<b>Communications sent on 5 November 2008 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteurs sent an allegation letter concerning the eruption of violence 
between the Bodo tribal and the Muslim communities in the Indian state of Assam. According to 
the information received, the violence between these two communities started on Friday 
3 October 2008. The incidents that sparked this wave of violence remain unclear, yet there have 
been long running tensions between the two communities.  
</p>
<p>40. Despite the important number of paramilitary officers deployed by the Government and the 
imposition of a curfew, mobs from both communities armed with machetes and knives continue 
to fuel violence between the two communities in the districts of Udalguri, Darrang and Baksa. 
As a result of the communal violence, reportedly more than 50 people were killed, more than 
500 houses were burnt and more than 80&#8217;000 people, both from the Bodo and the Muslim 
communities have been forced to flee out of their village and to seek shelter in camps set up by 
the Government. To counteract the communal violence, the government of the Indian state of 
Assam has issued shoot on sight orders to the security forces. Indeed, 25 of the more 
than 50 victims mentioned above, were reportedly killed by police fire.

<p><b>Urgent appeal sent on 23 May 2008 jointly with the Independent Expert on minority issues

</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Procedures mandate holders sent an urgent appeal regarding the attacks 
against a Roma settlement in the outskirts of Naples and Milan and the arrest of hundreds of 
undocumented migrants in security raids by law enforcement agencies. According to the 
information received, on 13 May 2008, approximately 60 people attacked Roma settlements in 
the outskirts of Naples, using homemade incendiary devices to set fire to tents and houses. On 
the same day, four Molotov cocktails were thrown at a Roma camp in Novarra, near Milan. Two 
other Roma encampments were set alight on 14 May 2008 in Ponticelli, near Naples. In the 
streets of Ponticelli, for several weeks prior to the riots, signs inciting racial hatred against Roma 
had been posted, which the police failed to act upon. In Trieste, the local administration cut 
provision of water and electricity to a Sinti camp, apparently in an attempt to force them to leave. 
</p>
<p>47. During that same period, several officials belonging to the Northern League made strong 
anti-immigrant statements. The Minister of Interior, Mr. Roberto Maroni, is reported to have 
stated publicly on 11 May 2008 that &#8220;all Roma camps will have to be dismantled right away, and 
the inhabitants will be either expelled or incarcerated&#8221;. Milan Deputy Mayor Riccardo de Corato 
stated that he wanted to institute a numerus clausus on the number of Roma in Milan.  
</p>
<p>48. In parallel, from 12 to 14 May 2008, throughout Italy hundreds of undocumented 
migrants - including 50 Roma living in a camp in Rome - have been arrested, registered and 
fingerprinted. It has been reported that these measures were taken by law enforcement agencies 
for the purposes of the migrants&#8217; expulsion from Italy. 
</p>
<p>49. On 21 May 2008, the Council of Ministers adopted a package of new measures in the area 
of public security. The proposed measures would, among others, criminalize illegal immigration 
and allow for immigrants to be held in so-called centres for identification and expulsion for a 
period of up to 18 months. In addition, the measures would make expulsions easier, restrict 
family reunification and allow for the confiscation of apartments rented to irregular migrants. 
The package also appears to include a declaration of a state of emergency, which would serve to 
deal with what is described as &#8220;the critical situation which has arisen in Campania, Lombardia 
and Lazio in relation to the presence of numerous irregular non-EU citizens and nomads living in 
these areas&#8221;.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>Reply from the Government dated 4 August 2008 
</b></p>
<p>50. In its response the Government highlighted that the stigmatization of certain ethnic or 
social groups is of serious concern for the Government, state and local authorities. It noted that 
all political forces have firmly condemned all recent attacks against particular groups and will 
continue to exercise the responsibility to protect all persons present on the Italian territory, as 
clearly emphasized by the Head of State, Hon. Giorgio Napolitano, on 2 June 2008, on the 
occasion of Italy&#8217;s National Day. The Government stated that it is the responsibility of central 
and local authorities to guarantee the security and the public order throughout the country. The 
Government further reiterated that Police controls in Roma camps are carried out only in full 
compliance with the Law in force. The criminal investigation police carries out these controls 
when individuals are caught red-handed or by motivated decree of the judicial authorities; or 
upon decision by the local Head of the Police Headquarters (<i>Questore</i>) who issues <i>ad hoc</i> orders, 
to be considered within the framework of the activities planned jointly with the Prefectura 
(<i>Prefettura</i>) and often with the municipalities concerned. The Government also provided the 
following information regarding specific events described in the letter by the mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>51. &#8220;Ponticelli (Naples): On Saturday, May 10, 2008, in Naples, a young Roma girl was 
arrested on a charge of illegally entering a private flat in Principe di Napoli street close to the 
Roma camp located in Malibran street, in the suburban district of Ponticelli, where she tried 
abducting a baby, six months old. This attempted abduction provoked a reaction by people 
residing in Ponticelli who, on the following night, threw incendiary bottles against another Roma 
settlement in Petri street resulting in the destruction of some shanties. The situation of public 
order got woke on Tuesday, May 13, when, during the shooting of a national broadcast (RAI) 
programme &#8220;La vita in diretta&#8221;, hundreds of people grew in the main streets of the district 
making road blocks, while a group of residents tried penetrating the Roma settlement located in 
Malibran street. The quick intervention of the police forces prevented the opposing factions from 
getting in touch with each other, but unfortunately it was impossible avoiding stones hurling 
against the Roma. 
</p>
<p>52. In the evening, thanks to the darkness and despite the watch services placed by the police, 
suspicious characters succeeded in setting fire both to some shanties within the Malibran street 
settlement, close to Argine street, and to a dismissed building - the former premises of the mental 
hospital &#8220;Tropeano&#8221; - located in De Meis street, that had been occupied without permission by 
five/six Roma families, then moved away before the fire has started. On the afternoon of 
Wednesday, May 14, about fifty people, mostly women, made a road block close to one of the 
various Roma settlements in Ponticelli, where some Roma families were still waiting for being 
moved to another place by the Napes Municipality. Furthermore, within the Calibra street Roma 
settlement, already totally evacuated, some shelters were partially set on fire by unknown 
persons that the police forces patrolling the area put to flight. The same police forces, having 
been reported by a cameraman who witnessed the fact, found two incendiary bottles that bad 
been hidden not far from the Malibran street Roma settlement. Within one of the settlements, 
two young men have been caught by the police and then seized while trying to steal a double 
current generator&#8221;. Finally, on Thursday, May 15, around 9.00 a.m., unknown persons set fire to 
some shanties and household goods with the abandoned camp of Virginia Woolf Street. Thanks 
to the intervention of the Fire Brigade the fire was put off at 11:30 a.m.&#8221; </p>

</p>
<p>53. The Government also provided detailed information concerning the general conditions of 
life for Roma in the Ponticelli district of Naples. The Government stated that within seven 
unauthorized Roma settlements, &#8220;Roma communities live in a degraded social environment with 
various indicators of social deviance and in lack of considerable signs of integration. While the 
householders are mainly engaged with retail trade, collection of various material and building 
works, the other components are usually engaged with begging and typical forms of crime such 
as thefts in houses, shops that leave a mark on the citizens&#8217; perception of security&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>54. The Government also informed that particular protection measures were taken by law 
enforcement authorities in order to guarantee the safety of the Roma community in the Ponticelli 
district.  
</p>
<p>55. The Government also provided information concerning events in Milan and Trieste. 
</p>
<p>56. &#8220;Milan: the unauthorized Bovisasca Roma camp lays on an area between Milan Northern 
Train Station (Bovisa Politecnico) and Boviasca street/Candian street railroad, property of the 
Milan Municipality. The soil was found contaminated by arsenic, hydrocarbons and other heavy 
metals by health authorities (ARPA and ASL). The population of the camp has been increasingly 
growing ant it was estimated as close to 300 individuals at the end of 2007 (mostly of Romanian 
nationality). Following a Police intervention in neighbouring area, the number of presences 
doubled (nearly 750 people) and the living conditions became unbearable, enough for the 
authorities to decide to move the inhabitants and proceed with a reclamation. In March 2008, 
following the decision by the Board of Governors of the Municipality, the Municipal Police, in 
cooperation with State Police, entered the camp and demolished the shacks, checking over 
114 people (5 of them, being expulsed according to the provisions of Legislative 
Decree 2007/10). At the beginning of April, a second Police operation was held, so that the 
remaining shack were demolished and further 205 Roma were identified. These operations, 
therefore, responded to the need to manage a social emergency and to protect the health of the 
Roma community. On May 15, 2008 a further intervention took place, when unidentified persons 
threw a Molotov Cocktail against a disused shop in Morosini Street, illegally occupied as a 
dormitory by two Romanian nationals. On the following day the Police took into custody an 
Italian citizen, unemployed and previous offender, who, together with others, was alleged of the 
crime based on racist motivations.

<p>57. Trieste: the unauthorized Pietraferrata Street camp is located in the southern outskirts of 
Trieste, property of the Trieste Municipality and it was settled in 1999. Recent controls verified 
that it lodges only 27 people (7 families) who are Italian citizens belonging to the Roma ethnic 
Group. Since it was never authorized by the Municipality, many inhabiting were condemned for 
illegal occupation in 2003, while many of them had been also condemned for crimes against 
property in other occasions. On March 1, 2008, the electricity company ACEGAS, which 
provided the camp with water end electricity, turned off the utility (temporarily activated on a 
forfeit basis for settlements such as circuses and itinerant performers). Due to the intervention of 
the Prefect - requesting ACEGAS through the Municipality to reinstate the service for 
humanitarian reasons - the company reactivated the supply of water and electricity, even if on 
May 5 it was again interrupted The municipal administration is trying to figure out a permanent 
solution to the problem&#8221;.  </p>

<p>58. Finally, the Government also provided information regarding the &#8220;security package&#8221; that 
contains new measures on immigration. It stated that, among other ends, the package aims at 
addressing more effectively the phenomenon of illegal immigration as well as its connection 
with ordinary and organized crime. The Government stated that the measures included in the 
&#8220;security package&#8221; are intended to curb criminal behaviours of individuals and no provision at 
all is envisaged against any community, group or class nor is linked to any form of 
discrimination and xenophobia. The Government explained that only one of five bills within the 
&#8220;security package&#8221; had come into force as of 25 July 2008, called &#8220;Urgent measures concerning 
public order&#8221;. This law has some immigration-related provisions, including the return of aliens 
by court decision if sentenced to a term of more than 2 years or convicted of crimes against the 
personality of the State. The expulsion has to be validated by the peace justice (<i>giudice di pace</i>) 
within 48 hours, during which time the foreigner may be held in a Centre for Identification and 
expulsion. Other provisions of the law include: the rental to irregular migrants is subject to a 
sentence ranging from 6 months to three years&#8217; imprisonment and to the seizure of the rented 
property; the punishment for those who employ irregular migrants is raised and ranges from 
6 months to 3 years in addition to a fee of 5,000 euros. The Government stated that these 
provisions do not appear to contrast with international human rights law, particularly article 13 
of the ICCPR. 
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Italy for its detailed reply to his 
communication of 18 October 2007. The Special Rapporteur continues to follow the situation 
closely, in particular with regards to the implementation of the legislation that composes the 
&#8220;security package&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur warns against sweeping statements that associate members of 
certain minorities to criminal behavior or social deviance, which contribute to further stigmatize 
such groups rather than promoting effective alternatives for social inclusion. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur wishes to make reference to the press release issued by his 
predecessor along with the Independent Expert on minority issues and the Special Rapporteur on 
the human rights of migrants on 15 July 2008 expressing serious concern about recent actions, 
declarations and proposed measures targeting the Roma community and migrants in Italy. The 
mandate holders expressed extreme concern about the proposal made by the Ministry of Interior 
to fingerprint all Roma individuals, including children, in order to identify those undocumented 
persons living in Italy, stating that this proposal can be unambiguously classified as 
discriminatory by targeting exclusively the Roma minority. The mandate holders also expressed 
dismay at the aggressive and discriminatory rhetoric used by political leaders, including Cabinet 
members, which in their view created an overall environment of hostility, antagonism and 
stigmatization of the Roma community among the general public. 
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to make reference to the mission report of his 
predecessor following his visit to Italy in October 2006, which was presented to the 4th session 
of the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/4/19/Add.4). He wishes to recall in particular the 
following recommendations: the recognition of the Roma and Sinti as national minorities, the 
adoption of a comprehensive national policy towards these communities, in particular to address </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/36/Add.1 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>their poor housing conditions, lack of documents, high dropouts of their children and their 
difficulties in accessing employment. The Special Rapporteur also refers to his recommendation 
that Roma and Sinti should be among the priority beneficiary groups of social inclusion policies. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur also notes that public policies directed to the Roma community 
should bear in mind General Recommendation XXVII of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination, particularly paragraph 31 in relation to adequate housing, in which the 
Committee recommended States &#8220;[t]o act firmly against any discriminatory practices affecting 
Roma, mainly by local authorities and private owners, with regard to taking up residence and 
access to housing; to act firmly against local measures denying residence to and unlawful 
expulsion of Roma, and to refrain from placing Roma in camps outside populated areas that are 
isolated and without access to health care and other facilities.&#8221;

Persons 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Procedures mandate holders sent an urgent appeal concerning allegations 
that 147 Chechen families who have been displaced to Ingushetia and Dagestan returned to the 
Chechen capital of Grozny. They reportedly had not yet found a durable solution and were at risk 
of being forcefully evicted from their accommodation. According to the information received, on 
10 January 2008, these 147 families who are living in a temporary accommodation centre at 
4 Vyborgskaia Street in Grozny, were reportedly told by officials that they had to leave their 
accommodation at short notice. Some inhabitants were reportedly told that they should leave 
before the end of January and officials allegedly threatened to cut off the electricity and gas if 
they did not leave. It was reported that inhabitants of many other temporary accommodation 
centres in Grozny were also being told to leave. Those affected have reportedly not been 
consulted and no adequate alternative accommodation had been foreseen for their relocation.  
</p>
<p><b>Reply from the Government dated 31 December 2008 
</b></p>
<p>65. At the time this report was finalized, the Special Rapporteur was not in a position to reflect 
the content of the reply from the Government of the Russian Federation dated 31 December 2007 
as he had not received the translation of its content from the relevant services. 
</p>
<p><b>South Africa 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent on 5 November 2008 jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
human rights of migrants 
</b></p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteurs sent an allegation letter concerning the murder of a Somali 
national, Ms. Sahra Omar Farah, and her three children in a village in the Eastern Cape. 
According to the information received, on 3 October 2008, Ms. Farah, her 19 and 14 year-old 
sons and her 12 year-old daughter were stabbed to death in a shop run by other Somalis in a 
village in the Eastern Cape. Ms. Farah was reportedly stabbed over 100 times in what has been </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/36/Add.1 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>characterized as a xenophobic attack. According to reports, both female victims may have been 
subjected to sexual assaults. Three other Somali merchants were allegedly killed in Johannesburg 
and Port Elizabeth since 3 October. These acts follow a wave of violent attacks faced by 
foreigners in South Africa last May 2008, targeting particularly migrants and refugees who had 
moved to South Africa fleeing the dire conditions in their countries of origin. In this regard, 
concern was expressed that the murder of Ms. Farah and her family reflect a pattern of 
xenophobic violence in South Africa over the recent months.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no reply to this communication had been received at 
the time this report was finalized. The Special Rapporteur would also like to make reference to 
the press release issued by his predecessor on 30 May 2008, in which he expressed distress at the 
xenophobic violence targeting refugees, migrants and South African ethnic minorities in 
Johannesburg and surrounding townships, claiming the lives of over forty people. The former 
Special Rapporteur took note of the efforts of the Government of South Africa to address the 
crisis and called upon authorities not only to carry out a thorough investigation of the acts of 
violence in order to bring the perpetrators to justice and prevent the spread of atrocities, but also 
to stimulate a collective reflection on the root causes of these phenomena.

<p><b>Carta de alegaciones enviada el 24 de enero de 2008 juntamente con el Relator Especial 
sobre los derechos humanos de los migrantes 
</b></p>
<p>68. Los relatores especiales enviaron una carta de alegaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con una menor de 
nacionalidad ecuatoriana que habr&#237;a sido v&#237;ctima de agresiones f&#237;sicas y verbales de contenido 
xen&#243;fobo y racista en Barcelona. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el ataque se habr&#237;a producido el 
martes d&#237;a 7 de octubre en un tren de la l&#237;nea ferroviaria de la Generalitat de Catalu&#241;a en el 
trayecto de Plaza Espa&#241;a a Martorell, poco antes de llegar a la estaci&#243;n de &#8216;Colonia G&#252;ell&#8217;, 
donde el agresor descendi&#243; del tren. S.X M. M., un joven de 21 a&#241;os, de nacionalidad espa&#241;ola, 
se habr&#237;a fijado en la menor de nacionalidad ecuatoriana que viajaba sola. Se acerc&#243; a ella y, sin 
dejar de hablar en ning&#250;n momento por el tel&#233;fono m&#243;vil, le insult&#243; y le amenaz&#243; de muerte. 
Posteriormente se lanz&#243; contra la chica ecuatoriana a la que golpear&#237;a varias veces al tiempo que 
continuaba profiriendo insultos racistas y xen&#243;fobos hacia la menor. 
</p>
<p>69. Tras insultarla y gritarle al o&#237;do varias veces que se marchara a su pa&#237;s, el presunto agresor 
comenz&#243; a golpearla cada vez con m&#225;s agresividad, llegando incluso a propinarle patadas en la 
cara, hasta que el tren par&#243; y el presunto agresor se baj&#243; de &#233;l, mientras continuaba profiriendo 
insultos de contenido racista. La Audiencia de Barcelona habr&#237;a decidido mantener la situaci&#243;n 
de libertad provisional sin fianza para el joven que agredi&#243; a la chica ecuatoriana, tras haber 
desestimado los recursos en contra del Ministerio Fiscal y de la v&#237;ctima. 
</p>
<p><b>Respuesta del Gobierno enviada el 31 de marzo de 2008 
</b></p>
<p>70. En su respuesta, el Gobierno confirm&#243; que el 7 de octubre de 2007 un hombre joven 
agredi&#243; e insult&#243; a otra pasajera de 16 a&#241;os de edad y nacionalidad ecuatoriana, que viajaba sola. 
Despu&#233;s de la agresi&#243;n, la joven solicit&#243; auxilio al tel&#233;fono de emergencias, siendo atendida por </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/36/Add.1

</p>
<p>la Guardia Civil. Desde ese momento la Guarda Civil inici&#243; gestiones para localizar al autor de 
los hechos, que culminaron con su detenci&#243;n a la entrada de su domicilio el d&#237;a 19 siguiente. El 
detenido pas&#243; a disposici&#243;n del Juzgado de Instrucci&#243;n y justific&#243; sus actos diciendo que estaba 
embriagado y que nunca hab&#237;a tenido comportamientos racistas, lo que desmentir&#237;an 
posteriormente la v&#237;ctima y un testigo.  
</p>
<p>71. La titular del Juzgado de Primera Instancia e Instrucci&#243;n n. 2 de Sant Boi de Llobregat dej&#243; 
en libertad con cargos al joven porque la parte acusadora no pidi&#243; ninguna otra medida, como la 
prisi&#243;n provisional. Seg&#250;n fuentes del Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Catalu&#241;a, el fiscal no 
asisti&#243; a la declaraci&#243;n del imputado y la familla de la menor renunci&#243; a ser representada por un 
abogado, motivo por lo que al juez no tuvo otra opci&#243;n que dejarle en libertad. 
</p><p>72. No obstante y con posterioridad, la Fiscalia recurri&#243; y pidi&#243; el arresto del imputado por 
considerar que exist&#237;a riesgo de fuga y para proteger a la menor. Sin embargo, la juez no acept&#243; 
estos argumentos en base a que el imputado tiene arraigo social y est&#225; en paro, por lo que no 
tiene medios para huir. Igualmente, la juez cree suficientes las medidas cautelares adoptadas 
hasta la celebraci&#243;n del juicio: prohibici&#243;n de acercarse a la joven, prohibici&#243;n de abandonar las 
localidades de Santa Coloma de Cervell&#243;, en la que &#233;l reside, y de Sant Boi de Liobregat. 
Tambi&#233;n se le proh&#237;be viajar en la l&#237;nea S8, en la que se produjo la agresi&#243;n, y se le ordena que 
se persone dos veces al d&#237;a ante la Polic&#237;a Municipal de Santa Coloma de Cervell&#243; y cada quince 
d&#237;as en el juzgado. 
73. La v&#237;ctima declar&#243; en el juzgado el dia 25 por la ma&#241;ana, ratificando los extremos 
recogidos en el atestado policial. El forense considera la posibilidad de que sufra un shock 
postraum&#225;tico como consecuencia de la agresi&#243;n, por lo que se le ha ofrecido el oportuno 
tratamiento.
