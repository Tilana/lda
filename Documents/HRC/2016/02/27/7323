<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review , established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twenty-first session 
</p>
<p>from 19 to 30 January 2015. The review of Spain was held at the 5th meeting on 21 January 
</p>
<p>2015. The delegation of Spain was headed by Ignacio Yb&#225;&#241;ez, Secretary of State for 
</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs. At its 10th meeting held on 23rd January 2015, the Working Group 
</p>
<p>adopted the report on Spain. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Spain: the former Yugoslav Republic of 
</p>
<p>Macedonia, Sierra Leone and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Spain: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation prepared in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/21/ESP/1); 
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/21/ESP/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/ESP/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Germany, the 
</p>
<p>Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland was transmitted to Spain through the troika. Those questions are available 
</p>
<p>on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of Spain considered that the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review was an essential tool for assessing human rights policies and laws and a 
</p>
<p>mechanism for dialogue between States on their commitment to the universal system of 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation recalled that Spain had ratified most human rights instruments and 
</p>
<p>optional protocols, submitted all its reports to the treaty bodies and extended an open 
</p>
<p>invitation to the special procedures. Since its first UPR, Spain had received visits from four 
</p>
<p>special procedures. 
</p>
<p>7. The drafting of the national report was intended as an exercise in self-criticism&#8212;an 
</p>
<p>essential element of the UPR&#8212;and included the participation of ministries and other public 
</p>
<p>institutions, and civil society. The suggestions from civil society were extremely useful to 
</p>
<p>better understand how laws and policies promoted by the Government were perceived. The 
</p>
<p>national human rights institution, the Defensor del Pueblo, also participated in the process 
</p>
<p>as an observer. 
</p>
<p>8. The national report focused, primarily, on the recommendations received in 2010&#8212;
</p>
<p>previously addressed in the voluntary interim report submitted in 2012&#8212;and on the 
</p>
<p>developments and events of recent years, particularly the fiscal adjustment undertaken to 
</p>
<p>counter the global economic and financial crisis, which still had significant repercussions. </p>


<p>The delegation recalled that the Government had taken into account the criteria established 
</p>
<p>by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regarding adjustment measures, 
</p>
<p>which should be proportionate, provisional, necessary and not be regressive or 
</p>
<p>discriminatory. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation went on to describe some of the main themes of the national report. 
</p>
<p>It mentioned, at the institutional level, the establishment of hate crime and discrimination 
</p>
<p>departments in each of the provincial prosecutor&#8217;s offices in Spain. It also highlighted the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the post of National Rapporteur on human trafficking to improve 
</p>
<p>coordination among the various institutions involved. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation stressed that, at the legislative level, the ongoing reform of the penal 
</p>
<p>code would lead to significant developments in the human rights field. For instance, the 
</p>
<p>reform would criminalize forced marriage, strengthen the protection of victims of gender 
</p>
<p>violence, amend the definition of sexual exploitation and forced prostitution and strengthen 
</p>
<p>the protection of children against offences affecting their sexual freedom. The reform 
</p>
<p>would also define the crime of enforced disappearance as a separate offence. 
</p>
<p>11. Regarding the implementation of the recommendations received in 2010, the 
</p>
<p>delegation noted that the Government intended to adopt, further to consultations, a new 
</p>
<p>national human rights plan with a longer time span, making it a State policy. Furthermore, 
</p>
<p>since its first UPR, Spain had adopted, implemented or advanced the development of 
</p>
<p>various specific plans such as the Strategic Plan on Equality of Opportunity for the period 
</p>
<p>2014&#8211;2016. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation considered that the eradication of gender-based violence would only 
</p>
<p>be achieved through the fight for equality. Spain had established a data-collecting system 
</p>
<p>on gender-based violence that was considered to be a model and the Government 
</p>
<p>maintained a zero tolerance policy on gender-based violence. 
</p>
<p>13. An important group of recommendations received in 2010 related to racial 
</p>
<p>discrimination and xenophobia. The delegation stated that Spain had adopted, in November 
</p>
<p>2011, the Comprehensive Strategy against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and 
</p>
<p>Related Forms of Intolerance. A Map of Discrimination in the country was being 
</p>
<p>developed, to improve data collection and official statistics regarding incidents and crimes 
</p>
<p>involving discrimination. The training of State security forces had been enhanced, to assist 
</p>
<p>them in identifying racist and xenophobic incidents. An independent department providing 
</p>
<p>assistance for victims of discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin had also been 
</p>
<p>established.  
</p>
<p>14. The delegation stated that the migrant holding centres were not penitentiary facilities 
</p>
<p>and that people in those centres were always held according to judicial authorization and 
</p>
<p>under judicial oversight. New rules of procedure had also been adopted in March 2014, 
</p>
<p>incorporating a series of guarantees. 
</p>
<p>15. The autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla were under extraordinary migratory 
</p>
<p>pressure. The temporary migrant reception centres, which operated under an open regime, 
</p>
<p>provided basic social services to illegal immigrants and asylum seekers. The Government 
</p>
<p>was undertaking reforms in the reception centres in response to the ever-increasing number 
</p>
<p>of arrivals. Additionally, the Government had decided to establish refugee offices at the 
</p>
<p>Ceuta and Melilla border posts to process asylum applications in situ. 
</p>
<p>16. Regarding the fight against torture, the delegation recalled that the Ombudsman 
</p>
<p>performed the function of a national preventive mechanism and that, in the context of the 
</p>
<p>ongoing reform of the Criminal Procedure Law, increased safeguards against torture and ill-
</p>
<p>treatment had been incorporated. </p>


<p>17. Despite the economic crisis, the Government was trying to secure access to justice 
</p>
<p>for the most vulnerable, in particular through the draft Law on the Statute of Victims, which 
</p>
<p>provided a global response, both legal and social, to the needs of the victims of crime, and 
</p>
<p>an extensive list of victims&#8217; rights.  
</p>
<p>18. The Government was aware of the serious impact of the economic crisis on children. 
</p>
<p>Child poverty rates had always been comparatively high in Spain, but the decline in 
</p>
<p>household income, as a result of the economic crisis and the impact of unemployment on 
</p>
<p>families, constituted a burden which the Government was striving to address. 
</p>
<p>19. On the right to education, the delegation noted that the investment rate per pupil in 
</p>
<p>public education, the student-teacher ratio and the percentage of expenditure on child public 
</p>
<p>education were relatively high compared to the equivalents in neighbouring countries. 
</p>
<p>Additionally, the Act on the Improvement of Educational Quality (Organic Act No. 8/2013) 
</p>
<p>had been adopted in December 2013, with the aim of reducing the rate of early dropout 
</p>
<p>from school, improving educational standards in accordance with international benchmarks 
</p>
<p>and enhancing the employability and entrepreneurship of students. 
</p>
<p>20. With regard to the right to health, in 2012 the Government had initiated a reform to 
</p>
<p>guarantee the sustainability of the national health system, under which health care  in 
</p>
<p>emergency situations, during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period, and  for those 
</p>
<p>under 18 is guaranteed for undocumented immigrants under the same conditions as for 
</p>
<p>Spanish citizens. 
</p>
<p>21. In conclusion, the delegation noted that Spain had an advanced legal and 
</p>
<p>institutional framework but that its implementation required improvements. To achieve this, 
</p>
<p>it was necessary to exert the political will&#8212;which was present&#8212;and obtain the necessary 
</p>
<p>resources, which were scarce owing to the financial crisis and budgetary restrictions. As 
</p>
<p>evidence of its political will, the Government had announced initial measures to reverse the 
</p>
<p>effects of the restrictions for the most vulnerable groups, such as the enactment, on 1 
</p>
<p>January 2015, of a tax reform which involved a general reduction in income tax for 
</p>
<p>individuals, particularly for lower-income taxpayers. In addition, the social expenditure 
</p>
<p>foreseen for 2015 represented 53.9 per cent of the Government&#8217;s budget. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

</p>
<p>54. The Spanish delegation welcomed the references made by several delegations to the 
</p>
<p>Alliance of Civilizations, a Spanish-Turkish initiative in its origins, as well as to the 
</p>
<p>Business and Human Rights Plan, and expressed thanks for the cooperation of several 
</p>
<p>countries in its preparation. In response to questions on discrimination, racism and 
</p>
<p>xenophobia, the Spanish delegation mentioned that, under the strategy to combat racism 
</p>
<p>and xenophobia, a series of activities for prevention and detection had been developed, such 
</p>
<p>as the Annual Report on Racism and Xenophobia. Training, public policies and institutional 
</p>
<p>cooperation had also been strengthened.  
</p>
<p>55. Regarding the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers 
</p>
<p>and Members of Their Families, the delegation recalled that the Spanish Constitution and 
</p>
<p>legislation guaranteed the rights of migrants. Spain followed the European Union position 
</p>
<p>on the matter.  </p>


<p>56. Regarding the fight against gender-based violence, the Spanish policy was based on 
</p>
<p>promoting responsible, united and sustained action with the participation of all public 
</p>
<p>institutions and civil society associations. Measures taken in the previous few years were 
</p>
<p>the creation of the Observatory for domestic gender-based violence, the adoption of gender 
</p>
<p>based laws, and the International Strategy to eradicate Violence Against Women 2013&#8211;
</p>
<p>2016. The delegation also mentioned efforts to improve the training of police officers, 
</p>
<p>health-care professionals, social workers and judicial officers with a victim&#8217;s approach. 
</p>
<p>With regard to the judiciary, the delegation recalled the reform of the Penal Code and a 
</p>
<p>draft law on the legal status of victims. Spain was also working to enhance the visibility of 
</p>
<p>other forms of violence, such as trafficking and the sexual exploitation of women and girls, 
</p>
<p>female genital mutilation and forced marriage. 
</p>
<p>57. Concerning the migration situation in the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla, 
</p>
<p>the delegation stated that there were two different legal proceedings established by law 
</p>
<p>regarding the return of foreigners who had entered Spanish territory. Both respected a series 
</p>
<p>of guarantees, such as the right to request international protection, the provision of free 
</p>
<p>legal aid, access to interpreters and non-return in the case of pregnant women where health 
</p>
<p>risks were involved. The delegation added that operations to prevent the entry of foreigners 
</p>
<p>into Spain were a different situation, which occurred during border patrols in Ceuta and 
</p>
<p>Melilla. Denials of entry were exerted by Spain as a sovereign right within the framework 
</p>
<p>of its obligations as a member of the European Union. The delegation of Spain informed 
</p>
<p>the Working Group that attempts to enter Spain by those borders were ongoing, on a mass 
</p>
<p>scale and violent and that they constituted a problem of internal security and public order. 
</p>
<p>In any intervention, the authorities always took into consideration the principle of 
</p>
<p>proportionality and opportunity and the possibility that, among the people concerned, there 
</p>
<p>could be persons in a vulnerable situation who required assistance.  
</p>
<p>58. The delegation referred to a question related to the incorporation of a provision in 
</p>
<p>the Protection of Public Safety Bill to amend the Migration Law. The purpose of the 
</p>
<p>amendment was to recognize the specificity of Ceuta and Melilla from the geographical, 
</p>
<p>border and security perspectives. The amendment was being debated in parliament, 
</p>
<p>including consultations with international expert bodies. The amendment, if adopted, would 
</p>
<p>comply with international obligations regarding access to international protection and non-
</p>
<p>refoulement. 
</p>
<p>59. Rwanda appreciated the policies adopted to promote equality of opportunity for 
</p>
<p>women and the laws and policies on the sexual exploitation of children and adolescents and 
</p>
<p>on trafficking in persons.  
</p>
<p>60. Senegal welcomed the various initiatives taken for the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>recommendations made in the first cycle, especially on violence against women, the 
</p>
<p>situation of rural women, equal opportunities and education. 
</p>
<p>61. Serbia noted with satisfaction the comprehensive national report of Spain and its 
</p>
<p>cooperation with the Ombudsman and other representatives of civil society.  
</p>
<p>62. Sierra Leone commended the drawing up of a Framework Protocol for the 
</p>
<p>Protection of Victims of Trafficking and the recent appointment of a National Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on human trafficking.  
</p>
<p>63. Slovakia acknowledged efforts to eliminate gender discrimination and combat 
</p>
<p>human trafficking and asked for more information on the training of prosecutors working in 
</p>
<p>the field of combating racism.  
</p>
<p>64. Slovenia welcomed information on institutional strengthening in the area of hate 
</p>
<p>speech and discrimination and the stated intention to restore social protection measures and 
</p>
<p>assistance to those most disadvantaged by the financial crisis. </p>


<p>65. Sri Lanka acknowledged measures addressing hate crime and combating human 
</p>
<p>trafficking and encouraged Spain to safeguard the rights of the most vulnerable population 
</p>
<p>groups through focused social assistance and income support.  
</p>
<p>66. The Sudan welcomed the adoption of the Strategic Plans for Equality of Opportunity 
</p>
<p>2014&#8211;2016 and for Citizenship and Integration and the Strategy for the Elimination of 
</p>
<p>Violence against Women 2013&#8211;2016.  
</p>
<p>67. Sweden expressed concern that the Law on Protection of Public Security could 
</p>
<p>restrict the citizen&#8217;s ability to publicly protest and legalize summary expulsions of migrants 
</p>
<p>crossing from Morocco to Ceuta and Melilla. 
</p>
<p>68. Switzerland commended the engagement of Spain in combating violence against 
</p>
<p>women. It also noted that the Franco era remained challenging in political and social life. 
</p>
<p>Concern regarding the behaviour of the police during peaceful protests was expressed. 
</p>
<p>69. Thailand welcomed the Strategy for the Elimination of Violence against Women and 
</p>
<p>invited Spain to provide redress and assistance to victims. Thailand encouraged Spain to 
</p>
<p>respect the human rights of migrants.  
</p>
<p>70. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia commended the establishment of a 
</p>
<p>hate crime and discrimination department in each provincial prosecutor&#8217;s office and the 
</p>
<p>2010 reforms to the Criminal Code.  
</p>
<p>71. Timor-Leste welcomed the initiatives to combat human trafficking and to support its 
</p>
<p>victims, and the adoption of the National Strategy for the Social Inclusion of the Gypsy 
</p>
<p>Population. 
</p>
<p>72. Togo appreciated the establishment of special departments for hate crimes and 
</p>
<p>discrimination in all provincial prosecutors&#8217; offices. It expressed concern about racial 
</p>
<p>profiling of migrants belonging to ethnic and religious minorities. 
</p>
<p>73. Trinidad and Tobago commended the active international engagement of Spain on 
</p>
<p>human rights and noted that the economic crisis affected the capacity of Spain to expand its 
</p>

<p>93. The Spanish delegation responded to questions that were raised during the 
</p>
<p>interactive dialogue or sent in advance. 
</p>
<p>94. The General Law on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities unified the existing 
</p>
<p>legislation on the subject and included the mainstreaming of disability policies. In the area 
</p>
<p>of education, during the period 2012&#8211;2013, the percentage of people who received 
</p>
<p>educational attention different from the ordinary amounted to 5.3 per cent of all students. In </p>

</p>
<p>whom there was exemption of fees and payments. 
</p>
<p>95. Regarding the gypsy population, in the previous 40 years there had been significant 
</p>
<p>social progress. For instance, in primary education, nearly 100 per cent of Gypsy children

</p>

</p>
<p>efforts on capacity-building for judges, prosecutors and other members of the investigative

</p>
<p>for women and men,  to encourage a better balance between work and family, and sharing 
</p>
<p>of responsibility. The measures adopted in 2014 to combat unemployment were of 
</p>
<p>particular relevance owing to the fact that unemployment was higher among women. 
</p>
<p>98. In 2014, the Government had adopted a protocol on certain actions in relation to 
</p>
<p>unaccompanied children arriving in Spanish territory, aimed at better coordination between 
</p>
<p>concerned institutions and administrations. During their stay in the country, minors under 
</p>
<p>Spanish protection were always considered legal residents. Once they reached adulthood 
</p>
<p>they could renew their residence and work permits if they met the conditions established by 
</p>
<p>law, which were more favourable than the general provisions on this matter. 
</p>
<p>99. In the near future the Government was expected to adopt a comprehensive plan to 
</p>
<p>combat trafficking for sexual exploitation and to develop a protocol for the protection of

</p>
<p>institutions and administrations concerned. 
</p>

</p>
<p>exceptional, applied for terrorist offences only, and could only be established by a judge or 
</p>
<p>tribunal through a reasoned decision, for the period of time that was strictly necessary. The 
</p>
<p>regime was under review within the framework of the reform of the law of criminal 
</p>
<p>procedure. 
</p>
<p>101. In recent years the Government had adopted temporary and structural measures to 
</p>
<p>address problems regarding mortgage debts. The temporary measures were taken to protect 
</p>
<p>persons who, as a result of the crisis, were no longer able to meet the obligations arising 
</p>
<p>from their mortgage loans to acquire homes and were in a situation of vulnerability. The 
</p>
<p>structural measures introduced limits to interest rates on arrears and improved auction 
</p>
<p>procedures in case debts remained after the sale in order to write them off. 
</p>
<p>102. Bulgaria appreciated recent ratifications, the establishment of the council of victims 
</p>
<p>of hate crimes and of the Rapporteur on human trafficking and the adoption of strategies on

</p>
<p>from migrant and disabled communities.

</p>
<p>107. The Congo commended the establishment of a National Council on victims of hate 
</p>

</p>
<p>trafficking and forced marriages.

</p>
<p>the death penalty, and stated that its role in the creation of the International Commission 
</p>
<p>against the Death Penalty was commendable.  
</p>
<p>109. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire commended human rights reforms, namely article 59bis of the Aliens

<p>economic crisis.  
</p>
<p>114. Egypt welcomed the establishment of provincial discrimination departments and the 
</p>
<p>continued commitment of Spain to women&#8217;s rights. It recognized the difficulties resulting 
</p>
<p>from the financial and economic crisis with regard to social protection and promotion of 
</p>
<p>human rights.  
</p>
<p>115. Estonia highlighted the commitment of Spain to combating human trafficking and 
</p>
<p>the prioritization of the elimination of violence against women. Estonia seconded the 
</p>
<p>suggestion by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
</p>
<p>(UNESCO) that the Government pursue efforts to ensure the rights of all children to an 
</p>
<p>inclusive education.  
</p>

</p>
<p>117. Gabon appreciated the measures regarding the fight against gender-based 
</p>
<p>discrimination, notably policies favouring equal opportunities within the professional 
</p>
<p>sphere and those on fighting violence against women. 
</p>

<p>media. </p>

</p>
<p>ongoing cooperation with the special procedures. It welcomed the improvements in the 
</p>
<p>legal framework regarding persons with disabilities.  
</p>

</p>
<p>the lack of equality before the law of foreigners. 
</p>
<p>122. Honduras welcomed the hate crimes and discrimination departments within local 
</p>
<p>prosecutor&#8217;s offices and the new legislation on human trafficking, forced marriage and 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>123. Hungary noted numerous achievements since the first review of Spain,

<p>encouraged Spain to share information on acts of ethnic profiling.  
</p>
<p>125. Highlighting its commitment to the international human rights normative 
</p>
<p>framework, the Spanish delegation mentioned the following instruments to which Spain 
</p>
<p>had recently become a party: the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child on a communications procedure, the Council of Europe Convention on 
</p>
<p>preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul 
</p>
<p>Convention) and the Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking in Human Organs.  
</p>
<p>126. The delegation emphasized that its institutional commitment was shown by the 
</p>
<p>active support and participation of Spain in the UPR and in all the work of the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council, of which Spain had been a member between 2011 and 2013. The 
</p>

</p>
<p>another opportunity to promote and defend human rights at the multilateral level.  
</p>
<p>127. The delegation recalled some of the foreign policy priorities of Spain in the area of

</p>
<p>importance of thoroughly analysing which commitments could be undertaken. 
</p>
<p>129. The delegation pointed out that many of the recommendations and questions 
</p>
<p>received arose from the impact of the fiscal adjustment measures taken to combat the 
</p>
<p>economic and financial crisis. It reiterated that the Government was fully aware of the 
</p>
<p>sacrifices that those measures had involved for many people and that it had taken special 
</p>
<p>care to respecting the criteria of necessity, timeliness, non-regression and non-
</p>
<p>discrimination.  
</p>
<p>130. The delegation concluded by reiterating its commitment to the universal periodic 
</p>
<p>review. </p>
