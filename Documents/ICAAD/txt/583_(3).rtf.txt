The three assessors unanimously found accusedGuilty of the count against him.

3.

4.      
Considering the nature of the evidence before the court, I am convinced that the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.

5.      
Prosecution case was based on the evidence of the victim. She was 3 years old at the time of the incident. Accused is known person to her call as uncle. Accused had inserted his finger into her vagina in the spare room of her house. She had complained to the mother same day. Mother confirmed her evidence regarding a recent complaint. She was examined by a doctor three weeks later. Doctor stated that her physical observations are consistent with the history given by the victim.

The accused remained silent and that is his right.

7.      
I am satisfied that evidence is sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
