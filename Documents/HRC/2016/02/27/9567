<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 2005/70, the Commission on Human Rights requested the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to submit, in consultation with 
other parts of the United Nations system, civil society and other stakeholders, a study on 
human rights and transitional justice activities undertaken by the human rights components of the 
United Nations that would include an analysis of the work accomplished, a compilation of 
lessons learned and best practices as well as conclusions and recommendations, with a view to 
assisting countries in the context of transitional justice (para. 4).  This study was submitted to the 
Commission on Human Rights as document E/CN.4/2006/93 and, inter alia, indicated that future 
reports would include a compilation of lessons learned and best practices. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 2/102 
of 6 October 2006, requesting the High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;continue with the 
fulfilment of her activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission 
on Human Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;.<b>  </b>The present report outlines the 
progress achieved by OHCHR in the development of lessons learned and best practices since the 
last report to the Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2006/93). 
</p>
<p><b>II.  TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Concepts, frameworks and coordination 
</b></p>
<p>3. In his report to the Security Council on the rule of law and transitional justice in conflict 
and post-conflict societies, the Secretary-General defined the concept of transitional justice as 
comprising &#8220;the full range of processes and mechanisms associated with a society&#8217;s attempts to 
come to terms with the legacy of large-scale past abuses, in order to ensure accountability, serve 
justice and achieve reconciliation&#8221; (S/2004/616, para. 8).  According to this definition, such 
processes and mechanisms include prosecutions, reparations, truth-seeking, institutional reform, 
vetting and dismissals.  In addition, the report emphasized that in the context of transitional 
justice strategies must be &#8220;holistic, incorporating integrated attention to individual prosecutions, 
reparations, truth-seeking, institutional reform, vetting and dismissals, or an appropriately 
conceived combination thereof&#8221; (ibid., para. 26). 
</p>
<p>4. At the country level, United Nations expertise on transitional justice issues can be found 
within OHCHR field presences, and human rights and rule of law components of peacekeeping 
missions.  While most transitional justice-related issues are within the domain of the human 
rights component of peacekeeping missions, rule of law components also have much to offer in 
the context of judicial reform issues.  Elsewhere, other United Nations agencies, funds and 
programmes also engage in transitional justice-related activities.  While OHCHR has the leading</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>role in the area of human rights and transitional justice,<b>1</b> it is important that all departments, 
agencies, programmes and funds work together so as to strengthen the capacity of national 
stakeholders. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>5. OHCHR support to United Nations field presences on transitional justice includes needs 
assessments, mission planning, selection and deployment of specialized staff, assistance in the 
design and conceptualization of transitional justice mechanisms in the field, and the provision of 
guidance in the form of policy tools.  The Office has a dedicated capacity on transitional justice. 
</p><p>6. OHCHR is seeking to develop sustainable, long-term institutional capacity within 
United Nations field presences, transitional administrations and civil society to respond to the 
demands in this area.  In this context, OHCHR has continued to elaborate transitional justice 
tools.  The tools are meant to provide field missions, transitional administrations and civil 
society with the fundamental information required to effectively advise on the development of 
transitional justice mechanisms, in line with international human rights standards and best 
practices.   
</p>
<p>7. At the beginning of 2006, the first series of the OHCHR rule of law policy tools 
addressing different aspects of transitional justice were published.  This included tools on 
(a) truth commissions; (b) prosecution initiatives; (c) vetting and institutional reform; 
(d) mapping the justice sector in post-conflict States; and (e) legal systems monitoring. 
</p><p>8. In 2006, OHCHR also initiated the development of the second series of tools, consisting 
of a tool on reparations programmes and on legacy of hybrid tribunals. 
</p>
<p>9. The policy tool on reparations programmes consists of the basic principles involved in 
setting up and implementing models of reparations programmes in post-conflict States and 
countries in transition.  It also addresses the challenges faced by reparations programmes, 
including which violations should be subject to reparations and which kinds of benefits 
reparations programmes should distribute.  In May and July 2006, OHCHR conducted field 
missions to Chile and Morocco to study practices and recent development in the area of 
reparations which would assist in the preparation of this tool.  In August 2006, the Office 
organized a workshop to solicit expert views and feedback on the tool.  It provided a forum to 
discuss the tool&#8217;s approach and analyse its effectiveness from the practical standpoint.  
Participants represented a wide range of expertise and practical experiences in the area of 
reparations programmes. 
</p>
<p>9. The policy tool on the legacy of hybrid tribunals aims to explore the potential for 
such tribunals to have a positive impact on the domestic justice system of post-conflict States so

 <p> 
</p>
<p>as to ensure a lasting legacy for the rule of law and respect for human rights.  The tool suggests 
effective and meaningful policies, processes and techniques regarding the interrelationship 
between hybrid and domestic courts.  The tool aims to enhance the credibility and impact of 
hybrid tribunals on the long-term stability and development of the domestic justice system, 
including respect for human rights protections, the rule of law and legal institutions.  In 
June 2006, the Office held a workshop to solicit expert views on the tool and to evaluate its 
effectiveness from the standpoint of post-conflict missions needs.  Participants represented a 
wide range of expertise and practical experiences in hybrid tribunals. 
</p>
<p>10. Furthermore, OHCHR, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the United Nations 
Development Programme and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime are collaborating 
in the development of the Rule of Law Index (ROLIX), with the objective of allowing for an 
empirical and objective assessment of a cross-section of factors important for the rule of law in a 
given country or locality, particularly in conflict and post-conflict societies.  The outcome 
document will then be used by the United Nations, other international agencies and other 
stakeholders to carry out assessments of the rule of law institutions and legal framework in 
various countries.  ROLIX will focus on the legal system, law enforcement agencies, the judicial 
system and the correctional services drawing, inter alia, on administrative data and community 
perceptions.  A particular priority will be given to criminal justice legislation and institutions 
owing to their importance for peace and security. 
</p>
<p>11. In October 2006, the High Commissioner for Human Rights focused attention on 
economic and social justice for societies in transition.<b>2</b>  She noted that transitional justice 
mechanisms have not yet dealt with economic, social and cultural rights adequately or 
systematically, and that transitional justice should take up the challenge, acknowledge that there 
is no hierarchy of rights and provide protection for all human rights, including economic, social 
and cultural rights.<b>3</b>  The proposal that a comprehensive transitional justice strategy should 
address the gross violations of all human rights during the conflict should be further explored. 
</p>
<p>12. Besides normative and policy development, OHCHR has also provided assistance, 
including advisory services and conceptualization of transitional justice mechanisms, to the field 
presences, other parts of the United Nations system and national authorities.  This has included 
aspects such as participation in the negotiations held between the United Nations and the 
Government of Burundi on the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission and a 
special tribunal in Burundi.  In August 2006, OHCHR sent an expert mission to share 
experiences and lessons learned with United Nations engagement and coordination with the 
United Nations Operation in Burundi about the need for and method of conducting a broad-based 
consultation on transitional justice issues.

<p>13. OHCHR has continued to strengthen partnerships with various actors involved in 
transitional justice policy development.  The International Centre for Transitional Justice 
provided expert advice, including technical assistance, with respect to issues pertaining to 
transitional justice, including substantial input to the rule of law tools. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p>14. <b>As identified in the present report, the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights has continued to enhance its leading role 
in the area of human rights and transitional justice, including through the 
development of transitional justice policies, tools and best practices and in assisting in 
the conceptualization of transitional justice mechanisms.</b>
