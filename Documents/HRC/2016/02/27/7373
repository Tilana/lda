<p><i>Summary

<p>In the present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 25/25, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur reflects on the latest developments in relation to the situation in the 
</p>
<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea over the past year. While initially the authorities of 
</p>
<p>the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea made a number of welcome gestures towards 
</p>
<p>increased cooperation with the United Nations human rights system and bilateral partners, 
</p>
<p>those openings have not been sustained, nor borne fruit. 
</p>
<p>The main focus of the report is the development of a multitrack strategy aimed at 
</p>
<p>addressing the issue of international abductions, enforced disappearances and related 
</p>
<p>matters, as recommended by the commission of inquiry on the situation of human rights in 
</p>
<p>the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. By means of such a strategy, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur seeks to maintain momentum on, and the visibility of, the issue in the 
</p>
<p>international arena, and thereby sustain continuous and targeted pressure on the authorities 
</p>
<p>of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to resolve the issue to the satisfaction of 
</p>
<p>victims, their families and the international community. The support of all relevant 
</p>
<p>stakeholders in the implementation of this strategy will be paramount.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>pursuant to Council resolution 25/25. 
</p>
<p>2. Retrospectively, 2014 has been a landmark year for the international community&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>collective engagement on human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and 
</p>
<p>its efforts to bring relief and justice to the long-suffering people of the country. The report 
</p>
<p>of the commission of inquiry on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea, presented to the Human Rights Council in March 2014, enabled the 
</p>
<p>revelation of the truth as to the magnitude and gravity of the human rights violations 
</p>
<p>committed over several decades by the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea.  
</p>
<p>3. Sadly, the situation on the ground has not changed since the release of that report. 
</p>
<p>Rather than responding seriously and substantively to the findings and recommendations of 
</p>
<p>the commission of inquiry, the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>has spared no effort in seeking to undermine the credibility of the report. While initially the 
</p>
<p>authorities of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea made a number of welcome 
</p>
<p>gestures towards increased cooperation with the United Nations human rights system and 
</p>
<p>bilateral partners, including meeting with the Special Rapporteur for the first time in New 
</p>
<p>York and conditionally inviting him to visit the country, those openings have not been 
</p>
<p>sustained, nor borne fruit. 
</p>
<p>4. The main focus of the present report is the development of a strategy aimed at 
</p>
<p>addressing the issue of international abductions, enforced disappearances and related 
</p>
<p>matters, as recommended by the commission of inquiry. The Special Rapporteur hopes that 
</p>
<p>it will contribute to resolving this painful issue. The support of all Member States and other 
</p>
<p>relevant stakeholders in the implementation of this strategy will be paramount. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Latest major developments 
</b></p>
<p>5. Since the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s last report to the Human Rights Council, in June 
</p>
<p>2014, there have been several important and unprecedented developments pertaining to the 
</p>
<p>human rights situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Temporary engagement with the international community 
</b></p>
<p>6. In the second half of 2014, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea showed a 
</p>
<p>welcome initial sign of being disposed to engage with the international community on 
</p>
<p>human rights, most likely prompted by the findings of the commission of inquiry and the 
</p>
<p>then upcoming debate in the General Assembly on the situation of human rights in the 
</p>
<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea.  
</p>
<p>7. During that period, the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, 
</p>
<p>for the first time, invited the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit 
</p>
<p>the country and indicated its interest in receiving technical assistance from his Office (see 
</p>
<p>sect. II.C below). In addition, the Government resumed dialogue with the European Union 
</p>
<p>after several years, and extended an invitation to the Special Representative for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights to visit the country. It also released three nationals of the United States of America 
</p>
<p>detained on its territory. </p>


<p>8. In September 2014, during the twenty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p>the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea announced that it had 
</p>
<p>accepted 113 recommendations out of the 268 made in the context of its second universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review, held in May 2014. Most of the recommendations accepted pertained to the 
</p>
<p>fulfilment of economic and social rights (the rights to food, water and sanitation, health and 
</p>
<p>education) and the rights of vulnerable groups (women, children and people with 
</p>
<p>disabilities).1 This was a notable improvement over the lack of collaboration extended 
</p>
<p>during and after the first cycle of the review. As with the recommendations accepted under 
</p>
<p>the first cycle, the Special Rapporteur believes that these new recommendations present 
</p>
<p>tangible opportunities for engagement by Member States and all parties concerned, 
</p>
<p>including United Nations agencies and civil society, to facilitate and verify their 
</p>
<p>implementation. The Government failed, however, to accept any recommendations relating 
</p>
<p>to the findings of the commission of inquiry, which the Special Rapporteur suggests is 
</p>
<p>indicative of the &#8220;reality gap&#8221; in the engagement of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea with the Council. 
</p>
<p>9. On 27 October 2014, on the eve of the presentation of his annual report to the Third 
</p>
<p>Committee of the General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur met, at his request, a 
</p>
<p>delegation of senior officials from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. This was 
</p>
<p>the first time that officials from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea had agreed to 
</p>
<p>meet the mandate holder since the establishment of the mandate a decade previously. 
</p>
<p>During the meeting, the senior officials invited the Special Rapporteur to undertake a 
</p>
<p>country visit in the near future, under the condition, however, that two operative paragraphs 
</p>
<p>contained in the draft resolution on the situation of human rights in the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea be removed. The first paragraph (para. 7) related to the 
</p>
<p>accountability for crimes against humanity of the highest authorities in the country. The 
</p>
<p>second paragraph (para. 8) pertained to a possible referral by the Security Council of the 
</p>
<p>situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur, who has made repeated requests to be invited to visit the country, 
</p>
<p>responded that he should be invited irrespective of the adoption of the resolution.  
</p>
<p>10. On 18 November 2014, the Third Committee of the General Assembly adopted a 
</p>
<p>resolution on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>with an overwhelmingly large majority: 111 Member States voted in favour, 19 against and 
</p>
<p>55 abstained. An amendment introduced to remove the aforementioned operative 
</p>
<p>paragraphs was rejected by a majority of 77 votes, with 40 votes in favour and 
</p>
<p>50 abstentions.  
</p>
<p>11. In two letters dated 24 and 28 November 2014 addressed to the Secretary-General, 
</p>
<p>the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea firmly denounced the 
</p>
<p>adoption of the resolution.2 
</p>
<p>12. In a letter dated 5 December 2014 addressed to the President of the Security 
</p>
<p>Council, 10 members of the Security Council requested that the situation in the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea be formally placed on the Council&#8217;s agenda, and in that regard 
</p>
<p>also requested a meeting on the situation. They stated that they were &#8220;particularly 
</p>
<p>concerned by the scale and gravity of human rights violations detailed in the comprehensive 
</p>
<p>report undertaken by the Human Rights Council commission of inquiry &#8230; These violations 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Report of the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/63). 
</p>
<p> 2 Annexes to the letters dated 24 and 28 November 2014 from the Permanent Representative of the 
</p>
<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>(A/69/616&#8211;S/2014/849 and A/69/623&#8211;S/2014/855). </p>


<p>threaten to have a destabilizing impact on the region and the maintenance of international 
</p>
<p>peace and security&#8221;.3 The Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>strongly opposed those requests in a letter dated 15 December addressed to the President of 
</p>
<p>the Security Council.4 
</p>
<p>13. On 18 December 2014, the General Assembly adopted in plenary session the 
</p>
<p>resolution on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, 
</p>
<p>with an increased majority: 116 Member States voted in favour, 20 against and 53 abstained 
</p>
<p>(resolution 69/188).  
</p>
<p>14. On 22 December 2014, the Security Council held a meeting to discuss the situation 
</p>
<p>in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. On behalf of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights, the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights 
</p>
<p>briefed the Council on the findings of the commission of inquiry, stressing that &#8220;rarely has 
</p>
<p>such an extensive charge-sheet of international crimes been brought to the Council&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>attention&#8221;.5 The Council voted to include the issue on its agenda (11 in favour; 2 against; 
</p>
<p>2 abstentions), paving the way for regular meetings on the issue. Member States refrained 
</p>
<p>at that stage from making explicit calls for a referral of the situation in the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to the International Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>15. In the aftermath of those two key developments in the General Assembly and the 
</p>
<p>Security Council, the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea indicated 
</p>
<p>that it would suspend dialogue with the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur, and that the respective invitations extended to visit the country were 
</p>
<p>being withdrawn. The Special Rapporteur finds this stance deeply regrettable. He urges the 
</p>
<p>Government to revisit its decision without delay, and remains ready to visit the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea as soon as possible to engage in further constructive dialogue 
</p>
<p>on issues of concern. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Main recent developments in neighbouring countries affected 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Republic of Korea 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur paid a visit to the Republic of Korea from 10 to 
</p>
<p>14 November 2014. During his visit, he met with senior officials from the Ministry for 
</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Unification, the Office for National 
</p>
<p>Security, and the National Intelligence Service, and members of the Human Rights Forum 
</p>
<p>and of the Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee of the National Assembly. He also 
</p>
<p>met with the Mayor of Seoul and with representatives of the National Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Commission of the Republic of Korea, non-governmental organizations and the diplomatic 
</p>
<p>community.  
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur observed during his visit that national aspirations for 
</p>
<p>reunification of the two Koreas into a single nation continued to be as strong as ever. In that 
</p>
<p>context, he was briefed on the establishment in July 2014 of the Presidential Committee for 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 Letter dated 5 December 2014 from the representatives of Australia, Chile, France, Jordan, Lithuania, 
</p>
<p>Luxembourg, the Republic of Korea, Rwanda, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
</p>
<p>Ireland and the United States of America to the United Nations addressed to the President of the 
</p>
<p>Security Council (S/2014/872). 
</p>
<p> 4 Letter dated 15 December 2014 from the Permanent Representative of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council 
</p>
<p>(S/2014/896). 
</p>
<p> 5 Verbatim record of Security Council meeting of 22 December 2014 (S/PV.7353), p. 5. </p>


<p>Unification Preparation. This body is tasked with proposing ways to improve inter-Korean 
</p>
<p>cooperation and prepare for peaceful unification. It recently proposed to the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea the holding of an &#8220;inter-Korean dialogue&#8221;6 to discuss issues of 
</p>
<p>mutual interest, a proposal that the Special Rapporteur welcomes. He similarly welcomes 
</p>
<p>the announcement made in January 2015 by the Supreme Leader of the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea that he would hold talks with the President of the Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea. This is an encouraging development as dialogue between the two countries and 
</p>
<p>increased contact between people of both Koreas is of the utmost importance, in line with 
</p>
<p>the commission of inquiry&#8217;s recommendations.7  
</p>
<p>18. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur was informed that dialogue between the 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea and the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea on the reunion of 
</p>
<p>separated families had been interrupted once again by the latter. He hopes that the 
</p>
<p>forthcoming talks between the two countries will enable progress on this key issue to 
</p>
<p>resume, in the interest of those families. He welcomes the fact that the Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>had continued to provide humanitarian assistance prior to the announcement of the 
</p>
<p>resumption of talks. 
</p>
<p>19. While on mission in the Republic of Korea, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention was 
</p>
<p>drawn to the issue of nationals of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea being sent 
</p>
<p>abroad by their Government to work under conditions that reportedly amount to forced 
</p>
<p>labour. This is an issue of serious concern which the Special Rapporteur will examine in 
</p>
<p>future reports.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Japan 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur visited Japan from 19 to 23 January 2015. During his visit, 
</p>
<p>he met with senior officials from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Ministry for the 
</p>
<p>Abduction Issue, the National Police, the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office, and the 
</p>
<p>Association of Members of Parliament dealing with abductions. He also met with members 
</p>
<p>of the Association of Families of Abductees and other representatives of civil society, as 
</p>
<p>well as members of the diplomatic community.  
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur was informed by the Japanese authorities that, in addition to 
</p>
<p>the 12 known cases of abductees remaining to be returned to Japan, the national police 
</p>
<p>agency was currently looking into 881 possible abduction cases attributable to the 
</p>
<p>Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea over the years. They represent 
</p>
<p>21 possible cases that are additional to the previous figure given in April 2014 by the 
</p>
<p>Japanese authorities. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur was briefed on the latest developments in relation to the 
</p>
<p>bilateral dialogue started in 2014 between the Governments of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea and Japan. In May 2014, the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>agreed to conduct a comprehensive, full-scale survey of all Japanese nationals in the 
</p>
<p>country, including the remains and graves of the Japanese who had died on its territory 
</p>
<p>before and after 1945 and the remaining Japanese, spouses, victims of abduction and the 
</p>
<p>missing. It also agreed to keep Japan constantly updated on the results of the investigation. 
</p>
<p>In return, Japan agreed to ease a number of sanctions it had imposed on the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. In October 2014, a delegation of senior Japanese officials went 
</p>
<p>to Pyongyang to be apprised of the latest information in relation to the survey undertaken. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 Press release from the Ministry of Unification, &#8220;New year plans on foundation building for 
</p>
<p>unification by Presidential Committee for Unification Preparation&#8221; (30 December 2014), available 
</p>
<p>from http://eng.unikorea.go.kr/content.do?cmsid=1834&amp;cid=42033&amp;mode=view. 
</p>
<p> 7 A/HRC/25/63, para. 91. </p>


<p>However, the meeting was reported to have been unsatisfactory. While welcoming the 
</p>
<p>dialogue between the two countries, the Special Rapporteur regrets that it has been stalled 
</p>
<p>for several months by the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, which is due to present a 
</p>
<p>report on the outcome of its survey by July 2015. The Special Rapporteur calls on the 
</p>
<p>Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea genuinely to abide by the terms 
</p>
<p>of the bilateral agreement with Japan. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to the international symposium on the issue 
</p>
<p>of abductions being organized by the Government of Japan in May in New York. It will be 
</p>
<p>similar to an event held on the margins of the twenty-seventh session of the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council in September 2014. Such events contribute to maintaining the visibility and 
</p>
<p>international understanding of the issue of international abductions carried out by the 
</p>
<p>Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and are important elements of 
</p>
<p>the strategy developed by the Special Rapporteur (see sect. III below). 
</p>
<p><b> 3. China 
</b></p>
<p>24. On the margins of the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur met with officials from China to discuss the issue of nationals of the 
</p>
<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea who, in their attempt to flee the country, had 
</p>
<p>crossed the border into China, and the issue of how to prevent their being sent back to their 
</p>
<p>country of origin, in breach of the provisions of international law on non-refoulement. He 
</p>
<p>remains keen to engage in a constructive dialogue with the Government of China to seek a 
</p>
<p>sustainable solution to this serious ongoing problem, and to achieve the overall objective of 
</p>
<p>bringing concrete meaningful changes to the human rights situation in the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Efforts by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. </b>Dialogue on technical cooperation with the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>Republic of Korea 
</b></p>
<p>25. In September 2014, for the first time, the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea expressed interest in receiving technical assistance from the Office of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Subsequent discussions were 
</p>
<p>held between the Government and the Office on the possible scope of such assistance. 
</p>
<p>While the Special Rapporteur welcomes this positive development, he regrets that the 
</p>
<p>Government decided to suspend its dialogue with the Office on the eve of the Security 
</p>
<p>Council meeting of 22 December 2014. 
</p>
<p>26. He calls on the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to resume dialogue with the 
</p>
<p>Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on technical 
</p>
<p>cooperation as soon as possible. He stresses that such dialogue should not be linked to any 
</p>
<p>political considerations, but be undertaken with a view to the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s international human rights obligations, including the commitments made during 
</p>
<p>the universal periodic review. He hopes that the Government will change its position and 
</p>
<p>grant the Office access to the country to assess the needs on the ground and explore with 
</p>
<p>the Government possible avenues for substantive and meaningful cooperation.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Establishment of a field-based structure 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 25/25, provided for the establishment 
</p>
<p>by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights of a field-based 
</p>
<p>structure tasked with strengthening the monitoring and documentation of the situation of </p>


<p>human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, enhancing the engagement and 
</p>
<p>capacity-building of various stakeholders and maintaining the visibility of the situation. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur welcomes all the efforts made by the Office and partners towards the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the structure. At the time of preparation of the present report, the Office is 
</p>
<p>finalizing administrative matters pertaining to the establishment of the field-based structure 
</p>
<p>with the Government of the Republic of Korea. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
</p>
<p>progress made on this initiative, and looks forward to collaborating with the field-based 
</p>
<p>structure in the very near future. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur was pleased to hear during his meetings with officials and 
</p>
<p>civil society in both the Republic of Korea and Japan about their eagerness to collaborate 
</p>
<p>with the field-based structure. He again calls upon all stakeholders to extend their full 
</p>
<p>cooperation to the structure in the accomplishment of its important work. In addition, he 
</p>
<p>encourages the Human Rights Council to fully support the structure and ensure that it can 
</p>
<p>fulfil its challenging mandate adequately. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Strategy on addressing the issue of international abductions, 
enforced disappearances and related matters 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>29. The commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea, following a thorough and careful investigation, found that &#8220;since 1950, the 
</p>
<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea has engaged in the systematic abduction, denial of 
</p>
<p>repatriation and subsequent enforced disappearance of persons from other countries on a 
</p>
<p>large scale and as a matter of State policy&#8221;.8  
</p>
<p>30. The commission of inquiry estimated that well over 200,000 persons, including 
</p>
<p>children, had been taken from other countries to the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea, and that many had never been heard of again. This figure included mostly those who 
</p>
<p>had left for the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea in the context of the Korean War.9 
</p>
<p>However, agents of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea had abducted and 
</p>
<p>disappeared hundreds of nationals from Japan, the Republic of Korea and other countries 
</p>
<p>between the 1960s and 1980s.10 Since the 1990s, they are believed to have abducted several 
</p>
<p>individuals from Chinese territory, including nationals of China and the Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>and a former Japanese national.
11
</p>
<p> In addition to victims from China, Japan and the Republic 
</p>
<p>of Korea, the commission of inquiry recorded cases of abductions and enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances of nationals of Lebanon, Malaysia, Romania, Singapore, Thailand and 
</p>
<p>possibly other countries.
12
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>31. The commission of inquiry found that such violations amounted to crimes against 
</p>
<p>humanity under international criminal law.13 It also found that those cases constituted 
</p>

</p>
<p> 9 Ibid. 
</p>
<p> 10  Ibid., para. 66. 
</p>
<p> 11 Ibid., para. 72. 
</p>
<p> 12  The commission of inquiry considered it possible that other foreigners, especially foreign women, 
</p>
<p>from France, Italy, the Netherlands and other unspecified European countries, and the Middle East, 
</p>
<p>were among the abductees (see Report of the detailed findings of the commission of inquiry 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/25/CPR.1), para. 975. 
</p>
<p> 13 A/HRC/25/63, paras. 76 and 79. </p>


<p>ongoing violations &#8220;because the policies, institutions and patterns of impunity that lie at 
</p>
<p>their heart remain in place&#8221;.14 Such findings have important international justice 
</p>
<p>implications, including the possible application of the jurisdiction of the International 
</p>
<p>Criminal Court. 
</p>
<p>32. The commission of inquiry subsequently recommended that the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>develop a strategy, involving all United Nations human rights mechanisms concerned, to 
</p>
<p>address the issue of international abductions, enforced disappearances and related matters 
</p>
<p>coherently and without delay. It also recommended that Member States afford full 
</p>
<p>cooperation to ensure the implementation of such a strategy.15  
</p>
<p>33. In the light of the number of countries whose nationals have been abducted and 
</p>
<p>disappeared, the Special Rapporteur believes that an international approach to the issue is 
</p>
<p>now required. He welcomes the various bilateral efforts undertaken by some countries so 
</p>
<p>far, which should be sustained. However, he stresses that it is also fundamental to generate 
</p>
<p>broad support from the international community to address the issue of international 
</p>
<p>abductions, enforced disappearances and related matters more robustly and 
</p>
<p>comprehensively. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur pays his deepest respect to the families of abductees and 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances that he has met in the Republic of Korea and Japan over the years. 
</p>
<p>He has been greatly impressed and moved by their dignified composure and unfailing 
</p>
<p>courage over several decades in their search for truth, justice and the return of their loved 
</p>
<p>ones. There is a real sense of urgency to solve this matter once and for all as the victims &#8212; 
</p>
<p>those who have survived &#8212; and their families are, for the most part, well advanced in 
</p>
<p>years.  
</p>
<p>35. In this context, the Special Rapporteur would like to propose the following elements 
</p>
<p>of a strategy aimed at addressing the issue of international abductions and enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances committed by the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea, and related matters. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Purpose 
</b></p>
<p>36. The present strategy builds on recent major developments in the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council, General Assembly and Security Council on the situation in the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, with significantly increased scrutiny by the international 
</p>
<p>community of the actions of the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea. It seeks to maintain momentum on, and the visibility of, the issue of international 
</p>
<p>abductions, enforced disappearances and related matters in the international arena, and 
</p>
<p>thereby sustain continuous and targeted pressure on the authorities of the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to resolve the issue to the satisfaction of the victims, their 
</p>
<p>families and the international community. 
</p>
<p>37. The strategy is aimed at eventually shedding light on all cases of abductions and 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances allegedly committed by agents of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea; securing the immediate return of those who are still alive, together with 
</p>
<p>their descendants, to their respective countries of origin; facilitating the uniting of separated 
</p>
<p>families without delay; identifying and repatriating the physical remains of those who have 
</p>
<p>perished, in close cooperation with their families and nations of origin; ensuring that 
</p>
<p>victims of abduction and enforced disappearance, as well as their families, obtain redress 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 14 Ibid., para. 76. 
</p>
<p> 15 Ibid., para. 94 (d). </p>


<p>and can enjoy their right to adequate compensation; and holding the alleged perpetrators 
</p>
<p>accountable, bearing in mind the principle of command and superior responsibility under 
</p>
<p>international criminal law.  
</p>
<p>38. To that end, the Special Rapporteur proposes a multitrack strategy which combines 
</p>
<p>outreach to the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea at the bilateral level on different 
</p>
<p>fronts, while maintaining pressure at the international level. It is not intended to be 
</p>
<p>exhaustive and the Special Rapporteur would welcome further constructive initiatives in the 
</p>
<p>pursuit of those goals.  
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur makes himself available to support the strategy, with the 
</p>
<p>support of the field-based structure of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights that is being established in Seoul, Republic of Korea. This structure will 
</p>
<p>play a pivotal role in ensuring the implementation of several elements of the strategy, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the mandate of the structure outlined by the Human Rights Council in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 25/25. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Multitrack strategy 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Comprehensive mapping of international abductions and enforced disappearances  
</b></p>
<p>40. Despite tight time constraints, the commission of inquiry recorded a significant 
</p>
<p>number of cases of abduction and enforced disappearance of nationals from several 
</p>
<p>countries. It did not rule out cases from a number of other countries. In this regard, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur believes that a comprehensive mapping of international abductions and 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances, believed to have been committed by agents of the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, should be undertaken in the long term to grasp the full scale 
</p>
<p>and gravity of the issue and contribute to achieving accountability for such violations. To 
</p>
<p>this end, the Special Rapporteur encourages all Member States affected by the issue, as well 
</p>
<p>as civil society organizations and other stakeholders, to share with the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights detailed information on cases of abduction, 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearance and related matters, including detailed lists of confirmed and 
</p>
<p>potential victims. These submissions can be treated confidentially whenever requested. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur also requests the Member States concerned to grant him and 
</p>
<p>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights access to potential 
</p>
<p>witnesses of abductions and enforced disappearances, especially those escapees who may 
</p>
<p>have information relevant to the issue.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Sustained action by the Security Council 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that the human rights situation in the 
</p>
<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea is now firmly placed on the Security Council&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>agenda.16 Already in the discussion held by the Security Council on 22 December 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights and several Council members highlighted 
</p>
<p>the importance of the abduction issue. Regular action by the single most powerful United 
</p>
<p>Nations entity will be of paramount importance in maintaining momentum on the issue and 
</p>
<p>pressure on the authorities of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. In this context, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur calls on the President and members of the Security Council to bring 
</p>
<p>the issue forward to the Council&#8217;s agenda on a regular basis, preferably at least twice per 
</p>
<p>year. He believes that, given its international peace and security dimensions, the issue of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 16 See S/2014/872. </p>


<p>international abductions, enforced disappearances and related matters should be an 
</p>
<p>important focus for the Security Council. 
</p>
<p>43. Likewise, the Special Rapporteur hopes the Security Council will pay particular 
</p>
<p>attention to this issue in its discussions on other themes, for instance in the framework of 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 2122 (2013) on women, peace and security (para. 2 (a), (b) and (d)). 
</p>
<p>44. Importantly, the Special Rapporteur sees future meetings of the Security Council as 
</p>
<p>a key platform for relatives of victims of abduction and enforced disappearance, in 
</p>
<p>particular female victims, to amplify their calls for justice and accountability. This would 
</p>
<p>also be in line with Security Council resolution 2122 (2013), which highlights the 
</p>
<p>importance of interaction of civil society, including women&#8217;s organizations, with members 
</p>
<p>of the Council at headquarters and during Council field missions (para. 6).  
</p>
<p>45. Finally, the Special Rapporteur is available to brief the Security Council himself on 
</p>
<p>human rights developments in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, including on the 
</p>
<p>issue of international abductions, enforced disappearances and related matters.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Sustained action by the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>46. In conjunction with action by the Security Council, the Special Rapporteur firmly 
</p>
<p>believes that the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly can also continue to add 
</p>
<p>dimensions to international understanding and advocacy of the issue of international 
</p>
<p>abductions, enforced disappearances and related matters. 
</p>
<p>47. In this endeavour, for instance, a panel discussion held during a future Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council session could serve as a prominent platform to bring together independent 
</p>
<p>experts, representatives of families concerned, and other civil society actors to discuss this 
</p>
<p>issue. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur has always found useful the holding of side 
</p>
<p>events on a specific issue on the margins of sessions of the Human Rights Council and the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly. He encourages Member States and civil society to continue organizing 
</p>
<p>such events on a regular basis. They could contribute to informing the international 
</p>
<p>community and the media at strategic times about the dire situation in the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Targeted action by the future human rights contact group 
</b></p>
<p>48. The commission of inquiry on the situation of human rights in the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea recommended in its report that: 
</p>
<p>States that have historically friendly ties with the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, major 
</p>
<p>donors and potential donors, as well as those States already engaged with the Democratic People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea in the framework of the six-party talks, should form a human rights contact group 
</p>
<p>to raise concerns about the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>and to provide support for initiatives to improve it.17 
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur notes the wide range of Member States that have been 
</p>
<p>highlighting the issue of abductions and enforced disappearances in their statements during 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council and General Assembly debates, including some that do not 
</p>
<p>traditionally support the related resolutions. He believes that concerted action by a 
</p>
<p>committed group of Member States to engage the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea 
</p>
<p>on the issue of international abductions, enforced disappearances and related matters could 
</p>
<p>make a significant difference.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 17 A/HRC/25/63, para. 94 (h). </p>


<p>50. The Special Rapporteur stands ready to brief interested and concerned Member 
</p>
<p>States in this regard. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. International conference on missing persons  
</b></p>
<p>51. In order to maintain the momentum and visibility achieved by the latest General 
</p>
<p>Assembly resolution and action by the Security Council, the Special Rapporteur encourages 
</p>
<p>Member States to consider sponsoring an international conference on the issue of missing 
</p>
<p>persons in general, which would include the issue of international abductions and enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances carried out by agents of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, and 
</p>
<p>the subject of separated families. The Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea could be invited to attend this conference to give it another opportunity to engage 
</p>
<p>meaningfully on the issue. 
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur suggests that the event take place on the margins of a future 
</p>
<p>General Assembly session, preferably during the high-level segment, with the participation 
</p>
<p>of, inter alia, victims and relatives of abductees and of the disappeared, Member States 
</p>
<p>concerned by the issue, senior United Nations officials, relevant United Nations human 
</p>
<p>rights mechanisms and representatives of civil society, including members of non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations and academics focusing on the issue. The objective of this 
</p>
<p>conference would be to produce a common declaration of concern as well as an action-
</p>
<p>oriented framework for information-sharing, coordination of investigative efforts and 
</p>
<p>engagement with the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Active role of an international civil society coalition 
</b></p>
<p>53. The important role of civil society in articulating concerns and mobilizing attention 
</p>
<p>on the issue of abductions, enforced disappearances and related matters cannot be 
</p>
<p>emphasized enough. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the dedicated work 
</p>
<p>undertaken by families of victims and non-governmental organizations from all countries 
</p>
<p>concerned by the issue, in many regions of the world. He strongly encourages them to 
</p>
<p>actively join forces in a common campaign, both domestically and internationally, to seek 
</p>
<p>truth and justice and decisively bring closure to this tragedy. 
</p>
<p>54. Families of victims and non-governmental organizations have a great deal of 
</p>
<p>information and experience to share with each other, and therefore learn from each other, 
</p>
<p>on how to cope with, and plan a strategy on, the issue. The Special Rapporteur is mindful 
</p>
<p>that in a number of countries families of victims and non-governmental organizations are 
</p>
<p>divided on how to approach the issue. Some have adopted a conservative approach, 
</p>
<p>aligning themselves with the position of their Government. Others favour a more proactive 
</p>
<p>approach on the issue. While the Special Rapporteur respects both those positions, he 
</p>
<p>nevertheless wishes to stress the utmost importance of all civil society actors speaking with 
</p>
<p>one voice, with a view to amplifying their message. This will have a ricochet effect in 
</p>
<p>mobilizing Member States and other stakeholders to take action on the issue. 
</p>
<p>55. In this process, it is important to include regional coalitions and international 
</p>
<p>organizations working on the issue of abductions, enforced disappearances and related 
</p>
<p>matters, which can contribute their expertise and years of experience in dealing with the 
</p>
<p>issue. 
</p>
<p>56. Mindful of the specificities of each region, the Special Rapporteur thinks that non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations from countries in other regions that have been dealing with 
</p>
<p>disappearance issues could be consulted in this endeavour. They could also share their own 
</p>
<p>experiences and strategies, and inspire and offer solidarity to one another. 
</p>
<p>57. In this endeavour, the field-based structure of the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights can hopefully play a key role in facilitating exchanges </p>


<p>among all civil society networks. It will also contribute, in accordance with its mandate, to 
</p>
<p>enhancing the capacity of the organizations working on the issue. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Communication, advocacy and outreach initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>58. Sustained communication, advocacy and outreach initiatives are required to 
</p>
<p>maintain the visibility of the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
</p>
<p>of Korea. They can help keep up the momentum of ongoing efforts, further engage all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders and raise awareness among the wider public about the plight and sufferings of 
</p>
<p>the victims. The field-based structure of the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights, as mandated by the Human Rights Council in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 25/25, will be instrumental in piloting such initiatives. 
</p>
<p>59. In particular, the Special Rapporteur sees new communication capacity as a key tool 
</p>
<p>for raising and maintaining the visibility of the issue of international abductions, enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances and related matters at the international, regional and local levels. It will be 
</p>
<p>very important to reach out to, and mobilize, the general public in the countries affected by 
</p>
<p>the issue and beyond. Furthermore, affected families, if they choose to, can utilize online 
</p>
<p>platforms to share information, organize joint advocacy efforts from different locations and 
</p>
<p>engage with human rights mechanisms on the issue in a more strategic and effective 
</p>
<p>manner in order to maximize the impact of their efforts. To that end, communication, 
</p>
<p>advocacy and outreach initiatives should be undertaken in relevant languages, in particular 
</p>
<p>in Korean and Japanese.  
</p>
<p>60. The use of social media and new communication technologies will give further 
</p>
<p>prominence to the issue and will help reach out to young people who may not be aware of 
</p>
<p>or feel concerned by it, and mobilize netizens worldwide. Should the issue not be resolved 
</p>
<p>in the near future, new generations will at least be informed and mobilized to continue the 
</p>
<p>struggle. In addressing the issue, it is therefore crucial to target in particular youth networks 
</p>
<p>in all affected countries. 
</p>
<p>61. Importantly, this new communication capacity will allow victims in the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and their relatives to continue to hold out hope that the 
</p>
<p>sustained concern of the international community will eventually lead to relief of their 
</p>
<p>suffering. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. Active role of regional mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Asian and Pacific region does not unfortunately have a regional human rights 
</p>
<p>arrangement that covers the situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, 
</p>
<p>although the country previously participated in some regional human rights dialogues 
</p>
<p>organized by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>There are, however, a number of important platforms for dialogue on regional issues in 
</p>
<p>which the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea regularly participates, or in which issues 
</p>
<p>relating to the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and security on the Korean 
</p>
<p>peninsula are discussed.  
</p>
<p>63. These platforms include the Regional Forum of the Association of Southeast Asian 
</p>
<p>Nations (ASEAN), which has met annually since 1994 and has the goal of fostering 
</p>
<p>constructive dialogue and consultation on political and security issues of common interest 
</p>
<p>and concern, and of contributing to efforts towards confidence-building and preventive 
</p>
<p>diplomacy in the Asian and Pacific region. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is 
</p>
<p>currently a participant in the ASEAN Regional Forum, along with Australia, Bangladesh, 
</p>
<p>Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Indonesia, 
</p>
<p>Japan, the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, New 
</p>
<p>Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, the Russian </p>


<p>Federation, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste, the United States of America and 
</p>
<p>Viet Nam. In addition, there are a number of other intergovernmental dialogues and 
</p>
<p>summits in the region, in particular the East Asia Summit and the ASEAN dialogue 
</p>
<p>arrangements.  
</p>
<p>64. The above-mentioned platforms could be important venues for the discussion and 
</p>
<p>development of common action on human rights issues in the Democratic People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea, such as international abductions, enforced disappearances and related 
</p>
<p>matters, which have had a negative impact on the regional security situation. 
</p>
<p><b> 9. Continuous use of United Nations human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>65. Another avenue for exerting pressure on the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea to shed light on abductions, enforced disappearances and related matters 
</p>
<p>is the use of relevant United Nations human rights mechanisms, both Charter- and treaty-
</p>
<p>based.  
</p>
<p><b>(a) Charter-based mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p> (i) <i>Special procedures mandate holders 
</i></p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur cautions against seeing his mandate in isolation when 
</p>
<p>looking at the human rights situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. In his 
</p>
<p>view, country and thematic special procedures mandates are mutually reinforcing, creating 
</p>
<p>positive synergies between themselves and complementing each other. By the broad range 
</p>
<p>of issues they cover, and the different tools available to them in the fulfilment of their 
</p>
<p>functions (e.g. communications, press statements, country visits, thematic reporting), 
</p>
<p>thematic special procedures mandate holders can add substantive leverage to seeking 
</p>
<p>responses from the authorities of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea on cases 
</p>
<p>brought to their attention. 
</p>
<p>67. The thematic mechanism most relevant to the issue of international abductions, 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances and related matters is the Working Group on Enforced or 
</p>
<p>Involuntary Disappearances. It was entrusted with the double mandate to (a) assist families 
</p>
<p>in determining the fate or whereabouts of their disappeared relatives who are placed outside 
</p>
<p>the protection of the law and (b) monitor States&#8217; compliance with their obligations deriving 
</p>
<p>from the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced or Involuntary 
</p>
<p>Disappearance and existing international rules, and to provide States with assistance in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of those norms.18 The Special Rapporteur welcomes the numerous 
</p>
<p>communications issued by the Working Group to the Government of the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea,19 as well as its public advocacy. He also welcomes the letters 
</p>
<p>sent by the Working Group to the President of the Human Rights Council, the President of 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly, the President of the Security Council and the Secretary-General &#8220;to 
</p>
<p>request the adoption of any appropriate action that they may deem appropriate&#8221;20 in relation 
</p>
<p>to the issue of abductions and enforced disappearances carried out by the Democratic 
</p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea. He encourages the Working Group to request an invitation to 
</p>
<p>visit the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and countries affected by the issue. 
</p>
<p>68. Other thematic mandates are also particularly relevant to the issue of international 
</p>
<p>abductions, enforced disappearances and related matters, as illustrated by the report of the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

<p>commission of inquiry,21 in particular the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
</p>
<p>inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
</p>
<p>women, its causes and consequences, the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, 
</p>
<p>especially in women and children, and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur encourages these mandate holders to raise, or continue to raise, the 
</p>
<p>issue with the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea within the scope 
</p>
<p>of their respective mandates, including by seeking invitations to visit the country. 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
</p>
<p>of Korea to respond promptly and thoroughly to all the concerns raised by special 
</p>
<p>procedures mandate holders over the years on the issue of abductions, enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances and related matters. In this regard, he reminds the Government of the 
</p>
<p>commitment it made under the second cycle of the universal periodic review to cooperate 
</p>
<p>with the special procedures of the Human Rights Council.22 
</p>
<p> (ii)<i> Universal periodic review 
</i></p>
<p>70. During the twenty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council in September 2014, 
</p>
<p>the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea announced that it had 
</p>
<p>accepted 113 of the 268 recommendations made in the framework of its second universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review. This is a notable improvement on the lack of collaboration extended 
</p>
<p>during and after its first review. However, the Government very regrettably rejected all 
</p>
<p>recommendations relating to the findings of the commission of inquiry, including those 
</p>
<p>pertaining to international abductions and enforced disappearances. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>finds this continuous state of denial deeply disconcerting. He urges Member States, in their 
</p>
<p>bilateral efforts to follow up on the universal periodic review of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea, not to lose sight of those rejected recommendations and to continue to 
</p>
<p>raise the matter.  
</p>
<p>71. Prior to the second cycle of the universal periodic review, the Government of the 
</p>
<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea had indicated that it was in a position to accept a 
</p>
<p>number of recommendations pertaining to the issue of separated families which had been 
</p>
<p>made during the first review, in December 2009:  
</p>
<p> Guarantee separated families&#8217; fundamental right to know the fate of their family 
</p>
<p> members across the border and to communicate and regularly meet together;  
</p>
<p> Do everything possible, in cooperation with the Republic of Korea, to ensure that the 
</p>
<p> maximum number of meetings of separated families is organized; 
</p>
<p>Take concrete steps to continue the process of family reunification, because for the elder 
</p>
<p>generation even a delay of one or two years means that their chance of seeing  their relatives 
</p>
<p>may be lost forever; 
</p>
<p>Adopt measures to facilitate family reunification as recommended by the Special 
</p>
<p> Rapporteur on [the situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea].23  
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this commitment and calls on Member States and 
</p>
<p>other stakeholders to seek to engage the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
</p>
<p>of Korea to follow up on these recommendations, which have not been implemented to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 21 A/HRC/25/63, paras. 64&#8211;73. 
</p>
<p> 22 See A/HRC/27/10, paras. 124.17, 124.52, 124.61, 124.65 and 124.66, and A/HRC/27/10/Add.1, 
</p>
<p>para. 10 (a). 
</p>
<p> 23 A/HRC/13/13, paras. 90.75&#8211;78. </p>


<p>date. As recommended by the commission of inquiry, separated families should be allowed 
</p>
<p>to unite, &#8220;including by allowing citizens to travel or emigrate where they choose&#8221;; and such 
</p>
<p>persons should immediately be provided with &#8220;facilities for unmonitored communications 
</p>
<p>by way of mail, telephone, e-mail and any other means of communication&#8221;.24 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Treaty-based mechanisms </b></p>
<p>73. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea is party to several international human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments. Three of them are of particular relevance to the issue of international 
</p>
<p>abductions, enforced disappearances and related matters: the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>74. The Government accepted a series of recommendations made in the context of the 
</p>
<p>first and second cycles of the universal periodic review to submit reports to United Nations 
</p>
<p>human rights treaty bodies, notably the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.25 It also accepted a 
</p>
<p>number of other recommendations under the universal periodic review concerning the 
</p>
<p>rights of children, women and persons with disabilities.26 
</p>
<p>75. However, the reports of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Committee, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of Discrimination against Women are all overdue.27 The Government should be 
</p>
<p>reminded of its obligation to submit timely reports and encouraged to seek international 
</p>
<p>assistance in this regard. 
</p>
<p>76. In addition, the Special Rapporteur calls on the treaty bodies to challenge the 
</p>
<p>Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea on the issue of abductions, enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances and related matters under their respective mandates.  
</p>
<p>77. Finally, the international community should also urge the Democratic People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Republic of Korea to sign and ratify the most relevant international human rights treaty 
</p>
<p>relating to the present issue: the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
</p>
<p>from Enforced Disappearance.  
</p>
<p><b> 10. Closure and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>78. Achieving closure and accountability for the abductions and enforced 
</p>
<p>disappearances carried out by the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea is the ultimate goal of this strategy. Sooner or later the Government will have to 
</p>
<p>answer for its actions, in particular in the cases of abduction and enforced disappearance, 
</p>
<p>which have caused unspeakable suffering to the victims and their families. 
</p>
<p>79. The commission of inquiry found that those cases constituted crimes against 
</p>
<p>humanity under international criminal law. Although the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea has not included crimes against humanity in its national criminal law and is not a  
</p>
<p>party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, perpetrators of such crimes 
</p>
<p>can be held responsible on the basis of international customary law. Since the cases of

</p>

</p>
<p> 26 First cycle: A/HRC/13/13, para. 90.98; second cycle: A/HRC/27/10, paras. 124.30, 124.31, 124.34,

</p>
<p>the Child since 2012; report due to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
</p>
<p>Women since 2006. </p>


<p>abduction and enforced disappearance constitute ongoing violations, the International 
</p>
<p>Criminal Court is competent to prosecute the perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur remains convinced that the Security Council should refer the 
</p>
<p>situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to the International Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p>as recommended by the commission of inquiry and subsequently encouraged by the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly.28 In that eventuality, the evidence and documentation gathered by the 
</p>
<p>commission of inquiry on abductions and enforced disappearances, and the future 
</p>
<p>investigations of the field-based structure of the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights, will be of great relevance and value to the prosecutor&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>work.  
</p>
<p>81. The General Assembly also encouraged the Security Council, as recommended by 
</p>
<p>the commission of inquiry, to consider the scope for effective targeted sanctions against 
</p>
<p>those who appear to be most responsible for acts that the commission deemed to constitute 
</p>
<p>crimes against humanity. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the steps some Member States 
</p>
<p>have begun to take on a bilateral basis in this direction. 
</p>
<p>82. In this context, the Special Rapporteur recalls the principle of command and superior 
</p>
<p>responsibility under international criminal law, whereby military commanders and civil 
</p>
<p>superiors can incur personal criminal responsibility for failing to prevent and repress crimes 
</p>
<p>against humanity committed by persons under their effective control. 
</p>
<p>83. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur calls on Member States to exercise universal 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction in the event that any relevant individuals fall under their jurisdiction, and, in 
</p>
<p>accordance with their national legal provisions, to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators 
</p>
<p>in cases of abduction and enforced disappearance. 
</p>
<p>84. Finally, should the two Koreas reunite one day, the importance of justice and 
</p>
<p>accountability for the cases of abduction and enforced disappearance should not be 
</p>
<p>overlooked in the peace and reconciliation process that would ensue. Any transitional 
</p>
<p>justice process should seek the truth and ensure accountability and redress for the victims. 
</p>
<p>In this regard, the evidence and documentation gathered by the commission of inquiry and 
</p>
<p>the field-based structure will again prove most pertinent. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The commission of inquiry on the situation of human rights in the Democratic 
</b></p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea brought the focus on the human rights situation in the 
</p>
<p><b>country to an unprecedented new level. It triggered a welcome, though temporary, 
</b></p>
<p>engagement by the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea with 
</p>
<p><b>the international community. It is highly regrettable that the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>subsequently decided to suspend such dialogue. This posture of isolation is no longer 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainable.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>In this context, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that a two-track strategy 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be pursued when addressing the human rights situation in the Democratic 
</b></p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea<b>: undertaking efforts to ensure accountability for those 
</b></p>
<p><b>responsible for serious human rights violations, while continuously seeking 
</b></p>
<p><b>engagement with the authorities to bring relief to the people of the Democratic 
</b></p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 28 See A/HRC/25/63, para. 94 (a), and General Assembly resolution 69/188, para. 8. </p>


<p>87. <b>It is more than ever essential at the present juncture that the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>community redouble its efforts to effect meaningful changes in the Democratic 
</b></p>
<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea <b>by addressing the deeply worrying human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the country, in particular with regard to the issue of international abductions, 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforced disappearances and related matters. The international community owes it to 
</b></p>
<p><b>all the victims and their relatives who have endured enough suffering, and to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>people of both Koreas in their hopes for a peaceful future. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>In this regard, the Special Rapporteur wishes to make the following series of 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Human Rights Council to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Reiterate its absolute condemnation of the longstanding and ongoing 
</b></p>
<p><b>systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations and other human rights 
</b></p>
<p>abuses committed in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea; <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Affirm the responsibility of the international community to protect the 
</b></p>
<p>people of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea and victims abroad from crimes 
</p>
<p><b>against humanity, </b>in view of the manifest failure of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
</p>
<p><b>of Korea to protect its own population from such crimes; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that the field-based structure of the Office of the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>High Commissioner for Human Rights tasked with following up on the commission of 
</b></p>
<p><b>inquiry</b>&#8217;s work can function with independence<b>, has sufficient resources and is not 
</b></p>
<p><b>subjected to reprisals or threats; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) </b>Urge the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to 
</p>
<p><b>invite the Special Rapporteur to undertake a fully-fledged visit to the country as soon 
</b></p>
<p><b>as possible and without any preconditions, in accordance with the terms of reference 
</b></p>
<p><b>for country visits by special procedures mandate holders,29 and more generally to 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperate with his mandate. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The S</b>pecial Rapporteur urges the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>Republic of Korea to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Immediately halt all the human rights violations identified by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>commission of inquiry in its report; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Resume dialogue with, and consider reissuing the invitations extended to 
</b></p>
<p><b>all the stakeholders concerned, including the Special Rapporteur and the Office of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Engage genuinely in bilateral talks with the Republic of Korea and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Japan, and abide by the terms of bilateral agreements concluded, first and foremost in 
</b></p>
<p><b>the interest of the victims and their families; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Cooperate with the United Nations human rights mechanisms, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, notably by granting them access to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country with a view to, inter alia, assisting and assessing the implementation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations accepted during the second cycle of the universal periodic review. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls on Member States to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure that the Security Council holds regular briefings on the situation 
</b></p>
<p>in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, with the participation of the High

<p> 29 E/CN.4/1998/45. </p>


<p><b>Commissioner for Human Rights and other relevant experts, including the Special

</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Facilitate the work of the field-based structure and the Special 
</b></p>

<p><b>Korea to take specific steps to facilitate and verify the implementation of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations accepted during the first and second cycles of the universal periodic 
</b></p>
<p><b>review; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Fully involve civil society actors in Memb</b>er States&#8217; efforts to address the

</b></p>
<p><b>the commission of inquiry, with a view to improving the situation of human rights in

</b></p>
<p><b>(g) </b>Protect the people from the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea who 
</p>
<p>have sought refuge in, or are transiting through, a Member State&#8217;s territory by

<p><b>(h) Make use of the principle of universal jurisdiction to realize and

<p>People&#8217;s Republic of Korea from further crimes against h<b>umanity. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls on the United Nations system as a whole to 
</b></p>
<p>address the grave human rights situation in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of 
</p>
<p><b>Korea in a coordinated and unified manner, in line with the Secretary-</b>General&#8217;s

<p><b>of Korea, including by reporting on human rights violations committed by the 
</b></p>

</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Finally, the Special Rapporteur looks forward to sustained and resolute action
