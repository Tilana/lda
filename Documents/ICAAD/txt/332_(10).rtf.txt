8. I now turn to your mitigation. You have made useful oral and written mitigation. I am mindful of that. He mentioned;

"The accused is 22 years of age being born on 19/4/1990. She has studied up to Form 6 at Ahmadiya Muslim College. Shereen has also done a course in Certificate in Business Management from the Fiji National University. Further to this, she has done a course in MYOB and Advance MYOB from Aptech College and Australian Pacific Territory Institute. Apart from this, she has done a course on Fundamentals of Age Care from Caregivers Services International (Fiji) Limited.

The accused is a first offender. This is the first time for her to appear in any Court of law and promises that this will be her last as this is a good lesson learnt. She has been driving since 2007 which is almost 6 years now and has never been involved in any accident before. Apart from this incident, she has never been booked by any Police or LTA Officers."

9. You are a holder of clean driving licence for past 6 years. You asked forgiveness and leniency of this court. You are remorseful of your offence. You promise that you will not re offend. You asked non conviction as you are a first offender. I elaborated the circumstance of offending. 

10. In State v Ratuvou [2002] FJHC 140; HAA0060J.2002S (2 August 2002) her Ladyship Justice Nazhat Shameem differentiates the disqualification of Driving License under section 103(1) and 98(1) as follows;

"What is mandatory is a period of disqualification. The minimum mandatory term of disqualification (on first conviction) is 3 months. The Magistrate has a discretion to impose more than 3 months but may not impose-less.

11. However, you are a first offender. In sentencing, I draw my attention to sentencing principles which set out in Sentencing and Penalty Decree 2009.

 Section 4(2) provides;"In sentencing offenders a court must have regard to  

(a) the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence; .

(b) current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable guideline judgment;

(c) the nature and gravity of the particular offence;

(d) the offender's culpability and degree of responsibility for the offence;

(e) the impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; 

(f) whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, and if so, the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so; 

(g) the conduct of the offender during the trial as an indication of remorse or the lack of remorse;

(h) any action taken by the offender to make restitution for the injury, loss or damage arising from the offence, including his or her willingness to comply with any order for restitution that a court may consider under this Decree;

(i) the offender's previous character;

(j) the presence of any aggravating or mitigating factor concerning the offender or any other circumstance relevant to the commission of the offence; and 

(k) any matter stated in this Decree as being grounds for applying a particular sentencing option." 

12. I now draw my attention to Section 15(3) of SENTENCING AND PENALTIES DECREE 2009 no: 42 of 2009

 "As a general principle of sentencing, a court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in section 4, and sentences of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in this Part."

Now I turn to the Case law in this regard. 

13. In Prasad v The State [1994] FJHC 132; Haa0032j.94s (30 September19994) S W Kepa J enunciated that the fact that Appellants arefirst offendersought to be a very strong mitigating factor in their favour. A prison sentence ought to be the last resort after the court has explored and exhausted all other alternative sentences. (Emphasize is mine)

14. In Prasad v State [1994] FJCA 19; Aau0023u.93s (24 May 1994), Fiji Court of Appeal held that ".... Courts ought to bend backwards to avoid immediate custodial sentence forfirst offenders."

15. It has been noted in Prasad v The State [1994] FJHC 132 (Supra) that criminologists recognise that a prison sentence should be the last resort especially where afirst offenderis concerned unless the charge is very serious or the offender is dangerous and imprisonment is called for in the public interest or in the interest of the offender himself. (Emphasize is mine). 

16. Thus according to the Sentencing Principles, you could be sentence to 2 years imprisonment for count one and 12 months for count two. The intention of legislature is clear that no one able to control a vehicle under the influence of liquor. To protect innocent pedestrians and property, deterrent sentence is enacted by the legislation. In that sense you attract custodial sentence. But you are a first offender and save court's time and resources. I therefore think you should be given another chance. 

17. In considering all these facts and law, I act under sections 15(1) (f) and 45(1) of the Sentencing Penalty Decree. I enter a non conviction, but you pay following fines. This will not affect you're your career or future prospects. I impose following sentence on you. 

Count 1: $300 fine in default 30 days in imprisonment 

Count 2:$200 fine, In default of fine 20 days imprisonment for both counts. 

Driving License is disqualified for 3 months, but only on Sundays. LTA to be notified. 

18. 28 days to appeal.
