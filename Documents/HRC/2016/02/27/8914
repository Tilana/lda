<p><b>Report of the Secretary-General 
</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 9/4, 
in which the Council requested the Secretary-General to seek the views and information of 
Member States on the implications and negative effects of unilateral coercive measures on their 
populations and to report thereon to the Council. 
</p>
<p>2. On 8 June 2009, the Secretary-General sent a note verbale to Member States seeking 
their views and information. As of 24 June 2009, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights had received responses, summarized below, from the 
Governments of Belarus, Costa Rica, Iraq, Spain and Ukraine. The full text of the submissions is 
available from the Secretariat. 
</p>
<p><b>Responses from Governments 
</b></p>
<p><b>BELARUS 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: English] 
 [11 June 2009] 
</p>
<p>3. The Government stated that Belarus took a position to reject unilateral coercive measures 
of an economic or political nature. It recognized that such measures contradicted the founding 
principles and norms of international law, and were unacceptable in the context of civilized 
international relations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>4. The Government called on the Human Rights Council not to lose sight of the problem of 
application of unilateral coercive measures and to react immediately to any unlawful actions by 
States that are contrary to international law and the Charter of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p><b>COSTA RICA 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: Spanish] 
 [17 June 2009] 
</p>
<p>5. The Government indicated that Costa Rica, as a Member State of the World Trade 
Organization, respected and fulfilled the principles that govern the World Trade Organization, 
including the rejection of unilateral coercive economic measures. The Government further 
mentioned that, as a Member State of the United Nations, it respected international law, favoured 
the freedom of international trade and would endorse a limitation to such freedom only if it were 
imposed in accordance with international law and within the framework of the United Nations or 
the World Trade Organization.  
</p>
<p><b>IRAQ 
</b> [Original: Arabic] 
 [17 June 2009] 
</p>
<p>6. The Government recalled that article 32 of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of 
States adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974 
provides that no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of 
measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its 
sovereign rights.  
</p>
<p>7. In this context, the Government reported difficulties faced by Iraq since the fall of the 
previous regime. It stated that Iraq had suffered unilateral coercive measures imposed by some 
neighbouring countries, including the smuggling of people into Iraq, the encroachment upon the 
waters of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, the dumping of toxic industrial waste, and the forced 
deportation of Iraqi refugees. The Government also expressed concern over Iraqi migrants in 
other countries who were facing poverty, child labour, prostitution, financial deprivation and 
forced deportation.  
</p>
<p>8. The Government is committed to taking legislative and administrative measures in 
accordance with international human rights law and to concluding international treaties with its 
neighbouring countries to confront and curb unilateral coercive measures.  
</p>
<p><b>SPAIN 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: Spanish] 
 [24 June 2009] 
</p>
<p>9. The Government indicated that, as of the date of the response, no State was using or 
fomenting the use of unilateral coercive measures of an economic, political or any other nature 
against Spain. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>UKRAINE 
</b></p>
<p> [Original: English] 
 [23 June 2009] 
</p>
<p>10. The Government reaffirmed that it did not have any legislation or regulations regarding 
extraterritorial effects that could affect the sovereignty of other States and the legitimate interests 
of entities under their jurisdiction, or the freedom of trade. It further stated that it did not accept 
the application of unilateral coercive measures and that it adhered to the fundamental principles 
of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, and the freedom of trade in its 
relation with other States.
