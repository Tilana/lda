</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 Despite their limitations, international debt relief efforts have helped reduce the 
external debt burden of heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) and contributed to the 
creation of fiscal space for resources to be channelled to poverty-reducing expenditures and 
economic development in these countries. Evidence also suggests that the additional fiscal 
space has allowed some HIPCs to increase their public spending on essential, human rights-
related social services, such as health care and education, thereby contributing to the 
realization of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, in these 
countries.  
</p>
<p> Nevertheless, the voluntary nature of these debt relief measures has created 
opportunities for some commercial creditors to eschew such efforts and then attempt to 
recover the full value of their debt through litigation. These creditors &#8212; termed &#8220;vulture 
funds&#8221; &#8212; purchase the defaulted debt at significant discounts, hold out for other creditors 
to cancel their debts and then aggressively pursue repayments that are vastly in excess of 
the amount that they paid for the debt. These activities not only dilute the impact of debt 
relief by reducing the resources available to the targeted debtor countries to finance 
development and reduce poverty, they also diminish the capacity of indebted poor countries 
to create the conditions necessary for the realization of human rights, particularly 
economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p> The present report, which is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council 
resolution 11/5, is intended to draw global attention to the adverse impacts of vulture fund 
activities on debt relief and on the capacity of poor countries to fulfil their human rights

<p> The report has five sections. In section I, the independent expert introduces the 
report. In section II, the activities that the independent expert has undertaken since his last 
report to the Council (A/HRC/11/10) are outlined. In section III, the independent expert 
briefly discusses what vulture funds are and provides some illustrations of vulture fund 
litigation against HIPCs. He also outlines the impact of vulture fund activities on debt relief 
and their implications for the realization of human rights in the countries targeted by these 
predatory creditors. In section IV, the independent expert sketches official initiatives that 
have been undertaken or are being considered to combat vulture funds. In section V, he 
offers some recommendations on measures to address the negative effects of vulture fund 
activities.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 
11/5, in which the Council requested the independent expert on the effects of foreign debt 
and other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all 
human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, to submit analytical reports 
to the Council and the General Assembly on the implementation of that resolution.  
</p>
<p>2. In his report to the Council at its eleventh session (A/HRC/11/10), the independent 
expert outlined a preliminary conceptual framework for understanding the link between 
foreign debt and human rights, based on international legal standards. In his report to the 
General Assembly (A/64/289), he highlighted the relevance of the concept of illegitimate 
debt to international efforts to find a fair and sustainable solution to the debt crisis, and 
argued that human rights considerations must inform the formulation of the concept in 
precise terms. The present report is intended to achieve three objectives: (a) to draw global 
attention to the negative impacts of &#8220;vulture fund&#8221; activities on international debt relief 
efforts and on the capacity of indebted poor countries that have benefitted from debt relief 
to create the necessary conditions for the realization of human rights and attainment of their 
development goals; (b) to examine the measures and proposals designed to combat these 
speculative investors; and (c) to make recommendations concerning these initiatives. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities undertaken 
</b></p>
<p>3. Since he submitted his first report to the Council (A/HRC/11/10) in June 2009, the 
independent expert has engaged in a broad range of activities. The activities that he 
undertook during the period March to July 2009 are outlined in his report to the General 
Assembly (A/64/289).  
</p><p>4. From 31 August to 2 September 2009, the independent expert participated in the 
Social Forum of the Council in Geneva, at which he spoke on the impact of the global 
economic and financial crises on efforts to combat poverty. On 12 November, he 
participated in the inaugural meeting of the expert working group established by the United 
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), under its project on 
promoting responsible sovereign lending and borrowing, to provide technical and policy 
analysis to inform the discussions concerning principles that could promote responsible 
sovereign lending and borrowing. On 17 December, he issued a press statement in which he 
expressed regret at the decision of the British High Court that Liberia must pay a debt 
dating to 1978 to two vulture funds. This event and other initiatives detailed in this report 
informed the decision of the independent expert to focus the present report on vulture 
funds. 
</p>
<p>5. From 11 to 13 January 2010, the independent expert participated in a colloquium in 
Geneva on human rights in the global economy, which was organized by the International 
Council on Human Rights Policy in collaboration with Realizing Rights: The Ethical 
Globalization Initiative. On 21 January, he participated in a panel discussion on Millennium 
Development Goal 8, Targets B and D on debt relief, held by the High-Level Task Force on 
the Implementation of the Right to Development during its sixth session (14&#8211;22 January) in 
Geneva. During this event, the independent expert delivered a statement in which he 
critically assessed the achievements and limitations of the multilateral debt relief initiatives 
in response to statements by representatives of the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF).  </p>


<p>GE.10-13156 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>6. In addition, the independent expert undertook his first country missions to Norway 
(28&#8211;30 April 2009) and Ecuador (2&#8211;8 May 2009) at the invitation of the Governments of 
these countries. The main objective of the missions was to examine the unique roles of the 
two countries in the debate concerning illegitimate debt and to consider the effect, on the 
enjoyment of human rights, of the decisions by both countries concerning public debt, from 
the creditor and debtor perspectives. The official report on these missions is contained in 
the addendum to this report (A/HRC/14/21/Add.1). 
</p><p>7. For ease of reference, all United Nations documents related to the work of the 
independent expert, including reports to the General Assembly and the Council, 
interventions on foreign debt and human rights, and press statements, are available on the 
website of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights at www2.ohchr.org/ 
english/issues/development/debt/index.htm. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Vulture funds 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. What are &#8220;vulture funds&#8221;? 
</b></p>
<p>8. The term &#8220;vulture funds&#8221; is used to describe private commercial entities that acquire, 
either by purchase, assignment or some other form of transaction, defaulted or distressed 
debts, and sometimes actual court judgements, with the aim of achieving a high return. In 
the sovereign debt context, vulture funds (or &#8220;distressed debt funds&#8221;, as they often describe 
themselves) usually acquire the defaulted sovereign debt of poor countries (many of which 
are heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs)) on the secondary market at a price far less 
than its face value and then attempt, through litigation, seizure of assets or political 
pressure, to seek repayment of the full face value of the debt together with interest, 
penalties and legal fees.1 According to the African Development Bank (AfDB), vulture 
funds have averaged recovery rates of approximately 3 to 20 times their investment, 
equivalent to returns of 300 to 2,000 per cent.2 AfDB describes these recovery rates as 
&#8220;probably the highest in the distressed debt market&#8221;.3 At present, there are neither laws that 
limit the amount of interest or profit such funds can collect through litigation, nor 
regulatory frameworks that require disclosure of the amount such funds paid to purchase 
the debt. 
</p>
<p>9. It is difficult to state with precision how many lawsuits have been instituted by 
vulture funds. However, it is estimated that there have been over 50 lawsuits by commercial 
creditors against HIPCs and many of these are still outstanding.4 According to the World 
Bank and IMF, 54 court cases were instituted against 12 HIPCs between 1998 and 2008.5

</p>
<p>Of those, 33 had not been settled as of September 2008. In the majority of cases a court 
judgement had been granted, for an estimated total of $1.2 billion (excluding awards 
extinguished through Debt Reduction Facility buy-backs). The potential impact of court 
awards varied from less than 0.5 per cent of the debtor country&#8217;s gross domestic product 
(GDP) to 49 per cent in the case of Liberia.6  
</p><p>10. The 2009 report on the status of implementation of the HIPC Initiative and 
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative indicates that litigation by commercial creditors appeared 
to be &#8220;less of a problem&#8221; in 2009 as compared to the previous year and that the number of 
cases still pending declined from 33 in 2008 to 14 in 2009.7 However, the same report 
warns that &#8220;the threat of new litigation remains&#8221; and states that new lawsuits were initiated 
in 2008 against the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, the Sudan and 
Zambia.8  
</p>
<p>11. Commercial creditor litigation is not confined to HIPCs. According to a study by the 
Trade Association for the Emerging Markets (EMTA), at least nine non-HIPC countries 
have been the subject of such litigation.9 In a number of these cases, the litigating creditor 
was awarded what EMTA has described as &#8220;a substantial amount&#8221; relative to what was paid 
for the debt obligation in the secondary market, or to what other creditors who voluntarily 
exchanged their debt in the restructuring received.10  
</p>
<p>12. Vulture fund lawsuits tend to be instituted in the courts of the developed countries. 
This may be where the vulture fund is registered or it may be the jurisdiction specified in 
the loan agreement. Most lawsuits are filed in courts in the United States of America, the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and France, which are perceived as 
&#8220;creditor-friendly&#8221; jurisdictions. A small number of lawsuits have been filed in the courts 
of HIPCs. 
</p>
<p>13. It is notable that vulture funds are often secretive, both in terms of their ownership 
and operations, and many of them are incorporated in offshore financial centres and 
banking secrecy jurisdictions, commonly referred to as tax havens.11 Some are owned by 
large financial institutions such as hedge funds (often based in the United States) and in 
other cases their ownership is obscure. Often, companies are established to pursue a single 
debt. For example, Donegal International Limited, which sued Zambia in 2006 (see below), 
was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on 18 December 1997 by Debt Advisory 
International LLC, a company based in the United States and owned by Michael Sheehan, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that IMF only tracks private creditor lawsuits for HIPC Initiative eligible 
countries that have reached the decision or completion point.

<p>Initiative (MDRI) &#8211; status of implementation&#8221; (2009), para. 24. According to IDA and IMF, the drop 
in the number of active cases is attributable to Debt Reduction Facility operations in Nicaragua and 
Liberia, out-of-court settlements by Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and Zambia, 
and the discontinuation, by five creditors, of lawsuits against Nicaragua (para. 24).

 Many tax havens are located in Europe, or are dependencies or overseas territories of European 
</p>
<p>countries. See European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad) and others, &#8220;Addressing

<p>with the sole aim of pursuing a debt owed by Zambia to Romania. As at the time of its 
litigation against Zambia, Donegal was owned by Select Capital Limited, a company 
registered in the British Virgin Islands on 27 June 1997. In the <i>Donegal International</i> case, 
the court found that the &#8220;ultimate ownership of Select Capital (was) rather obscure&#8221; and in 
his testimony before the court, Mr. Sheehan said that Select Capital had been set up 
offshore because &#8220;many of the investors were European and did not want to be subject to 
US tax&#8221;.12  
</p>
<p>14. The independent expert supports the view that tax havens facilitate the secretive 
manner in which vulture funds operate as well as the flight of much-needed capital from 
developing countries.13 Consequently, he considers that a key priority for the international 
community should be to end this secrecy and lack of transparency. In his estimation, 
tackling tax havens would also help address money laundering, tax evasion and capital 
flight. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Case studies 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Liberia 
</b></p>
<p>15. In 1978 Liberia borrowed US$ 6.5 million from Chemical Bank, a company based 
in the United States.14 The bank sold the debt to FH International Financial Services Inc. 
and Sifida Investment Company S.A., which later brought an action for its recovery before 
a court in New York. On 19 June 2002, the court entered a default judgement against 
Liberia for approximately US$ 18.4 million. Following the judgement, the debt was 
assigned several times by FH International Financial Services and Sifida to third parties and 
back to the two judgement creditors. The debt was subsequently assigned to Hamsah 
Investments Ltd. (registered in the British Virgin Islands) and Wall Capital Ltd. (registered 
in the Cayman Islands).  
</p><p>16. In June 2008, Hamsah Investments and Wall Capital commenced proceedings in the 
High Court in London to register, as an English judgement, the judgement of the New York 
court.15 On 26 November 2009, the High Court ordered Liberia to pay the claimants more 
than US$ 20 million including interest. While it accepted that Liberia was &#8220;short of money&#8221; 
and that the judgement debt was &#8220;a substantial sum&#8221;, the court stated that Liberia &#8220;must do 
the best they can&#8221;.16 The court rejected the submission of Liberia that it had been unable to 
respond to the claim before the New York court because of the financial difficulties which 
it faced, particularly during the period of the country&#8217;s civil war.17 The court also held that

<p>the debt rescheduling agreements Liberia had reached with its Paris Club creditors did not 
affect the obligations of the State to the private companies.18  
</p>
<p>17. Liberia, an HIPC with a GDP of US$ 870 million, ranks 169th out of 182 countries 
in the Human Development Index.19 Over 94 per cent of the country&#8217;s population of more 
than 4 million lives on less than US$ 2 per day, while the unemployment rate is as high as 
85 per cent. Life expectancy is less than 50 years and only slightly more than a third of the 
population is literate. The estimated adult HIV prevalence rate is 1.7 per cent.20 The country 
is attempting to recover from the effects of a devastating civil war that include badly 
damaged infrastructure as well as limited or no access to safe water and sanitation or 
electricity for the majority of the population. The judgement debt of US$ 20 million 
payable by Liberia is equivalent to about 5 per cent of the budget of the Government of 
Liberia this year, the country&#8217;s entire education budget and 150 per cent of its health budget 
in 2008.21 Plainly, Liberia cannot service its debt without jeopardizing its poverty-reduction 
and economic development prospects, let alone pay an amount that the British High Court 
accepted was &#8220;a substantial sum&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>  Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>18. In 1980 and 1986 the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) and its 
national electricity company (Soci&#233;t&#233; Nationale d&#8217;&#201;lectricit&#233;) entered into credit 
agreements with Energoinvest, a Yugoslav company, to provide electrical infrastructure. 
The Government guaranteed the amount but by the late 1980s both the electricity company 
and the Government had defaulted on the debts. In 2003, the International Chamber of 
Commerce made two arbitral awards in favour of Energoinvest for US$ 18.43 million and 
US$ 11.725 million plus 9 per cent interest and the cost of arbitration. In 2004 the United 
States District Court for the District of Columbia confirmed the US$ 11.725 million arbitral 
award and in 2005 confirmed the US$ 18.43 million arbitral award. 
</p><p>19. Energoinvest then sold its interests in the arbitral awards and judgements to a 
company called FG Hemisphere (now FG Capital Management) which specializes in 
uncovering, investigating and managing alternative investment opportunities and special 
situations within the emerging markets.22 Subsequently, FG Hemisphere attempted to seize 
assets of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the Bahamas, Europe, South Africa, the 
United States and in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China. In 2005, the 
company obtained a court order compelling the State to furnish detailed information about 
all its assets throughout the world. The State failed to comply with the order, arguing that it 
imposed a virtually impossible burden. In May 2008, FG Hemisphere filed a motion in the 
United States District Court for the District of Columbia to hold the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo in contempt.23 In March 2009, the court fined the State the sum of US$ 5,000

</p>
<p>20. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has a GDP of US$ 11.6 billion and a 
Human Development Index ranking of 176, remains embroiled in a civil war.25 
Approximately 79.5 per cent of its nearly 66 million population lives on less than US$ 2 per 
day. Government expenditure on health is estimated at 7.2 per cent of GDP.26 With a debt 
burden deemed unsustainable by the World Bank and IMF, the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo cannot service its external debt obligations without harming its poverty-reduction 
and economic development prospects. It is currently going through the HIPC process; the 
court awards mentioned above threaten the country&#8217;s potential gains from international debt 
relief efforts and its capacity to create the conditions for fulfilling its human rights 
obligations.

<p><b>  Zambia</b>27<b> 
</b></p>
<p>21. In 1979 Romania lent Zambia US$ 15 million, which the latter used to purchase 
tractors and other agricultural machinery from the former. It appears that some of this 
equipment arrived in an unusable condition. This situation was compounded by the fact that 
European subsidies rendered it difficult for Zambia to compete in the global marketplace. 
Unable to raise enough revenue from its exports to service the loan, Zambia defaulted.

International to pursue the debt Zambia owed to Romania) started putting forward 
proposals to acquire the Zambian debt from Romania. In an obvious attempt to persuade 
Romania to accept its proposal to acquire the debt, Debt Advisory International sent a 
memorandum to Romania in May in which it stated:  
</p>
<p>We understand that Zambia is currently not servicing its debt to Romania and has 
not made any serious attempts to reschedule these claims in many years. 
Furthermore, Zambia is not likely to resume servicing its obligations to Romania in 
the near term. Zambia&#8217;s economic situation remains dire, and the country&#8217;s 
unsustainable external debt burden makes it one of the countries likely to benefit 
from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative &#8230; Under the HIPC 
initiative, Zambia will receive additional debt reduction from its bilateral creditors 
&#8230; In particular, bilateral creditors may need to write off up to 90 per cent of their 
Zambian claims and reschedule the remaining 10 per cent over 23 years or more. It 
is the practice of the Paris Club to require African Governments to agree a minute to 
the effect that they will not afford any other sovereign creditor better rescheduling 
terms than they have afforded the Paris Club. Consequently, we believe that there is 
very little chance that Romania can expect to obtain more in net present value terms 
that we are presently offering.28  
</p>
<p>23. In 1998, Romania agreed to sell the debt to Donegal International for US$ 3.2 
million subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions by Donegal. The company failed to 
meet one of these conditions, namely, meeting a deadline of 31 December 1998 for the 
completion of the assignment. In December 1998, the two countries commenced 
negotiations to liquidate the debt for US$ 3,281,780 and subsequently signed a

<p>memorandum of understanding to the effect that Zambia would have until 31 January 1999 
to confirm its offer to purchase the debt at its slightly higher offer of US$ 3.5 million. Just 
12 days before this deadline and, without prior notice to Zambia, Romania sold the debt to 
Donegal International for US$ 3.2 million. At the time, the debt had a face value of 
approximately US$ 30 million. 
</p><p>24. In September 2002, after unsuccessfully attempting to swap the debt for investments 
in Zambia, Donegal International commenced litigation in the British Virgin Islands for 
approximately US$ 43 million. In April 2003, in controversial circumstances involving 
allegations of corruption and bribing of public officials, Zambia signed a settlement 
agreement with Donegal International in which it agreed to waive sovereign immunity from 
litigation and pay around US$ 15 million of the then US$ 44 million face value. It also 
agreed to penal rates of interest in the event of default and to have any disputes determined 
under English law. Zambia paid a total of US$ 3.4 million in three instalments and 
thereafter stopped paying, arguing that the agreement was tainted with corruption and had 
been signed without the requisite authority. 
</p>
<p>25. In 2006, months before Zambia was due to receive debt cancellation under the HIPC 
Initiative, Donegal International instituted legal action against the country for US$ 55 
million &#8211; an amount that was nearly 17 times the amount the company paid for the debt. In 
February 2007, the British High Court ruled in favour of Donegal International. Despite 
having found that the owner of the company, Mr. Sheehan, was &#8220;deliberately evasive and 
even dishonest&#8221;, that he had &#8220;deliberately&#8221; given &#8220;false evidence&#8221;, that the company had 
&#8220;deliberately&#8221; withheld documents &#8220;because they contradicted the case that they were 
seeking to advance&#8221; and that &#8220;the evidence from the witnesses called by Donegal (was) 
vague and inconsistent&#8221;,29 the court held that Donegal International had a case in law. 
However, it subsequently ruled that Zambia had a real prospect of establishing that certain 
provisions of the settlement agreement were penal and therefore unlawful. It ordered 
Zambia to pay US$ 15.4 million (an amount equivalent to 65 per cent of the country&#8217;s 
savings in debt relief in 2006)30 to Donegal International. Under HIPC Initiative terms, 
Zambia could have expected 88 per cent cancellation of its debt. 
</p>
<p>26. This case underscores the need for debtor countries to fully comprehend the 
implications of formally recognizing claims arising out of sovereign debts sold on the 
secondary market.

<p><b> C. Vulture funds, debt relief and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>27. There are two main international debt relief schemes: the Heavily Indebted Poor 
Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The HIPC 
Initiative was created in 1996 with the aim of reducing the debt burden of the world&#8217;s 
poorest countries to &#8220;sustainable levels&#8221;.31 A comprehensive review in 1999 resulted in the

p. 65. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>31
 In order to qualify for debt relief under the HIPC Initiative, a country must: (a) have an unsustainable 
</p>
<p>debt burden (i.e. a net present value of debt-to-exports ratio, after traditional debt relief, of more than 
150 per cent); (b) establish a track record of policies and reforms through IMF- and IDA-supported 
programmes; and (c) have prepared a poverty reduction strategy paper through &#8220;a broad-based 
participatory process&#8221;. </p>


<p>GE.10-13156 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>Enhanced HIPC Initiative to ensure faster, deeper and broader debt relief with the core 
objective of poverty reduction. In 2005, the HIPC Initiative was supplemented by MDRI to 
help accelerate countries&#8217; progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. MDRI 
ostensibly provides countries that complete the HIPC Initiative with full debt cancellation 
from four main multilateral institutions: IMF, the International Development Association 
(IDA), African Development Fund (administered by AfDB) and the Inter-American 
Development Bank.32 
</p>
<p>28. As of end-July 2009, 26 of the 40 eligible countries had completed the HIPC 
Initiative and qualified for irrevocable debt relief, while a further 9 had reached the decision 
point and qualified for interim debt relief. In September 2009, the World Bank and IMF 
reported that the total debt relief committed to the 35 post-decision-point HIPCs under the 
initiatives was US$ 124 billion (in nominal terms), representing on average about 40 per 
cent of the 2008 GDP of these countries.33 Commercial creditors account for 6 per cent of 
the total cost of debt relief to be provided to the 35 post-decision-point HIPCs, but only 
around a third of this has been provided. 
</p>
<p>29. According to the World Bank and IMF, the two international debt relief initiatives 
have helped significantly reduce the external debt burden of HIPCs and contributed to 
creating the fiscal space necessary for poverty-reducing expenditure and economic 
development in these countries. Countries that have benefitted from debt relief have 
increased average spending on health and education and now spend on average six times 
more on these basic services than they do on debt service. The 2009 HIPC and MDRI status 
of implementation report indicates that between 2001 and 2008, poverty-reducing spending 
in the 35 post-decision-point HIPCs increased by 2 percentage points of GDP on average, 
while debt service obligations declined concomitantly.  
</p>
<p>30. There is a dearth of empirical studies on the impact of HIPC and MDRI debt relief 
on economic and human development. Nevertheless, a few studies show a positive 
correlation between the reduction in debt service and the increase in poverty-reducing 
expenditure. For example, a study by Crespo Cuaresma and Vincellette shows that average 
educational expenditures are about 18.5 per cent of total government expenditures in post-
completion-point HIPCs, which is 2 to 3 percentage points higher than in pre-decision-point 
countries.34  
</p>
<p>31. From a human rights perspective, reduced debt burdens and increased fiscal capacity 
have contributed to the creation of the conditions necessary for the realization of human 
rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, in HIPCs. Some of the human 
rights impacts of debt cancellation include the abolition of primary school fees in Ghana, 
Malawi, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia, resulting in increased 
school enrolments in these countries; abolition of user fees for health care in Zambia, 
thereby making basic health care available to millions of Zambians living in rural areas; 
and improvement of health care in Mauritania and the Plurinational State of Bolivia.35 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>32
 The initiative covers all post-completion point HIPCs. Debt relief covers all debt due to IMF, the 
</p>
<p>African Development Fund, and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) by end-December 2004 
and all debt due to IDA by end-December 2003 and still outstanding at the time of qualifying (i.e. 
after HIPC Initiative debt relief). See www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/mdri.htm.

</p>
<p>32. Nevertheless, the voluntary nature of the two international debt relief schemes 
discussed above creates opportunities for individual creditors to refuse to participate and 
then attempt to recover &#8212; through litigation, seizure of assets or political pressure &#8212; the 
full value of their debt.36 In particular, this has enabled vulture funds to purchase defaulted 
debts and to litigate for the full face value at the expense of the debtor country and of other 
creditors.  
</p>
<p>33. Vulture fund litigation prevents heavily indebted poor countries from using 
resources freed up by debt relief for their development and poverty reduction programmes, 
and therefore diminishes the capacity of these countries to create the conditions necessary 
for the realization of human rights for their people. Money that is earmarked for poverty 
reduction and basic social services, such as health and education, is diverted to settling the 
substantial claims of vulture funds. In short, vulture funds erode the gains from debt relief 
for poor countries and jeopardize the fulfilment of these countries&#8217; human rights 
obligations. 
</p>
<p>34. It has been estimated that the average potential impact of vulture fund litigation 
against HIPCs amounts to 18 per cent of spending on health care and education, 59 per cent 
of debt repayments, and 5 per cent of budget revenue. A 2007 study by Debt Relief 
International found that lawsuit costs amount to 52 per cent of health and education in the 
Niger and 98 per cent of revenue in Cameroon. In 2008, the World Bank and IMF 
estimated that the potential impact of court awards varied from less than 0.5 per cent of the 
debtor country&#8217;s GDP to 49 per cent in the case of Liberia.37  
</p>
<p>35. Vulture fund litigation can also be lengthy and costly for HIPC countries, thereby 
diverting much needed resources and attention from pressing development, social and 
human rights issues. According to AfDB, vulture funds &#8220;grind down poor countries in 
cycles of litigation&#8221; and many lawsuits typically take 3 to 10 years to settle.38 
</p>
<p>36. It is noteworthy that the World Bank and IMF have recognized that litigation by 
commercial creditors has been &#8220;an impediment to the delivery of full debt relief to 
HIPCs&#8221;.39 Similarly, the European Commission has acknowledged that cases of aggressive 
litigation by commercial creditors have diluted some of the benefits of debt relief 
initiatives. In 2007, the Paris Club acknowledged that litigation against HIPCs &#8220;is a cause 
of concern for the international community&#8221;.40  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Official initiatives to tackle vulture funds 
</b>37. A number of initiatives have been adopted or are being considered at the 
international and national levels to tackle vulture funds. In this section, the independent 
expert sketches these initiatives and briefly addresses some of the key concerns raised in 
relation to the potential adverse consequences of proposed national legislative measures on 
the development prospects of the intended beneficiaries &#8211; HIPCs.

<p><b> A. Multilateral initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>38. The IDA Debt Reduction Facility, established in 1989, provides grants to heavily 
indebted IDA-only countries to enable them buy back, at a significant discount, 
commercially held external sovereign debt.41 The facility provides grants for both the 
preparation and the implementation of commercial debt-reduction operations. In order to be 
eligible for support from the Debt Reduction Facility, countries must meet certain 
conditions, including the demonstration of &#8220;satisfactory performance under a medium term 
adjustment program&#8221; and implementation of a &#8220;satisfactory strategy for debt management 
that seeks comprehensively to address commercial debt, provides substantial relief from 
official bilateral creditors, and enhances the country&#8217;s growth and development 
prospects&#8221;.42 Since its inception, the facility has helped extinguish approximately US$ 10 
billion of external commercial debt. 
</p>
<p>39. In April 2008, changes were made to the policies and procedures of the Debt 
Reduction Facility to improve its effectiveness at assisting eligible countries to reduce their 
burden of sovereign commercial external debt and reducing the opportunities for 
commercial creditors to profit from litigation against HIPC countries. In terms of the 
modifications, formerly bilateral debts sold to commercial creditors and domestic debts 
sold to external creditors after the HIPC decision-point reference date are no longer 
considered eligible for buy-back. These changes aim to prevent distressed debt funds (i.e., 
vulture funds) from making a profit by buying claims at a deep discount and tendering them 
for a buy-back under the facility and to discourage the sale of debt from official to 
commercial creditors.43 
</p>
<p>40 Despite these successes and enhancements, the Debt Reduction Facility has a major 
limitation: participation by commercial creditors is entirely voluntary. In other words, the 
facility does not prevent a creditor from holding out and then suing to recover the full face 
value of its debt instrument. The case of Liberia illustrates this problem. In April 2009, 
commercial creditors provided debt relief to Liberia under a debt buy-back operation under 
the facility and contributions from bilateral donors, which extinguished US$ 1.2 billion of 
commercial debt at a deep discount of 97 per cent of face value. Despite this buy-back, the 
non-participating creditors continued to hold claims against Liberia worth 85 per cent of the 
cost of the facility buy-backs. In November, the British High Court ordered Liberia to pay 
more than US$ 20 million to two vulture funds (see para. 16 above). Thus, as the 
Government of the United Kingdom has acknowledged, the Debt Reduction Facility 
&#8220;cannot address the problem posed by creditors determined to pursue a higher payout than 
that given by HIPC Initiative terms&#8221;.44  
</p>
<p>41. In September 2006, the Commonwealth Secretariat established a Legal Debt Clinic 
to provide legal advice to both Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth HIPCs facing or 
likely to face litigation by commercial creditors. The clinic also aims to hold regional 
seminars to raise awareness about the legal aspects of debt management, legal soundness of 
loan agreements, debt restructuring and how to deal with litigation threats.45

</p>
<p>42. The Paris Club creditors have collectively committed not to sell claims on HIPC 
countries to creditors who do not intend to provide debt relief, and called upon other 
creditors to make the same commitment.46  
</p>
<p>43. In 2008, Commonwealth Finance Ministers issued a communiqu&#233; in which they 
&#8220;recognized the importance of Commonwealth creditors leading by example by providing 
full HIPC relief and not selling claims on to other creditors&#8221;.47 
</p>
<p>44. In May 2008, European Union countries pledged to take action to &#8220;deter aggressive 
litigation by distressed-debt funds&#8221; and agreed not to sell claims on HIPCs to creditors who 
are not willing to provide debt relief.48 They further agreed to support: (a) dialogue with 
other creditors (bilateral, multilateral and commercial) and with borrowing countries; and 
(b) technical assistance to strengthen the debt management capacities of low-income 
countries and assist efficient debt negotiations; and (c) commercial debt buy-backs 
complementary to HIPC debt relief operations.49 
</p>
<p>45. In June 2009, AfDB launched the African Legal Support Facility with the goal of 
maximizing resources available for economic development and social progress for its 
member countries by enhancing their access to technical legal advice in dealing with 
lawsuits and other claims brought by vulture funds, in addition to other ancillary areas.50 
The facility is designed to, among other things: (a) provide members of the facility involved 
in creditor litigation with legal advice and services; and (b) provide members of the facility 
with technical legal assistance to enhance their legal expertise and negotiating capacity in 
matters related to debt management; natural resources and extractive industries 
management and contracting; investment agreements; and related commercial and business 
transactions. 
</p>
<p>46. The independent expert welcomes the foregoing multilateral initiatives against 
vulture funds. However, he is of the view that they are insufficient to prevent vulture fund 
activity. All of these initiatives depend on voluntary commitments not to sell debt 
obligations on to speculative investors or they provide funds or technical legal support to 
heavily indebted poor countries. Further, as the European Network on Debt and 
Development has argued, multilateral initiatives to discourage vulture fund activity appear 
to have ignored the fact that &#8220;it is entirely legal for vulture funds to pursue their claims in 
court&#8221;.51 Significantly, these measures do not prevent speculative commercial creditor 
litigation against poor countries. Indeed, the potential for profit remains a strong incentive 
for vulture funds to continue their activities.52 The problem is aptly summed up in the

<p>words of Michael Sheehan of Donegal International: &#8220;Our experience and that of others in 
this business is that you always eventually recover. You have a legal claim. Eventually if 
you litigate and work hard enough, you will always recover a sufficient amount to cover 
your costs.&#8221;53 The independent expert therefore calls upon all countries &#8212; creditor and 
debtor alike &#8212; to urgently consider enacting legislation that would make vulture fund 
profiteering illegal within their respective jurisdictions.  
</p><p>47. The following section briefly reviews the legislative measures that have been taken 
or are being considered by individual countries to tackle the vulture fund problem. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Initiatives at the national level 
</b></p>
<p>48. At the national level, legislative proposals are being considered or have been 
adopted in the United States and the United Kingdom to limit vulture fund litigation against 
HIPCs. In Belgium, the Senate approved a Law in May 2008 which prohibited vulture fund 
litigation in that country.54 The law stresses that official development assistance funds are 
&#8220;untouchable and non-transferable&#8221;. The Senate also adopted a non-binding resolution 
which, inter alia, called upon the Government of Belgium to urge the World Bank and IMF 
to develop the necessary legal instruments to ensure that debt relief initiatives are binding 
on all creditors.55  
</p>
<p>49. In July 2009, Representative Maxine Waters introduced the Stop Very Unscrupulous 
Loan Transfers from Underprivileged Countries to Rich, Exploitive Funds Act, or the Stop 
VULTURE Funds Act (H.R.2932), in the United States House of Representatives. This 
legislation is designed to protect low-income developing countries from the predatory 
practices of vulture funds by preventing &#8220;speculation and profiteering in the defaulted debt 
of certain poor countries&#8221;. The proposed legislation (which is limited to countries that are 
eligible to borrow from IDA, the concessional loan facility of the World Bank) would make 
it illegal for any private creditor holding defaulted sovereign debt to use litigation in a 
United States court, or the threat of such litigation, to secure payment of more than the total 
amount they paid for the debt obligation plus 6 per cent simple interest from the date the 
debt was acquired from an eligible poor country. Companies or individuals that act in 
contravention of this law would be subject to fines in amounts equal to the sum they sought 
to claim through litigation. The legislation also seeks to promote transparency by requiring 
full disclosure from any private creditor seeking to litigate against poor countries in United 
States courts. 
</p>
<p>50. It is notable that the United States draft legislation recognizes that profiteering in 
defaulted sovereign debt is facilitated by the lack of insolvency protections for sovereign 
debtors that are available to private debtors. Insolvency laws generally protect private 
debtors by, among other things, stays of execution pending restructuring of debt, 
suspension of accrual of interest and the ability to discharge debts and obligations as part of 
a debt restructuring process.

</p>
<p>51. In July 2009, the Government of the United Kingdom launched a public consultation 
on possible legislation that would limit the extent to which vulture funds could recover debt 
already contracted by a HIPC under British law.56 In February 2010, the Government 
published a response to the consultation as well as an impact assessment in support of the 
Debt Relief (Developing Countries) Bill, a Private Member&#8217;s Bill introduced in the House 
of Commons in December 2009 by Andrew Gwynne MP.57 On 8 April, the Bill was passed 
into law as the Debt Relief (Developing Countries) Act (c. 22) and it received the Royal 
Assent on the same date. The Act, which has a duration of one year from the date of 
commencement (although it may be extended for a further period or made permanent), is 
designed to limit the ability of vulture funds to use courts in the United Kingdom to recover 
debts owed by HIPCs. 
</p>
<p>52. The initiatives that have been undertaken or are being undertaken in Belgium, the 
United States and the United Kingdom to curb vulture fund activity are commendable. The 
independent expert urges all countries, particularly those that are preferred jurisdictions for 
vulture funds, to urgently consider enacting legislation to curtail vulture fund activity. Such 
a course of action would be consonant with the commitment, made in the Monterrey 
Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development, by all countries 
to share responsibility for preventing and resolving unsustainable debt situations as well as 
with the recognition in the Monterrey Consensus of the role of comprehensive strategies in 
reducing the vulnerability of debtor countries.58 
</p>
<p>53. The independent expert believes that such legislative frameworks should include 
measures to promote transparency in the secondary debt market and to tackle tax havens. In 
addition, as the Jubilee Debt Campaign has suggested in relation to the legislative proposals 
in the United Kingdom, the legislation should not be limited to HIPCs but should extend to 
all developing countries, with HIPC terms applied to HIPCs and a profiteering cap applied 
to all other developing countries.59 
</p>
<p><b> C. Concerns over proposed legislative controls on vulture funds 
</b></p>
<p>54. There has been some opposition to legislative proposals to curb vulture fund activity 
based on the concerns that, among other things, the proposed legislative controls offer 
minimal benefits to the beneficiary countries, they have adverse consequences for the 
secondary debt market and may limit access to credit for the intended beneficiary 
countries.60 Due to space limitations, these concerns are addressed briefly.

Kingdom on proposed vulture fund legislation, EMTA &#8212; an organization which describes

<p>itself as &#8220;the principal industry trade association for the financial institutions worldwide 
that buy, sell and hold debt instruments issued by Emerging Markets countries and obligors 
located therein&#8221; and claims that it is &#8220;dedicated to promoting the orderly development of 
fair, efficient and transparent trading markets for Emerging Market instruments &#8230; and to 
helping to integrate the Emerging Markets more fully&#8221; into the international financial 
system61 &#8212; contends that the proposed legislation &#8220;while intended to provide a very limited 
&#8216;benefit&#8217; to certain highly indebted poor countries (HIPCs), would in fact negatively affect 
market access of all HIPCs, and therefore, limit their long-term prospects for development 
and economic growth, and jeopardize their further integration into the international 
financial system&#8221;.62 It further claims that the implications of the proposed legislation to the 
broader market include: &#8220;(i) a dramatic reduction of liquidity and price in the secondary 
market for defaulted claims, (ii) a corresponding reduction in the supply of credit and/or 
increased cost of financing for HIPC borrowers &#8230;, and (iii) potential increased cost of 
financing across the wider Emerging Markets, as creditors interpret this Legislative 
Proposal as hostile to creditor rights&#8221;.63 However, the submission fails to offer any cogent 
evidence to support the EMTA claims.  
</p>
<p>56. Contrary to the claims of the EMTA, legislation designed to protect debt relief gains 
from the predatory activities of vulture funds would not curtail the secondary debt market. 
Rather, it would enable the secondary debt market to function in a more transparent and 
efficient manner. The British legislation does not preclude creditors from obtaining 
recompense through the legal system for debts owing to them. It only prevents them from 
obtaining extortionate payments on sovereign debt at the expense of other creditors in much 
the same way that insolvency law does in relation to private debtors. 
</p>
<p>57. Vulture fund activity not only dilutes the gains from debt relief, it also complicates 
the debt relief process and undermines other creditors by forcing debtor countries to grant 
vulture funds preferential treatment at the expense of responsible creditors who may be 
involved in debt restructuring with the debtor countries. Unlike vulture funds, responsible 
secondary debt participants do not acquire sovereign debt for the sole purpose of enforcing 
payment of usurious interest rates from impoverished countries. Responsible and ethical 
creditors therefore have nothing to fear from the proposed legislation. 
</p>
<p>58. Further, vulture fund litigation and freezing of the assets of debtor countries in the 
course of such litigation jeopardizes the servicing of debt obligations by the affected 
countries. It also inhibits trade and investment relations with developing countries.64 
Illustratively, in 2001, the vulture funds FG Hemisphere Associates LLC and Af-Cap sued 
CMS Nomeco, an oil and gas company in Texas, in a bid to garnish payments that CMS 
Nomeco owed to the Republic of the Congo.65 In 2008, FG Hemisphere Associates 
approached the High Court of Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China to try to 
force the China Railway Group to hand over part of its infrastructure investment in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo. Such actions provide a disincentive for companies to 
trade with or invest in countries targeted by vulture funds and therefore harm the 
development prospects of these countries.66

<p>59. According to a joint World Bank and IMF report, pending litigation and outstanding 
court awards may also prevent HIPCs from regularizing financial relationships with the 
international banking community.67 
</p>
<p>60. EMTA also claims that &#8220;the process of commercial creditor debt renegotiation and 
debt relief within the HIPC Initiative framework is already functioning effectively without 
legislative intervention&#8221;.68 To buttress its claims, it relies on the example of the Liberia 
Debt Reduction Facility buy-back operation in April 2009 which saw US$ 1.2 billion of 
commercial debt extinguished at 97 per cent of face value. However, EMTA expediently 
omits to mention that participation in Debt Reduction Facility buy-back operations is 
voluntary and the facility does not prevent hold-outs by creditors, as the case of <i>Hamsah 
Investments Ltd v. Liberia</i>,69 discussed in section III above, clearly demonstrates.  
</p>
<p>61. In its consultation paper on vulture fund legislation, the Government of the United 
Kingdom acknowledges the successful Liberian buy-back operation but cautions that &#8220;the 
non-participating creditors continue to hold claims against Liberia worth 85% of the cost of 
the Debt Reduction Facility buybacks&#8221;.70 Further, the World Bank and IMF have repeatedly 
emphasized that while the HIPC Initiative has helped reduce the external debt burdens of 
HIPCs, a number of challenges remain, including ensuring that HIPCs get full debt relief 
from all creditors, including private creditors.71 This underscores the pressing need for 
legislative measures to combat predatory creditor activity. 
</p>
<p>62. In the estimation of the independent expert, the EMTA submission and similar 
concerns by other proponents of vulture funds appear to be based on the erroneous 
assumption that markets have efficient, self-correcting mechanisms. As the recent financial 
crisis has amply demonstrated, this assumption is fundamentally mistaken. It is precisely 
the lack of State regulation that facilitated the abuses that manifested themselves in the 
financial crisis.72 In the Outcome of the Conference on the World Financial and Economic 
Crisis and Its Impact on Development, Governments recognized that the crisis was caused 
by &#8220;regulatory failures, compounded by over-reliance on market self-regulation, overall 
lack of transparency, financial integrity and irresponsible behaviour &#8230;&#8221;.73 Vulture funds 
are part of this flawed international financial system. Consequently, measures to reform the 
global financial system must include measures to curb profiteering by unethical commercial 
creditors. In this regard, it is worth recalling that the Monterrey Consensus recognizes that 
the orderly development of capital markets aimed at addressing development financing 
needs and nurturing productive investments requires &#8220;a sound system of financial 
intermediation, transparent regulatory frameworks and effective supervisory mechanisms&#8221;

 The financial crisis started as the &#8220;sub-prime mortgage crisis&#8221; in the United States in August 2007 and 
</p>
<p>then erupted into a global credit crisis in September 2008. It was caused by a combination of factors, 
including loose monetary policy, deregulation, excessive risk taking by banks and the explosion of 
credit/debt between 2002 and 2007. See UNCTAD, <i>The Global Economic Crisis: Systemic Failures

<p>63. A further claim in the EMTA submission is that the British legislative proposal 
would appear to put the United Kingdom in contravention of international treaties that 
guarantee actionable property rights, such as the European Convention on Human Rights.74 
This submission appears to be based on the misguided notion that the right to property is an 
absolute right. Human rights supervisory bodies have made clear that a State is entitled to 
limit or control the use of property (including contractual rights with an economic value) in 
accordance with the general interest by enforcing such laws as it deems necessary for the 
aim pursued.75 The limitation imposed by the Debt Relief (Developing Countries) Act is a 
&#8220;control of use&#8221; rather than a deprivation since there is no practical or legal extinction of 
the rights of ownership. Significantly, the Act does not preclude creditors from seeking 
reasonable recompense but merely seeks to prevent them from profiteering at the expense 
of indebted poor countries as well as the taxpayers who have contributed to international 
debt relief efforts. There are also compelling public interest grounds for reducing the 
recoverability of debts and judgements by vulture funds, namely, that the Act promotes 
fairness among creditors and that it promotes the development of HIPCs. 
</p>
<p>64. It is noteworthy that EMTA includes among its members a number of vulture funds 
(such as Elliott Associates, Debt Advisory International and Greylock Capital), as well as 
law firms such as Allen &amp; Overy (which represented Donegal International in its lawsuit 
against Zambia) and Dechert LLP (which represented the two vulture funds, Hamsah 
Investments and Wall Capital, in their lawsuit against Liberia). It may therefore be asserted 
that the EMTA opposition to legislative measures to curtail vulture fund activity is actuated 
more by self-interest than a real concern for the development prospects of poor countries. 
</p>
<p>65. Governments have a responsibility to intervene &#8220;when markets fail to create the 
conditions in which all people, including the poorest and most marginalized, can exercise 
the full range of their human rights&#8221;.76 Although the consultation paper does not explicitly 
state so, it can be argued that the British legislation is ultimately intended to help HIPCs 
create the necessary conditions for the realization of the basic rights of their citizens and the 
right to development. This would be in keeping with the spirit of international assistance 
and cooperation recognized in the Charter of the United Nations and binding international 
human rights instruments such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights which the United Kingdom has ratified.77 
</p>
<p>66. It is clear that existing laws in the &#8220;creditor-friendly&#8221; jurisdictions cannot effectively 
protect poor countries from predatory creditor activity. The case of <i>Donegal International 
Ltd v. Republic of Zambia &amp; Another</i>78provides a good illustration of the problem. In that 
case, the British High Court, while accepting that Zambia &#8220;is a poor country&#8221;, stressed that 
it was concerned with the &#8220;legal questions&#8221; raised by the applications before it and &#8220;not 
with questions of morality or humanity&#8221;.79 This underlines the need for Governments to

<p>implement legislative measures (which the courts would be bound to apply) to protect 
vulnerable countries from vulture fund activity. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>67. <b>Despite their limitations, international debt relief initiatives have helped reduce 
the debt burdens of heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) and create fiscal space 
for poverty-reducing expenditures in these countries. There is some evidence that 
reduced debt burdens and improved fiscal space has led to increased investment in 
essential social services related to human rights, such as health and education, in these 
countries. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Nevertheless, the voluntary nature of international debt relief schemes has 
created opportunities for vulture funds to acquire defaulted sovereign debt at vastly 
reduced prices and then seek repayment of the full value of the debt through 
litigation, seizure of assets or political pressure. While the debts held by vulture funds 
do not represent the bulk of poor countries&#8217; debt, awards in vulture fund lawsuits 
represent a considerable burden on the budgets of these countries. Further, vulture 
fund activities complicate sovereign debt restructuring by causing inequitable burden 
sharing among creditors, and undermine trade and investment relations of the 
countries that they target. They may also hamper efforts by HIPCs to normalize their 
financial relationships with the international banking community. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>By forcing HIPCs, through litigation and other means, to divert financial 
resources saved from debt cancellation, vulture funds diminish the impact of, or dilute 
the potential gains from, debt relief for these countries, thereby undermining the core 
objectives of internationally agreed debt relief measures. Vulture funds profiteer at 
the expense of both the citizens of HIPCs and the taxpayers of countries that have 
supported international debt relief efforts. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>From a human rights perspective, the settlement of excessive vulture fund 
claims by poor countries with unsustainable debt levels has a direct negative effect on 
the capacity of the Governments of these countries to fulfil their human rights 
obligations, especially with regard to economic, social and cultural rights, such as the 
rights to water and sanitation, food, health, adequate housing and education. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The various initiatives (including the creation of legal support funds, voluntary 
codes and provision of legal advice) that have been undertaken at the international 
level to address vulture fund activity have all contributed towards addressing the 
negative effects of vulture fund activity on debt relief. However, these initiatives are 
insufficient. Given that the success rate of past litigation may generate more lawsuits 
against HIPCs, more concrete, legally enforceable measures are urgently required to 
curb predatory creditor activity and preserve the gains from international debt relief 
efforts.  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Consideration should be given to making international debt relief schemes 
legally binding on all creditors (including commercial creditors). This would help 
prevent the exploitation of the proceeds of debt cancellation by unscrupulous 
creditors.  
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The absence of an international insolvency procedure concerning defaulted 
sovereign debt creates opportunities for vulture funds to profiteer at the expense of 
HIPCs and other creditors. Consequently, urgent consideration should be given to the 
establishment of a fair and transparent debt resolution mechanism at the 
international level. As the independent expert intimated in his report to the General </b></p>


<p>GE.10-13156 <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>Assembly (A/64/289, para. 52), an independent and impartial international debt 
resolution mechanism based on the principles of equity, transparency, inclusion and 
participation would help resolve sovereign debt repayment difficulties and disputes 
fairly and efficiently.</b>80 
</p>
<p>74. <b>The international community should adopt legally binding standards on 
responsible sovereign lending and borrowing which should contain provisions 
restricting the right of creditors to unilaterally assign debt obligations to third parties 
without the prior informed consent of the debtor. In this regard, the independent 
expert calls upon all countries to support the United Nations Conference on Trade 
and Development project on promoting responsible sovereign lending and borrowing. 
In addition, it may be necessary to consider whether a secondary market for sovereign 
debt is appropriate, while remaining aware of the importance of the secondary 
market for other types of debt. 
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The independent expert welcomes the initiatives undertaken or under 
consideration in Belgium, the United Kingdom and the United States to combat 
vulture fund activity. In particular, he commends the United Kingdom for passing 
legislation to protect poor countries against vulture fund lawsuits and to safeguard the 
gains from international debt relief efforts. He urges the United Kingdom to make the 
Debt Relief (Developing Countries) Act permanent upon expiry of its initial period of 
validity with such enhancements as may be appropriate. He also urges all other 
countries, particularly the major creditor countries, to urgently consider 
implementing legal frameworks to curtail predatory vulture fund activities within 
their jurisdictions. These measures would be consistent with the principle of the 
shared responsibility of creditors and debtors for resolving unsustainable debt 
situations which is enshrined in the Monterrey Consensus.</b>81  
</p>
<p>76. <b>Such legislation should not be limited to HIPCs but should cover a wider group 
of poor countries (particularly those eligible for International Development 
Association lending) and should, in view of the negative effects of the global recession 
on the budgets of many developing countries, cover post-HIPC debts, original debts 
(some of which may be of questionable legitimacy) and court judgements which have 
already been obtained.</b>82<b> Additionally, the legislation should promote transparency in 
the secondary debt market by compelling full disclosure (to the courts and other 
appropriate national authorities), by creditors seeking to sue developing countries for 
recovery of debt, of information concerning loan amounts, procurement 
documentation and details of the creditors.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The independent expert calls upon creditor countries to support the African 
Legal Support Facility and the Legal Debt Clinic of the Commonwealth Secretariat 
both politically and financially. He also urges debtor countries to avail themselves of 
the assistance proffered under these initiatives and, in particular, to enhance their 
own national legal expertise over time.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Borrower countries should also consider implementing legislative measures to 
assure transparency, participation and accountability in the negotiation, contraction, 
restructuring and settlement of public loans, and to provide for oversight of loan

transparency in the operation of these funds. Consequently, there is a pressing need

transactions with tax havens and sanctions on tax havens that do not cooperate as 
regards disclosure of information.</b>83 
</p>
<p>80. <b>The activities of vulture funds highlight some of the problems in the global
