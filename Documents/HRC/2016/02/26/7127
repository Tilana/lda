</p>
<p>tank shellings of a residential neighbourhood, and reiterating that all violence in all its 
</p>
<p>forms by all parties must cease,

<p>territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic and to the principles of the Charter of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Condemns</i> <i>in the strongest possible terms</i> such an outrageous use of force 
</p>
<p>against the civilian population, which constitutes a violation of applicable international law 
</p>
<p>and of the commitment of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, under Security 
</p>
<p>Council resolutions 2042 (2012) and 2043 (2012), to cease violence in all its forms, 
</p>
<p>including the cessation of the use of heavy weapons in population centres;
