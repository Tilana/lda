Moreover, on 11 March 1987, the Commission adopted resolution 1987/50, in which it 
reiterated its previous calls for the full restoration of all human rights to the population of 
Cyprus, in particular to the refugees; called for the tracing of and accounting for missing 
persons in Cyprus without any further delay; and called for the restoration and respect of 
the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Cypriots, including freedom of 
movement, the freedom of settlement and the right to property. It is in this light that the 
present report reflects a variety of human rights-related issues. 
</p>
<p> In its decision 2/102, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General 
and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue with the 
fulfilment of their activities, in accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the 
Commission on Human Rights and to update the relevant reports and studies. The Office of 
the High Commissioner (OHCHR) understands decision 2/102 to preserve the previous 
annual reporting cycle in respect of this issue until otherwise decided by the Council. The 
most recent annual report on the question of human rights in Cyprus was submitted to the 
Council at its sixteenth session (A/HRC/16/21). 
</p>
<p> The present report covers the period from 1 December 2010 to 30 November 2011. 
It provides an overview of human rights concerns in Cyprus, including the right to life and 
the question of missing persons, the principle of non-discrimination, freedom of movement, 
property rights, freedom of religion and cultural rights, freedom of opinion and expression, 
the right to education as well as with regard to a gender perspective. For the purpose of the 
report, in the absence of an OHCHR field presence in Cyprus or of any specific monitoring 
</p>

<p>mechanism, OHCHR has relied on a variety of sources with particular knowledge of the 
human rights situation on the island.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 13 February 1975, the Commission on Human Rights adopted resolution 4 
(XXXI) on the question of human rights in Cyprus, in which the Commission, inter alia, 
called upon all parties concerned to adhere strictly to the principles of the Charter of the 
United Nations, international instruments in the field of human rights and the relevant 
resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council and to take urgent measures 
for the return of all refugees to their homes in safety. In the subsequent resolution 4 
(XXXII) of 27 February 1976, the Commission recommended that the communities do their 
utmost to find a just and lasting peaceful solution to the Cyprus problem based on respect 
of the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and non-alignment of the Republic of 
Cyprus, which solution would also guarantee the full enjoyment in mutual confidence by 
the whole population of Cyprus of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. Furthermore, in its resolution 1987/50 of 11 March 1987, the Commission on 
Human Rights reiterated its previous calls for the full restoration of all human rights to the 
population of Cyprus, in particular to the refugees; called for the tracing of and accounting 
for missing persons in Cyprus without any further delay; called for the restoration and 
respect of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all Cypriots, including freedom of 
movement, the freedom of settlement and the right to property; and requested the Secretary-
General to provide the Commission, at its forty-fourth session, with information relevant to 
the implementation of resolution 1987/50. Reports on the question of human rights in 
Cyprus were presented annually to the Commission and, since 2007, to the Human Rights 
Council.1<b> 
</b></p>
<p>3. As at 30 November 2011, Cyprus remains divided, with a buffer zone maintained by 
the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). The UNFICYP mandate, 
which is contained in Security Council resolution 186 (1964), has been extended by 
successive Council resolutions. In resolution 1986 (2011), the Council decided to extend 
the mandate for a further period ending 15 December 2011.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>4. UNFICYP has continued to provide humanitarian assistance to the communities, 
including to Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the north and Turkish Cypriots living 
in the south of the island. Assistance continued to be sought from the mission in addressing 
day-to-day issues arising from the division of the island, including in relation to economic, 
educational, medical and social matters. Furthermore, UNFICYP facilitated religious and 
commemorative events and assisted in addressing legal and humanitarian concerns 
resulting from the arrest and detention of Turkish Cypriots in the south and Greek Cypriots 
in the north. 2  UNFICYP has also maintained efforts to build trust between the Greek 
Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities, including in the mixed village of Pyla in the 
buffer zone. 3  Furthermore, building on previous cooperation, the Turkish Cypriot 
community of Louroujina village and the Greek Cypriot community of Athienou launched 
an initiative to restore a medieval chapel in the buffer zone. 4  In order to support

<p>reconciliation between the two communities, UNFICYP facilitated more than 180 bi-
communal events, with the participation of more than 9,000 people during the reporting 
period from 1 December 2010 to 30 November 2011.5  
</p>
<p>5. The process of full-fledged negotiations between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish 
Cypriot sides, aimed at finding a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem, was 
formally launched under United Nations auspices on 3 September 2008. In July 2008, the 
Secretary-General appointed his Special Adviser on Cyprus with the mandate to assist the 
parties in the conduct of the negotiations. Since then, the Greek Cypriot and Turkish 
Cypriot leaders have met 135 times, including 46 meetings held between 1 December 2010 
and 30 November 2011.6 During the latter period, the Secretary-General met with the Greek 
Cypriot leader, Demetris Christofias, and the Turkish Cypriot leader, Dervi&#351; Ero&#287;lu, in 
Geneva on 26 January and 7 July, as well as in New York on 30 and 31 October. Since July 
2011, considerable advances have been made in the areas of the economy, European Union-
related matters and internal aspects of security; however, much less progress has been made 
in the areas of governance, property, territory and citizenship matters. 7  The Secretary-
General noted the positive, productive and vigorous discussions held on 30 and 31 October 
2011, with both leaders affirming to him their belief that a settlement was possible and 
within reach.8 The Secretary-General invited the two leaders to meet with him again in 
January 2012, with the expectation that all internal aspects of a settlement will have been 
resolved by then in order to move to a multilateral conference shortly thereafter.9 
</p>
<p>6. In addition, meetings were held between the representatives of the two leaders and 
technical meetings at the expert level. Since September 2008, the technical committees on 
crime and criminal matters, cultural heritage, health matters and the environment continued 
to meet on the implementation of confidence-building measures intended to improve the 
daily lives of Cypriots. The remaining three technical committees, on economic and 
commercial matters, crisis management and humanitarian matters, which were dormant 
since 2008, resumed their work in 2011.10 
</p>
<p><b> II. Human rights concerns  
</b></p>
<p>7. The persisting division of Cyprus continues to have consequences for a number of 
human rights issues on the whole island, including the right to life and the question of 
missing persons, the principle of non-discrimination, freedom of movement, property 
rights, freedom of religion and cultural rights, freedom of opinion and expression, and the 
right to education, as well as with regard to a gender perspective. 
</p>
<p>8. In the core document forming part of the reports of State parties to United Nations 
treaty bodies, transmitted on 23 May 2011, the Government of Cyprus stated that it had 
been &#8220;prevented by armed force from exercising its authority and control, and ensuring 
implementation and respect of human rights in the occupied area.&#8221;11

<p><b> A. Right to life and the question of missing persons 
</b></p>
<p>9. According to article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to life, liberty and security of person. Furthermore, article 1 of the Declaration on 
the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance provides that any act of 
enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity, placing the persons subjected 
thereto outside the protection of the law and inflicting severe suffering on them and their 
families; any act of enforced disappearance also violates or constitutes a grave threat to the 
right to life.  
</p>
<p>10. The Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus 12  continued the exhumation, 
identification and return of the remains of missing persons. As a result of the inter-
communal fighting as well as the events of July 1974 and afterwards, a total of 1,493 Greek 
Cypriots and 502 Turkish Cypriots have been officially reported as missing by both 
communities to the Committee. As at 30 November 2011, the remains of 833 individuals 
had been exhumed on both sides of the buffer zone by the Committee&#8217;s bicommunal teams 
</p>
<p>of archaeologists; the remains of 483 missing persons had undergone examination at the 
Committee&#8217;s bicommunal anthropological laboratory in the United Nations Protected Area 
</p>
<p>in Nicosia; and the remains of 310 missing individuals (249 Greek Cypriots and 61 Turkish 
Cypriots) had been returned to their respective families.13 However, during the reporting 
period, the Committee&#8217;s access to military areas in the north has been restricted.14 In view 
of the humanitarian dimension of the issue, it is important that the Committee&#8217;s exhumation 
requirements are accommodated throughout the island, including in military areas in the 
north.15  
</p>
<p>11. On 9 June 2011, the European Parliament adopted a declaration in which it fully 
endorsed the work of the Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus and recognized its post-
conflict role in promoting truth, remembrance and reconciliation in Cyprus. Furthermore, it 
called on the European Commission to continue to allocate sufficient resources to the 
Committee to enable it to fulfil its important mandate and called on the Governments of 
Turkey and of Cyprus to continue to support the Committee&#8217;s work, to redouble efforts to 
account for those individuals still listed as missing, and to ensure that all information that 
could facilitate the mission of the Committee is made freely available to it. 
</p>
<p>12. In its resolution 1986 (2011) of 13 June 2011, the Security Council welcomed the 
progress and continuation of the important activities of the Committee on Missing Persons 
in Cyprus, trusting that this process would promote reconciliation between the 
communities. The Council also noted with regret, however, that the sides were withholding 
access to the remaining minefields in the buffer zone, noting the continued danger posed by 
mines in Cyprus. In this context, the Council called on both sides to allow access to 
deminers and to facilitate the removal of the remaining mines in Cyprus within the buffer 
zone, and urged both sides to extend demining operations outside the buffer zone. 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 12 The Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus was established in April 1981 by agreement between 
</p>
<p>the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities under the auspices of the United Nations. It is 
mandated to look into cases of persons reported missing in the inter-communal fighting as well as in 
the events of July 1974 and afterwards, however, according to its terms of reference it neither 
attempts to attribute responsibility for the death of any missing persons nor makes findings as to the 
cause of such deaths.

<p>13. The Committee of Ministers&#8217; Deputies of the Council of Europe, which supervises 
the execution of judgements of the European Court of Human Rights, examined the case of 
<i>Cyprus v. Turkey</i>16 at its 1128th meeting, held from 29 November to 2 December 2011. 
With regard to the question of missing persons, the Deputies &#8220;renewed with insistence their 
calls on the Turkish authorities to ensure the CMP&#8217;s access to all relevant information and 
places without impeding the confidentiality essential to the carrying-out of its mandate, to 
inform the Committee of the measures envisaged in the continuity of the CMP&#8217;s work with 
a view to the effective investigations required by the judgment and to provide responses to 
the questions posed by the Committee&#8221;. 17  Furthermore, the Committee of Ministers&#8217; 
Deputies deeply regretted the refusal of Turkey to participate in the discussions, called on 
the defendant State to fully cooperate with the Committee and decided to take up this 
question again at its 1136th meeting in March 2012.18 
</p>
<p><b> B. Non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>14. According to article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, all are equal 
before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law.19 
Furthermore, all are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and against any incitement to such 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>15. Cyprus is still considered to have the highest proportion of internally displaced 
persons in terms of the percentage of its population (up to 23 per cent).20 In the area under 
the control of the Government of Cyprus, there were up to 208,000 of internally displaced 
persons at the end of 2010, including 83,000 people born to men with displaced status. 
Unlike children whose fathers have displaced person status, the children of women with the 
same status do not receive a refugee identity card but instead are given a certificate by 
descent. While the Parliament of Cyprus had in June 2010 adopted amendments to the 
Registry Laws and to the Law Providing Housing Assistance to Displaced and Other 
Persons with a view to granting the same status to children of refugee mothers as those of 
refugee fathers, the Supreme Court of Cyprus decided, on 1 February 2011, that these 
amendments were unconstitutional since they violated article 80, paragraph 2, of the 
Constitution, which provides that no bill relating to an increase in budgetary expenditure 
could be introduced by any member of Parliament.21 However, on 5 October 2011, the 
Government of Cyprus approved the proposal of the Ministry of the Interior to introduce 
support measures for children of refugee mothers, and the Parliament adopted a law thereon 
on 17 November 2011. Consequently, children of refugee mothers would be entitled to low-
interest housing loans and to rental subsidies in the case of college students. 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 16 In its judgement on <i>Cyprus v. Turkey</i> (25781/94) of 10 May 2001, the Grand Chamber of the 
</p>
<p>European Court of Human Rights held that Turkey was responsible for 14 violations of the European 
Convention on Human Rights, grouped by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe into 
four categories: (1) the question of missing persons; (2) the living conditions of Greek Cypriots in 
northern Cyprus; (3) the rights of Turkish Cypriots living in northern Cyprus; and (4) the question of 
the homes and property of displaced persons.

November-2 December 2011 (CM/Del/Dec(2011)1128) on the case of <i>Cyprus v. Turkey</i> (application 
no. 25781/94).

<p>16. UNFICYP continued to assist Turkish Cypriots living in the south by liaising with 
local authorities and community representatives in their efforts to provide welfare services 
and to strengthen support mechanisms for vulnerable members of the Turkish Cypriot 
community in educational and social areas. 22  UNFICYP engaged in mediation at the 
operational and political levels to defuse rising tensions between the Greek Cypriot and the 
Turkish Cypriot communities, for example, following an incident on 21 December 2010, 
when a European club basketball match in south Nicosia between the visiting Turkish team 
of Pinar Karsiyaka and the Greek Cypriot team of APOEL Nicosia was marred by acts of 
hooliganism by Greek Cypriot fans against the Turkish team players. Cyprus police 
intervened decisively at the stadium, providing the team with protection until its departure. 
The incident was subsequently condemned by both sides.23  
</p>
<p>17. In its report on Cyprus of 23 March 2011, the European Commission against Racism 
and Intolerance referred to reported cases of Turkish Cypriots being targeted for attack and 
noted the assurance of the authorities that isolated incidents committed by individuals had 
been unreservedly and unequivocally condemned by the political leadership. In this context, 
the Commission recommended that the authorities ensure that all acts of racist violence 
were thoroughly investigated with a view to prosecution, and that the perpetrators were 
duly punished. 24  In the comments made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the 
Commission&#8217;s report, the Government of Cyprus recalled that, since 2003, &#8220;there has been 
almost no incidence of hostility and discrimination between Greek Cypriots and Turkish 
Cypriots&#8221;, noting that isolated incidents had been condemned by the Government and that 
</p>
<p>all necessary measures had been taken to bring to justice the people responsible for these 
actions.25 
</p>
<p>18. On 21 September 2011, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe noted 
as positive developments the efforts made, in view of the growing diversity of Cypriot 
society, to improve and complete the anti-discrimination legislative and institutional 
framework and to increase awareness about human rights, tolerance and the principles of 
equality and non-discrimination. It also referred to additional measures taken to enable 
Turkish Cypriots to more effectively participate in public affairs and social, economic and 
cultural life.26 However, the Committee also raised concern that persons belonging to the 
three &#8220;religious groups&#8221; protected under the Framework Convention are still obliged to 
</p>
<p>affiliate themselves either with the Greek Cypriot Community or the Turkish Cypriot 
Community, and that their members are obliged to vote to elect their representative to 
Parliament. The Committee recommended taking adequate measures to ensure, during the 
population census in 2011 and other forthcoming processes, effective implementation of the 
principle of self-identification, and urgent action to combat and sanction effectively all 
forms of discrimination and intolerance, including misconduct by members of the police 
force. 
</p>
<p>19. In its admissibility decision on the case of <i>Erel and Damdelen v. Cyprus</i> of 14 
December 2010, the European Court of Human Rights did not find that the requirement to 
have habitual residence in the Government-controlled areas of Cyprus to vote and to stand

 26 Resolution CM/ResCMN(2011)16 on the implementation of the Framework Convention for the 
</p>
<p>Protection of National Minorities by Cyprus, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 21 September 
2011 at the 1121st meeting of the Ministers&#8217; Deputies. The Council of Europe Advisory Committee 
had adopted its third opinion on Cyprus on 19 March 2010; see ACFC/OP/III(2010)002 and 
A/HRC/16/21, paras. 28-29. </p>


<p>for parliamentary elections was disproportionate or irreconcilable with the underlying 
purposes of article 3 of Protocol No. 1 concerning free elections. Furthermore, the Court 
did not find evidence that the applicants of Turkish Cypriot origin living in the northern 
part of the island had been discriminated against. In this context, the Court argued that there 
was objective and reasonable justification as well as a legitimate basis for distinguishing, 
for electoral purposes, between those Turkish Cypriots who chose to remain under the day-
to-day administration of the Turkish Cypriot authorities in the north and those who lived 
within the area controlled by the Government.27 
</p>
<p>20. The &#8220;direct trade regulation&#8221; proposed by the European Commission is still pending 
adoption.28 While the European Union Aid Programme for the Turkish Cypriot community, 
which seeks to encourage economic development in the northern part of the island, has 
continued, its implementation faces challenges, inter alia, in relation to cooperation and 
confidence-building between the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities, at both 
the people-to-people level and for doing business. The Aid Programme also comprises a 
number of projects aimed at addressing the gap and promoting reconciliation and 
confidence-building.29 
</p>
<p><b> C. Freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>21. According to article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State, as well as 
the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.30 
</p>
<p>22. In Cyprus, however, crossings between the north and the south of the island are still 
possible only through official crossing points, a situation that limits freedom of movement. 
During the period from 21 November 2010 to 22 October 2011, UNFICYP recorded more 
than 1.5 million official crossings through the buffer zone.31  
</p>
<p>23. The &#8220;Green Line&#8221; Regulation (EC) No. 866/2004 continues to define the terms 
under which provisions of European Union law apply to the movement of persons, goods 
and services across the line between the areas of Cyprus in which the Government does not 
exercise effective control and the areas in which it does. In the seventh report on the 
implementation of Council Regulation (EC) 866/2004, the European Commission noted 
that the Green Line Regulation provided a stable legal framework for the free movement of 
Cypriots, other European Union citizens and third-country nationals who cross the Green 
Line at authorized crossing points.32 While there was a slight fall in the number of Greek 
Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots crossing the line in 2010, the number of non-Cypriot 
European Union citizens and third-country nationals crossing the line decreased by 56 per

<p>with the northern part of the island should be governed directly by the European Union single market

the European Parliament has not put the proposal back on the Parliament&#8217;s agenda.

<p>cent. The Ledra Street/Lokma&#231;&#305; crossing point continued to account for the vast majority of 
crossings by foreigners, primarily tourists. 
</p>
<p>24. In his 2011 reports on the United Nations operation in Cyprus, 33 the Secretary-
General emphasized that the restrictions on the movement of locally employed United 
Nations civilian personnel regrettably continued, and called upon the Turkish Cypriot 
authorities to respect the freedom of movement of all United Nations personnel. 
Furthermore, in view of restrictions reportedly imposed on a journalist working for the 
Turkish Cypriot newspaper <i>Afrika</i> in May 2011, the South East Europe Media Organisation 
called upon the Turkish Cypriot authorities to respect the freedom of movement of 
journalists.34 
</p>
<p>25. With regard to freedom of residence, nine Maronite families and two Greek Cypriots 
asked UNFICYP to convey their request to reside permanently in the north. However, these 
requests remain under consideration by the Turkish Cypriot authorities.35 
</p>
<p><b> D. Property rights 
</b></p>
<p>26. According to article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to own property alone as well as in association with others, and no one shall be 
arbitrarily deprived of his property. 
</p>
<p>27. On 27 October 2011, the deadline for applications of Greek Cypriots to the 
Immovable Property Commission, 36 which was 21 December 2011, was extended for a 
further two years. As at 30 November 2011, a total of 2,453 applications had been lodged 
with the Commission; 191 of them have been concluded through friendly settlements and 
seven through formal hearing. The Commission has paid 62,310,510 pounds sterling to the 
applicants as compensation. Moreover, the Commission has ruled for exchange and 
compensation in two cases, for restitution in one case and for restitution and compensation 
in five. In one case, the Commission delivered a decision for restitution after the settlement 
of the Cyprus issue, and in another case it ruled for partial restitution. 
</p>
<p>28. Following the Grand Chamber admissibility decision in the case of <i>Demopoulos and 
others v. Turkey</i>, the European Court of Human Rights declared several applications 
concerning alleged violations of property rights in the northern part of the island 
inadmissible for the non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.37 In its Demopoulos decision of 
1 March 2010, the Grand Chamber had concluded that Law 67/2005 of December 2005,

<p>according to which all natural and legal persons claiming rights to immovable or movable 
property could bring a claim before the Immovable Property Commission, &#8220;provides an 
accessible and effective framework of redress in respect of complaints about interference 
with the property owned by Greek Cypriots&#8221;.38 The Grand Chamber had also stressed that, 
despite the fact that the Commission was recognized as a domestic remedy for cases 
involving Greek Cypriot properties in the north, the Demopoulos decision was not to be 
interpreted as an obligation to make use of the Commission. Claimants could choose to 
await a political solution; however, if they wished to lodge an application before the Court, 
its admissibility would be decided in line with the principles and approach of the 
Demopoulos decision.39 
</p>
<p>29. In cases where the European Court of Human Rights had already issued a judgement 
on the merits prior to the Demopoulos decision, however, the Court continued examination 
in 2011 of the applicants&#8217; claims for just satisfaction. For example, in the case of <i>Anthousa 
Iordanou v. Turkey </i>(just satisfaction), the Court held, on 11 January 2011, that Turkey was 
to pay the applicant &#8364;143,000 in pecuniary damage, costs and expenses following its earlier 
judgement of 24 November 2009, in which the Court found that the applicant had been 
denied access to and control, use and enjoyment of her properties in the north as well as any 
compensation for the interference with her property rights.40 The Court reiterated its case 
law according to which objections based on non-exhaustion of domestic remedies raised 
after an application has been declared admissible cannot be taken into account at the merits 
stage or at a later stage.41 Furthermore, in the case of <i>Loizou and others v. Turkey</i> (just 
satisfaction), the Court decided, on 24 May 2011, to award &#8364;1.3 million in pecuniary and 
non-pecuniary damages.42 
</p>
<p>30. On 13 and 14 September 2011, the Committee of Ministers&#8217; Deputies of the Council 
of Europe decided to classify under its enhanced procedure 33 individual cases concerning 
interference in property rights in the northern part of the island and/or respect for home.43 
Enhanced supervision is applied to cases requiring urgent individual measures or revealing 
important structural problems. It is also applied to repetitive cases linked to cases already

<p>classified in the enhanced procedure and to inter-State cases. In respect of the question of 
the homes and property of displaced Greek Cypriots, the Deputies at their 1128th meeting, 
took note of the request of the Cypriot delegation to the Committee of Ministers, to suspend 
its examination of this question in the <i>Cyprus v. Turkey</i> inter-State case until the European 
Court of Human Rights has pronounced itself on the recent application for just satisfaction, 
and the Deputies decided to continue their discussion on this question, along with that 
related to the property rights of enclaved persons, at their 1136th meeting in March 2012.44 
</p>
<p>31. The situation in Varosha, the former resort town near Famagusta which is currently 
under the control of the Turkish military, remains unchanged and the United Nations holds 
the Government of Turkey responsible for the status quo in Varosha.45  
</p>
<p><b> E. Freedom of religion and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>32. According to article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, which includes freedom to change 
his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public 
or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.  46 
Furthermore, according to article 27, everyone has the right freely to participate in the 
cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts as well as to share in scientific 
advancement and its benefits.47 
</p>
<p>33. Access to sites and icons of religious and cultural significance continues to be 
facilitated by UNFICYP. During the reporting period, the mission facilitated more than 30 
religious and commemorative events, involving more than 9,000 individuals, which were 
either held in or required crossing of the buffer zone.48  
</p>
<p>34. However, several incidents and problems for Greek Cypriots with regard to 
manifesting their right to freedom of religion or belief were taken up by the Special 
Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief and UNFICYP also made representations to the 
Turkish Cypriot authorities. 49  On 25 December 2010, Turkish Cypriot authorities 
interrupted a Christmas service for the Greek Cypriot residents in the Church of Saint 
Sinesios in Rizokarpaso and reportedly refused permission for the holding of Christmas 
mass in the Church of the Holy Trinity in the nearby village of Yialoussa. On 4 February 
2011, Christian worshippers on the Karpas peninsula were allegedly prevented from 
holding evening masses. On 17 March 2011, Turkish Cypriot authorities confiscated 100 
copies of the New Testament and 104 prayer books thatthe Greek Cypriot side had sought 
to transport to the north, and pilgrims to the Monastery of Apostolos Andreas were 
reportedly required to pay an entrance fee. Furthermore, Turkish Cypriot authorities 
rejected requests to hold religious services in Rizokarpaso on 25 March 2011, and in Vatyli 
on Easter Monday, 20 April 2011.

<p>35. In this regard, Turkish Cypriot authorities defended their actions on the basis that the 
long-standing authorization procedures had not been followed.50 In March 2011, Turkish 
Cypriot authorities revised existing procedures for Greek Cypriots to obtain permission for 
religious observances at places of worship in the north. Consequently, the minimum 
number of days required to make an application for religious services has been reduced to 
10 working days. Furthermore, Turkish Cypriot authorities indicated that Greek Cypriots 
living in the north could hold religious services on any day of the week without permission 
if they are conducted by two designated Greek Cypriot priests at three churches located 
near the areas where they reside. 
</p>
<p>36. Archbishop Chrysostomos II of the Greek Orthodox Autocephalous Church of 
Cyprus and New Justinian complained to the European Court of Human Rights that he, the 
Church and its parishioners had been continuously prevented from holding religious 
services in the religious sites situated in the northern part of the island, which they were 
forced to leave in 1974. The Archbishop claimed that many properties had been destroyed, 
vandalized, looted or stripped of their religious function and that ecclesiastical vessels had 
been destroyed or sold. However, in its admissibility decision of 4 January 2011, the Court 
noted that the complaints with regard to freedom of religion were closely linked to the 
applicant&#8217;s inability to enjoy the property concerned. In this regard, the Court found that 
domestic remedies had not been exhausted before the Immovable Property Commission, 
&#8220;which is able both to order restitution of property and to award pecuniary and non-
pecuniary damages in respect of any loss of enjoyment of the property&#8221;.51 Consequently, 
the complaints concerning property issues were rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic 
remedies and the Court held that the complaints concerning freedom of religion and 
freedom of assembly did not raise any separate issues. 
</p>
<p>37. The Turkish Cypriot authorities also voiced concern at alleged limitations on 
freedom of religion or belief negatively affecting the more than 1,000 Turkish Cypriots 
living in the south.52 They are reportedly allowed to worship only in two mosques, namely, 
the Hala Sultan Tekke Mosque in Larnaca and the Koprulu Mosque in Limassol. In 
addition, the Greek Cypriot authorities reportedly do not allow for the designation of 
Turkish Cypriot Imams by their religious authorities to the mosques located in the south. 
Furthermore, during the annual Turkish Cypriot pilgrimage to Hala Sultan Tekke in August 
2011, only some of the Turkish Cypriots were able to cross the buffer zone owing to the 
lack of a clear advance agreement on procedures. In protest, the Turkish Cypriots cancelled 
a follow-on visit to the same mosque; UNFICYP intervention helped to defuse the 
tension.53 
</p>
<p><b> F. Freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>38. According to article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions 
without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any 
media and regardless of frontiers.54 
</p>
<p>39. With regard to freedom of expression in the north, during the period under review, it 
was reported that journalists of the Turkish-language daily newspaper <i>Afrika</i> were attacked 
</p>

<p>and received death threats in response to critical reporting on Turkey&#8217;s policy with regard 
to the northern part of the island.55 On 25 February, unknown attackers opened fire on the 
newspaper&#8217;s office door and left a note that the journalists would be targeted next. On 2 
March, the newspaper&#8217;s editor-in-chief reportedly received a death threat. One day after the 
publication of new information about the case of a Turkish Cypriot journalist who had been 
murdered in 1996, on 3 July, an armed man came to the <i>Afrika</i> office and shot at one of the 
newspaper employees who opened the door. In addition, on 1 November, Turkish Cypriot 
authorities forcefully entered the newspaper&#8217;s premises and removed from the building&#8217;s 
balcony a banner consisting of old newspaper headlines. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>40. According to article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to education.56 Education should be directed to the full development of the human 
personality and the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; it 
should promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or 
religious groups, and it should further the activities of the United Nations for the 
maintenance of peace. Furthermore, parents have a prior right to choose the kind of 
education that is given to their children. 
</p>
<p>41. In the north, UNFICYP continues to facilitate the delivery of textbooks and the 
appointment of teachers to the elementary and secondary Greek Cypriot schools in the 
Karpas peninsula.57 As in previous years, the Turkish Cypriot authorities objected to the use 
of seven Greek textbooks in Karpas schools and rejected the appointment of seven teachers, 
which created problems for the smooth functioning of Greek Cypriot schools in the north. 
</p>
<p>42. In the south, UNFICYP continued to work with the local authorities and community 
representatives in Limassol and Paphos to strengthen support mechanisms for vulnerable 
members of the Turkish Cypriot community in educational and social areas. However, the 
Turkish Cypriot side again raised concerns about the lack of a Turkish-language primary 
school in Limassol.58  
</p>
<p>43. Furthermore, Turkish Cypriot students still face a lack of access to European Union 
exchange and educational programmes owing to the non-recognition by Cyprus of the 
universities in the northern part of the island. The framework of a scholarship scheme for 
the Turkish Cypriot community was set up by the European Commission under the 
European Union aid programme in order to compensate for the lack of mobility that would 
be offered by the Erasmus programme. The scheme allows Turkish Cypriot students and 
teachers to spend one year abroad at a  university or higher education institution in the 
European Union, and the level of funding is far higher than that for Erasmus. In the 
academic year 2010-2011, a total number of 102 students and teachers participated in the 
scheme; in the current academic year, 93 students and teachers were awarded a scholarship. 
The European Commission is in contact with the authorities of Cyprus regarding the 
possibility of offering Turkish Cypriots the option of studying at universities in the areas 
under the effective control of the Government of Cyprus in the near future.59

<p>for Enlargement, European Commission. </p>


<p>44. In its report on Cyprus of 23 March 2011, the European Commission against Racism 
and Intolerance noted that a number of positive measures had been taken in favour of 
Turkish Cypriots in the field of education, such as free education in any public or private 
school (including the prestigious bicommunal English School in Nicosia), free meals 
provided to all Turkish speaking pupils in public schools, and free Turkish and Greek 
language classes offered to Turkish Cypriot children and their parents in adult education 
centres.60 Moreover, the Commission was pleased to learn about new history textbooks, to 
be introduced in the school year 2011-2012, which would reflect the diversity and plurality 
of society and include specific references to the two communities of Cyprus. 61 The 
Commission also highlighted, however, the disproportionately high concentration of 
Turkish Cypriot children in particular schools and, in this context, strongly recommended 
that the authorities review the way in which pupils are admitted to schools in order to 
eliminate any discriminatory practices and take other necessary measures to ensure a more 
even distribution of Greek-speaking and non-Greek-speaking children in different schools.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Gender perspective 
</b></p>
<p>45. In its resolution 1325 (2000), the Security Council called on all actors involved, 
when negotiating and implementing peace agreements, to adopt a gender perspective, 
including, inter alia:

<p>46. The Office of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Cyprus is working 
closely with the United Nations Development Programme and an expert group comprising 
Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot women, known as the Gender Advisory Team, to 
promote the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). The Team was 
formed in response to concerns about the inclusion of gender issues and women&#8217;s rights in 
the peace process and overall peacebuilding efforts in Cyprus. The Team&#8217;s civil society 
</p>
<p>activists and scholars from across the island have been meeting since October 2009 to 
develop gender-focused recommendations relating to the main areas under discussion in 
negotiations. Recent activities undertaken by the Team included a written submission to the 
leaders setting out the key principles of gender equality; the formal presentation to the two 
leaders of a poster on the tenth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), 
which now hangs in the foyer of the negotiating room; the placement of a billboard at the 
Ledra Street/Lokma&#231;&#305; crossing inviting the public to express their views by writing their 
answers to the question, &#8220;What does peace mean to you?&#8221; directly on the billboard; and the 
circulation of a petition calling for the negotiators to integrate a gender perspective in the 
peace talks &#8220;because women have a different experience of conflict, of security, of property 
issues, of peace and development&#8221;.62

<p><b> III. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>47. <b> There have been some positive developments in the question of human rights 
in Cyprus, such as the recent extension of the deadline for applications of Greek 
</b></p>
<p><b>Cypriots to the Immovable Property Commission</b> <b>as well as measures taken to allow 
Turkish Cypriots to participate more effectively in public affairs and social, economic 
</b></p>
<p><b>and cultural life. 
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>The persisting division of the island continues, however, to constitute an 
obstacle to the full enjoyment in mutual confidence by the whole population of Cyprus 
</b></p>
<p><b>of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. The present report provides examples 
</b></p>
<p><b>of adverse consequences and recent developments in relation to the right to life and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the question of missing persons, the principle of non-discrimination, freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>movement, property rights, freedom of religion and cultural rights, freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>opinion and expression, the right to education as well as with regard to a gender 
</b></p>
<p><b>perspective.  
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>It is hoped that the current efforts made by the Greek Cypriot and Turkish 
Cypriot leaders to negotiate and achieve a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus 
</b></p>
<p><b>problem will open avenues to improve the human rights situation on the island. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Addressing the underlying human rights issues should be an increasingly important 
</b></p>
<p><b>part of peacekeeping efforts and also underpin the political dialogue for a 
</b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. 
</b></p>
