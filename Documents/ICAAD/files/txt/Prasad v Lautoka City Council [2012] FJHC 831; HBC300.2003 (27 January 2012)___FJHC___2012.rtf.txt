DEFENDANT

Before : Master Anare Tuilevuka.

Date of Ruling : Friday 27 January 2012.

RULING
INTRODUCTION

[1].    
This matter had been fixed for trial for three days before Mr. Justice Yohan Fernando at the Lautoka High Court. However, trial was vacated when Mr. Nand was granted an adjournment to take instructions from the plaintiff on some preliminary points that Mr. Patel had raised on the first day of trial. There is no need for me to set out here the three preliminary points raised. Suffice it to say that because the adjournment necessitated the trial being vacated, Fernando J ruled ordered on 23 May 2011 that the defendant is "entitled to taxed costs for the 3 trial dates vacated" and then referred the file to this court for taxation on the standard basis.

[2].    
However, on 19 July 2011, the plaintiff's solicitors filed a motion seeking leave to withdraw the action and that "the costs of the application be paid by the Defendant to be taxed in default of agreement". The affidavit filed in support of the application simply states that "the plaintiff does not wish to proceed with this action any further. He now intends to wholly and completely discontinue this action against the Defendant".

[3].    
The defendant has since presented its bill of costs for taxation which was annexed to the affidavit of Mr. Jone Qio Nakauvadra### invalid font number 31506
 the CEO of the defendant council. which is filed herein. Mr. Nakauvadra deposes simply that the defendant does not object to the plaintiff discontinuing the action as long as he pays the defendant's costs.

[4].    
The High Court's power to award costs is discretionary (see Order 62 Rule 3(3)).

If the Court in the exercise of its discretion sees fit to make any order as to the costs of those proceedings, the Court shall order the costs to follow the event, except when it appears to the Court that in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of the costs.

[5].    
In other words, the loser will be ordered to pay the winner's costs and will be left to bear his own. 

[6].    
Where the plaintiff has discontinued or withdrawn his claim without ever going to trial as happened in this case, there is strictly no "winner" and/or "looser" formally declared by the court. But in such cases, an order for costs will be deemed to have been made (see Order 62 Rule 5(3)) against the party who is withdrawing his claim/counterclaim and in favour of the other party. In such cases, costs will be assessed up to the time of receipt of notice of discontinuance or withdrawal:

Where a party by notice in writing and without leave discontinues an action or counterclaim or withdraws any particular claim made by him as against any other party, that other party shall be entitled to his costs of the action or counterclaim or his costs occasioned by the claim withdrawn, as the case may be, incurred to the time of receipt of the notice of discontinuance or withdrawal

[7].    
In my view, in the majority of (if not all) cases that come under Order 62 Rule 5(3), the reason for the plaintiff's withdrawal or discontinuance of his claim (or defendant's withdrawal or discontinuance of his counter-claim) will not affect the defendant's (or the plaintiff's) entitlement to costs.

[8].    
Hence, in this case, what I am to do is to assess:

(i)     
the taxing of the defendant's costs for the three trial dates vacated as ordered by Fernando J.

(ii)    
the taxing of the defendant's costs occasioned by the plaintiff withdrawing his claim up to the time of withdrawal.

[9].    
Mr. Nand has raised no objection about the form and/or manner in which taxation has proceeded in this case. Nor does he question the attendances itemized in the bill of costs. Rather, Mr. Nand simply wants all attendances taxed on the lower scale and also the fees for the three trial dates vacated be reduced to $1,500 only. When taxing costs on standard basis, any doubt is resolved in favour of the party to be taxed.

[10].   
I am not convinced that the attendances should all be taxed on the higher scale. The case, in my view is not so complicated  nor has any reason been given to me such as to warrant taxation on a higher scale. Below is the taxed Bill of Costs.
