<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism contains communications 
transmitted to Governments between 1 January and 15 September 2007, as well as replies 
received up to 1 November 2007. In addition, the report also covers press releases issued 
in 2007. 
</p>
<p>2. During the period under review the Special Rapporteur corresponded with Governments, 
either separately or jointly with other mandate-holders, and he issued press releases that relate to 
a total of 14 countries or territories. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that problems concerning 
human rights and fundamental freedoms in the context of countering terrorism are not only 
confined to the countries and territories mentioned in this report. 
</p>
<p>3. During the period of review, the Special Rapporteur received replies from five 
Governments relating to communications sent in 2007 and communications that had not been 
replied to in 2006. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the detailed substantive information 
received from these Governments and encourages cooperation by those Governments which 
have not yet provided replies to his communications. Replies received after 1 November 2007 
will be reflected in the next report to the Human Rights Council on communications.  
</p>
<p>4. As in previous years, the Special Rapporteur acted upon information received from reliable 
sources concerning individual cases of alleged breaches of fundamental freedoms and human 
rights in the context of countering terrorism, and also took action with respect to legislative 
developments and proposals undertaken by a number of Member States. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur reiterates his encouragement to Member States to enter into dialogue, ideally 
during the preparatory stage of the adoption of new counter-terrorism legislation or legislation on 
terrorism-related offences, to seek his advice in accordance with paragraphs 14 (a) and (e) of 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/80 (extended by the Human Rights Council 
pursuant to its decision 2006/102). </p>

<p><b>A.  Communication envoy&#233;e au Gouvernement par le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial</b> 
</p>
<p>5. Le 29 janvier 2007, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial, conjointement avec le Vice-Pr&#233;sident du Groupe 
de travail sur la d&#233;tention arbitraire et le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la torture, a envoy&#233; une lettre 
concernant la situation d&#8217;<b>Abderrahmane Mehalli</b>. Selon les informations re&#231;ues, 
M. Mehalli aurait &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; le soir du 26 d&#233;cembre 2006 &#224; 19 h 30 &#224; son domicile de Bachdjerah 
par les services de la brigade mobile de la police judiciaire de Oued Ouchaeih et quelques 
membres des services du D&#233;partement du renseignement et de la s&#233;curit&#233;. Il aurait &#233;t&#233; d&#233;tenu 
dans un lieu inconnu pendant douze jours, durant lesquels les agents des services du 
D&#233;partement du renseignement et de la s&#233;curit&#233; l&#8217;auraient rou&#233; de coups de poing et de pied. 
Ils lui auraient aussi bouch&#233; le nez en lui mettant, en m&#234;me temps, un chiffon dans la bouche, et 
ensuite vers&#233; du liquide sur la t&#234;te. Ils l&#8217;auraient &#233;galement menac&#233; au moment o&#249; il devait &#234;tre 
entendu par le juge d&#8217;instruction. Le 6 janvier 2007, M. Mehalli aurait &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233; devant le juge 
d&#8217;instruction de la 2e chambre du Tribunal d&#8217;Alger. Il aurait &#233;t&#233; plac&#233; sous mandat de d&#233;p&#244;t et 
transf&#233;r&#233; &#224; la prison de Serkadji o&#249; il serait encore d&#233;tenu &#224; ce jour. M. Mehalli serait accus&#233; 
&#171;d&#8217;appartenance &#224; un groupe terroriste arm&#233;&#187;. Il aurait reconnu les faits qui lui sont reproch&#233;s 
sous le coup de la menace et aurait &#233;t&#233; contraint de signer un proc&#232;s-verbal sans pouvoir le lire 
auparavant. Par ailleurs, M. Mehalli n&#8217;aurait pas re&#231;u de soins m&#233;dicaux suite aux actes subis 
mais aurait &#233;t&#233; oblig&#233; de signer un document attestant qu&#8217;il aurait &#233;t&#233; bien trait&#233;. Des craintes ont 
&#233;t&#233; exprim&#233;es quant &#224; l&#8217;int&#233;grit&#233; physique de M. Mehalli et &#224; son &#233;tat de sant&#233;. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Communication re&#231;ue du Gouvernement 
</b></p>
<p>6. Le 26 juin 2007, le Gouvernement a r&#233;pondu &#224; la lettre envoy&#233;e le 29 janvier 2007. 
Le Gouvernement a inform&#233; le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial qu&#8217;Abderrahmane Mehalli a &#233;t&#233; arr&#234;t&#233; le 
27 d&#233;cembre 2006 par les agents de la police judiciaire d&#8217;Alger, en m&#234;me temps que plusieurs de 
ses complices. Pr&#233;sent&#233; le 6 janvier 2007 devant le Procureur de la R&#233;publique d&#8217;Alger, 
Sidi M&#8217;hamed, celui-ci a requis l&#8217;ouverture d&#8217;une information judiciaire contre les mis en cause 
pour appartenance &#224; un groupe terroriste. Les mis en cause ont &#233;t&#233; inculp&#233;s par le juge 
d&#8217;instruction de la 2e chambre et plac&#233;s en d&#233;tention provisoire. Le Gouvernement informe que 
l&#8217;affaire est toujours pendante devant le juge d&#8217;instruction.

<p><b>Chile

<p><b>A.  Comunicaci&#243;n enviada al Gobierno por el Relator Especial 
</b></p>
<p>7. El 5 de abril de 2007, el Relator Especial envi&#243; una carta de alegaci&#243;n, junto con el<b> </b>Relator 
Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los 
ind&#237;genas, sobre <b>los recientes proyectos de reforma de la ley que determina conductas 
terroristas y fija su penalidad</b>, de 16 de mayo de 1984 (Ley N&#186; 18314), as&#237; como sobre 
otras <b>propuestas de reforma legislativa</b> que tendr&#237;an implicaciones para la situaci&#243;n de las 
personas que se encuentran actualmente cumpliendo condenas en virtud de esta legislaci&#243;n.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>8. El art&#237;culo 1 de la Ley N&#186; 18314 califica el delito de terrorismo, para los efectos de la 
aplicaci&#243;n de la ley, como toda acci&#243;n que &#8220;se cometa con la finalidad de producir en la 
poblaci&#243;n o en una parte de ella el temor justificado de ser v&#237;ctima de delitos de la misma 
especie, sea por la naturaleza y efectos de los medios empleados, sea por la evidencia de que 
obedece a un plan premeditado de atentar contra una categor&#237;a o grupo de personas&#8221; (p&#225;rr. 1) o 
para &#8220;arrancar resoluciones de la autoridad o imponerle exigencias&#8221; (p&#225;rr. 2). Los Relatores 
Especiales creen que dicha definici&#243;n es excesivamente amplia y vaga a la luz del principio de 
legalidad penal consagrado en el art&#237;culo 15 del Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y 
Pol&#237;ticos. Dicho principio, inderogable incluso en caso de declararse el estado de excepci&#243;n, 
implica que la responsabilidad penal debe determinarse a trav&#233;s de disposiciones claras y 
precisas establecidas por la ley, a fin de respetar el principio de certeza jur&#237;dica y de asegurar 
que &#233;ste no quede sujeto a una interpretaci&#243;n que permita ampliar el &#225;mbito de la conducta 
penada.  
</p>
<p>9. La definici&#243;n actual del delito de terrorismo ha permitido la condena de nueve miembros 
de comunidades mapuche en el per&#237;odo 2003-2005 por delitos de &#8220;amenaza de incendio 
terrorista&#8221;, &#8220;lanzamiento de artefacto incendiario terrorista&#8221; o &#8220;incendio terrorista&#8221; en relaci&#243;n 
con actos violentos de protesta social asociados a reivindicaciones de tierras tradicionales 
ind&#237;genas. Estas condenas han sido objeto de grave preocupaci&#243;n en los &#250;ltimos a&#241;os, y han 
llevado a pronunciamientos de varios &#243;rganos internacionales de derechos humanos, as&#237; como de 
distintos procedimientos especiales del Consejo de Derechos Humanos. As&#237;, el Comit&#233; de 
Derechos Econ&#243;micos, Sociales y Culturales, en sus observaciones finales sobre Chile, expres&#243; 
su preocupaci&#243;n &#8220;por la aplicaci&#243;n de leyes especiales, como la Ley de seguridad del Estado 
(N&#186; 12927) y la Ley antiterrorista (N&#186; 18314), en el contexto de las actuales tensiones por las 
tierras ancestrales en las zonas mapuches&#8221; (E/C.12/1/Add.105, p&#225;rr. 14), y recomend&#243; al Estado 
&#8220;que no aplique leyes especiales, como la Ley de seguridad del Estado (N&#186; 12927) y la Ley 
antiterrorista (N&#186; 18314), a actos relacionados con la lucha social por la tierra y las 
reclamaciones leg&#237;timas de los ind&#237;genas&#8221; (ib&#237;d., p&#225;rr. 35).  
</p>
<p>10. En t&#233;rminos similares, el informe sobre la visita a Chile del Relator Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas, examin&#243; la 
aplicaci&#243;n de la legislaci&#243;n antiterrorista en el contexto de la protesta social de las comunidades 
mapuches asociadas a las demandas de tierras. El Relator Especial recomend&#243; al Gobierno que 
no se &#8220;criminalizaran o penalizaran las leg&#237;timas actividades de protesta o demanda social de las 
organizaciones y comunidades ind&#237;genas&#8221;, y que no se aplicaran &#8220;acusaciones de delitos tomados 
de otros contextos (&#8220;amenaza terrorista&#8221;, &#8220;asociaci&#243;n delictuosa&#8221;) a hechos relacionados con la 
lucha social por la tierra y los leg&#237;timos reclamos ind&#237;genas&#8221; (E/CN.4/2004/80/Add.3, p&#225;rrs. 69 
y 70). El Relator Especial recomend&#243; asimismo que el Gobierno de Chile &#8220;considere la 
posibilidad de declarar una amnist&#237;a general para los defensores ind&#237;genas de los derechos 
humanos procesados por realizar actividades sociales y/o pol&#237;ticas en el marco de la defensa de 
las tierras ind&#237;genas&#8221; (ib&#237;d., p&#225;rr. 75).  
</p>
<p>11. Asimismo, la situaci&#243;n de los l&#237;deres y activistas mapuches que cumplen condenas en 
virtud de la legislaci&#243;n antiterrorista fue objeto de comunicaciones dirigidas al Gobierno de Su 
Excelencia por distintos titulares de mandatos otorgados por el Consejo de Derechos Humanos, </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>con fechas de 24 de marzo y 19 de julio de 2005, y 21 de abril y 11 de mayo de 2006. En dichas 
comunicaciones se expres&#243; preocupaci&#243;n por las alegaciones recibidas en relaci&#243;n con las 
violaciones al derecho al debido proceso de los condenados, derivadas en parte de la definici&#243;n 
amplia del delito de terrorismo incorporada en la Ley N&#186; 18314.  
</p>
<p>12. En distintas comunicaciones dirigidas a los mecanismos especiales del Consejo, el 
Gobierno de Chile ha admitido asimismo la necesidad de revisar su pol&#237;tica criminal en relaci&#243;n 
con la protesta social de las comunidades mapuches, en el marco del respeto a la legislaci&#243;n 
vigente. As&#237;, en la respuesta del Gobierno de Chile a las recomendaciones del Relator Especial 
sobre la situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas 
(febrero de 2005), el Gobierno se&#241;al&#243; que estaba &#8220;analizando los tipos penales contenidos en la 
Ley antiterrorista, de acuerdo con las nuevas orientaciones de la pol&#237;tica criminal, pues est&#225; 
conciente que tal legislaci&#243;n establece tipos penales demasiado amplios, por lo cual se hace 
necesaria su revisi&#243;n&#8221; (p&#225;g. 7).  
</p>
<p>13. En la comunicaci&#243;n de 23 de mayo de 2006 en respuesta a la anterior comunicaci&#243;n de los 
Relatores Especiales, el Gobierno se&#241;al&#243; que &#8220;[l]a Presidenta de la Rep&#250;blica, Sra. Michelle 
Bachelet, se ha comprometido a que el ejecutivo, en hechos futuros que se encuentren tipificados 
como delitos por la Ley antiterrorista y que puedan ser juzgados por la ley com&#250;n cuando en 
&#233;stos se vean involucrados ind&#237;genas en procesos de reivindicaciones de tierras, no invocara la 
aplicaci&#243;n de dicha ley&#8221; (p&#225;g. 1).  
</p>
<p>14. En su intervenci&#243;n ante el segundo per&#237;odo de sesiones del Consejo de Derechos Humanos 
(18 de septiembre a 6 de octubre de 2006), el Gobierno de Chile reiter&#243; que &#8220;se ha 
comprometido recientemente a no aplicar la Ley antiterrorista en caso de hechos futuros que 
puedan ser juzgados a trav&#233;s de la ley com&#250;n&#8221;, e inform&#243; asimismo de que &#8220;el Parlamento se 
encuentra debatiendo un proyecto de ley que modifica la norma antiterrorista y que apunta a 
quitar el car&#225;cter terrorista a los atentados contra la propiedad&#8221; (19 de septiembre de 2006).  
</p>
<p>15. En este sentido, los Relatores Especiales quer&#237;an referirse a informaciones que han 
recibido en relaci&#243;n con distintos proyectos de reforma de la legislaci&#243;n antiterrorista y para 
atender a la situaci&#243;n de los presos mapuches que se encuentran cumpliendo condenas de 
terrorismo. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas: una primera propuesta de reforma legislativa 
fue presentada en el Senado el 15 de mayo de 2006 por los senadores Alejandro Navarro, 
Jaime Naranjo y Guido Guirardi, quienes presentaron un proyecto de ley &#8220;que permite conceder 
la libertad condicional a condenados por conductas terroristas y otros delitos, en causas 
relacionadas con reivindicaciones violentas de derechos consagrados en la Ley N&#186; 19253&#8221; 
(<i>Bolet&#237;n</i> N&#186; 4188-07). El proyecto propon&#237;a una modificaci&#243;n al r&#233;gimen de libertad condicional 
con el objeto de conceder el beneficio de la libertad condicional a los &#8220;condenados por conductas 
terroristas y otros delitos, en causas relacionadas con reivindicaciones violentas de derechos 
consagrados&#8221; en la Ley ind&#237;gena. Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas, dicha propuesta constituy&#243; 
un paso fundamental para la finalizaci&#243;n de la huelga de hambre iniciada por varios presos 
mapuches en marzo de 2006, si bien fue posteriormente rechazada por la Comisi&#243;n de 
Constituci&#243;n del Senado el 6 de septiembre de 2006.  
</p>
<p>16. Un segundo proyecto de ley, &#8220;que modifica la Ley N&#186; 18314, que determina conductas 
terroristas y fija su penalidad&#8221;, fue presentado por los diputados Juan Bustos, Eduardo D&#237;az, 
Antonio Leal y Jaime Quintana el 10 de mayo de 2006 (<i>Bolet&#237;n</i> N&#176; 4199-07). Este proyecto </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>propone revisar la Ley N&#186; 18314 para precisar la definici&#243;n del &#225;mbito de aplicaci&#243;n de la 
norma, circunscribi&#233;ndola a acciones cometidas por &#8220;bandas armadas o integrantes de ella contra 
la vida o la integridad f&#237;sica de las personas, con la finalidad de subvertir el r&#233;gimen 
constitucional o el orden p&#250;blico y de producir en la poblaci&#243;n o en una parte importante de ella 
el temor de ser v&#237;ctima de delitos de la misma especie&#8221; (ib&#237;d., p&#225;rr. 4). Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n 
disponible, dicho proyecto se encontrar&#237;a todav&#237;a pendiente de aprobaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>17. Por &#250;ltimo, el Gobierno de Chile present&#243; el 5 de julio de 2006 el proyecto de ley &#8220;con el 
objeto de introducir una modificaci&#243;n en la Ley N&#186; 18314 que establece conductas terroristas y 
fija de su finalidad&#8221; (<i>Bolet&#237;n</i> N&#186; 4298-07). El proyecto presentado por el Gobierno plantea una 
limitaci&#243;n del tipo penal de terrorismo actualmente existente en la ley, limitando los delitos 
terroristas a &#8220;aquellos que afecten la vida, la integridad f&#237;sica, la libertad y la salud p&#250;blica&#8221;. 
Seg&#250;n las informaciones recibidas por los Relatores Especiales, la propuesta del Gobierno de 
Chile fue presentada bajo el tr&#225;mite de urgencia (30 d&#237;as), pero dicha urgencia habr&#237;a sido 
retirada el pasado 29 de agosto de 2006. 
</p>
<p>18. Los Relatores Especiales expresan su satisfacci&#243;n por la voluntad expresada por el 
Gobierno de reformar la pol&#237;tica criminal en relaci&#243;n con la protesta social de las comunidades 
mapuches, as&#237; como de reformar la legislaci&#243;n antiterrorista. Los cambios propuestos por los 
proyectos de ley actualmente en tr&#225;mite de discusi&#243;n restringir&#237;an la definici&#243;n del tipo penal de 
terrorismo actualmente incorporado en la Ley N&#186; 18314 en un sentido que la har&#237;a compatible 
con los est&#225;ndares internacionales de derechos humanos, evitando as&#237; posibles vulneraciones del 
derecho al debido proceso de las personas inculpadas en virtud de dicha ley.  
</p>
<p>19. Asimismo, les gustar&#237;a expresar su preocupaci&#243;n por las informaciones que han recibido 
respecto a la retirada del tr&#225;mite de urgencia en agosto de 2006 del proyecto de ley presentado 
por el Gobierno, que en t&#233;rminos pr&#225;cticos habr&#237;a conducido al abandono de dicha iniciativa, as&#237; 
como a la falta de tramitaci&#243;n parlamentaria del proyecto de ley presentado por el diputado 
Juan Bustos y otros. La par&#225;lisis en la tramitaci&#243;n de dichos proyectos de ley, unida a la 
desestimaci&#243;n del proyecto de ley presentado por el senador Alejandro Navarro y otros, permite 
que se produzcan vulneraciones del principio de legalidad penal en la aplicaci&#243;n de la legislaci&#243;n 
antiterrorista, poniendo en entredicho la voluntad de reformar la pol&#237;tica criminal. 
</p>
<p>20. A este respecto, los Relatores Especiales quisieran llamar la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno sobre el 
hecho de que, como ha sido se&#241;alado por el Relator Especial sobre la promoci&#243;n y la protecci&#243;n 
de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales en la lucha contra el terrorismo, toda 
definici&#243;n de terrorismo y de acto terrorista debe identificar de manera precisa dichas conductas, 
limitando su alcance solamente a aquellos actos que son terroristas por naturaleza 
(E/CN.4/2006/98, p&#225;rrs. 26 a 50). Ello asegura el pleno respeto al principio de legalidad 
consagrado en el art&#237;culo 15 del Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol&#237;ticos, as&#237; como en 
otros instrumentos internacionales de derechos humanos.  
</p>
<p>21. El Relator Especial ha indicado que la resoluci&#243;n 1566 (2004) del Consejo de Seguridad 
insta a los Estados a que cooperen plenamente en la lucha contra el terrorismo y, de este modo, 
prevenir o sancionar los actos que re&#250;nan estas tres caracter&#237;sticas de manera acumulativa: 
a) actos, inclusive contra civiles, cometidos con la intenci&#243;n de causar la muerte o lesiones 
corporales graves o de tomar rehenes; b) actos cometidos, independientemente de toda 
justificaci&#243;n por consideraciones de &#237;ndole pol&#237;tica, filos&#243;fica, ideol&#243;gica, racial, &#233;tnica, religiosa </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>u otra similar, con la intenci&#243;n de provocar un estado de terror en la poblaci&#243;n en general, en un 
grupo de personas o en determinada persona, intimidar a una poblaci&#243;n u obligar a un gobierno o 
a una organizaci&#243;n internacional a realizar un acto, o a abstenerse de realizarlo; y c) actos que 
constituyan delitos definidos en las convenciones y los protocolos internacionales relativos al 
terrorismo y comprendidos en su &#225;mbito (ib&#237;d., p&#225;rr. 37).  
</p>
<p>22. Esta f&#243;rmula acumulativa sirve de umbral de seguridad para garantizar que sean 
&#250;nicamente los actos de car&#225;cter terrorista los que se identifiquen como tales. El Relator Especial 
subraya que no todos los actos que son delito con arreglo al derecho nacional o incluso 
internacional son actos de terrorismo ni deber&#237;an definirse as&#237; (ib&#237;d., p&#225;rr. 38). 
</p>
<p>23. Los Relatores Especiales son conscientes de la necesidad de los Estados de adoptar 
medidas efectivas para prevenir el terrorismo y luchar contra &#233;l pero, a la vez, les preocupa que 
la legislaci&#243;n actual de terrorismo no sea plenamente conforme a los est&#225;ndares internacionales 
de derechos humanos. En consecuencia, quieren hacer un llamamiento tanto al Gobierno como a 
los dem&#225;s poderes del Estado para que impulsen una pronta reforma de la legislaci&#243;n 
antiterrorista, y para que atiendan la situaci&#243;n de las personas mapuches que fueron condenadas 
en virtud de dicha legislaci&#243;n.

<p><b>A.  Communications sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>25. On 11 January 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, sent a letter regarding <b>Ayman Hkiri</b>, <b>Ahamed Lahbib</b>, <b>Mohamed Almadiri</b> 
and a <b>fourth person</b>, all Tunisian nationals studying in Egypt, held at the al-Khalifa detention 
centre in Cairo. According to the information received, the four men had been arrested at the end 
of November 2005, reportedly in connection with the activities of a so-called terrorist cell in 
Egypt recruiting people to fight against the United States forces in Iraq, but no official charges 
had been brought against them. After their arrest they were held at the State Security Intelligence 
office in Madinet Nasr, northern Cairo, where they were blindfolded and handcuffed, beaten and 
given electric shocks to sensitive parts of their bodies. They also were subjected to sleep 
prevention and forced to watch others being tortured. Subsequently they were transferred to 
al-Khalifa detention centre. Furthermore, the Egyptian authorities were planning to return the 
four men to Tunisia. Concern was expressed that they might face torture or ill-treatment if 
returned to Tunisia.  
</p>
<p>26. On 22 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter to the Government of Egypt with 
regard to the <b>proposed amendment to article 179 of the Constitution of Egypt</b>. According to 
the information received, the amendment to article 179 together with proposed amendments to 
33 other articles of the Constitution, had been approved by the Parliament on 19 March 2007. 
Further to the approval by the Parliament, it had been planned that these amendments will be put 
to a popular referendum on 4 April 2007. On 20 March 2007, however, it had been decided to 
conduct the public referendum 10 days earlier than the envisaged date, i.e. on 26 March. In this </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>connection, the Special Rapporteur drew the Government&#8217;s attention to three main substantive 
areas of concern relating to the proposed amendment. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view the 
amendment of article 179 of the Constitution required reconsideration in order to secure that its 
adoption will not lead to human rights violations: 
</p>
<p> (a) The amendment to article 179 of the Constitution stipulates that the State strives to 
protect public security and order against the danger of terrorism. This danger or acts of terrorism, 
however, are not defined by the proposed amendment. The lack of definition of these acts in the 
proposed constitutional provision combined with the broad and vague definition of terrorism in 
article 86 of the Penal Code of Egypt, introduced in 1992, aggravates the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
concern that the amendment would grant powers upon the authorities to employ measures under 
the new article 179 of the Constitution against actions which do not in fact amount to terrorism. 
The concern of the broad definition of terrorism contained in article 86 of the Penal Code, which 
seems to allow to be used against dissidents and opposition members and which has led to an 
increase in crimes punishable by the death penalty, has already been addressed in the letter 
of 21 September 2005; 
</p>
<p> (b) Moreover, the proposed amendment to article 179 of the Constitution foresees that 
the law shall regulate provisions for procedures which are necessary to confront the danger of 
terrorism in such a way that their implementation should not be hindered by articles 41 (1), 44 
and 45 (2) of the Constitution of Egypt. Therefore, such laws to be adopted would confer powers 
upon the authorities to arrest and detain individuals, conduct house searches and monitor private 
correspondence, telephone calls and other communication without constitutionally defined 
limitations. In fact, based upon the amendment to article 179 of the Constitution, the legal 
provisions to be adopted may include a blanket authorization for the unrestricted limitation of 
rights and freedoms enshrined in the articles 41 (1), 44 and 45 (2) of the Constitution. Thus, the 
proposed amendment may even allow for the restriction of the very essence of these 
constitutionally guaranteed rights. Regarding the power to arrest individuals, the Special 
Rapporteur drew the attention of the Government to article 9 (1) of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which affirms that everyone has the right to liberty of the 
person and no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. According to article 9, 
paragraph 3, of the ICCPR, anyone arrested or detained on criminal charge shall be brought 
promptly before a judge and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable amount of time or 
release. The right to challenge the lawfulness of any detention before a court is provided by 
article 9, paragraph 4, of the ICCPR. The Human Rights Committee confirmed in its general 
comment No. 29 of 2001 that the above-mentioned right is protected at all times, including 
during a state of emergency. This is partly because of the crucial role of procedural guarantees in 
securing compliance with the non-derogable right under article 7 of the ICCPR not to be 
subjected to torture or any other form of inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment; 
 (c) Finally, the proposed amendment confers upon the President the power to refer any 
terrorism-related case to any judicial authority stipulated in the Constitution or the law. Thus, 
this amendment authorizes the President, as head of the executive branch, to bypass otherwise 
applicable rules concerning jurisdiction. This may imply that individuals suspected for 
terrorism-related reasons may be tried before a military or special court, depending upon 
Presidential discretion.  </p>

</p>
<p>27. On 27 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication responding to the <b>letter 
sent by the Government of Egypt on 8 June 2007</b> regarding the proposed amendment to 
article 179 of the Constitution of Egypt on the protection of public security and order against the 
danger of terrorism. According to the letter of the Government, the comments of the Special 
Rapporteur on the draft amendments to the Constitution fell within the scope of advisory or 
technical assistance and could therefore be presented only at the request by the Government. As 
such assistance had not been requested, the letter sent by the Government expresses the view that 
the letter of 22 March 2007 from the Special Rapporteur fell outside his mandate. In his letter of 
27 June 2007, the Special Rapporteur explained why he takes a different view. Paragraph 14 (a) 
of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/80 (extended by the Human Rights Council 
pursuant to decision 2006/102) entrusts the Special Rapporteur on human rights and 
counter-terrorism to make concrete recommendations, including about the provision of advisory 
services or technical assistance by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. 
Hence, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s letter of 22 March should not be understood as a form of 
technical assistance or advisory services. Rather, it falls under paragraph 14 (e) of the 
Commission resolution mandating the Special Rapporteur to develop &#8220;a regular dialogue&#8221; with 
all relevant actors, including Governments. The Special Rapporteur underlined his firm opinion 
that a proactive approach, addressing also issues that have not yet been finally decided on the 
national level, is often more productive than reacting to alleged human rights violations after the 
fact (see paragraph 14 (b) of the above resolution). The Special Rapporteur expressed his hope 
that this clarification as to the procedural question of the scope of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
mandate will be of assistance to the Government in preparing a substantive response to his letter 
of 22 March. The Special Rapporteur reminded the Government that on 9 December 2005 he had 
requested an invitation for a country visit. The Special Rapporteur expressed his belief that such 
a visit would also be an optimal occasion to discuss the parameters of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
mandate with the competent authorities of the Government for the purpose of clarifying any 
remaining misunderstandings and to engage in a substantive dialogue on important issues 
concerning the impact of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the context of countering 
terrorism. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Communications from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>28. As at 1 November 2007, there has been no reply to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
correspondence of 11 January 2007. 
</p>
<p>29. By letter of 8 June 2007, the Government of Egypt replied to the communication sent 
on 22 March 2007. First, the Government recalled its unwavering commitment to the cause of 
promoting and protecting human rights, and that it has undertaken legislative, political, and 
economic and social reforms with a view to promoting and protecting the human rights of the 
Egyptian people in all fields.  
</p>
<p>30. The Government further highlights the fact it is an ardent advocate of the principle of 
protecting human rights while countering terrorism, which is best evidenced by the 
Government&#8217;s co-sponsorship of the General Assembly resolution on the protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism and by its support for the 
Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/80 on human rights and terrorism. Moreover, 
Egypt is also working constructively with the member States of the United Nations Human 
Rights Council to re-examine, revise and reform the working methods of the previous </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>Commission on Human Rights and the United Nations human rights special procedures. Within 
that context, Egypt has always emphasized the important role that Special Procedures play in 
promoting and protecting human rights, and has strongly defended the preservation and 
strengthening of that role within the new Council.  
</p>
<p>31. It is important to specify that the letter of the Special Rapporteur falls within the scope of 
advisory or technical assistance which must be applied only at the request of the concerned State. 
The Government recalls that it is stipulated in the mandate of the Special Rapporteur and does 
not apply in this instance. The Government blames this on the fact that his assessment seems to 
be primarily based on a hypothetical possibility of the presumed deviation of the draft legislation 
from human rights norms.  
</p>
<p>32. The Government considers that any evaluation should be based in actual articles of the law 
dealing with this issue when it is approved by the legislative branch of the Government. It is also 
unfortunate that the request of the Special Rapporteur to reconsider the amendment to article 179 
must be deemed as unwarranted intervention in the functions and operations of the legislative 
organs of the State, which have totally conformed to constitutional and legal parameters.  
</p>
<p>33. The Government believes that it is outside the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate to intervene 
in the national debate on a matter of constitutional amendments which have been decided upon 
by the Egyptian people, through a democratic process of national referendum.  
</p>
<p>34. By letter of 30 July 2007, the Government replied to the communication sent  
on 27 June 2007, concerning the Egyptian Constitution and the new anti-terrorism law still in its 
drafting stage.  
</p>
<p>35. First, the Government of Egypt stresses its firm commitment to the promotion of all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms, which are enshrined in the instruments Egypt has ratified. 
Furthermore, any international or regional human rights instrument becomes, upon ratification, 
part of the Egyptian legal system and hence national courts are bound to implement these 
instruments as national.  
</p>
<p>36. The Government emphasizes that the recent constitutional amendments, including the 
amendments to article 179, followed all the relevant procedural requirements stipulated in the 
Constitution; they were first approved by both Houses of the Egyptian Parliament, after being the 
subject of extensive debates and discussions, then they were put to a public referendum where 
the sweeping majority of Egyptian voters were in favour of such amendments.  
</p><p>37. Despite finding it premature to prejudge the content and nature of the new anti-terrorism 
law before its final promulgation, as it is currently in its drafting stages, the Government of 
Egypt, in the light of its adamant desire to engage in constructive dialogue with all Special 
Rapporteurs, is hereby responding to the Special Rapporteur on human rights and 
counter-terrorism&#8217;s letter dated 22 March 2007 on amending article 179 of the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>38. The Government notes that article 179 of the Constitution does not constitute any 
infringement on Egypt&#8217;s international human rights obligations. According to the text of this 
article, the provisions of the anti-terrorism law will only regulate the investigation and </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>verification procedures - the recourse to which will only be under the condition of necessity - 
while not regulating any of the adjudication procedures. Moreover, article 179 stipulates that the 
implementation of these procedures must be under the full supervision of the judiciary.  
</p><p>39. It is further stressed that, according to article 179 of the Constitution, the President has the 
right to refer any terrorist-related case to any judicial authority stipulated in the Constitution or in 
the law. Thus, article 179 does not allow for any arbitrariness in the conduct of justice, since all 
judicial authorities function in consonance with, and abide by, the principles of fair and impartial 
trial as stipulated in both the Constitution (chapter 4 on the Rule of Law) and all relevant 
Egyptian legislation. Furthermore, new amendments were recently introduced to the law 
regulating military courts in Egypt. This new law aims at enhancing the independent nature of 
military courts as a specialized judicial authority. A Higher Court on Military Appeals that 
enjoys the same jurisdiction as the Court of Appeal was introduced by the new law. This Higher 
Court of Appeal will consider appeals presented against the verdicts issued from military courts, 
thereby adding a new guarantee pertaining to the impartiality and fairness of military courts. 
</p>
<p>40. As regards the anti-terrorism law currently being drafted by a committee established 
particularly for that purpose, it will function as the legislative replacement for the exceptional 
procedures of the emergency law that are going to expire on 31 May 2008. The Committee 
mandated to draft that law is currently studying and comparing relevant legislation worldwide.  
</p>
<p>41. The jurisprudence of the United Nations human rights treaty bodies and the United Nations 
model law in this regard equally constitute important reference points for the work of the 
Committee. In drafting the law, the Committee is also keen to ensure its compliance with 
Egypt&#8217;s international commitments that stem from the international human rights to which Egypt 
is a party. 
</p>
<p>42. The Government of Egypt stressed that it was keen on securing the widest participation 
possible of all stakeholders in the discussion and debates on the new law before presenting it to 
both Houses of Parliament. The Committee sought the vision of the National Council for Human 
Rights (the independent national institution established in accordance with the Paris Principles 
adopted by the General Assembly) with regard to the guarantees that the new law should provide 
in order to protect fundamental rights and freedoms while combating terrorism. The Committee 
will provide the National Council for Human Rights with the draft law as soon as it finishes such 
a draft in order to seek its detailed comments on it. 
</p>
<p>43. In light of the above, the Government of Egypt asserts that the meticulous and thorough 
drafting process of the new anti-terrorism law reflects its determination to avoid any shortcoming 
that arose in similar laws drafted worldwide for the same purpose. The Government asserts as 
well its eagerness to achieve and maintain the delicate balance between combating terrorism on 
the one hand and safeguarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of its citizens on the other. 
</p>
<p>44. Finally, the Government of Egypt underlines that it is keen to continue to engage with the 
Special Rapporteur in a constructive dialogue within the parameters of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
mandate, and to respond to communications transmitted to it and provides all information needed 
with the aim of enhancing the promotion and protection of human rights. </p>

<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>45. On 13 February 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
question of torture, sent a letter regarding <b>Bashir Ahmed Makhtal</b>, 42, a Canadian citizen born 
in Dagahbur, Ogaden; <b>Abdi Abdulahi Osman</b>, 41, a Somali citizen born in Gunagado, 
Dagahbur, Ogaden; <b>Ali Afi Jama</b>, 33, a Somali citizen born in Godey, Ogaden; and <b>Hussein Aw 
Nuur Gurraase</b>, 35, a Somali citizen born in Gunagado, Ogaden, all of them ethnic Ogadenis 
trading in second-hand clothing in the Horn of Africa (see also paragraphs 62 and 99). 
According to the information received, on 31 December 2006, Bashir Ahmed Makhtal, Abdi 
Abdulahi Osman, Ali Afi Jama, and Hussein Aw Nuur Gurraase were arrested by Kenyan 
authorities, who suspected them to be terrorists. The arrests were reportedly conducted on the 
basis of provisions of an anti-terrorism bill which had not yet been adopted. The four men were 
held in custody for three weeks without official charges. On 21 January 2007, Bashir Ahmed 
Makhtal, Abdi Abdulahi Osman, Ali Afi Jama, and Hussein Aw Nuur Gurraase were transferred 
to the Ethiopian armed forces in Mogadishu. Concern was expressed that the four individuals 
might be subjected to ill-treatment because of their ethnicity.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Communication from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>46. As at 1 November 2007, no reply had been received to the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; 
correspondence. 
</p>
<p><b>Fiji 
A.  Communication sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>47. On 16 August 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture, sent a letter to the Government relating to <b>three incidents this year in which persons 
are reported to have died in either police or military custody in Fiji</b>, following their initial 
arrest. It is reported that investigations into the killings have been inconclusive and that the 
perpetrators have not been prosecuted. According to information received, <b>Tevita Malasebe</b> was 
arrested at the family home in Suva on 4 June 2007 during the night by eight members of the 
Fiji Police (&#8220;strike-back team&#8221;). Shortly after his arrest, members of Tevita&#8217;s family travelled to 
the Valelevu Police Station asking to see him. Officers at the station however denied that Tevita 
was being held, although the van that had transported him to the station was reportedly parked 
outside and three officers involved in Tevita&#8217;s arrest were observed at the station. A few hours 
later, a phone call was received advising the family that Tevita was in CWM hospital, where 
family members later observed Tevita&#8217;s bruised corpse. A Police Officers Order for 
Burial/cremation (form 5) reports the cause of his death as &#8220;shock and internal haemorrhage due 
to multiple bruises as a complication of multiple blunt impacts&#8221;. Post-mortem photos we have 
reviewed appear to indicate substantial bruising to the body of the deceased. According to 
information received, <b>Sakiusa Rabaka</b> was arrested in the course of a joint military police 
operation on 28 January 2007. He was questioned by the military in Nadi and reportedly died 
three weeks later of a brain haemorrhage, for which he received emergency surgery. Then police 
Commissioner Romanu Tikotikoca reportedly stated that police were treating his death as </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>murder and investigations were ongoing against suspects including one police man and six or 
seven soldiers. According to information received, <b>Nimilote Verebasaga</b> was arrested by the 
police at the family home in Nakaulevu early in the morning of 5 January 2007 and taken to the 
military barracks for questioning. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the CWM hospital in 
Suva and the body reportedly showed visible signs of broken ribs and a broken neck. The family 
later recovered his body from the Suva morgue. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Communication from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>48. As at 1 November 2007, no reply had been received to the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; 
correspondence. 
</p>
<p><b>Germany 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>49. By letter of 16 February 2007, the Government replied to the communication sent 
on 18 December 2006 (see A/HRC/4/26/Add.1, para. 24). The Government reported that the 
transfer of the terror suspects to the United States of America authorities by the Bosnia and 
Herzegovina authorities in January 2002 became known to the public through media reports in 
November 2006 and had led to violent protests in Sarajevo. The Government does not have 
further detailed information to conclude whether the allegations are accurate.  
</p>
<p>50. The Government reports that, at the time, two German liaison officers were deployed to 
US-EUCOM. The German liaison detachment acts as a point of contact for the American forces 
in Germany and is mainly responsible for the exchange of information between US-EUCOM and 
the German territorial commands. From 21 January 2002 onwards this detachment was 
augmented by an additional officer and senior NCO. These additional soldiers joined a 
multinational planning group which dealt with issues of support for the United States in 
preparing and implementing Operation Enduring Freedom and developed exercise scenarios for 
basic planning. None of the liaison officers were involved in planning or activities connected 
with the transfer and transport of the terror suspects. The case of the transfer of the 
&#8220;Algerian Six&#8221; had already been presented and commented on by the Special Rapporteur of the 
Council of Europe, Dick Marty.  
</p>
<p>51. On 27 November 2006, the Association of Public Broadcasting Corporations of Germany 
(ARD) current-affairs television programme &#8220;Report Mainz&#8221; broadcast a report about the 
transfer of six Algerian citizens from Bosnia and Herzegovina to Guant&#225;namo via Turkey, and 
the alleged role of US-EUCOM headquarters in Stuttgart-Vaihingen. Immediately prior to the 
broadcast of the report, S&#252;dwestrundfunk (SWR) 2 sent a press release to the Stuttgart Public 
Prosecution Office dated 23 November, together with photocopies of various documents 
intended as evidence of the responsibility of US-EUCOM headquarters.  
</p>
<p>52. The Stuttgart Public Prosecution office instituted an appraisal of the matter 
on 27 November 2006 on the basis of the information provided by S&#252;dwestrundfunk, and 
forwarded this to the office of the Public Prosecutor General at the Federal Court of Justice, 
asking it to examine whether it should potentially take over the matter. This was done in view of 
the fact that the Public Prosecutor General at the Federal Court of Justice is the competent </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>authority pursuant to section 142a of the Courts Constitution Act (CCA) for criminal prosecution 
with regard to the offences listed in section 120 (1) and (2) of that Act. Because this list is 
exhaustive, the Federal Public Prosecutor General can only take over criminal proceedings if 
there is suspicion of an offence that is listed in section 120 (1) and (2) of the Act. This is due to 
the fact that, under the division of jurisdiction in the German Basic Law, criminal prosecution is 
fundamentally the remit of the L&#228;nder (constituent states of the Federation); section 120 (1) 
and (2) of the CCA more closely define the exceptional cases of federal jurisdiction referred to in 
article 96 paragraph 5 of the Basic Law. The importance of a case on its own cannot give rise to 
the Federal Public Prosecutor General having jurisdiction.  
</p><p>53. In the present case, the Stuttgart Public Prosecution Office contacted the Federal Public 
Prosecutor General because the facts, as they stood, might cover the offence of abduction 
pursuant to section 234a of the Criminal Code, and could therefore give rise to jurisdiction on the 
part of the Federal Public Prosecutor General (section 120 (2), sentence No. 1, in conjunction 
with section 74a (1) No. 5 of the CCA). As a mandatory requirement within the definition of this 
criminal offence, the victim must have been exposed to the danger of being persecuted for 
political reasons. Having regard to article l6a (1) of the Basic Law, the Federal Public Prosecutor 
General takes the legal view that political grounds within the meaning of section 234a of the 
Criminal Code include racial, religious or philosophical grounds, and beyond these, association 
with a political party or group. The persecution must therefore involve one of these elements. A 
contravention of the ride of law alone, however, does not necessarily turn persecution into 
political persecution within the meaning of this penal provision. The Federal Public Prosecutor 
General therefore decided on 21 December 2006 to refrain from initiating investigation 
proceedings, because no sufficient factual indications were apparent for any of these criminal 
offences, which, according to the definitive statutory regulation, can give rise to the Federal 
Public Prosecutor General having jurisdiction to prosecute. In particular, the Federal Public 
Prosecutor General did not see sufficient indications for the criminal offence of abduction 
according to section 234a of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>54. This decision of the Federal Public Prosecutor General did not mean that the examination 
of the criminal information process has been concluded. Rather, it meant only that jurisdiction 
over the criminal persecution remains with the Stuttgart Public Prosecution Office which had the 
task of examining the facts of the case with respect to other criminal offences such as unlawful 
deprivation of liberty (section 239 of the Criminal Code). The same criminal procedure 
instruments are available to it for this purpose as to the Federal Public Prosecutor General.  
</p>
<p>55. The Stuttgart Public Prosecution Office has therefore undertaken a further examination of 
the allegations. With its order of 11 January 2007, it then also refrained from initiating 
investigation proceedings on suspicion of unlawful deprivation of liberty or other criminal 
offences (not within the remit of the Federal Public Prosecutor General), in accordance with 
section 152 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. According to this order, there was no 
suspicion of criminal conduct by German citizens, in particular by German liaison officers 
working at the US-EUCOM headquarters, which would have required the initiation of 
investigation proceedings. In this respect, it stated that there is merely information that liaison 
persons of the German armed forces work at US-EUCOM headquarters in Stuttgart-Vaihingen 
and were also working there at the time of the action in question. However, there was no 
information linking these persons to participation in the transfer of the six Algerians to 
Guant&#225;namo.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>56. The Public Prosecution Office also stated that it was not known which persons were 
involved in arranging the handover, in whatever manner, on the United States side, and it also 
was not known who was responsible for the action (particularly at the US-EUCOM headquarters 
in Stuttgart). Furthermore, according to the order, members of the United States forces are not 
subject to German jurisdiction. Article VII 3 (a) (&#252;) of the Agreement Between the Parties to the 
North Atlantic Treaty Regarding the Status of Their Forces (NATO Status of Forces 
Agreement - SOFA) of 19 June 1951 establishes a primary right for the United States military 
authorities to exercise jurisdiction over a member of their force or of a civilian component in 
relation to offences arising out of any act done in the performance of official duty. According to 
the Public Prosecution Office, the act in the present case - provided that it involved criminal 
liability - would without doubt constitute such an act done in the performance of official duty.  
</p>
<p>57. In conclusion, the Stuttgart Public Prosecution Office was not able to establish that anyone 
subject to German jurisdiction was in fact involved in any criminal offence under German law 
and therefore no further investigations were carried out. Moreover, it stated there has been no 
waiver by the United States authorities of their primary right to exercise jurisdiction over 
American military personnel in EUCOM, nor is such a waiver expected.  
</p>
<p>58. Since the group of prisoners was not transferred through Germany to Guant&#225;namo, Cuba, 
the question of what safeguards are in place to ensure no such transfers occur, does not arise. 
</p>
<p>59. Measures taken in the fight against terrorism, such as arrests of individuals, their transfer 
from the custody of one State to that of another, and the treatment afforded to detainees, must at 
any time be in conformity with the relevant rules of international law, including where applicable 
the rules of international humanitarian law and recognized human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>60. The presence of the United States military in Germany is sanctioned by the Convention 
on the Presence of Foreign Forces in the Federal Republic of Germany, which was concluded 
by the Federal Republic of Germany, the United States of America, the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the French Republic on 23 October 1954. Their status is 
regulated by the Agreement between the Parties of the North Atlantic Treaty Regarding the

<p><b>Statement of the Special Rapporteur on his mission to Israel 
</b></p>
<p>61. On 10 July 2007, the Special Rapporteur issued the following statement during a press 
conference held in Jerusalem (see the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on his mission to Israel, 
(A/HRC/6/17/Add.4), which highlights some, but not all, of his preliminary findings: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur conducted an eight-day mission to Israel, with visits to the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory. The purpose of the mission, conducted at the invitation of 
the Israeli Government from 3 to 10 July 2007, was to undertake a fact-finding exercise, 
and a legal assessment of Israeli law and practice in the fight against terrorism, measured 
against international law, and considering the impact of Israeli counter-terrorism practices </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>and policies. His conduct of country visits is also aimed at identifying and disseminating 
best practice in the countering of terrorism. Following this visit, a more thorough report, 
which will become publicly available, will be prepared and submitted to the Human Rights 
Council, a subsidiary body of the United Nations General Assembly. The Special 
Rapporteur will engage in a further process of written consultations between now and the 
completion of his final report for the purpose of clarifying open issues.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ms Tzipi Livni 
in Tse&#8217;elim. In Jerusalem, the Special Rapporteur had meetings on a specialist level with 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Israeli Defence Force, Israeli Security 
Agency, members of the Knesset (Parliament), the Counter Terrorism Bureau, as well as 
the former and current President of the Supreme Court of Israel. The Special Rapporteur 
also travelled to other parts of Israel, including to the HaSharon and Hadarim prisons 
where he was able to conduct private interviews of security detainees, and to the Ofer 
Military Court where he observed ongoing proceedings. Within the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory he visited, inter alia, Bethlehem, Ramallah and Nablus, examined the route and 
impact of the barrier erected by Israel, and met with the President&#8217;s Office of the 
Palestinian Authority. He met with lawyers, academics, victims of terrorism and 
non-governmental organizations from Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. He 
was also briefed by a number of international organizations, including United Nations 
interlocutors.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur is deeply mindful of the difficulties faced by Israel in its 
efforts to combat acts of terrorism, and the long history of violence in the region, with 
devastating effects on the Israeli and Palestinian civilian population. He was touched by 
the personal accounts of victims of terrorism, who have not only faced the bereavement of 
family and other physical losses, but also struggle to overcome the psychological and 
fear-inducing consequences of terrorism. He emphasises that sustainable security can only 
be achieved through due respect for human rights.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur notes with encouragement that Israel is reconsidering its 
derogation from aspects of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights under a 
declared state of emergency, which has been in existence since the establishment of the 
State of Israel. This reform is long overdue, as the current legal framework for countering 
terrorism is vague and outdated, partly based on pre-1948 instruments and hardly 
compatible with the requirement of legality and Israel&#8217;s commitment to democracy. He 
was informed that new counter-terrorism legislation is being drafted and is further 
encouraged by advice from the Israeli Ministry of Justice that he will be consulted and 
invited to comment upon this legislation prior to its introduction to the Knesset.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur is furthermore pleased to receive assurances from Israeli 
Government sources that Israel is not involved in any global programme of extraordinary 
rendition or secret detention. Central to Israel&#8217;s strategy in the fight against terrorism has 
become the continuing construction of a barrier between Israel and certain towns in the 
West Bank. The route of the barrier, partly a wall and partly a fenced zone with multiple 
physical obstacles, does not follow the Green Line but is largely located within the 
Occupied Palestinian Territory, capturing on its western side or within so-called &#8216;fingers&#8217; 
extending deep into the Palestinian Territory several Israeli settlements located there. At </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>the same time a considerable part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including towns 
and villages, is being separated from the rest of the Territory by the barrier. The winding 
route of the barrier is creating multiple obstacles for movement between even close-by 
communities within the Occupied Palestinian Territory. According to Israeli Government 
interlocutors heard during the visit, the barrier has, together with intelligence and 
surveillance technologies, resulted in a higher level of security and protection against 
terrorist attacks. It is nevertheless having an enormously negative impact upon the 
enjoyment of human rights by the Palestinian people.  
 &#8220;The Special Rapporteur heard from Israeli Government sources of a long-term 
perspective to replace the current and not yet complete unilaterally-positioned barrier with 
an agreed international border with a future Palestinian State. Until this is achieved on the 
basis of genuine negotiations and agreement, the Special Rapporteur emphasises that no 
part of the barrier must be treated as a fait accompli or annexation of territory. Further, 
any associated security measures must not impact disproportionately upon the lives of 
ordinary Palestinian people. Two crucial elements are relevant in this regard in order to 
both comply with the requirements of international human rights and to counteract the 
experiences by Palestinians of the barrier causing increasing arbitrariness and oppression. 
There must be a reduction in the level of hardship to people moving within the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory. The practical implementation of all security measures, including at 
checkpoints and terminals, must also be by professional, transparent, accountable and, to 
largest possible extent, civilian means. The current practices surrounding the route of 
the barrier, and associated security measures, bear a substantial risk of negative and 
counter-productive effects, which may in themselves create conditions conducive to the 
spread of, and recruitment to, terrorism.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned about the impact of the barrier and 
accompanying measures upon the freedom of movement, right to property, right to work, 
right to health, right to education, the right to private and family life, the right to 
non-discrimination and the human dignity of all persons. The route of the barrier and 
associated &#8216;closures&#8217; is impacting upon the access of Palestinians to their land and water 
resources, including through the devastation or separation from villages of agricultural land 
in the course of erecting the barrier, and in some cases has had a devastating 
socio-economic impact upon communities. As a result of closures and the system of 
permits regulating the movement of people from one area to another, the Palestinian people 
are adversely affected in their ability to access education; health services, including 
emergency medical treatment; other social services; and places of employment. The means 
of security screening and searches at checkpoints raises concerns about privacy and 
non-discrimination, particularly heightened in the case of women and children. The 
permits regime furthermore impacts upon the integrity of family units and the ability of 
men and women to marry with persons outside their own permit zones. The legal 
framework against which Israel&#8217;s conduct in its measures against terrorism is to be 
addressed is the combined effect of international humanitarian law and international 
human rights law.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur identifies as a particularly problematic area in the overlap 
between armed conflicts and policing, Israel&#8217;s policy of the targeted killing of persons 
identified as involved in terrorist conduct. Although always a morally inexcusable </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>decision, participation in terrorism does not create a vacuum in the application of the law, 
and the Special Rapporteur is encouraged in that regard by the position of the Supreme 
Court of Israel that the fight against terrorism must be achieved through compliance with 
the law, including international law. He is, however, troubled by the decision of the 
Supreme Court concerning targeted killings, in which the court correctly noted that under 
international humanitarian law a person directly participating in hostilities may during 
armed conflict be a legitimate military target, but where it applied an overly broad and 
vague explanation of what amounts to direct participation in hostilities and paid 
insufficient attention to the fact that not every instance of terrorist conduct will fall under 
the law of armed conflict. The Court nevertheless qualified its position by stating that such 
recourse must be by way of last resort and that arrest must always be preferred and actively 
pursued. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the policy of targeted killings may in 
fact result in cases of extrajudicial execution. 
 &#8220;The Human Rights Committee welcomed, in 1999, the decision of the Supreme 
Court invalidating the former governmental guidelines governing the use by the Israeli 
Security Agency (ISA) of &#8216;moderate physical pressure&#8217; during interrogation. The same 
decision left open the possibility of the application, ex post facto, of the &#8216;necessity defence&#8217; 
under Israeli Penal Law. Even when properly applied this defence does not validate the 
application of physical or psychological means of torture or any form of cruel, inhuman, or 
degrading treatment, but instead means that such wrongful conduct may, in certain very 
limited circumstances, go unpunished in respect of a particular individual but never 
absolve the duty of the state to secure accountability and provide an effective remedy for 
the human rights violation suffered.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur was shocked by the unconvincing and vague illustrations by 
the ISA of when such &#8216;ticking bomb&#8217; scenarios may be applicable. He was troubled by the 
process by which individual interrogators would seek approval from the Director of 
the ISA for the application of special interrogation techniques, potentially rendering this as 
a policy rather than a case-by-case, ex post facto, defence in respect of wrongful conduct. 
He was furthermore concerned by the lack of truly independent and impartial investigation 
mechanisms following the application of such methods. A number of further issues will be 
examined by the Special Rapporteur in his full report including, but not limited to: the 
definition and classification of terrorism, terrorist organizations, and security suspects; the 
demolition of houses; the use of &#8216;human shields&#8217; by the Israeli Defence Force; the 
movement of goods and people to and from Gaza; the use of, and procedures surrounding, 
the administrative detention of security suspects and military courts to try terrorist 
suspects; the use of military force by Israel, including outside its own territory; and the 
rights of victims of terrorism and their families.&#8221;

<p><b>Kenya 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>62. On 14 February 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, sent a 
letter to the Government of Kenya regarding the <b>detention of over 70 persons</b>, Kenyans and 
non-Kenyans. According to the information received, during the month of January 2007, </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>about 70 individuals of Kenyan and other nationalities were arrested by units of the Kenyan 
Police, apparently for terrorism-related reasons. A significant number of these individuals had 
been held or continued to be held incommunicado. In view of their incommunicado detention, 
concern was expressed for their physical and mental integrity. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur also received information about Bashir Ahmed Makhtal, aged 42, a Canadian citizen 
born in Dagahbur, Ogaden; Abdi Abdulahi Osman, 41, a Somali citizen born in Gunagado, 
Dagahbur, Ogaden; Ali Afi Jama, 33, a Somali citizen born in Godey, Ogaden; and Hussein Aw 
Nuur Gurraase, 35, a Somali citizen born in Gunagado, Ogaden, all ethnic Ogadenis trading in 
second-hand clothing in the Horn of Africa (see also paragraphs 45 and 99). According to 
information received, the four men were arrested by Kenyan authorities on 31 December 2006. 
They were held in custody for three weeks without official charges. For two weeks, the 
authorities interrogated them in the absence of lawyers or Canadian Embassy officials. Mr. 
Makhtal, who holds a Canadian passport, was denied access to the Canadian High Commission 
for the first two weeks. Only on 15 January 2007 was Mr. Makhtal granted a brief meeting with 
a Canadian High Commission official and a lawyer his family hired for him. On 21 January 
2007, Mr. Makhtal, Mr. Osman, Mr. Jama and Mr. Gurraase were transferred to the Ethiopian 
armed forces in Mogadishu without any legal basis and without having been given the 
opportunity to appeal the transfer.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Communication from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>63. As of 1 November 2007, no reply had been received to the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; 
correspondence. 
</p>
<p><b>Philippines 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>64. On 5 March 2007, the Special Rapporteur sent a letter to the Government of the 
Philippines regarding the &#8220;<b>Act to Secure the State and Protect our People from Terrorism</b>&#8221;, 
the so-called &#8220;<b>Human Security Act of 2007</b>&#8221;. By letter of 27 September 2005, the Special 
Rapporteur had already addressed several concerns related to his mandate concerning the 
previous draft legislation, which had been under consideration by the Parliament at that moment. 
According to information received, the Human Security Act of 2007, which had been approved 
by the Senate and the Congress in February 2007, was awaiting signature by the President and 
was to enter into force in May 2007. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur drew the 
Government&#8217;s attention to four main substantive areas of concern relating to the new provisions. 
In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, certain aspects of the Act required reconsideration in order to 
secure that its adoption will not lead to human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>65. Section 3 of the Act sets out which crimes are qualified as terrorist crimes. The section 
provides that: &#8220;Any person who commits an act punishable under any of the following 
provisions of the Revised Penal Code (arts. 122, 134, 134 a, 248, 267 and 324) or under 
Presidential Decree No. 1613; Republic Act No. 6969, Republic Act No. 5207; Republic Act 
No. 6235; Presidential Decree No. 532; and Presidential Decree No. 1866, as amended, thereby 
sowing and creating a condition of widespread and extraordinary fear and panic among the 
populace, in order to coerce the government to give in to an unlawful demand shall be guilty of 
the crime of terrorism.&#8221; </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>66. The principle of legality in criminal law, enshrined in several international human rights 
instruments such as article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR), to which the Philippines is a party, implies that the requirement of criminal liability is 
limited to clear and precise provisions in the law, so as to respect the principle of certainty of the 
law and ensure that it is not subject to interpretation which would broaden the scope of the 
proscribed conduct. 
</p>
<p>67. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, at the national level, the specificity of terrorist crimes is 
properly defined by the presence of three cumulative conditions: (a) the means used, which can 
be described as deadly or otherwise serious violence against members of the general population 
or segments of it, or the taking of hostages; (b) the intent, which is to cause fear among the 
population or the destruction of public order or to compel the Government or an international 
organization to doing or refraining from doing something; and (c) the aim, which is to further an 
underlying political or ideological aim. It is only when all of these three conditions are fulfilled 
that an act may be criminalized as terrorist (see E/CN.4/2006/98, para. 50). 
</p>
<p>68. While commending the approach taken by the Philippines to define terrorist acts as 
a combination of a serious ordinary crime with a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; intent and effect, the 
Special Rapporteur expressed his preoccupation at the large number of ordinary crimes listed 
in the Act. As outlined above, it needs to be ensured that the list of offences only includes 
crimes that involve deadly or otherwise serious violence against human persons (condition 1). 
For example, this condition does not seem to be automatically inherent in crimes committed 
under articles 134, 134a and 324 of the Revised Penal Code. Furthermore, the Special 
Rapporteur stressed that reference to complete statutes, such as contained in the Act in the form 
of references to certain presidential decrees and republic acts, and does not meet the requirement 
of clear and precise provisions so as to respect the principle of legal certainty of the law.  
</p>
<p>69. Thus, the definition of terrorist acts as contained in section 3 of the Human Security Act 
suffers from the absence of at least one of the three cumulative conditions for classifying a crime 
as a terrorist crime, i.e. the condition that the crime which is committed is &#8220;deadly or otherwise 
serious violence against members of the general population or segments of it&#8221;. Furthermore, the 
reference to entire statues without specifying the actual criminal offence leads to an 
over-inclusive definition of terrorist crimes. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s opinion, these omissions 
lead to the qualification of crimes as terrorist crimes, which, in fact, do not dispose of the 
distinctive force of terrorist acts. Thus, the definition as contained in the Human Security Act is 
overly broad and therefore at variance with article 15 of the ICCPR.  
</p>
<p>70. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur also referred to the penalty of 40 years of 
imprisonment, without the benefit of parole. The Special Rapporteur expressed his concern at 
this strict penalty for two reasons. First, it applies to all crimes listed in section 3 in an 
undifferentiated manner. For some of theses crimes, this provision may amount to a 
disproportionate punishment. Secondly, the pre-determined, unalterable number of years of 
imprisonment does limit the judicial discretion of taking into consideration the individual&#8217;s 
personal guilt and other significant circumstances when rendering the verdict. In this respect, 
however, the Special Rapporteur noted his sincere relief that capital punishment has not been 
included as a punishment for terrorist crimes, which, in his view, reflects an important 
development affecting a broader range of issues in the Philippines.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>71. Section 19 of the Act provides that &#8220;in the event of an actual or imminent terrorist attack, 
suspects may not be detained for more than three (3) days without the written approval of a 
municipal, city, provincial or regional official of a Human Rights Commission or judge of the 
municipal, regional trial court, the Sandiganbayan or a justice of the Court of Appeals nearest the 
place of the arrest&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>72. While noting with satisfaction that the maximum period of detention has been decreased 
considerably, the Special Rapporteur would like to highlight his concern as to the competence of 
officials of Human Rights Commissions of the Philippines to approve a detention of an 
individual according to international standards.  
</p>
<p>73. According to article 9, paragraph 1, of the ICCPR, everyone has the right to liberty of the 
person and no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. According to article 9, 
paragraph 3, of the ICCPR, anyone arrested or detained on criminal charge shall be brought 
promptly before a judge and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable amount of time or 
release. The right to challenge the lawfulness of one&#8217;s detention before a court is provided by 
article 9, paragraph 4, of the ICCPR. The Human Rights Committee confirmed in its 
general comment No. 29 of 2001 that this right is protected at all times, including during a state 
of emergency. This is partly because of the crucial role of procedural guarantees in securing 
compliance with the non-derogable right under article 7 of the ICCPR not to be subjected to 
torture or any other form of inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment.  
</p>
<p>74. According to the information obtained, Human Rights Commissions are composed of 
members of the executive branch. Therefore, &#8220;a municipal, city, provincial or regional official of 
a Human Rights Commission&#8221; does not amount to a court in the meaning of article 9, 
paragraph 4, of the ICCPR. Hence, this provision of the Act is incompatible with the ICCPR, 
which the Philippines have ratified without reservations.  
</p>
<p>75.  Section 26 of the Act provides for restrictions on the right to travel, movement, 
communication and correspondence &#8220;[i]n cases where evidence of guilt is not strong, and the 
person charged with the crime of terrorism or conspiracy to commit terrorism is entitled to bail 
and is granted the same (&#8230;)&#8221; upon order by the court. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur 
highlighted that conditions for such restriction to the right to travel, or imposition of house arrest 
should not be defined through the absence of evidence &#8220;in cases where evidence of guilt is not 
strong&#8221;, which, in any case raises concerns as to the legal certainty of this clause. Instead, the 
pre-condition for such restriction should be the degree of suspicion or evidence which must meet 
a certain threshold. Furthermore, the restrictions in correspondence and communication would 
amount to a disproportionate measure when it was imposed as an automatic or default 
consequence of home arrest. It should be enshrined in the act that the court may order such 
measures when they are considered necessary, suitable and proportionate in the individual case 
at hand.   
</p>
<p>76. Lastly, section 53 of the Act establishes the Anti-Terrorism Council and assigns it 
functions as enshrined in section 54 of the Act. According to the information obtained, the 
Council is exclusively composed of members of the executive. Given its composition and the 
broad powers vested in the Anti-Terrorism Council, the question of its accountability arises. 
Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur referred to paragraph 8 of article 54 of the Act, which 
appears to confer the power to rearrange the organization of the judiciary on an ad hoc basis to </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>the Anti-Terrorism Council. These arrangements ought to be regulated by the legislature as they 
may endanger the principle of the separation of powers in general and the independence of the 
judiciary in particular.  
</p><p>77. The Special Rapporteur, after several meetings and communications with the Government 
of the Philippines has proposed a 10-day period for a visit during the dates of 10 to 
22 January 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Communication from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>78. By letter dated 9 May 2007, the Government replied to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
communication of 5 March 2007. The Government of the Philippines thereby provides views 
and comments on the concerns raised by the Special Rapporteur on human rights and 
counter-terrorism with regard to the Human Security Act of 2007.  
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s first concern is that there is a need to be ensured that the list of 
offences only includes crimes that involve deadly or otherwise serious violence against human 
persons. This condition does not seem to be automatically inherent in crimes committed under 
articles 134, 134a and 324 of the Revised Penal Code.  
</p>
<p>80. A reading of the Senate deliberations shows that, for there to be a crime of terrorism, there 
must be present, in addition to any of the crimes enumerated in section 3 of the Human Security 
Act (HSA), both the elements of sowing and creating a condition of widespread and 
extraordinary fear and panic among the populace, attempting to coerce the Government to give 
in to an unlawful demand. 
</p>
<p>81. Special Rapporteur&#8217;s second concern is that reference to complete statutes, such as 
contained in the Act in the form of references to certain presidential decrees and republic acts, 
does not meet the requirement of clear and precise provisions so as to respect the principle of 
legal certainty of the law. The reference to the entire statutes without specifying the actual 
criminal offence leads to an over-inclusive definition of terrorist crimes.  
</p>
<p>82. The Government of the Philippines disagrees. Section 14 (1) and (2), article III (Bill of 
Rights), of the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines provides that: &#8220;No person shall be held to 
answer for a criminal offense without due process of law&#8221; and that &#8220;In all criminal prosecutions, 
the accused shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, and shall enjoy the right to 
be heard by himself and counsel, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against 
him.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>83. In addition, section 8, rule 110 (Prosecution of Offenses) of the Rules of Court states:  
</p>
<p> &#8220;Designation of the offense: The complaint or information shall state the designation 
of the offense given by the statute, aver the acts or omissions constituting the offense, and 
specify its qualifying and aggravating circumstances. If there is no designation of the 
offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute punishing it. It is 
a constitutional right of any person who stands charged in a criminal prosecution to be 
informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him or her.&#8221;  </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>84. Pursuant to section 8 of rule 110 cited above, for a complaint or information to be 
sufficient, it must, inter alia, state the designation of the offence by the statute, and the acts or 
omissions complained of as constituting the offence. This is essential to avoid surprises for the 
accused and to afford him the opportunity to prepare his defence accordingly. To comply with 
these fundamental requirements of the Constitution and the Rules on Criminal Procedure, it is 
imperative for the specific statute violated to be designated or mentioned in the charge. 
However, there is no law which requires that, in order for an accused to be convicted, the 
specific provision which penalizes the offence be mentioned in the inquiry. It is not the 
designation of the offence in the complaint or inquiry that is decisive. What is decisive are the 
allegations therein which directly apprise the accused of the nature and cause of the accusation 
against him.<b>1</b> Therefore, although no particular provisions of the special laws were cited in 
section 3 of the HSA, so long as the complaint or the charges filed against the accused contains 
an allegation of the acts or omissions constituting terrorism, the requirements of the Constitution 
and of the Rules of Court are deemed complied with. 
</p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s third concern is the penalty of 40 years imprisonment, without 
the benefit of parole. This is a strict penalty because it applies to all crimes listed in section 3 of 
the Act in an undifferentiated manner. The pre-determined, unalterable number of years of 
imprisonment limits judicial discretion for taking into consideration the individual&#8217;s personal 
guilt and other significant circumstances when rendering the verdict. 
</p>
<p>86. Section 2 of Act No. 1403 (Indeterminate Sentence Law), as amended, which enumerates 
the instances wherein the convicted persons are not entitled to parole, reads:  
</p>
<p> &#8220;This Act shall not apply to Persons convicted of offenses punished with the death 
penalty or life-imprisonment; to those convicted of treason, conspiracy or proposal to 
commit treason; to those convicted of misprision of treason, rebellion, sedition or 
espionage; to those convicted of piracy; to those who are habitual delinquents; to those 
who shall have escaped from confinement or evaded sentence; to those who having been 
granted conditional pardon by the Chief Executive shall have violated the terms thereof; to 
those whose maximum term of imprisonment does not exceed one year, not to those 
already sentenced by final judgment at the time of the approval of this Act, except as 
provided in Section 5 hereof&#8221;.<b> </b></p>
<p>Since the crime of terrorism is considered a crime against national security and the law of 
nations, persons convicted of the crime of terrorism are likewise not entitled to parole 
because their cases are analogous to these enumerated in Act No. 1403, as amended. It is 
worth mentioning that on 24 June 2006, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed into 
law R.A. No. 9346, which prohibited the imposition of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s fourth concern is that human rights commissions are composed 
of members of the executive branch. &#8220;A municipal, city, provincial or regional official of a 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Human Rights Commission&#8221; does not amount to a court in the meaning of article 9, paragraph 4, 
of the ICCPR. Hence, this provision is incompatible with the Covenant, which the Philippines 
has ratified without reservations.<b> </b></p>
<p>88. An understanding of what the Commission on Human Rights is, vis-&#224;-vis the courts in the 
Philippines, needs amplification.<b> </b> To set the record straight, the Commission on Human Rights is 
not composed of members of the executive branch. It was created by the 1987 Constitution as an 
independent office, although not at the same level as the other Constitutional Commissions. It 
serves as the &#8220;watchdog&#8221; or Ombudsman of the people to guard against human rights abuses 
committed against them.<b> </b> The Commission should be distinguished from the Human Rights 
Committee, now renamed and reconstituted as the Presidential Human Rights Committee 
(PHRC), which was formed to serve as the primary advisory body to the President in effectively 
addressing urgent human rights concerns/issues in the entire country.<b> </b> PHRC is composed of 
members from the executive branch. Under Administrative Order No. 163, s. 2006, the 
Chairperson of the CHR, the Ombudsman, the Chairperson of the Senate Committee on Justice 
and Human Rights and the Supreme Court Administrator may join the PHRC as observers.<b> </b> 89. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s fifth concern<b> </b>is that the conditions for the restriction to the right 
to travel, or imposition of house arrest under section 26 of the Act should not be defined through 
the absence of evidence &#8220;in cases where evidence of guilt is not strong&#8221;. Instead, the 
precondition for such restriction should be the degree of suspicion or evidence which must meet 
a certain threshold. The restrictions on correspondence and communication under section 26 of 
the Act would amount to a disproportionate measure when imposed as an automatic or default 
consequence of house arrest. It should be enshrined in the Act that the court may order such 
measures when they are considered necessary, suitable and proportionate in the individual case 
at hand. 
</p>
<p>90. Section 26 of the HSA should be read in relation to the following provisions of article III 
(Bill of Rights), of the 1987 Constitution: &#8220;All persons, except those charged with offenses 
punishable by reclusion perpetua when evidence of guilt is strong, shall, before conviction, be 
bailable by sufficient sureties, or be released on recognizance as may be provided by law. The 
right to bail shall not be impaired even when the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is suspended. Excessive bail shall not be required.&#8221;<b> </b></p>
<p>91. Section 6 states that the liberty of abode and of changing the same within the limits 
prescribed by law shall not be impaired except upon lawful order of the court. Neither shall the 
right to travel be impaired except in the interest of national security, public safety, or public 
health, as may be provided by law.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s sixth concern is section 53 of the Act establishes the 
Anti-Terrorism Council. According to the information obtained, the Council is exclusively 
composed of members of the executive. Given its composition and the broad powers vested in 
the Anti-Terrorism Council, the question of its accountability arises.<b> </b>Under section 1, article XI 
(Accountability of Public Officers)<b> </b>of the 1987 Constitution, &#8220;Public office is a public trust&#8221;. 
The notion of a public trust connotes accountability.<b> </b> Congress has put in place mechanisms to 
see to it that the rights of the people will be safeguarded.<b> </b> Under section 59 of the HSA, a Joint 
Oversight Committee, composed of five members each from the Senate and the House in 
addition to the Chairs of the Committees of Public Order of both Houses<b> </b>was created to oversee </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the Act.<b> </b> Upon the expiration of one year after the Act is approved by the 
President, the Committee shall review the HSA, particularly the provisions that authorize the 
surveillance of suspects of, or persons charged with, the crime of terrorism.  
</p>
<p>93. To that end, the Committee shall summon the police and law enforcement officers and the 
members of the Anti-Terrorism Council and require them to answer questions from the members 
of Congress and to submit a written report of the acts they have done in the implementation of 
the law, including the manner in which the persons suspected of or charged with the crime of 
terrorism have been dealt with in their custody and from the date when the movements of the 
latter were subjected to surveillance and his or her correspondences, messages, conversations 
and the like were listened to or subjected to monitoring, recording and tapping. A Grievance 
Committee was also created composed of the Ombudsman as Chair, and the Solicitor General 
and an under-secretary from the Department of Justice, as members, to receive and evaluate 
complaints against the actuations of police and law enforcement officials in the implementation 
of the HSA. 
</p>
<p>94. Moreover, to discourage frivolous accusations and to ensure that only airtight indictments 
of terrorism are brought before the courts, section 50 of the HSA entitles the person accused of 
terrorism, upon acquittal, to the payment of damages in the amount of P 500,000 for every day 
that he/she has been detained or deprived of liberty or arrested without a warrant as a result of 
such an accusation.<b> </b> The award of damages shall be without prejudice to the right of the acquitted 
accused to file criminal or administrative charges against those responsible for charging him/her 
with the case of terrorism. In addition, section 41 for the HSA also entitles the person suspected 
of or charged with the crime of terrorism or conspiracy to commit terrorism, upon his or her 
acquittal or the dismissal of the charges against him or her, to the payment of damages in the 
amount of P 500,000 a day for the period in which his properties, assets or funds were seized. In 
both instances, the amount of damages shall he taken from the appropriations of the police or law 
enforcement agency that caused the filing of the charges against him/her.<b> </b></p>
<p>95. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s seventh concern<b> </b>is that<b> </b>article 54 (8) of the Act appears to confer 
the power to re-arrange the organization of the judiciary on an ad hoc basis to the Anti-Terrorism 
Council. These arrangements ought to be regulated by the legislature as they may endanger the 
principle of the separation of powers in general and the independence of the judiciary in 
particular.<b> </b>The Philippines disagrees. The designation of special courts will not in any way affect 
the independence of the judiciary. It is a power vested in an independent Supreme Court to 
provide focus and expedite terrorism cases pending in the lower courts. Under the Constitution, 
the jurisdiction of courts, other than the irreducible jurisdiction of the Supreme Court prescribed 
under section 5, article VIII of the 1987 Constitution, is determined by Congress. However, it is 
the Supreme Court which has administrative supervision over all lower courts and their 
personnel. This is a significant innovation towards strengthening the independence of the 
judiciary. 
96. The authority to promulgate rules concerning pleading, practice and procedure and 
admission to the practice of law is a traditional power of the Supreme Court. The grant of this 
authority, coupled with its authority to integrate the Bar, to have administrative supervision over 
all courts, and to discipline judges of lower courts, in effect places in the hands of the Supreme </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p>Court the totality of the administration of justice and thus makes for a more independent 
judiciary.<b>2</b> The Supreme Court, in the exercise of its administrative supervision over all courts, 
has, in the past and pursuant to law, designated special courts to handle special cases. For 
example, section 90 of R.A. No. 9165 (Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002) provides 
that &#8220;the Supreme Court shall designate special courts from among existing Regional Trial 
Courts to exclusively try and hear drugs cases&#8221;. Pursuant to R.A. No. 8369 (Family Courts Act 
of 1997), the Supreme Court issued Administrative Memorandum 99-1-13 which established the 
Family Courts. Under Section 5 of R.A. No. 9160 (Anti-Money Laundering Act), as amended, 
&#8220;(T) he regional trial courts shall have jurisdiction to try all cases of money laundering&#8221;. Acting 
on the request of the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC), the Supreme Court <i>en banc 
</i>issued a resolution designating the existing commercial courts as anti-money laundering courts. 
So even in the absence of an express provision of law, the Anti-Terrorism Council can request 
the Supreme Court to designate anti-terrorism courts to try and decide violation of 
R.A. No. 9372. Said request will not affect the independence of the judiciary since the discretion 
to establish anti-terrorism courts falls not with the Anti-Terrorism Council but, with the Supreme 
Court, in the exercise of its administrative supervision over all courts.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Statement of the Special Rapporteur on the Human Security Act of 2007</b> 
</p>
<p>97. The Special Rapporteur issued the following statement on 12 March 2007: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;On 6 March the Bill, titled The Act to Secure the State and Protect our People from 
Terrorism, otherwise known as the &#8216;Human Security Act of 2007&#8217; was signed into law by 
the President of the Philippines. This law is scheduled to take effect in July 2007, two 
months after the May elections. During this interim period, the Special Rapporteur 
encourages the legislative branch of Government in the Philippines to reconsider this new 
counter-terrorism law which was approved by Congress in a Special Session of Parliament 
on 19 February 2007. It is the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s hope that there will be further debate 
which may result in the introduction of specific amendments or repeal of the entire Act by 
the new Congress elected this spring, since implementation of this law could have a 
negative impact on human rights in the country and undermines the rule of law. There are 
some positive aspects of the definition of terrorist acts in the Human Security Act but the 
end result is an overly broad definition which is seen to be at variance with the principle of 
legality and thus incompatible with article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights (ICCPR). Further, the strict application of a penalty of 40 years&#8217; 
imprisonment undermines judicial discretion in individual cases and may result in a 
disproportionate punishment due to the broad definition of terrorist acts. While there has 
been some improvement regarding the length of pre-charge detention in the final version of 
this law, there is a further concern regarding the competence of various bodies authorized 
to review detention of an individual since some of these are members of the executive 
rather than an independent judicial body. Thus, section 19 of the Human Security Act 
appears to lack the procedural guarantees provided by article 9 of the ICCPR.

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1

</p>
<p> &#8220;Another area of concern is that the Act provides for restrictions on movement 
including the imposition of house arrest where the legal basis is simply &#8216;in cases where 
evidence of guilt is not strong&#8217; rather than positive suspicion or a higher evidentiary 
threshold.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Philippines is a country facing many challenging issues and the Special 
Rapporteur wishes to reaffirm that he is fully conscious of the need to take effective 
measures to prevent and counter terrorism, and of the difficulties of States in doing so 
without compromising the freedoms of a civil society. However, the Special Rapporteur is 
concerned that many provisions of the Human Security Act are not in accordance with 
international human rights standards.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government back in September 2005 and addressed several 
concerns regarding the draft version of this legislation on counter terrorism which was under 
consideration by the Parliament at that time. He also communicated his concerns to the 
Government regarding the most recent version of the bill just before it was due to become law.  
</p>
<p><b>Saudi Arabia 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>98. On 8 February 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairperson-Rapporteur of 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of 
judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, sent a 
letter to the Government of Saudi Arabia regarding <b>Sulieman al-Rushudi</b>, lawyer, 
<b>Essam al-Basrawi</b>, lawyer, <b>Saud al-Hashimi</b>, a medical doctor, <b>Al-Sharif Saif al-Ghalib</b>, 
<b>Musa al-Qirni</b>, a university professor, <b>Abdel Rahman al-Shumayri</b>, also a university 
professor, <b>Abdelaziz al-Khariji</b>, and at least three other persons, whose identities are yet to be 
confirmed. All these individuals have been active as human rights defenders. In particular, they 
engaged in signing petitions addressed to King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, calling on him 
to initiate political and democratic reforms and to respect human rights. According to the 
information received, the above-mentioned persons were arrested in the cities of Jeddah and 
Madinah on 3 February 2007, where they had met to discuss the organization of peaceful 
activities in favour of political and democratic reforms in Saudi Arabia. The 10 men were held 
incommunicado at the offices of the General Intelligence Service (al-Mabahith al-&#8217;Amma) in 
Jeddah. Requests for access by their families and to appoint lawyers have been denied by the 
General Intelligence Service. On 5 February 2007, Mr. Al-Basrawi&#8217;s son asked for a visit and 
attempted to hand over medicine for his ill and disabled father. He was ordered to return home 
and warned never to ask again to meet with Mr. Al-Basrawi. The Ministry of the Interior issued a 
statement alleging that the detainees were arrested on suspicion of fund-raising to support 
terrorism. Mr. Al-Rushudi and Mr. Al-Ghalib had been detained before and released after several 
weeks following the signing of a petition in March 2004 calling for political change in 
Saudi Arabia. Concern was expressed that the detention of Mr. Al-Rushudi, Mr. Al-Basrawi, 
Dr. Al-Hashimi, Mr. Al-Ghalib, Dr. Al-Qirni, Dr. Al-Shumayri, Mr. Al-Khariji, and the three 
other persons mentioned above may be related to their legitimate and peaceful activities in 
defence of human rights. In view of their incommunicado detention concern was expressed that 
these individuals may be at risk of ill-treatment. Further concerns were expressed as regards </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 29 
 
</p>
<p>Mr. Al-Basrawi&#8217;s status of health since he has reportedly been denied to receive medication from 
his son. Concern was also expressed that the charge of &#8220;terrorism&#8221; is used in order to prevent 
them from pursuing human rights and political activities.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Communication from the Government

<p><b>Somalia 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communication sent to the Government by the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p>100. On 13 February 2007, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Special Rapporteur on 
the question of torture, sent a letter to the Government of Somalia regarding <b>Bashir Ahmed 
Makhtal</b>, 42, a Canadian citizen born in Dagahbur, Ogaden; <b>Abdi Abdulahi Osman</b>, 41, a 
Somali citizen born in Gunagado, Dagahbur, Ogaden; <b>Ali Afi Jama</b>, 33, a Somali citizen born in 
Godey, Ogaden; and <b>Hussein Aw Nuur Gurraase</b>, 35, a Somali citizen born in Gunagado, 
Ogaden (see also paragraphs 45 and 99). All of them are ethnic Ogadenis trading in second-hand 
clothing in the Horn of Africa. According to the information received on 31 December 2006, 
Bashir Ahmed Makhtal, Abdi Abdulahi Osman, Ali Afi Jama, and Hussein Aw Nuur Gurraase 
were arrested by Kenyan authorities, who suspected them to be terrorists. The arrests were 
reportedly conducted on the basis of provisions of an anti-terrorism bill which has not yet been 
adopted. The four men were held in custody for three weeks without charge. On 
21 January 2007, they were transferred to the Ethiopian armed forces in Mogadishu. Concern 
was expressed that the four individuals might be subjected to ill-treatment because of their 
ethnicity. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Communication from the Government

<p>101. As at 1 November 2007, no reply had been received to the Special Rapporteurs&#8217;

</p>
<p><b>South Africa 
</b></p>
<p><b>Statement of the Special Rapporteur on his mission to South Africa 
</b></p>
<p>102. The Special Rapporteur issued his preliminary findings on his mission to South Africa 
on 26 April 2007 during a press conference held in Pretoria (see report of the Special Rapporteur 
on his mission to South Africa, A/HRC/6/17/Add.2): 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur conducted a 10-day visit to South Africa from 16 to 
26 April 2007, at the invitation of the Government. The Special Rapporteur visited 
Pretoria, Johannesburg, Midrand and Cape Town. He had high-level meetings with 
ministers or officials responsible for foreign affairs, justice, defence, safety and security, 
intelligence, corrections and home affairs. During the visit, he met with the national police 
force, the national prosecuting authority, the judiciary, parliamentary committees, the 
Human Rights Commission, a representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees, lawyers, academics and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The Special </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 30 
 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur also had the opportunity to visit a correctional detention centre and to observe a 
trial in the High Court of Pretoria related to charges that could fall under the notion of 
terrorism. The purpose of the visit was twofold: firstly, to examine South Africa&#8217;s laws, 
policies and practices on counter terrorism and to assess how such measures affect the 
protection and promotion of human rights, and secondly, to examine the role South Africa 
plays in southern Africa and on the African continent in countering terrorism in the 
international context. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Historical context: after the repression of apartheid, South Africa, in the early 
1990s, made its transition from apartheid into a full-fledged parliamentary democracy, 
marked particularly by the adoption of the Constitution in 1995. The transition process was 
in many ways exceptional through its non-violent and inclusive approach. The strong 
constitutional foundation on which South Africa rests today is evident and enjoys broad 
support within society. South Africa has also demonstrated a leadership role on both the 
African continent and internationally, which includes at present holding a seat on the 
Security Council. The country continues to grapple with many challenges, particularly 
related to access to the most essential social and economic rights. An active civil society in 
conjunction with a full-fledged judicial system, including the Constitutional Court, has 
deepened the practical meaning of South Africa&#8217;s human rights commitments.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;Perceived terrorists threats: this historical setting forms the background for 
South Africa&#8217;s measures in the context of the promotion and protection of human rights 
while countering terrorism. The issue of protecting human rights while countering 
terrorism has a particular significance in today&#8217;s South Africa. During apartheid, the notion 
of &#8216;terrorism&#8217; was used as an instrument of widespread and systemic human rights 
violations by the regime. Today, the Government of South Africa does not perceive 
terrorism, from national or international groups, as a serious threat to the country. The 
Government, however, remains vigilant and expresses its readiness to cooperate in 
international measures to combat terrorism. Further the Government stresses its preference 
for multilateral action within the framework of the United Nations on this issue. The 
Government sees terrorist acts primarily as crimes, which are to be dealt with using the 
methods of intelligence, investigations and prosecutions within the framework of the 
ordinary criminal justice system. In the last decade, this approach is reflected in two 
incidents which could be referred to as terrorism. Firstly, the violence by PAGAD (People 
Against Gangsterism and Drugs) primarily in the Western Cape, and the violence 
attributed to &#8216;Boeremag&#8217;, a group of white South Africans suspected of carrying out acts of 
violence, including bombings with human casualties, in 2001-2002. PAGAD is today seen 
as a spent force without recruitment or financial basis. The Boeremag trial is ongoing since 
several years, but the violent attacks have ceased. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Counter-Terrorism Act of 2005: due to internal pressures and certain gaps in 
South Africa&#8217;s national legislation, where particular terrorist acts committed outside 
South Africa were not criminalized, a report was prepared by the South African Law 
Review Commission. After extensive consultation with civil society, Parliament approved </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 31 
 
</p>
<p>the Protection of Constitutional Democracy against Terrorist and Related Activities Act 
(POCDATARA) in 2005. Today, this law provides the overall legal framework for 
counter-terrorism in South Africa. The Ministry of Safety and Security has main 
responsibility for its implementation. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;To date, no jurisprudence is available regarding the implementation of the new 
terrorism law. However, there is a pending prosecution, related to an associated crime in 
the Boeremag trial, which is scheduled to commence pursuant to the new law in the 
coming months. Hence, areas of concern can, at this stage, only be raised regarding the text 
as it stands, having not been applied.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;Thus, the Special Rapporteur draws attention in particular to the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; On the face of it, section 1, subsection 1 (xxv) (a) of the definition of terrorist 
activity appears overly broad, covering several offences that do not necessarily 
include deadly or otherwise serious violence against members of the general 
population or segments of it; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Taking into account that the above concern is mitigated by the fact that in practice 
the range of crimes covered by the notion of terrorist activity would be narrowed 
down by the cumulative requirements of subsection (b) on terrorist intent and 
subsection (c) on political or analogous aim, subsection (a) nevertheless projects 
to the world, including other African countries, an incorrect message as to what 
kind of acts may amount to terrorism;  
</p>
<p>&#8722; The reporting duty set out in section 12 of the law in respect of all crimes under 
the Act raises issues related to the freedom of expression generally and, in 
particular, journalists&#8217; ability to protect their sources. Nevertheless, the Special 
Rapporteur recognizes certain elements of the Act as examples of good practice; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The criminal proceedings pursuant to the Act basically fall under general 
South African criminal law and all its safeguards; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The authorities clearly state that racial/ethnic/religious profiling are neither a part 
of the collection of intelligence or used in investigations, but rather any profiling 
is based on individual behaviour; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; There are no provisions of administrative detention in the South African 
counter-terrorism law. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur draws attention to the fact that, in many countries, cases 
related to terrorism often trigger special procedures or even the jurisdiction of special 
courts, and that Governments may feel justified to proceed in an exceptional manner to 
such generally accepted practices such as the right to a public trial. In this context, the 
Special Rapporteur is concerned that the Government of South Africa has made an 
application for an <i>in camera</i> trial in a security-related case. Further, in the context of 
countering terrorism, national legislation is often borrowed and copied by other countries </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p>in a piecemeal way, and if sections of the South African Counter-Terrorism Act are 
inserted into a national framework with less developed legal safeguards, it may indeed 
threaten human rights. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Listing of Individuals and Entities:<b> </b>sections 25 and 26 of the Act relate to the listing 
of individuals and entities by the United Nations Security Council as terrorists pursuant to 
Security Council resolution 1267. According to section 25, the listings when completed are 
published by Presidential Proclamation in the <i>Government Gazette</i>. The lists are then 
submitted to Parliament, which may take any action which it may deem appropriate. The 
Special Rapporteur notes as a good practice that the law sets out a clear procedure for the 
publication of the list, as for instance, financial transactions with persons placed on the list 
may place other individuals within the ambit of criminal liability. However, for the 
individuals and entities listed, the nature and scope of the parliamentary action envisaged 
remain unclear. The Special Rapporteur received several interpretations of the proceedings 
that follow from the listing and the form and scope of potential judicial review, not 
provided explicitly by the Act itself. The Special Rapporteur is troubled by the fact that 
these discussions of a proper parliamentary procedure and a prospect of judicial review 
appear to have arisen only recently and in respect of a public discussion on the possible 
United Nations listing of two South African nationals. This current situation in 
South Africa also demonstrates the shortcomings of the United Nations listing process. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Police services: law enforcement agencies naturally play a crucial role in 
counter-terrorism, and professional conduct and adherence to human rights is a central 
pillar in their ability to collect intelligence and conduct investigations in relation to terrorist 
acts. The apartheid era of South African law enforcement was grim, and therefore, it has 
been an enormous task to create a South African Police Service (SAPS) which has the trust 
of the community. However, allegations of police brutality persist in South Africa. For 
clarity and transparency on the issue of police unjustified use of force, the Special 
Rapporteur draws attention to the concluding observations by the Committee against 
Torture (CAT), which include the recommendation to prohibit in law all forms of torture 
and ill-treatment, and to incorporate in the law a specific criminalization of torture. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Immigration in the context of counter-terrorism:<b> </b>in the international debate on 
terrorism, foreigners are often depicted as a risk. South African authorities and NGOs 
generally do not perceive immigrants as a risk for potential terrorist acts. It came to the 
attention of the Special Rapporteur that arrests of foreigners have taken place on the basis 
of security-related issues. Although formally, detention took place due to overstepping of 
immigration rules. At the same time, allegations or rumours were frequently raised 
concerning huge backlogs and corruption in the practices of the Department of Home 
Affairs. These trends raise concerns both in terms of the rights of foreigners and the risk of 
South Africa becoming a safe haven for organized crime or terrorist activities. 
South Africa has a determined policy of non-discrimination and promotion of equality, 
enshrined in both its Constitution and legislation. Most rights in the Constitution apply to 
every person in South Africa, including the right to housing and the right to emergency 
health care. For instance in the <i>Lawyers for Human Rights </i>case the Constitutional Court 
delineated the applicability of the rights protections under the Constitution to foreigners. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 33 
 
</p>
<p>Despite the clarity of the law, the Special Rapporteur was surprised at statements by even 
high-level governmental persons to the effect that illegal aliens would not enjoy rights in 
South Africa. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Non-refoulement: before and during the visit, the case of Khalid Rashid, a Pakistani 
national who left South Africa on 6 November 2005, allegedly on a chartered airplane 
escorted by Pakistani authorities was brought to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention. Until 
April 2007, the whereabouts of Mr. Rashid was unknown. Numerous court submissions 
have been filed on his behalf, and the case is ongoing. Without assessing the merits of the 
case, the Special Rapporteur notes that the discussion around it gives rise to a number of 
general concerns: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The distinction between extradition and deportation and the respective provisions 
to be followed; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The principle of non-refoulement in South African law and practice, whilst clearly 
anchored in the Constitution and reaffirmed in the <i>Mohamed </i>case, does not appear 
to be understood by all authorities and is included neither in the Extradition Act 
nor in the Immigration Act; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; The detention practices in respect of foreigners subject to removal 
 &#8220;The Special Rapporteur recommends the insertion of a general non-refoulement 
clause in the legislation, prohibiting any removal of a person, be it extradition, deportation 
or other form of removal to face a real risk of capital punishment, torture, or any form of 
inhuman, cruel or degrading treatment or punishment. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Immigration detention: the Immigration Act of 2002 gives immigration officers the 
power to detain a foreigner and to within 48 hours determine the status of the foreigner. If 
the person is illegally in the country, deportation procedures are to be instituted and the 
person can be detained by order of the immigration officer. No judicial or administrative 
review is required, and despite, inter alia, the right to legal counsel as stated in section 35 
(2) of the Constitution, access to legal advice or counsel appears problematic. This is a 
cause of concern particularly in the counter-terrorism context, as the Special Rapporteur 
heard several reports of persons in security-related cases having been detained not in 
facilities subscribed as immigration holdings, but in police stations, especially in the 
Pretoria area. No independent monitoring agency is conducting visits to police detention 
facilities where detained foreigners might be held in terrorism-related cases. The Special 
Rapporteur regrets that the authorities were unable to facilitate his requests to visit these 
facilities in order to conduct interviews with staff and detainees, including on issues 
concerning access to counsel and access to judicial review of detention. Mindful of the 
commitment by post-apartheid South Africa to the principle &#8216;no detention without trial&#8217;, 
the Special Rapporteur regrets that this principle may not be complied with in respect of 
foreigners who, rightly or wrongly, are suspected by other countries of terrorism. The 
Special Rapporteur finds that the current practices of immigration detention may raise 
issues under article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 
concerning the right to personal liberty, and recommends that detention practices be </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p>reformed so as to allow for mandatory judicial review of detention decisions, for access to 
legal counsel, and the institution of an independent body for oversight of immigration 
detention. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Community relations: South Africa is committed to maintaining good community 
relations across ethnic, religious or other lines. Many of the governmental interlocutors of 
the Special Rapporteur also emphasized that South Africa&#8217;s foreign policy is deliberately 
pursuing a strategy that is broadly supported at home so as to give the least possible 
occasion for resentment both within and outside its territory. The Special Rapporteur 
commends South Africa for its commitment to prevent terrorism. Concerns however have 
been raised in relation to the violence and even murders targeted towards Somalian 
nationals, mainly in the Cape. For good community relations to persist, concerted action is 
needed. The Special Rapporteur encourages South Africa to formulate clear policy 
objectives and concrete programmes for the eradication of xenophobia and inter-ethnic 
violence. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Regional role: South Africa plays a key role in all major political forums on the 
African continent, including the African Union (AU), New Partnership for Africa&#8217;s 
Development (NEPAD), and Southern African Development Community (SADC). The 
Government supports both the AU counter-terrorism centre in Algiers and the 
establishment of an early warning mechanism on conflict in the SADC region. The Special 
Rapporteur also learned about the research network on counter-terrorism, ANTCT. This is 
particularly encouraging in light of the need for multidisciplinary, international research 
on terrorism and conditions conducive to terrorism. The Special Rapporteur encourages 
South Africa, both within the AU and SADC, to work towards the development of model 
laws on counter-terrorism which are in conformity with international human rights 
standards. Also in this context the Special Rapporteur encourages accession to 
international human rights instruments. In particular, South Africa should take a leading 
role in promoting the ratification of the ICCPR, the CAT and their Optional Protocols, as 
well as other human rights treaties, by all African States, so as to ensure the international 
monitoring of the compliance with human rights in countering terrorism. The Special 
Rapporteur thanks the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for its cooperation. He would also like 
to thank all his interlocutors, both governmental and non-governmental institutions for 
sharing their insights and ideas. The Special Rapporteur expresses his appreciation for the 
logistical support provided by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in 
Pretoria. The Special Rapporteur will submit his full report on the visit to the 
United Nations Human Rights Council.&#8221;

<p><b>Turkey 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communications from the Government 
</b></p>
<p>104. By letter of 11 April 2007, the Government replied to the communication sent by the 
Special Rapporteur of 24 July 2006 as follow-up to his mission to Turkey conducted in 
February 2006. 
</p>
<p>105. The Government reports that article 1 of the Anti-Terror Law dated 12 December 1991, 
No. 3713, defines terrorism as &#8220;any kind of acts which constitute an offence perpetrated by a 
person or persons who are members of an organization, through use of force and violence and by 
employing any of the methods of coercion, intimidation, oppression, suppression or threat for the 
purpose of altering the fundamentals of the Republic stated in the Constitution, its political, 
legal, social, secular and economic order, impairing the indivisible integrity of the State with its 
territory and nation, endangering the existence of the Turkish State and its Republic, weakening 
or annihilating or seizing the State authority, destroying fundamental rights and freedoms, 
impairing the internal and external safety of the State, public order or public health&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>106. The Government further emphasizes that Law No. 4928, which was adopted in 2003, 
amended article 1 of Law No. 3713 in order to rearrange the components of the term &#8220;terrorism&#8221;. 
Prior to this amendment, &#8220;use of force and violence&#8221; was among the methods of terrorism in the 
definition (&#8220;any kind of acts perpetrated &#8230; by employing any of the methods of force and 
violence, coercion, intimidation, oppression&#8221;). However, with the amendments introduced to the 
article, &#8220;use of force and violence&#8221; has been incorporated into the definition of terrorism as a 
fundamental component comprising this crime. The purpose of this amendment is to prevent 
overly broad interpretations of the definition of terrorism. Use of force and violence is now a 
threshold for acts of quality for terrorism. This constitutes a safeguard for those acts that fall 
within the boundaries of fundamental rights and freedoms. The new formulation of the definition 
of terrorism, which is given in paragraph 1 above, is consistent with principles enshrined in 
international instruments and the relevant rulings of the European Court of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>107. The second and third paragraphs of article 1 of the Anti-Terror Law were repealed in 2006. 
The second paragraph defined the main elements of the term &#8220;terrorist organization&#8221;. The third 
paragraph stipulated that certain terms, such as &#8220;gangs&#8221;, formation and &#8220;group&#8221; used in other 
criminal laws, could also be considered as terrorist organization. 
</p>
<p>108. Article 220 of the new Turkish Criminal Code defines the term &#8220;organization&#8221;, taking into 
account article 2 (a) of the United Nations Conventions against Transnational Organized Crime. 
One of the purposes of the Turkish Criminal Code is to provide harmonization of terminology 
used in the laws that fall within the criminal system. In this respect, the second and third 
paragraphs of article 1 of the Anti-Terror Law relating to the definition of &#8220;terrorist 
organization&#8221; were repealed in order to avoid confusion over this term. 
</p>
<p>109. Article 4 of the Anti-Terror Law, which was amended in 2006, stipulates that certain 
offences in the Turkish Criminal Code constitute terrorist crimes when they are perpetrated 
within the framework of the activities of terrorist organizations. These offences include, 
inter alia, production or trading of narcotics, documentation fraud, money and smuggling. </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 36 
 
</p>
<p>110. It should be underlined that the types of crimes committed by terrorist organizations may 
differ depending on the strategic targets that they select to advance their objectives. For example, 
tourism has often been a selected target of terrorist organizations in Turkey, since it is a large 
sector of the Turkish economy. Therefore, terrorist organizations have plotted terrorist bombings 
in tourist places, kidnapped foreigners and in many instances deliberately started forest fires in 
tourist regions. It is for this reason that &#8220;deliberately starting a forest fire&#8221; has been included in 
the crimes set forth in article 4 of the Anti-Terror Law. 
</p>
<p>111. It should also be pointed out that it has not been possible to formulate a clear-cut and 
comprehensive definition of terrorism in international law, due to the immense variety of the 
motives, forms, conditions, objectives and ideologies that are linked to terrorist movements 
active in the world. Whereas terrorist acts have been set out in various international instruments, 
including the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, to which Turkey is party, 
the Convention only makes a general reference to the term &#8220;terrorism&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>112. Amendments made to articles 6 and 7 of the Anti-Terror Law have been referred to the 
Constitutional Court by the President. The review by the Constitutional Court is ongoing. 
</p>
<p>113. Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law, entitled &#8220;financing of terrorism&#8221;, has been formulated in 
accordance with Turkey&#8217;s international obligations, particularly arising from the international 
Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism, to which Turkey is party. 
</p>
<p>114. The recent amendments made to article 10 of the Anti-Terror Law allow for certain 
restrictions on defence rights, which are all exceptional in nature and must be authorized by the 
decision of a judge. Such decisions are subject to appeal. 
</p><p>115. Paragraph 1 (b) of article 10 states that &#8220;a detainee&#8217;s right to access to defence counsel may 
be delayed by 24 hours by the decision of the judge upon the request of the Public Prosecutor, 
however, during this period a statement cannot be taken&#8221;. The purpose of this provision is to 
prevent the detainee from assisting other perpetrators of a terrorist crime as well as to ensure that 
the evidence of the crime is not destroyed by the terrorist organization. 
</p>
<p>116. Counter-terrorism investigations require different methods than that of ordinary crimes due 
to the necessity to respond to the complex nature of terrorist tactics in a commensurate way. In 
general, the first 24 hours following the apprehension of a terror suspect are very important for 
the investigation. Any evidence or information obtained on the suspect or from the surrounding 
environment contributes significantly to the investigation and assists in finding other 
perpetrators, preventing other terrorist offences as well as seizing materials that will be used in 
other crimes. Furthermore, various terrorist organizations have developed a so-called &#8220;alarm 
system&#8221;, which triggers an alert process aimed at eliminating the evidence, organizational 
information and documentation when any member is apprehended. 
</p>
<p>117. In this respect, the restriction provided in article 10 (b) of the Anti-Terror Law is a 
precautionary measure against terrorist acts deemed necessary under exceptional circumstances 
and on the basis of concrete evidence that needs to be found justifiable by the judge. Judicial 
scrutiny is a safeguard against arbitrary practices. Another safeguard in the provision is making a 
statement only in the presence of a lawyer, and the ban on taking a statement from the suspect 
during the restricted period. The suspect will give a statement only in the presence of a lawyer, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 37 
 
</p>
<p>as is the case with other suspects. Medical examination of the suspect will be conducted after his 
apprehension, before detention and at the end of the detention period. If the suspect does not 
have the financial means to afford a lawyer&#8217;s fee, it will be borne by the State. Therefore, 
article 10 (b) does not prevent suspects from exercising their defence rights or benefiting from 
the safeguards provided for suspects. 
</p>
<p>118. The new article 10 (e) of the Anti-Terror Law sets a general rule that documents, files and 
papers of the defence counsel cannot be examined during the investigation. However, the same 
article provides for an exception to this rule, limited to cases in which there is evidence to 
support the contention that the defence counsel acts as a liaison between the members of a 
terrorist organization for organizational purposes. In this case, the judge may order that an 
official be present during the meetings and that the documents exchanged between the suspect 
and the defence counsel be examined by the judge. However, such decisions by the judge are 
subject to appeal. The purpose of this provision is to prevent terror suspects from communicating 
with other members of the terrorist organization after they are apprehended. 
</p>
<p>119. Article 10 (b) of the Anti-Terror Law states that a terror suspect can appoint only one 
defence counsel during the detention period. During the investigation of ordinary offences, three 
lawyers are allowed to be present in statement-taking. However, due to the complex nature of 
terrorist crimes and heavy workload which needs to be done expeditiously during the detention 
period, as well as to prevent any abuse of rights by terrorist organization (which has been 
experienced on a large scale), the number of defence lawyers to be appointed during the 
detention period has been reduced to one, with a recent amendment introduced to article 10 (b) 
of the Anti-Terror Law. 
</p>
<p>120. The authority of defence lawyers to examine case files has been provided in article 153 of 
the Criminal Procedure Code. According to this article, defence lawyers may access case files 
and obtain copies of documents free of charge during the investigation. However, article 10 (d) 
establishes an exception to this rule, which has a very limited application. It stipulates that in 
cases in which examining or obtaining a copy of a document from the investigation file by a 
defence lawyer poses a serious risk to the purposes of the investigation, the authority to gain 
access to such documents may be restricted by a court upon the request of the Public Prosecutor. 
After the indictment is accepted by the court, defence lawyers may examine any document in the 
case file or any evidence under protection, without being subject to any restriction. 
</p><p>121. Furthermore, circular No. 24 issued by the Ministry of Justice addressed to all Chief Public 
Prosecutors states that, taking into consideration that the main purpose of the criminal procedure 
law is to establish the concrete facts in a manner respectful of human rights. The right to defence 
has been safeguarded in the section on fundamental rights and duties of the Constitution of 
Turkey, which is also protected in the European Convention on Human Rights within the 
framework of the right to trial. The procedures and legal provisions concerning the authority of 
defence lawyers to have access to suspects, to be present during the interrogation, to render them 
legal assistance, to examine case files and to obtain copies of any document from there free of 
charge should be fully respected and implemented. In view of the above, no shortcoming exists 
in terms of the legislative framework on access to case files by defence lawyers. So far, no 
problem has been encountered in practice relating to these provisions. </p>

</p>
<p>122. By letter of 31 May 2007, the Government replied to the communication sent by the 
Special Rapporteur on 22 December 2006 as follow-up to his mission to Turkey conducted in 
February 2006, which related to the Law on Compensation for Damages that Occurred due to 
Terror and Counter-terrorism (&#8220;Compensation Law&#8221;). The Government reported that the 
Compensation Law has recently been amended by Law No. 5666, which entered into force upon 
its promulgation in Official Gazette No. 26537, dated 30 May 2007. According to the 
amendment, the deadline for submission of compensation claims to the Damage Assessment 
Commissions envisaged by the Compensation Law has been extended for a period of one year 
starting from the date on which Law No. 5666 entered into force. Therefore, the deadline for 
compensation claims has been extended until 30 May 2008. 
</p>
<p>123. The unofficial translation of Law No. 5666 (date of adoption: 24 May 2007) reads as 
follows: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Article 1 - The following provisional article has been added to the Law on 
Compensation for Damages that Occurred due to Terror and Counter-terrorism No. 5233 
and dated 17/7/2004. &#8216;Provisional article 4: The provisions of this Law also apply to 
pecuniary damages of real persons and legal entities of private law, that have sustained 
damages due to any act that falls within the scope of articles 1, 3 and 4 of the Anti-Terror 
Law No. 3713, committed between 19/7/1987 and the date on which this Law enters into 
force or that have sustained damages due to measures taken within the framework of 
counter-terrorism within the aforementioned dates, provided that they submit an 
application to the relevant offices of governors or county governors within one year 
following the date of entry into force of this Law. Applications submitted in accordance 
with this article, shall be concluded within two years from the date of application. In the 
case that this time limit also elapses and the claims are not concluded, the Council of 
Ministers may extend the time for a period not exceeding one year each time.&#8217; 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Article 2 - This Law enters into force on the day of its promulgation.  
</p>
<p>&#8220;Article 3 - The provisions of this Law are enforced by the Council of Ministers.&#8221; 
</p>

<p><b>Statement of the Special Rapporteur on his mission to the United States 
</b></p>
<p>124. On 25 May 2007, the Special Rapporteur highlighted some, but not all, of his preliminary 
findings on his mission to the United States of America during a press conference held in 
Washington D.C. (see report of the Special Rapporteur on his mission to the United States 
of America, A/HRC/6/17/Add.3): 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur conducted a 10-day visit to the United States, at the 
invitation of the Government, from 16 to 25 May 2007. The purpose of the mission was to 
undertake a fact-finding exercise, and a legal assessment of United States law and practice 
in the fight against terrorism, measured against international law. His conduct of country </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 39 
 
</p>
<p>visits, including that in the United States, is also aimed at identifying and disseminating 
best practice in the countering of terrorism. Following this visit, a more thorough report, 
which will become publicly available, will be prepared and submitted to the Human Rights 
Council, a subsidiary body of the United Nations General Assembly. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;In Washington D.C., the Special Rapporteur had meaningful meetings on a 
specialist level with the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, 
Department of Defence, and Department of Justice. He also met with members of 
Congress and their staff, academics and non-governmental organizations. Mr Scheinin 
travelled to Miami to observe a day of the trial against Jose Padilla and others. It was 
disappointing that the Special Rapporteur was not provided with access to places of 
detention, including at Guant&#225;namo Bay, with guarantees permitting private interviews of 
detainees. It is a part of the Standard Terms of Reference for all United Nations Special 
Rapporteurs that any visits to detention centres involve unmonitored interviews with 
detained persons. This is a universally applied term of reference which in many parts of the 
world is essential for protecting individuals against abuse. It would give a wrong message 
to the world if the Special Rapporteur were to deviate from this standard condition in 
respect of the United States. The Special Rapporteur therefore hopes that he can soon visit 
the United States again for the purpose of visiting places of detention, including 
Guant&#225;namo Bay, prior to the consideration by the United Nations Human Rights Council 
of his report on this country visit. That visit should also include observing military 
commission hearings at Guant&#225;namo Bay. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur is deeply mindful of the tragic events of 
September 11, 2001, as well as preceding acts of international terrorism against the 
United States, including the bombing of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He is also 
mindful of domestic acts of terrorism, including the Oklahoma City bombing. Addressing 
the situation of victims of terrorism with appropriate compensation and access to health 
care and rehabilitation is an important aspect of a comprehensive strategy against 
terrorism, and should be seen as a matter of best practice. The Special Rapporteur notes 
with encouragement the establishment by the United States Government of a process by 
which the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11 have been able to seek 
compensation. In a world community which has adopted global measures to counter 
terrorism, the United States is a leader. This position carries with it a special responsibility 
also to take leadership in the protection of human rights while countering terrorism. The 
example of the United States will have its followers, in good and in bad. The Special 
Rapporteur has a deep respect for the long traditions in the United States of respect for 
individual rights, the rule of law, and a strong level of judicial protection. 
 &#8220;Despite the existence of a tradition in the United States of respect for the rule of 
law, and the presence of self-correcting mechanisms under the United States Constitution, 
it is most regretful that a number of important mechanisms for the protection of rights have 
been removed or obfuscated under law and practice since the events of September 11, 
including under the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, 
Military Commissions Act of 2006, and under Executive Orders and classified 
programmes. The Special Rapporteur thus sees his visit as one step in the process of </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 40 
 
</p>
<p>restoring the role of the United States as a positive example for respecting human rights, 
including in the context of the fight against terrorism. He dismisses the perception that the 
United States has become an enemy of human rights. It is a country which still has a great 
deal to be proud of. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The framework of public international law: the Special Rapporteur does not 
consider the international fight against terrorism as a &#8216;war&#8217;, at least not in other than 
rhetorical terms. During high-level meetings with government officials, it has been 
repeated that the United States sees itself as being engaged in an armed conflict with 
Al Qaeda and the Taliban, commencing prior to the events of September 11 and continuing 
today; until the capabilities of Al Qaeda can be so degraded that their conduct can be dealt 
with through regular law enforcement mechanisms. The United States consequently 
identifies humanitarian law as the applicable international law to the apprehension, 
detention and trial of persons detained at Guant&#225;namo Bay. The Special Rapporteur 
reminds the United States of the well-established principle that, even during an armed 
conflict triggering the application of international humanitarian law, international human 
rights law continues to apply. This is a point made clear, for example, by the Human 
Rights Committee in its general comment 29, and has been confirmed by the International 
Court of Justice. The conduct of the United States must therefore comply not only with the 
Geneva Conventions, but also with applicable international human rights law. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The same bodies, the Human Rights Committee and the International Court of 
Justice, have also confirmed that human rights, including those enshrined in the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), are also legally binding 
upon a State when it acts outside its internationally recognized territory. The fact that the 
United States more than 50 years ago, when the ICCPR was being drafted, expressed that it 
could not be expected to &#8216;legislate&#8217; for occupied countries, cannot constitute a valid 
justification to engage extraterritorially in outright human rights violations such as 
arbitrary detention, torture, or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur accepts that the United States was engaged in an 
international armed conflict from the commencement of <i>Operation Enduring Freedom</i>, 
proclaimed as an exercise of self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter of the 
United Nations, and until the fall of the Taliban regime as the de facto government of 
Afghanistan. He further accepts in principle that an international terrorist organization, 
if organized hierarchically as an armed force within the meaning of Common article 3 
of the Geneva Conventions, could be engaged in a transborder, albeit technically 
non-international (as not between two States), armed conflict. However, this does not mean 
that any act of terrorism, or of international terrorism, would constitute an armed conflict. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur is aware of the reservations and declarations entered by 
the United States upon its ratification of the ICCPR and the Convention against Torture 
(CAT). Under international law, reservations that are contrary to the object and purpose of 
a treaty are impermissible. The relevant treaty bodies, the Human Rights Committee and 
the Committee against Torture, have requested that the United States withdraw its </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 41 
 
</p>
<p>reservations and declarations relevant to this context. In light of this, the Special 
Rapporteur sees his mandate as requiring him to address the law and practice of the 
United States with reference to international treaty standards, without making an 
assessment of whether its reservations and declarations are permissible. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Guant&#225;namo Bay detainees: the persons detained at the United States military 
facility at Guant&#225;namo Bay have been categorized by the United States as alien unlawful 
enemy combatants. It must be made clear that this is a description of convenience only 
without legal effect, since there is no such third category of persons under international 
law. Those that participate in hostilities are either &#8216;combatants&#8217; or &#8216;civilians&#8217; who have 
participated in hostilities and are thus subject to detention and prosecution. Although 
combatants who are apprehended during the course of an international armed conflict and 
detained as prisoners of war will be released at the end of hostilities, this will not be the 
case for persons who are held as persons suspected of war crimes. The international 
community has recognized the need to ensure that there is no impunity for those that 
commit war crimes. While acknowledging this principle, it should also be recognized that 
the chance of ensuring a fair trial diminishes over time.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;In the case of those who have been captured during armed hostilities in an 
international or non-international armed conflict, but in respect of which there is no 
allegation of offending against the laws of war, such individuals should be released, or 
tried by civilian courts for their suspected other crimes. The Special Rapporteur considers 
that the detention of this group of persons for a period of several years without charge 
undermines the right of fair trial, and that the United States has thereby placed itself in a 
position of having to release many of these persons without charge.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;There are serious concerns about the ability of detainees at Guant&#225;namo Bay to seek 
a judicial determination of their status, and of their continuing detention. Upon the arrival 
of a detainee at Guant&#225;namo Bay, a Combatant Status Review Tribunal is convened to 
determine whether the detainee is an &#8216;unlawful enemy combatant&#8217; and whether that person 
should continue to be detained. This occurs once only, unless new evidence about the 
person&#8217;s status becomes available. Added to this, an Administrative Review Board 
undertakes annual reviews of each detainee&#8217;s status to confirm whether continued 
detention is required. As confirmed by the Department of Defence, these are administrative 
processes, rather than judicial ones. Detainees are not provided with a lawyer during the 
course of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal hearing. Even more problematic is the 
fact that decisions of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal and Administrative Review 
Board are subject to limited judicial reviews only, meaning that any reference to ordinary 
courts is limited to the procedure. The most that a reviewing court may do is to order 
reconsideration of a decision, not release. These restrictions result in non-compliance with 
the ICCPR which prohibits arbitrary detention (article 9 (1)), requires court review of any 
form of detention and entailing a possibility of release (article 9 (4)), and provides a right 
to a fair trial within reasonable time for anyone held as a criminal suspect (article 9 (3) and 
article 14 (3)). Article 9 (4) is also relevant to the removal of habeas corpus rights under 
section 7 of the Military Commissions Act 2006, which purports to expressly deny the 
jurisdiction of ordinary courts to hear an application for habeas corpus.<b> </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 42 
 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Closure of Guant&#225;namo Bay: the Special Rapporteur is encouraged by the 
announcement of the President of the United States that he wishes to move towards the 
closure of Guant&#225;namo Bay, and urges continued and determined action to that end. The 
Special Rapporteur has been advised that between 40 and 80 Guant&#225;namo Bay detainees 
are expected to be tried by military commissions, and that the United States wishes to 
return the balance of detainees to their countries of origin or, where necessary, to a 
surrogate country, and that it is conducting negotiations with countries for this purpose. He 
supports initiatives to return detainees to their countries of origin, but also concludes that 
although the United States has advised that it will not do so in breach of the principle of 
non-refoulement, the current United States standard applied under this principle fails to 
comply with international law. While international law (primarily ICCPR article 7) 
requires that a person not be returned to a country where there is a risk of torture, or any 
form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the United States applies a lower threshold 
of non-return where it is &#8216;more likely than not&#8217; that a person will be subject to torture as 
narrowly defined by the United States itself. Despite the fact that the United States has not 
yet abolished the death penalty, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the principle of 
non-refoulement is also applicable where a person is liable to the imposition of the death 
penalty in a jurisdiction where the standards of trial fall short of rigorous compliance with 
article 14 of the ICCPR on the right to a fair trial.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the United States has the primary 
responsibility to resettle any individuals among those detained in Guant&#225;namo Bay who 
are in need of international protection. He further recommends that other States be willing 
to receive persons currently detained at Guant&#225;namo Bay. The United States and the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) should work together to 
establish a joint process by which detainees can be resettled in accordance with 
international law, including refugee law and the principle of non-refoulement. In 
particular, the Special Rapporteur urges the United States to invite the UNHCR to 
conduct confidential individual interviews with the detainees in order to determine their 
qualification as refugees and to recommend to other countries their resettlement. He also 
urges the United States not to require from receiving countries the detention or monitoring 
of those returned in cases where such measures would not have basis in international and 
domestic law. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Detainees in Afghanistan and Iraq: the Special Rapporteur is mindful of the fact 
that there are in Afghanistan some 700 and in Iraq around 18,000 persons detained by the 
United States. Some of these detainees appear to be held for reasons related to the fight 
against terrorism, under a legal status analogous to that at Guant&#225;namo Bay. He reminds 
the United States and other States responsible for the detention of persons in Afghanistan 
and Iraq that these detainees also have a right to a fair trial within a reasonable time if 
suspected of a crime or, failing this, to release.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The use of military commissions to try terrorist suspects: by Military Order in 2001, 
the President of the United States established military commissions for the purpose of 
trying enemy combatants. The United States Supreme Court ruled in 2006, in <i>Hamdan v. 
Rumsfeld</i>, that military commissions established under the Military Order were 
unconstitutional, since they were not established under the express authority of Congress, 
and that the structure and procedures of the commissions violated both the United States </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 43 
 
</p>
<p>Uniform Code of Military Justice and the four Geneva Conventions. Congress 
subsequently enacted the Military Commissions Act 2006, which largely reflects the 
military commission structure under the 2001 Order. The establishment of military 
commissions is not restricted geographically, permitting any non-United States citizen, 
including those holding permanent resident status, to be subject to trial by military 
commission if designated as an enemy combatant. Various aspects relating to the 
jurisdiction and operation of military commissions raise significant human rights concerns, 
including the jurisdiction and composition of military commissions, the potential use of 
evidence obtained by coercion, and the potential for the imposition of the death penalty.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;One of the principal reasons given by the Government for the establishment of 
military commissions, rather than the use of courts martial or ordinary courts, has been that 
those courts do not have jurisdiction over certain crimes which some detainees are 
suspected to have committed. Three matters of concern are raised by this position. First, 
the Military Commissions Act of 2006 purports to be a piece of legislation which codifies 
the laws of war and establishes the jurisdiction of military commissions over war crimes. 
However, the offences listed in section 950v (24)-(28) of the Act (terrorism, providing 
material support for terrorism, wrongfully aiding the enemy, spying, and conspiracy) go 
beyond offences under the laws of war. The establishment of these offences, and the way 
in which they are described, therefore means that the military commissions have been 
given jurisdiction over offences which do not in fact form part of the laws of war and thus 
may result in civilians being tried by military tribunals, in breach of the established 
interpretation of ICCPR article 14. The second problem, concerning these same offences, 
is that to the extent they were not covered by the law applicable at the time of the 
commission of the actual acts, the military commissions will be applying criminal law 
retroactively, in breach of ICCPR article 15 and universally acknowledged general 
principles of law. Finally, it appears that the Government&#8217;s justification for military 
commissions is incorrect as a matter of fact because ordinary courts martial have had the 
jurisdiction to try violations of the laws of armed conflict since 1916 under the Uniform 
Code of Military Justice, and that the nexus between the events of September 11 and 
United States citizens would allow ordinary courts to try other offences such as conspiracy 
and terrorism. This is borne out by the fact that the 1998 Embassy bombings were 
prosecuted by ordinary courts, and that Osama bin Laden was indicted for his action in the 
attacks on the USS Cole by a Grand Jury in 2000. The ability of ordinary courts to hear 
charges of conspiracy and material support for terrorism is further borne out by the fact 
that those being prosecuted in <i>United States v. Padilla et al.</i> in the United States District 
Court at Miami are charged with such offences. In contrast, a suspected co-conspirator, 
who is an alien and currently detained at Guant&#225;namo Bay, is likely to face these charges 
before a military commission.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;As to the composition of military commissions, the Special Rapporteur has serious 
concerns about the independence and impartiality of the commissions, their potential use to 
try civilians, and the lack of appearance of impartiality. Whereas military judges in courts 
martial are appointed from a panel of judges by lottery, judges in a military commission 
are selected for each trial by the convening authority of military commissions. Although 
the current convening authority is a civilian and former judge, she is employed by the 
Department of Defence so that the appearance of impartial selection of military judges and 
members of individual commissions is undermined. Furthermore, there is no prohibition </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 44 
 
</p>
<p>against the selection of members of a commission who fall within the same chain of 
command so that more junior members of a military commission, despite any advice to the 
contrary, may be directly or indirectly influenced in their consideration of the facts. The 
ability of the convening authority to intervene in the conduct of trials before a military 
commission is also troubling. The plea agreement in the trial of David Hicks, for example, 
was negotiated between the convening authority and counsel for David Hicks, without any 
reference to the prosecuting trial counsel. The involvement of the executive in such matters 
is troubling.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, although evidence which has been 
obtained by torture is inadmissible, evidence obtained by other forms of coercion may, by 
determination of the military judge, be admitted into evidence. Two problems arise in this 
context. The first is that an accused may not become aware of the fact that evidence has 
been obtained by torture or coercion since the interrogation techniques used to obtain 
evidence subsequently presented at trial may themselves be classified and thereby outside 
the knowledge of the accused. The next problem is that the definition of torture for the 
purpose of proceedings before a military commission is restricted so that it does not catch 
all forms of coercion that amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, 
equally prohibited in non-derogable terms by ICCPR article 7. It is a clear and established 
principle of international law that no evidence obtained by torture or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment may be used for the purpose of trying and punishing a person. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur is furthermore concerned with the ability of a military 
commission to determine charges in respect of which the death penalty may be imposed. It 
is well established that article 6 of the ICCPR requires that, where a State seeks to impose 
the death penalty, it is obliged to ensure that fair trial rights under article 14 of the ICCPR 
are rigorously guaranteed. Given that any appeal rights subsequent to conviction are 
limited to matters of law, coupled with the concerns outlined, at the lack of fair trial 
guarantees in proceedings before military commissions, the Special Rapporteur concludes 
that any imposition of the death penalty as a result of a conviction by a military 
commission is likely to be in violation of article 6.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;Finally, the Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the acquittal of a person by 
a military commission, or the completion of a term of imprisonment following conviction, 
does not result in a right of release. This further undermines the principles of fair trial and 
would, if immediate release was not provided in an individual case, involve an arbitrary 
detention in contravention of article 9 (1) of the ICCPR. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Interrogation of terrorist suspects: as a result of an apparent internal leak from the 
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the media in the United States learnt and published 
information about &#8216;enhanced interrogation techniques&#8217; used by the CIA in its interrogation 
of terrorist suspects and possibly other persons held because of their links with such 
suspects. Various sources have spoken of such techniques involving physical and 
psychological means of coercion, including stress positions, extreme temperature changes, 
sleep deprivation, and &#8216;waterboarding&#8217; (means by which an interrogated person is made to 
feel as if they are drowning). With reference to the well-established practice of bodies 
such as the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture, the Special 
Rapporteur concludes that these techniques involve conduct that amounts to a breach of the </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 45 
 
</p>
<p>non-derogable right to be free from torture and any form of cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment. In a meeting with the Special Rapporteur, the Acting General Counsel for the 
CIA refused to engage in any meaningful interaction aimed at clarifying the means of 
compliance with international standards of methods of interrogation and accountability in 
respect of possible abuses. Despite repeated requests on the part of the Special Rapporteur, 
the CIA did not make themselves available to meet again with him. In light of this lack of 
cooperation and corroborating evidence from multiple sources, the Special Rapporteur can 
only conclude that the conduct of his country visit gives further support to the suspicion 
that the CIA has indeed been involved, and continues to be involved, in the use of 
enhanced interrogation techniques that violate international law. He urges the United States 
to ensure that all its officials and agencies comply with international standards, including 
the ICCPR article 7 and, in the context of an armed conflict, Common article 3 of the 
Geneva Conventions.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur welcomes the revision of the United States Army Field 
Manual in September 2006. Although this Manual clearly states that acts of violence or 
intimidation against detainees is prohibited, and that interrogation techniques must not 
expose a person to inhumane treatment, there are nevertheless aspects of the revised 
Manual (when compared to the earlier version of the Manual) that cause concern. On the 
positive side, the revised Manual explicitly prohibits the use of waterboarding, something 
not expressly prohibited before. Nevertheless, a comparison of the two recent versions of 
the Army Field Manual could leave the impression that it is not prohibited during the 
conduct of an interrogation to slap a person being questioned, subject a person to extreme 
changes in temperature falling short of the medical state of hypothermia, isolate a detainee 
for prolonged periods, make use of stress positions, and subject a person to questioning for 
periods of up to 40 hours without sleep. The Special Rapporteur concludes that the Manual 
should be revised to expressly exclude such techniques. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Rendition, and detention in &#8216;classified locations&#8217;: The Special Rapporteur refers to 
various sources pointing to the rendition by the CIA of terrorist suspects or other persons 
to &#8216;classified locations&#8217; (also known as places of secret detention) and/or to a territory in 
which the detained person may be subjected to indefinite detention and/or interrogation 
techniques that amount to a violation of the prohibition against torture, or cruel, inhuman 
or degrading treatment. These reports suggest that such interrogation techniques may have 
been used either directly by CIA agents or in their presence. The existence of classified 
locations was confirmed by the President of the United States on 6 September 2006 
when he announced the transfer of 14 &#8216;high value detainees&#8217; from these locations to 
Guant&#225;namo Bay. Although the President announced that at that time the CIA no longer 
held any persons in classified locations, he reserved the possibility of resuming this 
program. Since that time, one further high value detainee has been transferred to 
Guant&#225;namo Bay and the whereabouts of many others are unaccounted.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that there is a difference between &#8216;rendition to 
justice&#8217; (whereby a person is outside formal extradition arrangements handed to another 
State for the purpose of standing trial in that State, and so long as there is no risk of the 
person being subjected to torture, or being faced with an unfair trial where the death 
penalty might be imposed), versus &#8216;extraordinary rendition&#8217; to another State for the 
purpose of interrogation or detention without charge. Rendition in the latter circumstances </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 46 
 
</p>
<p>runs the risk of the detained person being made subject to torture, or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment. Furthermore, the removal of a person outside the legally prescribed 
procedures of extradition or deportation amounts to an unlawful detention in violation of 
article 9 (1) of the ICCPR. In addition, the use by the CIA of civil aircraft for the 
transportation of persons subjected to extraordinary rendition, whether by contract or by 
the establishment of airlines controlled by the Agency, is in violation of the Chicago 
Convention on Civil Aviation. Again due to the refusal of the Acting General Counsel for 
the CIA to engage in any meaningful interaction, and in light of corroborating evidence, 
the Special Rapporteur concludes that his visit supports the suspicion that the CIA has been 
involved in the extraordinary rendition of terrorism suspects and possibly other persons. 
This conclusion is corroborated by the recent findings of the Human Rights Committee and 
Committee against Torture in the cases of <i>Agiza v. Sweden</i> and <i>Alzery v. Sweden</i> in which 
Sweden was found to violate its human rights treaty obligations by handing over Mr. Agiza 
and Mr. Alzery to CIA agents in the course of their rendition to Egypt. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Immigration and refugee issues: a number of troubling developments in the law and 
practice of the United States concerns the treatment of immigrants, those applying for 
visas, and those claiming a refugee status. The PATRIOT Act of 2001 amended provisions 
of the Immigration and Nationality Act, expanding the definition of terrorist activity 
beyond the bounds of conduct which is truly terrorist in nature, particularly in respect of 
the provision of &#8216;material support to terrorist organizations&#8217;. The definition captures, for 
example, the provision by a person of a ransom to have a family member released by a 
terrorist organization or providing funds to a charity organization that was not then 
classified as a terrorist organization. The PATRIOT Act provides for the mandatory 
detention of those suspected of such conduct and a refusal of refugee status for such 
persons, albeit that the Secretary of Homeland Security has announced a policy of &#8216;duress 
waiver&#8217;. The Special Rapporteur is troubled by the lack of transparency and judicial 
remedies in the application of such a waiver to persons some of whom may effectively be 
victims of terrorist conduct. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Furthermore, the REAL ID Act of 2005, an enactment which ostensibly works to 
prevent the use of false identification and eliminate identity theft, contains provisions 
concerning the prevention of &#8216;terrorists&#8217; from obtaining relief from removal. The Act raises 
the threshold concerning the credibility of asylum claims, and limits appeal rights for 
asylum-seekers, which is inconsistent with the general principle of providing a claimant 
with the benefit of the doubt as espoused by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees and applied by many national jurisdictions in asylum cases.  
 &#8220;Profiling and community outreach: the Special Rapporteur notes with 
encouragement and as an element of best practice that the Secretary of Homeland Security 
has openly stated that the application of law and practice by his department is not to 
involve racial or religious profiling. The Special Rapporteur nevertheless notes claims that 
country of origin has been, or may be, used as a proxy for such profiling. It is a significant 
problem in certain regions of the world that the religious status of persons is wrongly 
confused with the identification of such persons as potential terrorists. This is a troubling 
pattern that must be reversed, and the Special Rapporteur recommends that all States, 
including the United States, ensure that they do not act in a manner which might be seen as 
advocating this development.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
  page 47 
 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The Special Rapporteur is very much encouraged by the initiation of community 
outreach programmes by various governmental agencies including the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS). Both on its own initiative, and in conjunction with civil 
society, the DHS has initiated a number of programmes aimed both at creating a 
constructive dialogue with communities, including Muslims, and at explaining Islamic 
faith and practice to members of the public and state employees. The alienation of sections 
of society, and the treatment of groups in violation of their human rights, has been 
recognized by the international community as constituting conditions conducive to the 
emergence of terrorism, or recruitment into terrorist organizations. The Special Rapporteur 
therefore identifies the efforts to reach out to the community as a best practice in the fight 
against terrorism. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Surveillance measures: the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution 
guarantees the right of United States citizens to privacy, albeit that international human 
rights law accommodates interference with privacy where necessary for legitimate 
purposes and implemented in a proportionate manner. The United States Supreme Court 
has held, in the 1972 decision <i>United States v. United States District Court</i>, that the Fourth 
Amendment prohibits the surveillance without a warrant of United States persons, even 
where this is carried out for national security reasons. Under United States law, the 
surveillance of United States persons (citizens or permanent residents of the United States) 
can only occur when authorized by the Wiretap Act of 1968, or the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA). The PATRIOT Act of 2001 expanded the provisions of 
FISA so that applications for a surveillance warrant need only establish that foreign 
intelligence gathering is a significant purpose of the proposed surveillance rather than &#8216;the 
purpose&#8217; of surveillance, as previously required under FISA. This regime raises a number 
of concerns. First is the low threshold in the availability of surveillance warrants, which 
leaves open the possibility for interference with privacy where this is not necessary for 
legitimate purposes. Next is the fact that the Attorney General&#8217;s guidelines on the 
availability of surveillance warrants for the investigation of terrorist and related offences, 
or the gathering of related intelligence, is classified. Although the Special Rapporteur has 
been advised by the Department of Justice that these guidelines comply with international 
human rights law, there is no way of assessing the accuracy of this position, nor is there 
any transparency to guarantee compliance with the dual requirements of article 17 of the 
ICCPR to not interfere with privacy and to protect against the arbitrary interference with 
privacy. It is also relevant that the ICCPR obliges States parties to comply with these 
requirements not only in respect of citizens and permanent residents, but also in respect of 
all persons within the jurisdiction of the State. It is furthermore troubling that the use of 
FISA warrants, which have traditionally been treated as an exception to surveillance 
conducted under the Wiretap Act of 1968, has increased substantially since September 11. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Operating outside the scope of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was a 
National Security Agency (NSA) program of secret surveillance without warrant, 
authorized by an Executive Order of the President. The existence of this program 
apparently came to light as a result of an internal leak. Whereas it is a crime under 
United States law to undertake surveillance without a court order, the NSA surveillance 
program was said to be authorized under an inherent right of the President to authorize 
warrantless surveillance under article II of the United States Constitution. Whether or not 
that is the case, the use of surveillance techniques without a warrant amounts to an </p>

<p>A/HRC/6/17/Add.1 
page 48 
 
</p>
<p>interference with privacy that is not authorized by a prescription by law. The Special 
Rapporteur therefore concludes that such surveillance is unlawful within the terms of 
article 17 of the ICCPR. Following media reports in 2005 exposing the existence of the 
NSA program, the United States President acknowledged the existence of the program and 
stated that NSA surveillance would in the future be carried out under FISA.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;A further development impacting upon privacy rights has been the expanded use of 
National Security Letters, a form of administrative subpoena facilitating expedited access 
to records by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other intelligence agencies. Prior to 
the PATRIOT Act of 2001, the availability of National Security Letters was restricted to 
financial records, customer call records, and consumer reports, with the requirement that a 
certifying officer was satisfied that the subject of investigation was acting on behalf of a 
foreign power. The Act broadened the type of records accessible under National Security 
Letters and extended the authority to counter-terrorism investigations. The Special 
Rapporteur is concerned with the lack of checks and balances in this authority, a matter 
that fails to properly ensure that there is no arbitrary interference with privacy. 
</p>
<p> &#8220;Freedom of the press: the Special Rapporteur takes the view that although the 
criminalization of incitement to terrorism and other serious crime may fall within the scope 
of lawful restrictions upon freedom of expression as guaranteed by ICCPR article 19, 
States should be careful not to use vague terms such as &#8216;glorifying&#8217; or &#8216;promoting&#8217; 
terrorism when restricting expression.  
</p>
<p> &#8220;The exercise of freedom of expression is a cornerstone of democratic society, and in 
ensuring accountable governance. It is evident that the freedom of the press, and its ability 
to bring executive action to light, has been a significant factor in the raising of public 
awareness and debate on issues central to the promotion and protection of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms within the United States. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged, 
in that regard, by the fact that the Government of the United States has not acted to restrain 
media interest or publication. The free media of the United States itself has in the years 
following September 11 operated as a device for ensuring transparency and accountability 
in respect of the adverse consequences upon human rights of counter-terrorism measures 
undertaken by the Government. This is a feature of best practice which all countries should 
aspire to.&#8221;
