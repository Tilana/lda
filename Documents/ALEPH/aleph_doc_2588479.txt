Dear SilverCrest Shareholder:August 24, 2015
The Board of Directors invites you to attend the special meeting (the “SilverCrest Meeting”) of shareholders (“SilverCrest
Shareholders”) of SilverCrest Mines Inc. (“SilverCrest”) to be held at 10:00 a.m. (Vancouver time) on Friday,
September 25, 2015 at the Metropolitan Hotel Vancouver, 645 Howe Street, Vancouver, British Columbia.
At the SilverCrest Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon, among other things, a resolution approving the
plan of arrangement (the “Arrangement”) contemplated by the arrangement agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”)
dated July 26, 2015 among SilverCrest, First Majestic Silver Corp. (“First Majestic”) and SilverCrest Metals Inc. (“New
SilverCrest”) pursuant to which First Majestic will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of SilverCrest and in
return SilverCrest Shareholders will receive, in respect of each common share of SilverCrest (a “SilverCrest Share”) held,
0.2769 of a common share of First Majestic (a “First Majestic Share”) and C$0.0001 in cash (the “Consideration”).
SilverCrest Shareholders will also receive 0.1667 of a common share of New SilverCrest (a “New SilverCrest Share”), a
company newly incorporated by SilverCrest for purposes of the Arrangement. Each unexercised SilverCrest stock option
will be exchanged for a New SilverCrest stock option and a First Majestic replacement option based on the same exchange
ratios.
The Consideration implies a value of C$1.30 per SilverCrest Share based on the closing price of the First Majestic Shares
on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) on July 24, 2015, the last trading day prior to announcement of the Arrangement
Agreement. The Consideration represents a premium of approximately 37% to the 30-day volume-weighted average price
of the SilverCrest Shares on the TSX for the period ending July 24, 2015 and a premium of approximately 35% to the
closing price of the SilverCrest Shares on the TSX on such date.
New SilverCrest will be an exploration company which will have the benefit of current SilverCrest management’s
exploration expertise. As part of the Arrangement, SilverCrest will transfer to New SilverCrest its Cruz de Mayo, Las
Chispas, Angel de Plata, Huasabas and Estacion Llano exploration properties located in northern Mexico, as well as
C$5,250,000 in cash and certain other assets currently owned by SilverCrest. First Majestic will transfer its Guadalupe
exploration property located in Durango, Mexico to New SilverCrest, and will own approximately 9.9% of the New
SilverCrest Shares following completion of the Arrangement. N. Eric Fier, SilverCrest’s Chief Operating Officer, will be the
CEO and President of New SilverCrest along with other members of SilverCrest’s current board and management team.
New SilverCrest has applied to list the New SilverCrest Shares on the TSX Venture Exchange.
On completion of the Arrangement, former SilverCrest Shareholders are expected to hold approximately 21.2% of the
outstanding First Majestic Shares and approximately 90.1% of the outstanding New SilverCrest Shares.
To be effective, the Arrangement must be approved by a resolution (the “Arrangement Resolution”) passed by (i) at least
two-thirds of the votes cast on such resolution by SilverCrest Shareholders at the SilverCrest Meeting, and (ii) at least a
simple majority of the votes cast on such resolution by SilverCrest Shareholders at the SilverCrest Meeting, excluding the
votes of SilverCrest Shares held or controlled by J. Scott Drever, N. Eric Fier and Barney Magnusson, each of whom is an
“interested party” under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 — Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions.
The Arrangement is also subject to certain conditions and the approval of the Supreme Court of British Columbia as well as
certain regulatory approvals. Subject to receiving such approvals and satisfying all other conditions of closing, it is
anticipated that the Arrangement will be completed in early October 2015.
The accompanying Notices of Special Meetings and Joint Information Circular of SilverCrest and First Majestic (the
“Circular”) provide a full description of the Arrangement and include certain additional information to assist you in
considering how to vote on the Arrangement. You are encouraged to consider carefully all of the information in the Circular
including the documents incorporated by reference therein.
Vote your shares today FOR the Arrangement Resolution. Your vote is important regardless of the number of
SilverCrest Shares you own. If you are a registered holder of SilverCrest Shares, we encourage you to take the time now
to complete, sign, date and return the enclosed form of proxy by not later than 10:00 a.m. (Vancouver time) on
September 23, 2015 (or 48 hours prior to the time of any adjournment or postponement of the SilverCrest Meeting), to
ensure that your SilverCrest Shares will be voted at the SilverCrest Meeting in accordance with your instructions, whether or
not you are able to attend in person. If you hold your SilverCrest Shares through a broker or other intermediary, you should
follow the instructions provided by your broker or other intermediary to vote your SilverCrest Shares.
All directors and certain officers of SilverCrest have entered into a lock-up agreement with First Majestic pursuant to which
they have agreed, subject to the terms of that agreement, to vote for the Arrangement Resolution. As of the date of the lock-
up agreement, these directors and officers held, in aggregate, 4,658,530 SilverCrest Shares which represented 3.9% of the
then issued and outstanding SilverCrest Shares.
The Board of Directors of SilverCrest (the “SilverCrest Board”) has unanimously determined that the Consideration
is fair to SilverCrest Shareholders and the SilverCrest Optionholders and that the Arrangement is in the best
interests of SilverCrest. Further, the SilverCrest Board has unanimously approved the Arrangement Agreement
and unanimously recommends that SilverCrest Shareholders vote FOR the Arrangement Resolution. The
recommendation of the SilverCrest Board is based on various factors, as more particularly set out in the Circular,
including the fairness opinion of National Bank Financial Inc., to the effect that the Consideration is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the SilverCrest Shareholders.

Forward-Looking Statements
This Circular includes certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the United States Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and “forward-looking information” under applicable Canadian securities laws. When used in
this Circular, the words “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, “expect”, “target”, “plan”, “forecast”, “may”, “schedule” and similar
words or expressions, identify forward-looking statements or information. These forward-looking statements or information
relate to, among other things: anticipated benefits of the Arrangement to First Majestic, SilverCrest and their respective
shareholders; the timing and receipt of required shareholder, court, stock exchange, creditor and regulatory approvals for
the Arrangement; the ability of First Majestic and SilverCrest to satisfy the other conditions to, and to complete, the
Arrangement; the closing of the Arrangement; the listing of the New SilverCrest Shares on the TSX-V; the integration of First
Majestic and SilverCrest; pro forma financial information; the tax consequences of holding and disposing SilverCrest
Shares, First Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares; the completion of a post-closing reorganization of First Majestic
and SilverCrest; the development of the Santa Elena Mine; future silver production; analyst coverage, liquidity and
institutional shareholdings of First Majestic Shares; future growth potential for First Majestic, SilverCrest and their respective
businesses; future plans for the La Joya property; future mine development plans; estimates regarding mineral reserves and
resources of First Majestic and SilverCrest; estimates regarding the life of and recovery of minerals at the Santa Elena mine;
and estimates of production costs.
In respect of the forward-looking statements and information concerning the anticipated completion of the Arrangement and
the anticipated timing for completion of the Arrangement, the parties have provided them in reliance on certain assumptions
that they believe are reasonable at this time, including the ability of the parties to receive, in a timely manner, the necessary
shareholder, court, stock exchange, creditor and regulatory approvals; and the ability of the parties to satisfy, in a timely
manner, the other conditions to the closing of the Arrangement. These dates may change for a number of reasons, including
inability to secure necessary shareholder, court, stock exchange, creditor and regulatory approvals in the time assumed or
the need for additional time to satisfy the other conditions to the completion of the Arrangement. Accordingly, readers should
not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements and information contained in this Circular, including the
information incorporated by reference, concerning these times.

Forward-looking information relating to future silver production, analyst coverage, liquidity and institutional shareholdings of
First Majestic Shares, future growth potential for First Majestic, SilverCrest and their respective businesses, future mine
development plans, estimates regarding the life of and recovery of minerals at the Santa Elena mine, and estimates of
production costs is based on management of the applicable parties’ reasonable assumptions, estimates, expectations,
analyses and opinions, which are based on such management’s experience and perception of trends, current conditions
and expected developments, and other factors that management believes are relevant and reasonable in the
circumstances, but which may prove to be incorrect. Assumptions have been made regarding, among other things, the price
of silver, gold, and other metals; costs of development and production; estimated production rates for silver and other metals
produced by the parties; the estimated costs of development of development projects; First Majestic’s and/or SilverCrest’s
ability to operate in a safe and effective manner and their ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms.
These statements reflect the parties’ respective current views with respect to future events and are necessarily based upon
a number of assumptions and estimates that, while considered reasonable by the respective parties, are inherently subject
to significant business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties and contingencies. Many factors, both
known and unknown, could cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from the results,
performance or achievements that are or may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements or information
and the parties have made assumptions and estimates based on or related to many of these factors. Such factors include,
without limitation: satisfaction or waiver of all applicable conditions to closing of the Arrangement including, without
limitation, receipt of all necessary shareholder, court, stock exchange, creditor and regulatory approvals or consents and
lack of material changes with respect to First Majestic and SilverCrest and their respective businesses, all as more
particularly set forth in the Arrangement Agreement; the synergies expected from the Arrangement not being realized;
business integration risks; fluctuations in general macro-economic conditions; fluctuations in securities markets and the
market price of the First Majestic Shares; fluctuations in the spot and forward price of silver, gold, base metals or certain
other commodities (such as natural gas, fuel oil and electricity); fluctuations in the currency markets (such as the Canadian
dollar and Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar); changes in national and local government, legislation, taxation, controls,
regulations and political or economic developments in Canada or Mexico; operating or technical difficulties in connection
with mining or development activities; risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development
and mining (including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins
and flooding); risks relating to the credit worthiness or financial condition of suppliers, refiners and other parties with whom
the parties do business; inability to obtain adequate insurance to cover risks and hazards; and the presence of laws and
regulations that may impose restrictions on mining, including those currently enacted in Mexico; employee relations;
relationships with and claims by local communities and indigenous populations; availability and increasing costs
associated with mining inputs and labour; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development, including the
risks of obtaining necessary licenses, permits and approvals from government authorities; diminishing quantities or grades
of mineral reserves as properties are mined; title to properties; and the factors identified under the caption “Risk Factors” in
the First Majestic AIF, under the caption “Risk Factors” in the SilverCrest AIF and under “Risk Factors” in this Circular. In
addition, the failure of a party to comply with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement may result in that party being required
to pay a non-completion or other fee to the other party, the result of which could have a material adverse effect on the paying
party’s financial position and results of operations and is ability to fund growth prospects and current operations.
Readers are cautioned against attributing undue certainty to forward-looking statements or information. Although the parties
have attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, there may be other factors that
cause results not to be anticipated, estimated or intended. The parties do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to
update these forward-looking statements or information to reflect changes in assumptions or changes in circumstances or
any other events affecting such statements or information, other than as required by applicable law.

Information for Beneficial Shareholders
The information set out in this section is of significant importance to many Shareholders as a substantial number of
Shareholders do not hold Shares in their own name. This Circular and the accompanying materials are being sent also to
Beneficial SilverCrest Shareholders and Beneficial First Majestic Shareholders (collectively, “Beneficial Shareholders”).
Beneficial Shareholders hold their Shares through a broker, investment dealer or other intermediary (each, an
“Intermediary”).
If you are a Beneficial Shareholder, your Intermediary will send you a voting instruction form (“VIF”) or proxy form with this
Circular. This form will instruct the Intermediary as to how to vote your Shares at the SilverCrest Meeting or First Majestic
Meeting, as applicable, on your behalf. You must follow the instructions from your Intermediary to vote. The majority of
Intermediaries now delegate responsibility for obtaining instructions from Beneficial Shareholders to Broadridge Financial
Solutions Inc. (“Broadridge”). Broadridge typically mails a voting instruction form to Beneficial Shareholders and asks
Beneficial Shareholders to return the VIF to Broadridge (in some cases the completion of the VIF may be by telephone or
the internet). Additionally, there are two kinds of Beneficial Shareholders: (i) those who object to their name being
made known to the issuers of securities which they own, known as objecting beneficial owners or “OBOs”; and
(ii) those who do not object to their name being made known to the issuers of securities which they own, known as
non-objecting beneficial owners or “NOBOs”. SilverCrest and First Majestic may utilize the Broadridge QuickVote™
service to assist Beneficial Shareholders that are NOBOs with voting their Shares. NOBOs may be contacted by
Laurel Hill to conveniently obtain a vote directly over the telephone. Broadridge then tabulates the results of all
instructions received and provides the appropriate instructions respecting the voting of Shares to be represented
at the SilverCrest Meeting and First Majestic Meeting, as applicable.
- 7 -
For greater certainty, Beneficial Shareholders should note that they are not entitled to use a VIF or proxy form
received from Broadridge or their Intermediary to vote Shares directly at the SilverCrest Meeting or the First
Majestic Meeting, as applicable. Instead, the Beneficial Shareholder must complete the VIF or proxy form and return
it as instructed on the form. The Beneficial Shareholder must complete these steps well in advance of the
SilverCrest Meeting or the First Majestic Meeting, as applicable, in order to ensure such Shares are voted.
In the alternative, if you wish to vote in person at the SilverCrest Meeting or the First Majestic Meeting, as applicable, or
have another person attend and vote in person on your behalf, insert your name or such other person’s name in the space
provided for the proxyholder appointment in the VIF or proxy form, and return it as instructed by your Intermediary. Your
Intermediary may have also provided you with the option of appointing yourself or someone else to attend and vote on your
behalf at the SilverCrest Meeting or First Majestic Meeting, as applicable, through the internet. When you arrive at the
SilverCrest Meeting or First Majestic Meeting, as applicable, please register with the scrutineer.
Beneficial Shareholders who have questions or concerns regarding any of these procedures may also contact their
Intermediary. It is recommended that inquiries of this kind be made well in advance of the SilverCrest Meeting and the First
Majestic Meeting. Beneficial SilverCrest Shareholders should also instruct their Intermediary to complete the Letter of
Transmittal with respect to the Beneficial SilverCrest Shareholder’s SilverCrest Shares in order to receive in exchange
pursuant to the Arrangement the applicable Consideration from First Majestic and, concurrently, the applicable number of
New SilverCrest Shares.
Management of SilverCrest and First Majestic, respectively, will pay for Intermediaries to forward this Circular, the proxy
form or a voting instruction form to objecting beneficial owners under National Instrument 54-101 – Communication with
Beneficial Owners of Securities of a Reporting Issuer of the Canadian Securities Administrators.
See “Information Concerning the SilverCrest Meeting” and “Information Concerning the First Majestic Meeting”.
Information for United States Shareholders
The First Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares issuable under the Arrangement have not been and will not be
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any state securities laws, and such securities will be issued in reliance upon the
exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act provided by section 3(a)(10) thereof. Section 3(a)(10)
of the U.S. Securities Act exempts the issuance of securities issued in exchange for one or more bona fide outstanding
securities, or partly in such exchange and partly for cash, from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act where
the terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange have been approved by a court of competent jurisdiction, after a
hearing upon the fairness of the terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange at which all persons to whom the
securities will be issued have the right to appear and receive timely notice thereof. The Court is authorized to conduct a
hearing at which the substantive and procedural fairness of the terms and conditions of the Arrangement will be considered.
The Court issued the Interim Order on August 24, 2015, and, subject to the approval of the Arrangement Resolution by the
SilverCrest Shareholders and the approval of the First Majestic Resolution by the First Majestic Shareholders, a hearing for
a final order approving the Arrangement will be held on September 30, 2015 (or as soon thereafter as legal counsel can be
heard) at the Courthouse, 800 Smithe Street, Vancouver, British Columbia. All SilverCrest Shareholders are entitled to
appear and be heard at this hearing, provided that they satisfy the applicable conditions set forth in the Interim Order. See
“The Arrangement – Court Approval and Completion of the Arrangement”. The Final Order of the Court will, if granted,
constitute the basis for the exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act with respect to the First
Majestic Shares, New SilverCrest Shares, First Majestic Replacement Options and New SilverCrest Options issued in
connection with the Arrangement.
- 8 -
The First Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares to be received by SilverCrest Shareholders upon completion of the
Arrangement may be resold without restriction in the United States, except in respect of resales by persons who are
“affiliates” (within the meaning of Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act”) of First Majestic or New SilverCrest, as
applicable, at the time of such resale or who have been affiliates of First Majestic or New SilverCrest, as applicable, within
90 days before such resale. Further, the First Majestic Shares issuable upon the exercise of the First Majestic Replacement
Options and the New SilverCrest Shares issuable upon exercise of the New SilverCrest Options in the United States after
the Effective Time will not be issued in reliance upon Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act and such options may be
exercised only pursuant to registration under the U.S. Securities Act or an available exemption from the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and pursuant to any applicable state securities laws and, if issued in the United
States pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act, such securities will be
“restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act and will be subject to transfer
restrictions. See “Regulatory Matters – United States Securities Law Matters”.
SilverCrest and First Majestic are “foreign private issuers,” within the meaning of Rule 3b-4 under the U.S. Exchange Act,
and the solicitation of proxies for the SilverCrest Meeting and the First Majestic Meeting are not subject to the requirements
of section 14(a) of the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, this Circular has been prepared in accordance with disclosure
requirements applicable in Canada. SilverCrest Shareholders and First Majestic Shareholders in the United States should
be aware that such requirements are different from those applicable to registration statements under the U.S. Securities Act
and proxy statements under the U.S. Exchange Act. Although the unaudited historical interim financial statements and
audited historical annual financial statements of SilverCrest and First Majestic and other financial information included or
incorporated by reference in this Circular have been prepared in U.S. dollars, such financial statements and other financial
information included or incorporated by reference in this Circular have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, which
differs from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in certain material respects, and thus are not directly comparable
to financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
SilverCrest Shareholders should be aware that the Arrangement described in this Circular may have tax consequences in
both the United States and Canada. Shareholders who are resident in, or citizens of, the United States are advised to
review the summaries contained in this Circular under the headings “Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax
Considerations” and “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” and to consult their own tax advisors to
determine the particular United States tax consequences to them of the Arrangement in light of their particular situation, as
well as any tax consequences that may arise under the laws of any other relevant foreign, state, local, or other taxing
jurisdiction.
Information concerning the properties and operations of SilverCrest and First Majestic has been prepared in accordance
with the requirements of Canadian securities laws, which differ from the requirements of United States securities laws.
Mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates included or incorporated by reference in this Circular have been prepared
in accordance with NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum definitions and classification
system. NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators which establishes standards for all public
disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. Canadian standards,
including NI 43-101, differ significantly from the requirements of the SEC, and mineral reserve and mineral resource
information contained or incorporated by reference in this Circular may not be comparable to similar information disclosed
by United States companies. In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the term “resource” does not
equate to the term “reserve”. Under United States standards, mineralization may not be classified as a “reserve” unless the
determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time
the reserve determination is made. The SEC’s disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information
concerning “measured mineral resources”, “indicated mineral resources” or “inferred mineral resources” or other
descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute “reserves” by United States standards
in documents filed with the SEC. United States investors should also understand that “inferred mineral resources” have a
great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all
or any part of an “inferred mineral resource” will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of
“inferred mineral resources” may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies except in rare cases. Disclosure of
“contained ounces” in a mineral resource estimate is permitted disclosure under NI 43-101 provided that the grade or quality
and the quantity of each category is stated; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that
does not constitute “reserves” by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. The
requirements of NI 43-101 for identification of “reserves” are also not the same as those of the SEC, and reserves reported
in compliance with NI 43-101 may not qualify as “reserves” under SEC standards. Accordingly, information contained in this
Circular and the documents incorporated by reference herein containing descriptions of mineral deposits may not be
comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements
under the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.
- 9 -
The enforcement by investors of civil liabilities under the United States federal and state securities laws may be
affected adversely by the fact that SilverCrest and First Majestic are organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other
than the United States, that some or all of their officers and directors are and will be residents of countries other
than the United States, that some or all of the experts named in this Circular may be residents of countries other
than the United States, and that all or a substantial portion of the assets of SilverCrest, First Majestic and such
persons are and will be located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for
SilverCrest Shareholders or First Majestic Shareholders resident in the United States to effect service of process
within the United States upon SilverCrest or First Majestic, as applicable, their respective officers and directors or
the experts named herein, or to realize, against them, upon judgments of courts of the United States predicated
upon civil liabilities under the securities laws of the United States. In addition, the SilverCrest Shareholders and the
First Majestic Shareholders resident in the United States should not assume that the courts of Canada: (a) would
enforce judgments of United States courts obtained in actions against such persons predicated upon civil liabilities
under the securities laws of the United States; or (b) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against such
persons predicated upon civil liabilities under the securities laws of the United States.
NEITHER THE FIRST MAJESTIC SHARES NOR THE NEW SILVERCREST SHARES ISSUABLE PURSUANT TO
THE ARRANGEMENT HAVE BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SEC OR THE SECURITIES
REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES, NOR HAS THE SEC OR ANY SUCH STATE
SECURITIES REGULATORY AUTHORITY PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF THIS CIRCULAR.
ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE.

Q&A on the Arrangement
Q: What are SilverCrest Shareholders being asked to vote on?
A: SilverCrest Shareholders are being asked to vote on a special resolution to approve the plan of arrangement involving
SilverCrest, First Majestic and New SilverCrest under the BCBCA pursuant to which First Majestic will acquire all of the
outstanding SilverCrest Shares.
See “The Arrangement – SilverCrest Shareholder Approval”.
Q: What will I receive for my SilverCrest Shares under the Arrangement?
A: Under the Arrangement, each SilverCrest Shareholder will receive, subject to the terms of the Plan of Arrangement,
0.2769 of a First Majestic Share and C$0.0001 for each SilverCrest Share held. SilverCrest Shareholders will also receive
0.1667 of a common share of New SilverCrest, a company newly incorporated by SilverCrest for purposes of the
Arrangement.
See “The Arrangement – Description of the Arrangement” and “The Arrangement – Letter of Transmittal”.
Q: Does the Consideration reflect a premium for the SilverCrest Shares?
A: The Consideration implied a share price premium for SilverCrest Shareholders as of the date of the Arrangement
Agreement. The amount of the premium will vary according to the relative market prices of First Majestic Shares and
SilverCrest Shares at the time of closing.
The Consideration represents a premium of approximately 37% to the 30-day volume-weighted average price of the
SilverCrest Shares on the TSX for the period ending July 24, 2015 and a premium of approximately 35% to the closing price
of the SilverCrest Shares on the TSX on such date.
Q: Does the SilverCrest Board support the Arrangement?
A: Yes. The SilverCrest Board has unanimously determined that the Consideration is fair to SilverCrest Shareholders and
the SilverCrest Optionholders and that the Arrangement is in the best interests of SilverCrest. Further, the SilverCrest Board
has unanimously approved the Arrangement Agreement and unanimously recommends that SilverCrest Shareholders vote
FOR the Arrangement Resolution.
The recommendation of the SilverCrest Board is based on various factors, as more particularly set out in the accompanying
joint information circular, including the fairness opinion of National Bank Financial Inc., to the effect that the Consideration is
fair, from a financial point of view, to the SilverCrest Shareholders.
- 11 -
See “The Arrangement – Background to the Arrangement”, “The Arrangement – Recommendation of the First Majestic
Board” and “The Arrangement – Reasons for the Recommendation of the First Majestic Board”.
Q: What approvals are required of SilverCrest Shareholders at the SilverCrest Meeting?
A: To be effective, the Arrangement Resolution must be approved by:
(a)
at least two-thirds of the votes cast on the Arrangement Resolution by SilverCrest Shareholders present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the SilverCrest Meeting, and
(b)
at least a majority of the votes cast on the Arrangement Resolution by SilverCrest Shareholders present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the SilverCrest Meeting, excluding for this purpose votes attached to
SilverCrest Shares held by certain executive officers of SilverCrest who are entitled to receive “change of control”
payments upon completion of the Arrangement pursuant to their respective management consulting agreements with
SilverCrest. See “The Arrangement – SilverCrest Shareholder Approval” and “Regulatory Matters – Canadian Securities
Law Matters – MI 61-101”.
First Majestic has entered into voting agreements with the Locked-up Shareholders, pursuant to which the Locked-up
Shareholders have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions of the Lock-up Agreement, to vote their SilverCrest Shares
in favour of the Arrangement Resolution. As of the date of the Arrangement Agreement, the Locked-up Shareholders
collectively beneficially owned or exercised control or direction over an aggregate of 4,658,530 SilverCrest Shares and
6,475,000 SilverCrest Options, representing 3.92% of the SilverCrest Shares on a non-diluted basis, and 8.61% of the
SilverCrest Shares on a fully-diluted basis. See “The Arrangement – Lock-up Agreement”.
Q: What other approvals are required for the Arrangement?
The issuance of shares of First Majestic must be approved by the First Majestic Shareholders. See “The Arrangement –
First Majestic Shareholder Approval”.
In addition, the Arrangement must be approved by the Court. The Court will be asked to grant an order approving the
Arrangement and to determine that the Arrangement is fair to the SilverCrest Shareholders and the SilverCrest
Optionholders. SilverCrest will apply to the Court for this order if the SilverCrest Shareholders approve the Arrangement
Resolution at the SilverCrest Meeting and the First Majestic Shareholders approve the First Majestic Resolution at the First
Majestic Meeting.
The Arrangement and the transactions contemplated thereby are also subject to regulatory approval including the approval
of the (i) TSX, (ii) the NYSE and the NYSE MKT, and (iii) Mexican Antitrust Clearance.
See “The Arrangement – First Majestic Shareholder Approval” and “The Arrangement – Court Approval and Completion of
the Arrangement”.
Q: When will the Arrangement become effective?
A: Subject to obtaining the Court approval as well as the satisfaction of all other conditions precedent, if SilverCrest
Shareholders approve the Arrangement Resolution and the First Majestic Shareholders approve the First Majestic
Resolution, it is anticipated that the Arrangement will be completed in early October 2015.
Q: What are the Canadian federal income tax consequences of the Arrangement?
A: SilverCrest Shareholders who are Eligible Holders and who make a valid Tax Election with First Majestic may defer all
or part of the Canadian income tax that would otherwise arise on an exchange of their SilverCrest Shares for First Majestic
Shares and cash under the Arrangement.
- 12 -
A tax instruction letter providing certain instructions on how to complete the Tax Election forms may be obtained
from the Depositary by checking Box G on the Letter of Transmittal and submitting the Letter of Transmittal to the
Depositary within 90 days of the Effective Date in accordance with the procedures set out under “The Arrangement
– Letter of Transmittal”. A tax instruction letter may also be obtained on First Majestic’s website at
www.firstmajestic.com on or around the Effective Date. First Majestic agrees only to execute tax election forms of
Eligible Holders that have been prepared in accordance with the procedures set out in the tax instruction letter
within 90 days of the Effective Date and which comply with the provisions of the Tax Act. For further information
about making a Tax Election see “Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations – Shareholders Resident
in Canada – Exchange of SilverCrest Shares for First Majestic Shares and Cash — Section 85 Election”.
Subject to the qualifications set forth in this Circular, a Resident Shareholder whose SilverCrest Shares are exchanged for
First Majestic Shares and cash pursuant to the Arrangement, and who does not make a valid Tax Election with respect to
the exchange, will be considered to have disposed of those SilverCrest Shares for proceeds of disposition equal to the
aggregate fair market value of the First Majestic Shares and cash. As a result, a Resident Shareholder will generally realize
a capital gain (or capital loss) to the extent that such proceeds of disposition, net of any reasonable costs of disposition,
exceed (or are less than) the adjusted cost base of the Resident Shareholder’s SilverCrest Shares immediately before the
exchange. Generally, one-half of any capital gain (a “taxable capital gain”) realized by a Resident Shareholder in a
taxation year must be included in computing the Resident Shareholder’s income for that taxation year. One-half of any
capital loss must be deducted from taxable capital gains realized by the Resident Shareholder in the year of disposition, in
accordance with the detailed rules of the Tax Act.
A Non-Resident Shareholder will generally not be taxable in Canada with respect to any capital gains generated on the
disposition of SilverCrest Shares pursuant to the Arrangement as long as such SilverCrest Shares do not constitute “taxable
Canadian property” as defined in the Tax Act.
See “Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations” for the definitions of terms used but not defined above and for
a general summary of certain Canadian federal income tax consequences relating to the Arrangement.
Tax matters are complicated and the tax consequences of the Arrangement to you will depend on the facts of your
particular circumstances. Because individual circumstances may differ, you should consult with your tax advisor
as to the specific tax consequences of the Arrangement to you.
Q: What are the United States federal income tax consequences of the Arrangement?
A: The exchange of SilverCrest Shares for First Majestic Shares, cash and the New SilverCrest Share Consideration
pursuant to the Exchange generally is intended by First Majestic to qualify as part of a tax-deferred “reorganization” within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (a “Reorganization”) provided that the Substantially All Assets Requirement is
satisfied and the Amalgamation Transactions take place as currently intended by First Majestic. However, it is not entirely
clear that the Arrangement will qualify for treatment as a Reorganization and neither SilverCrest nor First Majestic has
sought or obtained either a ruling from the IRS or an opinion of counsel or other tax advisors regarding any of the tax
consequences of the Arrangement. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the status of the
Exchange as a Reorganization or that the U.S. courts will uphold the status of the Exchange as a Reorganization in the
event of an IRS challenge. If the Amalgamation Transactions do not take place, the Exchange will be a fully taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Assuming the Exchange is treated as part of a Reorganization, and subject to special rules applicable to interests in a PFIC,
as discussed under “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” below, U.S. Holders of SilverCrest Shares
should not recognize gain or loss, except to the extent of the U.S. dollar amount of the cash and the fair market value of the
New SilverCrest Share Consideration received pursuant to the Exchange. In addition, the distribution of the New
SilverCrest Shares not treated as additional consideration paid by First Majestic for the SilverCrest Shares should generally
be treated as a taxable distribution by SilverCrest.
Regardless of whether the Exchange qualifies as a Reorganization, the PFIC rules may require U.S. Holders to recognize
taxable gain or income subject to tax at ordinary income tax rates and incur an interest charge on a deemed income deferral
benefit. This description of U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Arrangement is qualified in its entirety by the longer
discussion under “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” below, and neither this description nor the
longer discussion is intended to be legal or tax advice to any particular U.S. Holder of SilverCrest Shares (or after the

See “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” for the definitions of terms used but not defined above and
for a general summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences relating to the Arrangement.
Tax matters are complicated and the tax consequences of the Arrangement to you will depend upon the facts of
your particular circumstances. Because individual circumstances may differ, you should consult with your tax
advisor as to the specific tax consequences of the Arrangement to you, including the applicability of United States
federal, state, local, non-United States and other tax laws.
Q: What will happen to SilverCrest if the Arrangement is completed?
A: If the Arrangement is completed, First Majestic will acquire all of the outstanding SilverCrest Shares and SilverCrest will
become a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of First Majestic. Following completion of the Arrangement, it is expected that the
SilverCrest Shares will be delisted from the TSX and NYSE MKT, and First Majestic will apply to the applicable securities
regulatory authorities in Canada to have SilverCrest cease to be a reporting issuer in all applicable jurisdictions in which
SilverCrest is a reporting issuer. In addition, it is anticipated that First Majestic will cause SilverCrest to terminate its
registration under section 12(g) and suspend its reporting obligations under section 13(a) of the U.S. Exchange Act.
Q: Are the First Majestic Shares listed on a stock exchange?
A: Yes. First Majestic Shares currently trade on the TSX under the symbol “FR” and on the NYSE under “AG”. First Majestic
has applied to the TSX and the NYSE to list the First Majestic Shares issuable (i) under the Arrangement and (ii) upon the
exercise of the Replacement Options. It is a condition of closing that First Majestic will have obtained approval of the TSX,
subject only to the customary listing conditions of the TSX, and of the NYSE, subject to fulfilling the requirements of the
NYSE.
Q: Are SilverCrest Shareholders entitled to Dissent Rights?
A: Yes. Under the Interim Order, registered holders of SilverCrest Shares are entitled to Dissent Rights but only if they follow
the procedures specified in the BCBCA, as modified by the Plan of Arrangement and the Interim Order. If you wish to
exercise Dissent Rights, you should review the requirements summarized in this Circular carefully and consult with your
legal advisor.
See “The Arrangement – Right to Dissent”.
Q: What will happen if the Arrangement Resolution is not approved or the Arrangement is not completed for any
reason?
A: If the Arrangement Resolution is not approved or the Arrangement is not completed for any reason, the Arrangement
Agreement may be terminated. In certain circumstances, including if SilverCrest accepts a competing offer that the
SilverCrest Board concludes is superior to the Arrangement, SilverCrest will be required to pay to First Majestic the
Termination Payment of C$8,000,000 if SilverCrest accepts a competing offer. In certain other circumstances, including
termination due to breach of a representation or warranty or due to failure to obtain shareholder approval, one of the parties
may be required to pay to the other than expense reimbursement fee of US$1,000,000.
See “The Arrangement Agreement – Termination” and The Arrangement Agreement – Termination Payment”.
- 14 -
Q: Should I send in my Letter of Transmittal and SilverCrest Share certificates now?
A: All registered holders of SilverCrest Shares should complete, sign and return the Letter of Transmittal with accompanying
SilverCrest Share certificate(s) (if applicable) to the Depositary as soon as possible. In the event the Arrangement is not
consummated, the Depositary will promptly return any SilverCrest Share certificates (if applicable) that have been
deposited. Please be sure to use the Letter of Transmittal.
See “The Arrangement – Letter of Transmittal”.
Q: When will I receive the First Majestic Shares, cash and New SilverCrest Shares issuable pursuant to the
Arrangement in exchange for my SilverCrest Shares?
A: You will receive 0.2769 of a First Majestic Share, C$0.0001 and 0.1667 of a New SilverCrest Share in exchange for each
SilverCrest Share held as soon as practicable after the Arrangement becomes effective and your properly completed Letter
of Transmittal and SilverCrest Share certificate(s) (if applicable) are received by the Depositary. It is anticipated that the
Arrangement will be completed in early October 2015.
See “The Arrangement – Procedure for the Arrangement to Become Effective”.
Q: What happens if I send in my SilverCrest Share certificate(s) and the Arrangement Resolution is not approved or
the Arrangement is not completed?
A: If the Arrangement Resolution is not approved or if the Arrangement is not otherwise completed, your SilverCrest Share
certificate(s) (if applicable) will be returned promptly to you by the Depositary.
Q: What will happen to my SilverCrest Options?
A: Under the Arrangement, each SilverCrest Option which is outstanding and has not been duly exercised prior to the
Effective Time will be exchanged for a First Majestic Replacement Option to purchase from First Majestic such number of
First Majestic Shares as is equal to the First Majestic Exchange Ratio and a New SilverCrest Option to purchase from New
SilverCrest such number of New SilverCrest Shares as is equal to the New SilverCrest Exchange Ratio. Each First Majestic
Replacement Option will provide for an exercise price per First Majestic Share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal
to the exercise price per SilverCrest Share that would otherwise be payable pursuant to the SilverCrest Option it replaces,
divided by the First Majestic Exchange Ratio. Each New SilverCrest Option will provide for an exercise price of C$0.06 per
New SilverCrest Share. All terms and conditions of a First Majestic Replacement Option and a New SilverCrest Option,
including the term to expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising, will be the same as the SilverCrest Option for which it
was exchanged except that there will be no accelerated expiry of First Majestic Replacement Options on account of early
termination after ceasing to hold office or ceasing to be an employee or consultant.

The purpose of the Arrangement is to effect a business combination of SilverCrest with First Majestic by
the exchange of all issued and outstanding SilverCrest Shares for First Majestic Shares (and a nominal
cash component) and to establish New SilverCrest as a separate company. If the Arrangement
Resolution receives SilverCrest Shareholder Approval and all other conditions to the closing of the
Arrangement are satisfied or waived, the Arrangement will be implemented by way of a court-approved
plan of arrangement under the BCBCA. As a result of the Arrangement, each SilverCrest Shareholder
will become a shareholder of First Majestic and of New SilverCrest, and SilverCrest will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of First Majestic.
The ArrangementFollowing the issuance of the First Majestic Shares as part of the Consideration receivable by
SilverCrest Shareholders under the Arrangement, SilverCrest Shareholders will hold approximately
21.2% of the total outstanding First Majestic Shares on a post-closing undiluted basis assuming no
SilverCrest Options are exercised prior to the Effective Date and there are no other issuances of First
Majestic Shares or SilverCrest Shares. Upon completion of the Arrangement, New SilverCrest will be
owned as to approximately 90.1% by the former SilverCrest Shareholders and as to approximately 9.9%
by First Majestic.
See “The Arrangement – Description of the Arrangement” and “The Arrangement Agreement”.
 
The SilverCrest Board, after careful consideration and having taken into account the SilverCrest
Fairness Opinion and such other matters as the SilverCrest Board considered relevant, has unanimously
determined that the Consideration payable by First Majestic under the Arrangement, together with the
distribution of New SilverCrest Shares, is fair to SilverCrest Shareholders and the SilverCrest
Optionholders and that the Arrangement is in the best interests of SilverCrest.
Accordingly, the SilverCrest Board has unanimously approved the Arrangement and
unanimously recommends that SilverCrest Shareholders vote FOR the Arrangement Resolution.
In the course of their evaluation of the Arrangement to arrive at the conclusion that the Arrangement is
beneficial to the SilverCrest Shareholders, the SilverCrest Board considered a number of factors
including, among others, the following:
·         Significant Premium to SilverCrest Shareholders. First Majestic has offered SilverCrest
Shareholders a significant premium to the SilverCrest Share price. Before ascribing any value to the
New SilverCrest Shares, the Consideration to be received by the SilverCrest Shareholders, represents a
premium of approximately 35% based on the closing price on the TSX of the First Majestic Shares and
the SilverCrest Shares on July 24, 2015 (being the last trading day prior to the announcement of the
Arrangement) and a premium of approximately 37% to the volume weighted average price of the
SilverCrest Shares on the TSX for the 30-day period ending on July 24, 2015.
·         Benefits of Owning First Majestic Shares. The First Majestic Shares to be received by SilverCrest
Shareholders in the Arrangement offer SilverCrest Shareholders the following:
·         an opportunity to own shares in a high-quality, leading silver producer;
·         access to First Majestic's operational and underground mining expertise;

Board
- 33 -
·         diversification of SilverCrest’s single asset risk profile by providing exposure to First Majestic’s
broad portfolio of Mexican assets; and
·         enhanced capital markets presence with a pro forma market capitalization in excess of
C$685,000,000 based on the market capitalizations of First Majestic and SilverCrest on July 24, 2015
(the last trading day prior to announcement of the Arrangement Agreement) with increased analyst
coverage, trading liquidity and a broader institutional investor base compared to that of SilverCrest.
·         Continued Participation by SilverCrest Shareholders in the Santa Elena Mine and the La Joya
Property. SilverCrest Shareholders, through their ownership of First Majestic Shares, will continue to
participate in the value associated with the operation and further development of the Santa Elena Mine
and the exploration and potential development of the La Joya Project.
·         Continued Participation by SilverCrest Shareholders in the New SilverCrest Exploration Properties
Through New SilverCrest. SilverCrest Shareholders, through their ownership of New SilverCrest
Shares, will participate in the opportunities associated with the SilverCrest Transferred Properties and
the First Majestic Transferred Property, and will have the benefit of SilverCrest management’s
exploration expertise.
·         Fairness Opinion. SilverCrest’s financial advisor, National Bank Financial, provided its opinion to
the SilverCrest Board to the effect that, as of July 26, 2015, and subject to the assumptions, limitations
and qualifications set out in the SilverCrest Fairness Opinion, the Consideration is fair, from a financial
point of view, to the SilverCrest Shareholders.
 
As at the date of the SilverCrest Fairness Opinion and subject to the scope of the review, analysis
undertaken and various assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth in the SilverCrest Fairness
Opinion, National Bank Financial has delivered its opinion that the Consideration is fair, from a financial
point of view, to the SilverCrest Shareholders.
 
See “The Arrangement – SilverCrest Fairness Opinion” and the full text of the SilverCrest Fairness
Opinion, which is attached as Appendix I to this Circular. SilverCrest Shareholders are encouraged to
read the SilverCrest Fairness Opinion carefully in its entirety.
 
The First Majestic Board, after careful consideration and having taken into account the First Majestic
Fairness Opinion and such other matters as the First Majestic Board considered relevant, has
unanimously determined that the Arrangement is in the best interests of First Majestic.
Accordingly, the First Majestic Board has unanimously approved the Arrangement and
unanimously recommends that First Majestic Shareholders vote FOR the First Majestic
Resolution.
 
In the course of their evaluation of the Arrangement to arrive at the conclusion that the Arrangement is in
the best interests of First Majestic, the First Majestic Board considered a number of factors including,
among others, the following:
·         Addition of a Sixth Producing Mine. SilverCrest’s Santa Elena mine adds a sixth producing mine to
First Majestic’s broad portfolio of Mexican projects, enhancing its leading position in Mexico. The
completion of the Arrangement is consistent with First Majestic’s overall business plan, which includes
the development of its existing mineral property assets and the pursuit through acquisition of additional
mineral assets which contribute to corporate growth. The Arrangement will further diversify First
Majestic’s production portfolio and exploration potential, as well as its cash flow across a robust portfolio
of producing mines. The strategic addition is expected to add production of approximately 5,200,000
silver equivalent ounces for the 2016 calendar year, increasing First Majestic’s estimated annual
production to approximately 22,300,000 silver equivalent ounces in 2016.

The Arrangement will also increase First Majestic’s reserve and resource base. SilverCrest has reported (i) total
probable reserves of 18,764,000 ounces of contained silver and 295,000 ounces of contained gold, (ii) indicated
resources of 3,220,000 ounces of contained silver and 50,000 ounces of contained gold, and (iii) inferred
resources of 1,932,000 ounces of contained silver and 31,000 ounces of contained gold. SilverCrest has
estimated the Santa Elena mine to have a remaining life of eight years, with the potential for additional exploration.
·         Additional Low Cost Production. SilverCrest’s reported costs at the Santa Elena mine are lower than many of
its peers in Mexico, with a cash operating cost of US$8.05 per silver equivalent ounce during the quarter ended
June 30, 2015. The combination of the two businesses including the addition of SilverCrest’s highly automated
and state of the art Santa Elena production facility is also expected to provide operational and production
synergies with the potential to reduce operational and production costs further at the Santa Elena mine and First
Majestic’s existing properties. Management of First Majestic has a strong track record of successful integration of
similar acquisitions.
·         Strengthens Balance Sheet. The Arrangement is expected to add approximately US$33,000,000 in cash and
US$29,000,000 of working capital to First Majestic’s balance sheet to further enhance its financial position. First
Majestic’s net asset value per share, reserves and total resources per share and production per share are
expected to increase with the addition of the Santa Elena mine.
·         Reasonable Premium to SilverCrest Shareholders. In consultation with Cormark, First Majestic has
determined that the premium to be paid to the SilverCrest Shareholders is within the range typical in the market for
similar transactions.
·         Increased Capital Market Presence. Upon completion of the Arrangement, First Majestic will have a broader
shareholder base with expected increased market liquidity and a larger public float than First Majestic presently.
As of July 24, 2015 (the last trading day prior to announcement of the Arrangement Agreement), First Majestic had
a pro forma market capitalization of approximately C$685,000,000 (based on the market capitalizations of First
Majestic and SilverCrest as of such date) compared with First Majestic’s market capitalization of approximately

First Majestic Fairness Opinion, the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view, to First Majestic.
As at the date of the First Majestic Fairness Opinion and subject to the scope of the review, analysis undertaken
and various assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth in the First Majestic Fairness Opinion, Cormark
has delivered its opinion that the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view, to First Majestic.

If the Arrangement Resolution and the First Majestic Resolution are passed, the Arrangement is approved by
the Court and all of the other conditions to closing of the Arrangement are satisfied, First Majestic will acquire
all of the outstanding SilverCrest Shares and SilverCrest will become a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of
First Majestic. Each SilverCrest Shareholder will be entitled to receive 0.2769 of a First Majestic Share and
C$0.0001 in exchange for each SilverCrest Share held. Each SilverCrest Shareholder will also be entitled to
receive 0.1667 of a New SilverCrest Share. Each unexercised SilverCrest Option will be exchanged for a
New SilverCrest Option and a First Majestic Replacement Option.
Effects of the
Arrangement
A copy of the Plan of Arrangement is attached as Appendix C and forms an integral part of this Circular.
SilverCrest Shareholders are encouraged to read the Arrangement Agreement as it is the principal agreement
that governs the Arrangement. The Arrangement Agreement is available under SilverCrest’s and First
Majestic’s profiles on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on EDGAR under SilverCrest’s and First Majestic’s
profiles at www.sec.gov.
For a summary of the principal provisions of the Arrangement Agreement, see “The Arrangement Agreement”.
 
Pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement, SilverCrest has agreed not to solicit, initiate or encourage any
Acquisition Proposals. However, the SilverCrest Board has the right to consider and accept a Superior
Proposal under certain conditions and First Majestic has the right to match the Superior Proposal. If
SilverCrest accepts a Superior Proposal and terminates the Arrangement Agreement, SilverCrest must pay
First Majestic the Termination Payment of C$8,000,000. SilverCrest can only consider and accept a Superior
Proposal before the SilverCrest Meeting.
See “The Arrangement Agreement – Non-Solicitation Covenants and Rights to Accept a Superior Proposal”
and “The Arrangement Agreement – First Majestic’s Right to Match”.
 
The Arrangement Agreement may be terminated before the Effective Time in certain circumstances. Such
termination may, in certain circumstances, result in the payment by SilverCrest to First Majestic of the
Termination Payment of C$8,000,000 or an expense reimbursement fee of US$1,000,000, or payment by
First Majestic to SilverCrest of an expense reimbursement fee of US$1,000,000.

The Letter of Transmittal is enclosed with this Circular for use by Registered SilverCrest Shareholders. In order
for a Registered SilverCrest Shareholder to receive the First Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares to
which it is entitled under the Arrangement, the SilverCrest Shareholder is required to forward to the Depositary
a completed and signed Letter of Transmittal and surrender its SilverCrest Shares and, where issued,
SilverCrest Share certificate(s). The details for the surrender of SilverCrest Shares and, where issued,
SilverCrest Share certificate(s) to the Depositary and the addresses of the Depositary are set out in the Letter of
Transmittal. Provided that a Registered SilverCrest Shareholder has delivered and surrendered to the
Depositary (i) a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, (ii) SilverCrest Share certificates
(where issued) and (iii) such additional documents as the Depositary may reasonably require in respect of the
exchange of SilverCrest Shares, the Registered SilverCrest Shareholder will be entitled to receive, and First
Majestic and New SilverCrest will cause the Depositary to respectively deliver to the Registered SilverCrest
Letter of
Transmittal
Shareholder, (a) certificates or DRS Advice Statements representing the number of First Majestic Shares and a
cheque for the cash payment issuable or deliverable to such holder as Consideration pursuant to the
Arrangement, and (b) certificates or DRS Advice Statements representing the number of New SilverCrest
Shares issuable or deliverable pursuant to the Arrangement.
In the event that the Arrangement is not completed, the Depositary will promptly return any SilverCrest Share
certificate(s) (where issued) that have been deposited. The Letter of Transmittal is available on SilverCrest’s
website at www.silvercrestmines.com and under SilverCrest’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
See “The Arrangement – Letter of Transmittal” and “The Arrangement – Return of SilverCrest Share
Certificates”.
 
The Interim Order expressly provides Registered SilverCrest Shareholders with the right to dissent with respect
to the Arrangement Resolution. Each Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholder is entitled to be paid the fair value
(determined as of immediately before the passing of the Arrangement Resolution) of all, but not less than all, of
the holder’s SilverCrest Shares, provided that the holder duly dissents to the Arrangement Resolution in
accordance with the terms of the Plan of Arrangement and the Interim Order and the Arrangement becomes
effective.
To exercise Dissent Rights, a SilverCrest Shareholder must dissent with respect to all SilverCrest Shares of
which it is the registered and beneficial owner. A Registered SilverCrest Shareholder who wishes to dissent
must deliver a written Dissent Notice to SilverCrest as set forth below and such Dissent Notice must strictly
comply with the requirements of section 242 of the BCBCA as modified by Article 3 of the Plan of Arrangement,
the Interim Order and the Final Order. Any failure by a SilverCrest Shareholder to fully comply with the
provisions of the BCBCA, as modified by Article 3 of the Plan of Arrangement, the Interim Order and the Final
Order, may result in the loss of that holder’s Dissent Rights.
Dissent
Rights
A SilverCrest Shareholder who wishes to exercise Dissent Rights must ensure that a Dissent Notice is received
by SilverCrest at its registered office at 19th Floor, 885 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia,
Canada V6C 3H4 on or before 5:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on September 23, 2015. See “Rights of Dissenting
SilverCrest Shareholders”.
First Majestic is not obligated to complete the Arrangement if holders of more than 5% of the outstanding
SilverCrest Shares exercise Dissent Rights.
- 37 -
Pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, each SilverCrest Option which is outstanding and has not been duly
exercised prior to the Effective Time will be exchanged for a First Majestic Replacement Option to
purchase from First Majestic such number of First Majestic Shares as is equal to the First Majestic
Exchange Ratio and a New SilverCrest Option to purchase from New SilverCrest such number of New
SilverCrest Shares as is equal to the New SilverCrest Exchange Ratio. See “The Arrangement”. Vesting of
all SilverCrest Options has been or will be accelerated prior to the Effective Time.
Each First Majestic Replacement Option will provide for an exercise price per First Majestic Share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per SilverCrest Share that would
otherwise be payable pursuant to the SilverCrest Replacement Option it replaces, divided by the First
Treatment of
SilverCrest
Options
Majestic Exchange Ratio. Each New SilverCrest Option will provide for an exercise price of C$0.06 per
New SilverCrest Share. All terms and conditions of a First Majestic Replacement Option and a New
SilverCrest Option, including the term to expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising, will be the same as
the SilverCrest Option for which it was exchanged except that there will be no accelerated expiry of First
Majestic Replacement Options on account of early termination after ceasing to hold office or ceasing to be
an employee or consultant.
Income Tax
Considerations
Risk Factors
If required, the exercise price of a First Majestic Replacement Option or a New SilverCrest Option, as the
case may be, will be increased such that the aggregate In-The-Money Amount of the First Majestic
Replacement Option and the In-The-Money Amount of the New SilverCrest Option issued in exchange for
a SilverCrest Option immediately after the exchange does not exceed the In-The-Money Amount of the
SilverCrest Option immediately before the exchange.
 
SilverCrest Shareholders should carefully review the tax considerations described in this Circular and are
urged to consult their own tax advisors in regard to their particular circumstances. See “Certain Canadian
Federal Income Tax Considerations” and “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations.
 
There are risks associated with the completion of the Arrangement. Some of these risks include: (a) there
can be no certainty that the Arrangement will be completed as completion of the Arrangement is subject to
certain conditions that may be outside the control of both First Majestic and SilverCrest; (b) the Termination
Payment provided under he Arrangement Agreement may discourage other parties from attempting to
acquire SilverCrest and could have an adverse effect on its financial condition; (c) SilverCrest directors and
executive officers may have interests in the Arrangement that are different from those of SilverCrest
Shareholders; (d) there is a risk that the Exchange will be a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income
tax purposes; and (e) it is expected that New SilverCrest will be a PFIC for the current taxable year and
may be a PFIC in subsequent years, which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for
U.S. Holders. See “Risk Factors – Risks Factors Relating to the Arrangement”.
There are risks associated with First Majestic post-Arrangement. In addition to the risk factors described in
the First Majestic AIF under the heading “Risk Factors” which are specifically incorporated by reference
into this Circular, some of these risks include: (a) the value of the First Majestic Shares that SilverCrest
Shareholders receive under the Arrangement, or of the First Majestic Shares that existing First Majestic
Shareholders retain following the Arrangement, may be less than the value of the SilverCrest Shares or
First Majestic Shares, as applicable, as of the date of the Arrangement Agreement or the date of the
SilverCrest Meeting and the First Majestic Meeting; (b) the integration of First Majestic and SilverCrest may
not occur as planned; (c) First Majestic may not realize the benefits of its growth projects; (d) mineral
reserve and mineral resource figures pertaining to First Majestic’s and SilverCrest’s properties are only
estimates and are subject to revision based on developing information; (e) following the Arrangement, the
market price of the First Majestic Shares may be volatile; (f) the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of First Majestic’s
condition or results of operations following the Arrangement; (g) First Majestic may be subject to significant
capital requirements and operating risks associated with its expanded operations; (h) following completion
of the Arrangement, First Majestic may issue additional equity securities; and (i) First Majestic may become
subject to legal proceedings. See “Risk Factors – Risk Factors Relating to First Majestic Post-
Arrangement”.
- 38 -
There are risks associated with New SilverCrest. See the risk factors described in “Appendix H – Information
Concerning New SilverCrest Post-Arrangement – Risk Factors”.
 
If the Arrangement is completed, the SilverCrest Shares will be delisted from the TSX and NYSE MKT, and
First Majestic will apply to the applicable securities regulatory authorities in Canada to have SilverCrest
cease to be a reporting issuer in all applicable jurisdictions in which SilverCrest is a reporting issuer. In
addition, it is anticipated that First Majestic will cause SilverCrest to file a Form 15 with the SEC pursuant to
U.S. Exchange Act Rule 12g-4 and thereby terminate SilverCrest’s registration under section 12(g) and
suspend SilverCrest’s reporting obligations under section 13(a) of the U.S. Exchange Act.
Stock
Exchange
Listings and
Reporting
Issuer Status
First Majestic has applied for listing on the NYSE and TSX of the First Majestic Shares issuable to
SilverCrest Shareholders pursuant to the Arrangement and issuable pursuant to exercise of First Majestic
Replacement Options. The TSX has granted its approval of the listing of such First Majestic Shares,
conditional upon approval by the First Majestic Shareholders of the First Majestic Resolution and the
satisfaction of other customary listing conditions.
New SilverCrest intends to file an application with the TSX-V for listing of the New SilverCrest Shares,
including those issuable to SilverCrest Shareholders and to First Majestic pursuant to the Arrangement.
Mexican
Antitrust
Clearance
See “The Arrangement – Stock Exchange Listing and Reporting Issuer Status”.
 
Under the Mexican Competition Law, the Arrangement cannot be consummated until the issuance of a
clearance resolution from COFECE, which must be issued within 60 business days after the filing of a notice
of concentration or the submission of all additional required information and documentation. However, for
complicated cases COFECE may extend the period up to 40 additional business days.
First Majestic has made the application and will file responses as may be requested by COFECE during such
period. Under the Mexican Competition Law, once the term has expired and no decision has been issued by
COFECE, it is generally understood that they have no objection.
 
The Arrangement is proposed to be carried out pursuant to Division 5 of Part 9 of the BCBCA. The following
procedural steps must be taken in order for the Arrangement to become effective:
(a)          the SilverCrest Shareholder Approval and the First Majestic Shareholder Approval must be obtained;
Procedure
for the
Arrangement
 
to Become
Effective
(b)          the Court must grant the Final Order approving the Arrangement; and
(c)          all other conditions precedent to the Arrangement further described in the Arrangement Agreement
including receipt of necessary regulatory approvals must be satisfied or waived by the appropriate party.

The Arrangement
Overview
The purpose of the Arrangement is to effect a business combination of SilverCrest with First Majestic by the exchange of all
issued and outstanding SilverCrest Shares for First Majestic Shares and to establish New SilverCrest as a separate
company. If (a) the Arrangement Resolution is approved by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes cast on such
resolution by SilverCrest Shareholders present in person or by proxy at the SilverCrest Meeting and receives SilverCrest
Minority Approval, (b) the First Majestic Resolution is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on such
resolution by First Majestic Shareholders present in person or by proxy at the First Majestic Meeting, (c) the Final Order is
granted and (d) all other conditions to the closing of the Arrangement are satisfied or waived, the Arrangement will be
implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the BCBCA.
As a result of the Arrangement, each SilverCrest Shareholder will become a shareholder of First Majestic and of New
SilverCrest and will receive, in exchange for each SilverCrest Share held, 0.2769 of a First Majestic Share plus C$0.0001
cash and 0.1667 of a New SilverCrest Share. SilverCrest will then become a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Majestic, and
the former SilverCrest Shareholders will hold approximately 21.2% of the total outstanding First Majestic Shares assuming
no SilverCrest Options are exercised prior to the Effective Date and there are no other issuances of First Majestic Shares or
SilverCrest Shares. New SilverCrest will be owned as to approximately 90.1% by the former SilverCrest Shareholders and
as to approximately 9.9% by First Majestic.
- 47 -
Pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, each SilverCrest Option which is outstanding and has not been duly exercised prior to
the Effective Time will be exchanged for a First Majestic Replacement Option to purchase from First Majestic such number
of First Majestic Shares as is equal to the First Majestic Exchange Ratio and a New SilverCrest Option to purchase from
New SilverCrest such number of New SilverCrest Shares as is equal to the New SilverCrest Exchange Ratio. Each First
Majestic Replacement Option will provide for an exercise price per First Majestic Share (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent) equal to the exercise price per SilverCrest Share that would otherwise be payable pursuant to the SilverCrest
Replacement Option it replaces, divided by the First Majestic Exchange Ratio. Each New SilverCrest Option will provide for
an exercise price of C$0.06 per New SilverCrest Share. All terms and conditions of a First Majestic Replacement Option
and a New SilverCrest Option, including the term to expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising, will be the same as the
SilverCrest Option for which it was exchanged except that there will be no accelerated expiry of First Majestic Replacement
Options on account of early termination after ceasing to hold office or ceasing to be an employee or consultant. If required,
the exercise price of a First Majestic Replacement Option or a New SilverCrest Option, as the case may be, will be
increased such that the aggregate In-The-Money Amount of the First Majestic Replacement Option and the In-The-Money
Amount of the New SilverCrest Option issued in exchange for a SilverCrest Option immediately after the exchange does not
exceed the In-The-Money Amount of the SilverCrest Option immediately before the exchange. Vesting of all SilverCrest
Options has been or will be accelerated prior to the Effective Time.
A summary of certain material terms of the Arrangement Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement is provided in this section.
This summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Arrangement Agreement
which is available under SilverCrest’s and First Majestic’s profiles on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on EDGAR under
SilverCrest’s and First Majestic’s profiles at www.sec.gov, and to the Plan of Arrangement, which is attached as Appendix C
to this Circular. The Arrangement Agreement was amended by agreement of the parties on August 24, 2015 to set the
exercise price of the New SilverCrest Options at C$0.06.
Background to the Arrangement
The Arrangement Agreement is the result of arm’s length negotiations among representatives of First Majestic and
SilverCrest and their respective legal and financial advisors. The following is a summary of the background leading up to
the Arrangement Agreement.
First Majestic’s overall business plan includes the development of its existing mineral property assets and the pursuit
through acquisition of additional mineral assets which contribute to corporate growth. In furtherance of these objectives,
First Majestic has completed three public company acquisitions and two mine acquisitions since 2004 including, most
recently, the acquisition of Silvermex Resources Inc. including its La Guitarra mine in 2012. Since the acquisition of
Silvermex Resources Inc., First Majestic has continued to assess potential acquisition candidates.
Over the past several years, SilverCrest entered into a number of confidentiality agreements with various mining companies
with a view to holding discussions regarding potential transactions to maximize shareholder value. SilverCrest established
an electronic data room in order to allow for technical due diligence to be conducted and a number of companies conducted
site visits as part of their due diligence.
During the period from the fall of 2014 to the spring of 2015, based upon direction from the SilverCrest Board and previous
discussions, management of SilverCrest, together with National Bank Financial, approached a number of likely acquirers to
solicit interest in a process for the acquisition of SilverCrest. First Majestic was one of two parties which indicated an
interest in having discussions with SilverCrest regarding the possible acquisition of SilverCrest.
On April 1, 2015, SilverCrest and First Majestic entered into a confidentiality and standstill agreement. Initial discussions
were held between the management of SilverCrest and First Majestic in April, 2015 to determine respective levels of
interest. Management of First Majestic consulted with Cormark on an informal basis. On April 24, 2015 National Bank
Financial, which, to that date, had been advising SilverCrest on an informal basis, presented to SilverCrest management a
preliminary analysis which it had prepared of First Majestic. On April 29, 2015, Cormark provided First Majestic
management with a preliminary analysis of SilverCrest.
During April and May 2015, First Majestic personnel conducted site visits of SilverCrest’s Santa Elena mine to conduct
operational and technical due diligence. On May 9, 2015, First Majestic formally retained Cormark to act as its financial
advisor in connection with the potential acquisition of SilverCrest.
On May 21, 2015, the First Majestic Board met to discuss the strategic and financial merits of a transaction with SilverCrest.
The First Majestic management team presented their preliminary view of a transaction with SilverCrest to the First Majestic
Board, and discussed indicative transaction terms and preliminary due diligence matters. The First Majestic Board
authorized management to submit a non-binding letter of intent in respect of a potential combination of SilverCrest with First
Majestic. In consultation with First Majestic’s legal counsel, McCullough O’Connor Irwin LLP, management of First Majestic
prepared an initial discussion draft of a letter of intent and exclusivity agreement with certain indicative transaction terms. On
May 28, 2015, First Majestic sent this draft to SilverCrest.
- 48 -
On June 3, 2015, SilverCrest formally engaged National Bank Financial as its financial advisor. National Bank Financial
then presented a preliminary financial assessment of SilverCrest and discussed strategic process considerations with
SilverCrest management.
After further consultation with its financial, legal and tax advisors, on June 8, 2015, First Majestic sent SilverCrest a signed
letter of intent consisting of an exclusivity agreement and non-binding indicative transaction terms. On June 9, 2015, the
SilverCrest Board met to consider the First Majestic letter of intent and to receive National Bank Financial’s presentation of
its analysis of the proposed transaction with First Majestic and to consider National Bank Financial’s observations on other
potentially interested parties and their ability to put forward competing proposals. The SilverCrest Board also considered
whether to establish a special committee of the SilverCrest Board to oversee the potential transaction process and
concluded that it was unnecessary as SilverCrest and First Majestic were completely at arm’s length and all but one (J.
Scott Drever, SilverCrest’s Chief Executive Officer) of the five members of the SilverCrest Board were viewed as
independent for this purpose and could meet independently if and as required. The SilverCrest Board instructed
management to proceed with further negotiations with First Majestic to determine whether a transaction with terms
acceptable to the SilverCrest Board could be achieved.
Between June 9 and June 24, 2015, a number of discussions took place between management of SilverCrest and First
Majestic and between their respective financial advisors to consider possible transaction terms and structure. SilverCrest
outlined to First Majestic terms which it considered would be of interest to SilverCrest and which SilverCrest management
and the SilverCrest Board would be prepared to consider seriously. First Majestic’s management also held discussions with
certain members of the First Majestic Board regarding potential transaction terms and the business and prospects of
SilverCrest. First Majestic sent SilverCrest a further revised signed letter of intent (the “LOI”) representing its “best and final
offer” on June 24, 2015. The other potential acquirer of SilverCrest was similarly solicited for its “best and final offer” and
SilverCrest received this on June 24, 2015. The SilverCrest Board instructed National Bank Financial to perform an
analysis of both offers for presentation to the SilverCrest Board.
On June 25, 2015, National Bank Financial presented the results of its analysis of both offers to the SilverCrest Board and
recommended acceptance of the LOI. A meeting of the SilverCrest Board with SilverCrest management and SilverCrest’s
legal and financial advisors followed on June 25, 2015. Based in part on National Bank Financial’s analysis and advice,
SilverCrest accepted the LOI on June 26, 2015 and terminated discussions with the other potential acquiror. The LOI
included a binding exclusivity period of 30 days and non-binding indicative terms for the Arrangement. During the
exclusivity period, each of SilverCrest and First Majestic agreed to complete due diligence of the other by July 19, 2015,
which date was subsequently extended to the end of the exclusivity period.
Following execution of the LOI, each of SilverCrest and First Majestic and their respective Canadian and Mexican legal, tax
and financial advisors conducted extensive due diligence of the other. SilverCrest organized a senior technical team
consisting of senior management and independent consultants to conduct an in-depth technical due diligence of First
Majestic and conducted site visits to all of First Majestic’s five mine sites. First Majestic also organized a team consisting of
senior management, an independent director and third party advisors to conduct legal, financial, tax, operational and
technical due diligence including multiple site visits to the Santa Elena mine site and contiguous properties as well as visits
to SilverCrest’s local office in Hermosillo, Mexico.
Between June 26 and July 26, 2015, SilverCrest and First Majestic, together with their respective legal and financial
advisors, negotiated the terms of the Arrangement Agreement. During this period, the parties and the Locked-up
Shareholders also negotiated the terms of the Lock-up Agreement.
On July 16, 2015, the SilverCrest Board met to receive, among other things, National Bank Financial’s update on its review
of the proposed Arrangement with First Majestic and to receive the due diligence reports prepared by SilverCrest’s senior
management and outside consultants.
- 49 -
On July 17, 2015, management of First Majestic received the preliminary due diligence reports prepared by First Majestic’s
outside Canadian and Mexican legal advisors. On July 22, 2015 management of First Majestic received Canadian and
Mexican tax due diligence reports prepared by First Majestic’s tax advisors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
On July 24, 2015, the SilverCrest Board met to consider the draft Arrangement Agreement and other documents, and to
receive the advice of National Bank Financial and its Canadian legal counsel, Koffman Kalef LLP. National Bank Financial
made a presentation to the SilverCrest Board concerning the financial terms of the proposed Arrangement transaction and
Koffman Kalef LLP led the SilverCrest Board through a detailed review and discussion of the draft Arrangement Agreement
and other documents.
National Bank Financial orally advised the SilverCrest Board that, as of July 24, 2015, based upon certain assumptions,
qualifications and limitations, in its opinion, the Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to the SilverCrest
Shareholders. National Bank Financial’s oral opinion was subsequently formalized in the written SilverCrest Fairness
Opinion. See “SilverCrest Fairness Opinion”.
At the SilverCrest Board meeting on July 24, 2015, the SilverCrest Board determined to hold an in camera session of
independent directors, which consisted of all directors other than J. Scott Drever, SilverCrest’s Chief Executive Officer. The
independent directors reviewed and discussed the change of control benefits which would accrue to senior management,
including SilverCrest’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer and whether in the view
of the independent directors this influenced in any way the transaction process and management’s recommendation to the
SilverCrest Board for approval of the proposed Arrangement. Having reviewed all aspects of the proposed Arrangement
and the roles played by SilverCrest’s executive officers and independent consultants in the transaction process and the
extensive involvement of independent SilverCrest Board members in the process, the independent directors of SilverCrest
unanimously approved proceeding with the Arrangement and execution of the Arrangement Agreement.
After discussion and taking into consideration the financial advice of National Bank Financial as well as numerous other
factors, including those set forth below under the heading “Reasons for the Recommendation of the SilverCrest Board” the
SilverCrest Board resolved and determined that the Arrangement was fair to SilverCrest Shareholders and the SilverCrest
Optionholders and in the best interests of SilverCrest, and that it would recommend that SilverCrest Shareholders vote for
the Arrangement Resolution.
On July 24, 2015, the First Majestic Board met to consider the draft Arrangement Agreement and other documents, and to
receive the advice of Cormark and its Canadian legal counsel, McCullough O’Connor Irwin LLP. At the meeting, the First
Majestic Board was presented with reports from senior management and its Canadian and Mexican legal, financial and tax
advisors with respect to due diligence, the terms and structure of the proposed transactions and the Arrangement
Agreement.
Cormark made a presentation to the First Majestic Board concerning the financial terms of the proposed Arrangement
transaction at which time Cormark orally advised the First Majestic Board that, as of July 24, 2015, based upon certain
assumptions, qualifications and limitations, in its opinion, the Arrangement was fair, from a financial point of view, to First
Majestic. Cormark’s oral opinion was subsequently formalized in the written First Majestic Fairness Opinion. See “First
Majestic Fairness Opinion”.
After discussion and taking into consideration the financial advice of Cormark, the advice of its legal and tax advisors, as
well as numerous other factors, including those set forth below under the heading “Reasons for the Recommendation of the
First Majestic Board” the First Majestic Board resolved and determined that the Arrangement is in the best interests of First
Majestic and approved the execution of the Arrangement Agreement. The First Majestic Board also resolved that it would
recommend that the First Majestic Shareholders vote for the First Majestic Resolution.
Throughout the weekend of July 25 and 26, 2015, respective management and legal counsel of SilverCrest and First
Majestic finalized the Arrangement Agreement. The Arrangement Agreement and the Lock-up Agreement were executed
over the course of the weekend and the Arrangement was publicly announced prior to the open of markets on July 27, 2015.
- 50 -
Recommendation of the SilverCrest Board
The SilverCrest Board, having taken into account the SilverCrest Fairness Opinion and such other matters as it considered
relevant, including the factors set out below under the heading “Reasons for the Recommendation of the SilverCrest Board”,
and, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, has unanimously determined that the Arrangement is in the best
interests of SilverCrest and is fair to SilverCrest Shareholders and SilverCrest Optionholders.
Each member of the SilverCrest Board is required by the Lock-up Agreement to vote all SilverCrest Shares held (including
any SilverCrest Shares issued upon any exercise of SilverCrest Options) for the Arrangement Resolution, subject to the
terms of the Arrangement Agreement and the Lock-up Agreement.
Accordingly, the SilverCrest Board unanimously approved the Arrangement and unanimously recommends that
SilverCrest Shareholders vote FOR the Arrangement Resolution. In the absence of a contrary instruction, the
persons designated by management of SilverCrest in the enclosed form of proxy intend to vote FOR the approval
of the Arrangement Resolution.
Reasons for the Recommendation of the SilverCrest Board
The SilverCrest Board reviewed and considered a significant amount of information including a number of factors relating to
the Arrangement with the benefit of advice from SilverCrest’s senior management and financial and legal advisors. The
following is a summary of the principal reasons for the unanimous conclusion of the SilverCrest Board that the Arrangement
is in the best interests of SilverCrest and is fair to the SilverCrest Shareholders and the SilverCrest Optionholders, the
unanimous determination of the SilverCrest Board to approve the Arrangement and authorize its submission to the
SilverCrest Shareholders and to the Court for approval, and the unanimous recommendation of the SilverCrest Board that
SilverCrest Shareholders vote FOR the Arrangement Resolution.
(a)
Significant Premium to SilverCrest Shareholders. First Majestic has offered SilverCrest Shareholders a significant
premium to the SilverCrest Share price. Before ascribing any value to the New SilverCrest Shares, the Consideration to
be received by the SilverCrest Shareholders, represents a premium of approximately 35% based on the closing price on
the TSX of the First Majestic Shares and the SilverCrest Shares on July 24, 2015 (being the last trading day prior to the
announcement of the Arrangement) and a premium of approximately 37% to the volume weighted average price of the
SilverCrest Shares on the TSX for the 30-day period ending on July 24, 2015.
(b)
Benefits of Owning First Majestic Shares. The First Majestic Shares to be received by SilverCrest Shareholders in the
Arrangement offer SilverCrest Shareholders the following:
(i) an opportunity to own shares in a high-quality, leading silver producer;
(ii) access to First Majestic’s operational and underground mining expertise;
(iii)
diversification of SilverCrest’s single asset risk profile by providing exposure to First Majestic’s broad portfolio of
Mexican assets; and
(iv)
enhanced capital markets presence with a pro forma market capitalization in excess of C$685,000,000 based on the
market capitalizations of First Majestic and SilverCrest on July 24, 2015 (the last trading day prior to announcement of
the Arrangement Agreement) with increased analyst coverage, trading liquidity and a broader institutional investor base
compared to that of SilverCrest.
(c)
Continued Participation by SilverCrest Shareholders in the Santa Elena Mine and the La Joya Property. SilverCrest
Shareholders, through their ownership of First Majestic Shares, will continue to participate in the value associated with
the operation and further development of the Santa Elena Mine and the exploration and potential development of the La
Joya Project.
- 51 -
(d)
Continued Participation by SilverCrest Shareholders in the New SilverCrest Exploration Properties Through New
SilverCrest. SilverCrest Shareholders, through their ownership of New SilverCrest Shares, will participate in the
opportunities associated with the SilverCrest Transferred Properties and the First Majestic Transferred Property, and will
have the benefit of SilverCrest management’s exploration expertise.
(g)
Fairness Opinion. SilverCrest’s financial advisor, National Bank Financial, provided its opinion to the SilverCrest Board
to the effect that, as of July 26, 2015, and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications set out in the
SilverCrest Fairness Opinion, the Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the SilverCrest Shareholders.
See “SilverCrest Fairness Opinion”.
(h)
Alternatives to the Arrangement. Prior to entering into the Arrangement Agreement, SilverCrest evaluated business and
strategic opportunities with the objective of maximizing shareholder value in a manner consistent with the best interests
of SilverCrest. As part of that process, SilverCrest entered into a number of confidentiality agreements with various
mining companies over the past several years in order to allow for preliminary discussions to occur regarding potential
transactions to maximize shareholder value and established an electronic data room to allow such companies to conduct
due diligence. The SilverCrest Board, with the assistance of its legal and financial advisors, assessed the alternatives
reasonably available to SilverCrest and determined that the Arrangement represents the best current prospect for
maximizing shareholder value.
Likelihood of the Arrangement Being Completed. The likelihood of the Arrangement being completed is considered by the
SilverCrest Board to be high in light of the experience, reputation and financial capability of First Majestic and SilverCrest
(i)and the absence of significant closing conditions outside the control of the parties, other than necessary shareholder,
court and regulatory approvals and exercise of Dissent Rights.
(l)
Tax Deferred Rollover. SilverCrest Shareholders who are Eligible Holders and who properly complete and file the
required Section 85 Election will benefit from a tax deferred rollover under the Tax Act in respect of any capital gains that
would otherwise be realized on the disposition of the SilverCrest Shares. See “Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax
Considerations”.
(l)
Other Factors. The SilverCrest Board also considered the Arrangement with reference to the financial condition and
results of operations of SilverCrest, as well as its prospects, strategic alternatives and competitive position, including the
risks involved in achieving those prospects and following those alternatives in light of current market conditions and
SilverCrest’s financial position.
In the course of its deliberations, the SilverCrest Board also identified and considered a variety of risks and potentially
negative factors relating to the Arrangement including those matters described under the heading “Risk Factors”. After
carefully considering such risks and potentially negative factors, the SilverCrest Board unanimously concluded, in their
business judgement, that the potentially positive factors related to the Arrangement substantially outweighed the potentially
negative factors.
In making its determinations and recommendations, the SilverCrest Board also identified and considered a number of
procedural safeguards that were, and are present to permit the SilverCrest Board to represent effectively the interests of
SilverCrest, minority SilverCrest Shareholders and SilverCrest’s other stakeholders, including among other things:
(a)
Ability to Respond to Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding the limitations contained in the Arrangement Agreement on
SilverCrest’s ability to solicit interest from third parties, the Arrangement Agreement allows SilverCrest to engage in
discussions or negotiations with respect to a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal at any time prior to the
SilverCrest Meeting if the SilverCrest Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal would be reasonably likely, if consummated in accordance with its terms, to
be a Superior Proposal and the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
laws.
- 52 -
(b)
Reasonable Termination Payment. The amount of the Termination Payment payable to First Majestic upon termination
pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement is C$8,000,000. The parties are reciprocally responsible for an
expense reimbursement fee of US$1,000,000 in the event that the Arrangement Agreement is terminated by the other
party under certain circumstances. These payments and fees are within the ranges typical in the market for similar
transactions and the SilverCrest Board does not believe that they constitute a significant deterrent to potential Superior
Proposals. See “The Arrangement Agreement – Termination Payment”.
(c)
Shareholder and Court Approvals. The SilverCrest Board considered the fact that the Arrangement Resolution must be
approved by at least two-thirds of the votes cast on such resolution by the SilverCrest Shareholders present in person or
by proxy at the SilverCrest Meeting and must receive SilverCrest Minority Approval. The SilverCrest Board also
considered the fact that the Arrangement must also be approved by the Court, which will consider the substantive and
procedural fairness of the Arrangement to all SilverCrest Shareholders and SilverCrest Optionholders.
(d)
Dissent Rights. Any Registered SilverCrest Shareholder who opposes the Arrangement may, on strict compliance with
certain conditions, exercise its Dissent Rights and receive the fair value of the Dissent Shares in accordance with the
Arrangement.
The foregoing summary of the information and material factors considered by the SilverCrest Board is not, and is not
intended to be, exhaustive. In view of the complexity, and large number, of factors and information considered in connection
with the evaluation of the Arrangement, the SilverCrest Board, both individually and collectively, did not find it practicable to,
and therefore did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to assign any relative weight to each specific factor or item of information
considered in reaching its conclusion and recommendation. Rather, the SilverCrest Board based its recommendations on
the totality of the information presented to and considered by it. In addition, individual members of the SilverCrest Board
may have given different weight to different factors or items of information.
The foregoing discussion of the information and material factors considered by the SilverCrest Board is forward-looking in
nature. This information should be read in light of the factors described under the section entitled “Forward-Looking
Statements”.
SilverCrest Fairness Opinion
On June 3, 2015, the SilverCrest Board retained National Bank Financial as its financial advisor and to deliver a fairness
opinion to SilverCrest with respect to the Arrangement.
National Bank Financial has delivered the written SilverCrest Fairness Opinion to the effect that, as of July 26, 2015, and
based upon and subject to the scope of the review, analysis undertaken and various assumptions, limitations and
qualifications set forth in its opinion, the Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the SilverCrest Shareholders.
The full text of the SilverCrest Fairness Opinion describing the assumptions made, procedures followed,
information reviewed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by National Bank Financial is
attached as Appendix I hereto and forms part of this Circular. SilverCrest Shareholders are encouraged to read the
SilverCrest Fairness Opinion carefully in its entirety.
The SilverCrest Fairness Opinion addresses the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration and does not
address any other aspect of the Arrangement or any related transaction, including any tax consequences of the
Arrangement to SilverCrest or the SilverCrest Shareholders. The SilverCrest Fairness Opinion was provided for the
exclusive use of the SilverCrest Board and may not be relied upon by any other person. The SilverCrest Fairness Opinion
does not address the relative merits of the Arrangement or any related transaction as compared to other business strategies
or transactions that might be available to SilverCrest or the underlying business decision of SilverCrest to effect the
Arrangement or any related transaction. The SilverCrest Fairness Opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
SilverCrest Shareholder as to how such SilverCrest Shareholder should vote on the Arrangement Resolution, or how to act
with respect to any matters relating to the Arrangement.
- 53 -
The SilverCrest Fairness Opinion was rendered on the basis of the securities markets, economic, financial and general
business conditions prevailing as at July 26, 2015 and on information relating to the subject matter thereof as represented to
National Bank Financial. As set forth in the SilverCrest Fairness Opinion, National Bank Financial has relied upon, and
assumed the completeness, accuracy and fair presentation of all financial and other information, data, advice, opinions, and
representations obtained by National Bank Financial from public sources or provided by or on behalf of SilverCrest.
National Bank Financial was not asked to prepare, and has not prepared, a formal valuation of SilverCrest.
The SilverCrest Fairness Opinion and the financial analyses of National Bank Financial were only one of many factors
considered by the SilverCrest Board in their evaluation of the Arrangement and should not be viewed as determinative of
the views of the SilverCrest Board with respect to the Arrangement or the consideration provided for in the Arrangement.
Under the terms of National Bank Financial’s engagement, SilverCrest has agreed to pay National Bank Financial a
success fee upon completion of the Arrangement and an opinion fee upon delivery of the SilverCrest Fairness Opinion, with
the opinion fee to be fully credited against the success fee. In addition, SilverCrest has agreed to reimburse National Bank
Financial for its reasonable out of pocket expenses, and to indemnify National Bank Financial and related parties against
liabilities relating to, or arising out of, its engagement.
Recommendation of the First Majestic Board
The First Majestic Board, having taken into account the First Majestic Fairness Opinion and such other matters as it
considered relevant, including the factors set out below under the heading “Reasons for the Recommendation of the First
Majestic Board”, and, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, has unanimously determined that the
Arrangement is in the best interests of First Majestic.
Accordingly, the First Majestic Board unanimously approved the Arrangement and unanimously recommends that
First Majestic Shareholders vote FOR the First Majestic Resolution. In the absence of a contrary instruction, the
persons designated by management of First Majestic in the enclosed form of proxy intend to vote FOR the approval
of the First Majestic Resolution.
Reasons for the Recommendation of the First Majestic Board
The First Majestic Board reviewed and considered a significant amount of information including a number of factors relating
to the Arrangement, SilverCrest and its business with the benefit of advice from First Majestic’s senior management and
financial and legal advisors. The following is a summary of the principal reasons for the unanimous conclusion of the First
Majestic Board that the Arrangement is in the best interests of First Majestic, the unanimous determination of the First
Majestic Board to approve the Arrangement and the unanimous recommendation of the First Majestic Board that First
Majestic Shareholders vote FOR the First Majestic Resolution.
(a)
Addition of a Sixth Producing Mine. SilverCrest’s Santa Elena mine adds a sixth producing mine to First Majestic’s broad
portfolio of Mexican projects, enhancing its leading position in Mexico. The completion of the Arrangement is consistent
with First Majestic’s overall business plan, which includes the development of its existing mineral property assets and the
pursuit through acquisition of additional mineral assets which contribute to corporate growth. The Arrangement will
further diversify First Majestic’s production portfolio and exploration potential, as well as its cash flow across a robust
portfolio of producing mines. The strategic addition is expected to add production of approximately 5,200,000 silver
equivalent ounces for the 2016 calendar year, increasing First Majestic’s estimated annual production to approximately
22,300,000 silver equivalent ounces in 2016.
The Arrangement will also increase First Majestic’s reserve and resource base. SilverCrest has reported (i) total probable
reserves of 18,764,000 ounces of contained silver and 295,000 ounces of contained gold, (ii) indicated resources of
3,220,000 ounces of contained silver and 50,000 ounces of contained gold, and (iii) inferred resources of 1,932,000 ounces
of contained silver and 31,000 ounces of contained gold. SilverCrest has estimated the Santa Elena mine to have a
remaining life of eight years, with the potential for additional exploration.
- 54 -
(b)
Additional Low Cost Production. SilverCrest’s reported costs at the Santa Elena mine are lower than many of its peers in
Mexico, with a cash operating cost of US$8.05 per silver equivalent ounce during the quarter ended June 30, 2015. The
combination of the two businesses including the addition of SilverCrest’s highly automated and state of the art Santa
Elena production facility is also expected to provide operational and production synergies with the potential to reduce
operational and production costs further at the Santa Elena mine and First Majestic’s existing properties. Management of
First Majestic has a strong track record of successful integration of similar acquisitions.
(c)
Strengthens Balance Sheet. The Arrangement is expected to add approximately US$33,000,000 in cash and
US$29,000,000 of working capital to First Majestic’s balance sheet to further enhance its financial position. First
Majestic’s net asset value per share, reserves and total resources per share and production per share are expected to
increase with the addition of the Santa Elena mine.
(d)
Reasonable Premium to SilverCrest Shareholders. In consultation with Cormark, First Majestic has determined that the
premium to be paid to the SilverCrest Shareholders is within the range typical in the market for similar transactions.
(e)
Increased Capital Market Presence. Upon completion of the Arrangement, First Majestic will have a broader shareholder
base with expected increased market liquidity and a larger public float than First Majestic presently. As of July 24, 2015
(the last trading day prior to announcement of the Arrangement Agreement), First Majestic had a pro forma market
capitalization of approximately C$685,000,000 (based on the market capitalizations of First Majestic and SilverCrest as
of such date) compared with First Majestic’s then unadjusted market capitalization of approximately C$570,000,000.
(f)
Extensive Due Diligence. First Majestic’s management team, technical services team and its Canadian and Mexican
legal, tax and financial advisors completed a very detailed due diligence review on SilverCrest that included site visits
and a detailed technical review of the Santa Elena project.
(g)
Fairness Opinion. First Majestic’s financial advisor, Cormark, provided its opinion to the First Majestic Board (the “First
Majestic Fairness Opinion”) to the effect that, as of July 24, 2015, and subject to the assumptions, limitations and
qualifications set out in the First Majestic Fairness Opinion, the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view, to First
Majestic. See “First Majestic Fairness Opinion”.
(h)
Other Factors. The First Majestic Board also considered the Arrangement with reference to the current economic, industry
and market trends affecting each of First Majestic and SilverCrest and the silver and gold mining industries in general,
information concerning the business, operations, property, assets, financial condition, operating results and prospects of
each of First Majestic and SilverCrest and the then historical trading prices of the First Majestic Shares and the
SilverCrest Shares.
In the course of its deliberations, the First Majestic Board also identified and considered a variety of risks and potentially
negative factors relating to the Arrangement including those matters described under the heading “Risk Factors”. After
carefully considering such risks and potentially negative factors, the First Majestic Board unanimously concluded, in their
business judgement, that the potentially positive factors related to the Arrangement substantially outweighed the potentially
negative factors.
The foregoing summary of the information and material factors considered by the First Majestic Board is not, and is not
intended to be, exhaustive. In view of the complexity, and large number, of factors and information considered in connection
with the evaluation of the Arrangement, the First Majestic Board, both individually and collectively, did not find it practicable
to, and therefore did not, quantify or otherwise attempt to assign any relative weight to each specific factor or item of
information considered in reaching its conclusion and recommendation. Rather, the First Majestic Board based its
recommendations on the totality of the information presented to and considered by it. In addition, individual members of the
First Majestic Board may have given different weight to different factors or items of information.
- 55 -
The foregoing discussion of the information and material factors considered by the First Majestic Board is forward-looking in
nature. This information should be read in light of the factors described under the section entitled “Forward-Looking
Statements”.
First Majestic Fairness Opinion
On May 9, 2015, the First Majestic Board retained Cormark as its financial advisor and to deliver a fairness opinion to First
Majestic with respect to the Arrangement.
Cormark has delivered the written First Majestic Fairness Opinion to the effect that, as of July 24, 2015, and based upon and
subject to the scope of the review, analysis undertaken and various assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth in
its opinion, the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view, to First Majestic. The full text of the First Majestic
Fairness Opinion describing the assumptions made, procedures followed, information reviewed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Cormark is attached as Appendix J hereto and forms part
of this Circular. First Majestic Shareholders are encouraged to read the First Majestic Fairness Opinion carefully in
its entirety.
The First Majestic Fairness Opinion addresses the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Arrangement and does not
address any other aspect of the Arrangement or any related transaction, including any tax consequences of the
Arrangement to First Majestic or the First Majestic Shareholders. The First Majestic Fairness Opinion was provided for the
exclusive use of the First Majestic Board and may not be relied upon by any other person. The First Majestic Fairness
Opinion does not address the relative merits of the Arrangement or any related transaction as compared to other business
strategies or transactions that might be available to First Majestic or the underlying business decision of First Majestic to
effect the Arrangement or any related transaction. The First Majestic Fairness Opinion does not constitute a
recommendation to any First Majestic Shareholder as to how such First Majestic Shareholder should vote on the First
Majestic Resolution, or how to act with respect to any matters relating to the Arrangement.
The First Majestic Fairness Opinion was rendered on the basis of the securities markets, economic, financial and general
business conditions prevailing as at July 24, 2015 and on information relating to the subject matter thereof as represented to
Cormark. As set forth in the First Majestic Fairness Opinion, Cormark has relied upon, and assumed the completeness,
accuracy and fair presentation of all financial and other information, data, advice, opinions, and representations obtained by
Cormark from public sources or provided by or on behalf of First Majestic. Cormark was not asked to prepare, and has not
prepared, a formal valuation of First Majestic.
The First Majestic Fairness Opinion and the financial analyses of Cormark were only one of many factors considered by the
First Majestic Board in their evaluation of the Arrangement and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the
First Majestic Board with respect to the Arrangement or the consideration provided for in the Arrangement.
Under the terms of Cormark’s engagement, First Majestic has agreed to pay Cormark a success fee upon completion of the
Arrangement and an opinion fee upon delivery of the First Majestic Fairness Opinion, with the opinion fee to be fully
credited against the success fee. In the event that the Arrangement is not completed, First Majestic has agreed to pay
Cormark a portion of any break fee paid to First Majestic. In addition, First Majestic has agreed to reimburse Cormark for its
reasonable out of pocket expenses, and to indemnify Cormark and related parties against liabilities relating to, or arising out
of, its engagement.

SilverCrest Option to purchase from New SilverCrest such number of New SilverCrest Shares as is equal to the New
SilverCrest Exchange Ratio. Each SilverCrest Replacement Option shall provide for an exercise price per SilverCrest
Share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per SilverCrest Share that would otherwise be
payable to acquire a SilverCrest Share pursuant to the SilverCrest Option it replaces. Each New SilverCrest Option shall
provide for an exercise price of C$0.06 per New SilverCrest Share. All terms and conditions of a SilverCrest
Replacement Option or a New SilverCrest Option, including the term to expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising,
will be the same as the SilverCrest Option for which it was exchanged and shall be governed by the terms of the
SilverCrest Option Plan (in the case of SilverCrest Replacement Options) or the New SilverCrest Option Plan (in the

Majestic Replacement Option to purchase from First Majestic such number of First Majestic Shares as is equal to the First
Majestic Exchange Ratio (all resulting fractions to be rounded down to the nearest whole number of First Majestic
Shares). Each First Majestic Replacement Option shall provide for an exercise price per First Majestic Share (rounded up
to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per SilverCrest Share that would otherwise be payable pursuant to
(j)
the SilverCrest Replacement Option it replaces, divided by the First Majestic Exchange Ratio. All terms and conditions of
a First Majestic Replacement Option, including the term to expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising, will be the
same as the SilverCrest Replacement Option for which it was exchanged, and shall be governed by the terms of the First
Majestic Option Plan. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the terms and conditions of the First Majestic Option Plan relating to
accelerated expiry of First Majestic Options on account of early termination after ceasing to hold office or ceasing to be an
employee or consultant shall not apply to the First Majestic Replacement Options, such that there will be no accelerated
expiry of First Majestic Replacement Options on account of early termination after ceasing to hold office or ceasing to be

shall be revised accordingly.
- 58 -
Procedure for the Arrangement to Become Effective
The Arrangement is proposed to be carried out pursuant to Division 5 of Part 9 of the BCBCA. The following procedural
steps must be taken in order for the Arrangement to become effective:
(a) the SilverCrest Shareholder Approval and the First Majestic Shareholder Approval must be obtained;
(b)
the Court must grant the Final Order approving the Arrangement; and
(c)
all other conditions precedent to the Arrangement further described in the Arrangement Agreement including receipt of
necessary regulatory approvals must be satisfied or waived by the appropriate party.
SilverCrest Shareholder Approval
At the SilverCrest Meeting, SilverCrest Shareholders will be asked to approve the Arrangement Resolution, in the form set
out in Appendix A attached to this Circular. The approval of the Arrangement Resolution will require the affirmative vote of at
least two-thirds of the votes cast on such resolution by SilverCrest Shareholders present in person or by proxy at the
SilverCrest Meeting.
In addition, in accordance with MI 61-101, the Arrangement Resolution must also receive SilverCrest Minority Approval. The
Arrangement is considered a “business combination” subject to the requirements of MI 61-101 because the SilverCrest
Executive Shareholders will receive “collateral benefits” (as defined in MI 61-101) upon completion of the Arrangement in
respect of “change of control” payments pursuant to their respective management consulting agreements with SilverCrest.
Each of the SilverCrest Executive Shareholders may, therefore, be considered an “interested party” (as defined in MI 61-
101) to the Arrangement and, accordingly, the votes attaching to the SilverCrest Shares held by each of the SilverCrest
Executive Shareholders will be excluded in determining “minority approval” (as defined in MI 61-101) of the Arrangement
Resolution. See “Regulatory Matters – MI 61-101”.
First Majestic Shareholder Approval
Pursuant to the rules of the TSX, the First Majestic Resolution requires the approval of at least a simple majority of the votes
cast on such resolution by First Majestic Shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the First Majestic
Meeting because the number of First Majestic Shares being issued or issuable under the Arrangement exceeds 25% of the
number of First Majestic Shares which are currently outstanding. First Majestic expects to issue up to an aggregate of
35,795,750 First Majestic Shares pursuant to the Arrangement, which is equal to approximately 29.3% of the First Majestic
Shares that were issued and outstanding as of the date of the Arrangement Agreement.
Pursuant to the rules of the NYSE, the First Majestic Resolution requires the approval of at least a simple majority of the
votes cast on such resolution by First Majestic Shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the First Majestic
Meeting because the number of First Majestic Shares being issued or issuable under the Arrangement exceeds 20% of the
number of First Majestic Shares which are currently outstanding.
Accordingly, to be effective, the First Majestic Resolution must be approved, with or without variation, by the affirmative vote
of a majority of the votes cast on such resolution by First Majestic Shareholders present in person or represented by proxy
and entitled to vote at the First Majestic Meeting.
Lock-up Agreement
On July 26, 2015, in connection with the execution of the Arrangement Agreement, each of the Locked-up Shareholders
entered into the Lock-up Agreement with First Majestic. As at the date of the Lock-up Agreement, the Locked-up
Shareholders collectively beneficially owned or exercised control or direction over, in aggregate, 4,658,530 SilverCrest
Shares and 6,475,000 SilverCrest Options, representing 3.9% of the outstanding SilverCrest Shares (on a non-diluted
basis), and 8.6% of the SilverCrest Shares on a fully diluted basis.
Under the terms of the Lock-up Agreement, each of the Locked-up Shareholders has severally agreed, subject to the terms
of the Lock-up Agreement, among other things, to vote all of the SilverCrest Shares held by the Lock-up Shareholder for the
Arrangement Resolution. The following is a summary of the principal terms of the Lock-up Agreement:
- 59 -
Except as otherwise noted below or in the Lock-up Agreement, each Lock-up Shareholder has covenanted and agreed that
it will:

contemplated and any actions required in furtherance thereof or otherwise contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement;
(b)
cause its Owned Securities to be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum at the SilverCrest Meeting;
and
(c)
vote all of its Owned Securities against the following actions (other than pursuant to the Arrangement): (i) any acquisition
proposal or merger, takeover bid, amalgamation, plan of arrangement, business combination or similar transaction
involving SilverCrest, other than the Arrangement; (ii) any reorganization, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or
winding up of SilverCrest or any of its subsidiaries; (iii) any amendment of SilverCrest’s notice of articles or articles that
would reasonably be regarded as being directed towards or likely to prevent, delay, impede or interfere with the
consummation of the Arrangement; (iv) any action or transaction that would result in a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement of SilverCrest under the Arrangement Agreement; or (v) any other action or transaction
that would reasonably be regarded as being directed towards or likely to prevent, delay, impede or interfere with the
consummation of the Arrangement.
Except as otherwise noted below or in the Lock-up Agreement, each Lock-up Shareholder has covenanted and agreed that
it will not:
(a)
and will not permit any of its affiliates to, grant any proxies or powers of attorney, or any other authorization or consent

any class action with respect to any claim, derivative or otherwise, against SilverCrest or any of its subsidiaries (or any of
their respective successors, including, without limitation, First Majestic) or any of their respective directors or officers
relating to the negotiation, execution and delivery of the Arrangement Agreement, the Lock-up Agreement or the
Arrangement or alleging oppression or a breach of any fiduciary duty of any person in connection with the negotiation and
entry into the Arrangement Agreement;

encourage the making of, or cooperate in any way regarding, any Acquisition Proposal;
(k)

acquire additional SilverCrest Shares (ii) sell, transfer, gift, assign or otherwise dispose of any such additional SilverCrest

Shareholder to vote or cause to be voted all its Owned Securities for the Arrangement, (B) prompt written notice of such
transfer is provided to First Majestic, (C) the transferee agrees to be bound by the terms hereof pursuant to documentation
approved in writing by First Majestic in advance of such transfer and (D) the transferee continues to be a corporation or
other entity directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the Lock-up Shareholder or under common control with or
controlling the Lock-up Shareholder, at all times prior to the effective date of the Arrangement and agrees that, if such
transferee ceases to be so controlled, it will immediately transfer such Owned Securities back to the transferor;
(l)
grant or enter into with any person any agreement or option, right or privilege (whether by law, pre-emptive or contractual)
capable of becoming an agreement or option, for the exchange, acquisition or transfer from the Lock-up Shareholder of
any Owned Securities or any right or interest thereto; and
(m) allow any of its Owned Securities to become subject to any encumbrances.
The Lock-up Agreement will terminate on the earliest of: (a) First Majestic providing written notice of termination to the
Locked-up Shareholders; (b) the termination of the Arrangement Agreement in accordance with its terms; (c) the Effective
Time of the Arrangement; and (d) as agreed by First Majestic and SilverCrest in accordance with the terms of the
Arrangement Agreement.
Court Approval and Completion of the Arrangement
The Arrangement requires approval of the Court under the BCBCA. Prior to the mailing of this Circular, SilverCrest obtained
the Interim Order, which provides for the calling and holding of the SilverCrest Meeting, the Dissent Rights and other
procedural matters. A copy of the Interim Order is attached as Appendix K to this Circular.
Subject to approval of the Arrangement Resolution by SilverCrest Shareholders at the SilverCrest Meeting and approval of
the First Majestic Resolution by First Majestic Shareholders at the First Majestic Meeting, the hearing in respect of the Final
Order is currently scheduled to take place on September 30, 2015 in the Court at 800 Smithe Street, Vancouver, British
Columbia, at 9:45 a.m.
Any SilverCrest Shareholder or other person who wishes to appear, or to be represented, and to present evidence or
arguments must serve and file an appearance (“Appearance”) as set out in the Notice of Hearing of Petition for Final Order
and satisfy any other requirements of the Court. A copy of the Notice of Hearing of Petition for Final Order is attached as
Appendix L to this Circular. The Court will consider, among other things, the fairness and reasonableness of the
Arrangement to those to whom securities will be issued. The Court may approve the Arrangement in any manner the Court
may direct, subject to compliance with any terms and conditions, if any, as the Court deems fit. In the event that the hearing
is postponed, adjourned or re-scheduled then, subject to further order of the Court, only those persons having previously
served an Appearance in compliance with the Notice of Hearing of Petition for Final Order and the Interim Order will be
given notice of the postponement, adjournment or re-scheduled date.
- 61 -
The Court has been informed that the Final Order will constitute the basis for the Section 3(a)(10) Exemption with respect to,
among other things, First Majestic securities and the New SilverCrest securities to be issued pursuant to the Arrangement
as described under “United States Securities Law Matters”. Assuming the Final Order is granted and the other conditions to
closing contained in the Arrangement Agreement are satisfied or waived to the extent legally permissible, then the parties
will proceed to effect the Arrangement.
Although the objective of SilverCrest and First Majestic is to have the Effective Date occur as soon as possible after the
SilverCrest Meeting, the Effective Date could be delayed for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an objection
before the Court at the hearing of the application for the Final Order or any delay in obtaining any required regulatory
approvals or clearances. SilverCrest or First Majestic may determine not to complete the Arrangement without prior notice to
or action on the part of SilverCrest Shareholders or First Majestic Shareholders. See “The Arrangement Agreement –
Termination”.
Stock Exchange Listing and Reporting Issuer Status
The First Majestic Shares currently trade on the TSX under the symbol “FR” and on the NYSE under “AG”. First Majestic
has applied to the TSX and the NYSE to list the First Majestic Shares issuable: (i) under the Arrangement and (ii) upon the
exercise of the First Majestic Replacement Options. It is a condition of closing that First Majestic will have obtained approval
of the TSX, subject only to the customary listing conditions of the TSX, and of the NYSE, subject to fulfilling the
requirements of the NYSE. First Majestic is a reporting issuer in each of the provinces of Canada and a registrant under the
U.S. Exchange Act.
Following completion of the Arrangement, it is expected that the SilverCrest Shares will be delisted from the TSX and
NYSE MKT and SilverCrest will make an application to cease to be a reporting issuer under applicable securities laws in
British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and
Newfoundland. In addition, it is anticipated that First Majestic will cause SilverCrest to file a Form 15 with the SEC pursuant
to U.S. Exchange Act Rule 12g-4 and thereby terminate SilverCrest’s registration under section 12(g) and suspend
SilverCrest’s reporting obligations under section 13(a) of the U.S. Exchange Act.
New SilverCrest intends to file an application with the TSX-V for listing of the New SilverCrest Shares, including those
issuable to SilverCrest Shareholders and to First Majestic pursuant to the Arrangement and those issuable upon exercise of
New SilverCrest Replacement Options. There can be no assurance as to if, or when, the New SilverCrest Shares will be
listed or traded. It is not a condition of the Arrangement that any stock exchange shall have approved the listing of the New
SilverCrest Shares. Unless and until such a listing is obtained, New SilverCrest Shareholders may not have a market for the
New SilverCrest Shares. Upon completion of the Arrangement, New SilverCrest expects that it will become a reporting
issuer in each province in Canada in which SilverCrest is a reporting issuer, but will not be a registrant under the
U.S. Exchange Act.
Letter of Transmittal
The Letter of Transmittal is enclosed with this Circular for use by Registered SilverCrest Shareholders. In order for
Registered SilverCrest Shareholders to receive the First Majestic Shares, New SilverCrest Shares and cash which such
SilverCrest Shareholder is entitled to under the Arrangement, the Registered SilverCrest Shareholder is required to forward
a completed and signed Letter of Transmittal and surrender its SilverCrest Shares and, where issued, SilverCrest Share
certificates. The details for the surrender of SilverCrest Shares and, where issued, SilverCrest Share certificates, to the
Depositary and the addresses of the Depositary are set out in the Letter of Transmittal. Provided that a Registered
SilverCrest Shareholder has delivered and surrendered to the Depositary (i) a properly completed and duly executed Letter
of Transmittal, (ii) SilverCrest Share certificates (where issued) and (iii) such additional documents as the Depositary may
reasonably require in respect of the exchange of SilverCrest Shares, the Registered SilverCrest Shareholder will be entitled
to receive, and First Majestic and New SilverCrest will cause the Depositary to respectively deliver to the Registered
SilverCrest Shareholder, (a) certificates or DRS Advice Statements representing the number of First Majestic Shares and a
cheque for the cash payment issuable or deliverable to such holder as Consideration pursuant to the Arrangement, and
(b) certificates or DRS Advice Statements representing the number of New SilverCrest Shares issuable or deliverable
pursuant to the Arrangement.
- 62 -
Where SilverCrest Shares are evidenced only by a DRS Advice Statement, there is no requirement to first obtain a share
certificate for those SilverCrest Shares or deposit with the Depositary any SilverCrest Share certificate or DRS Advice
Statement evidencing those SilverCrest Shares. Only a properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal is
required to be delivered to the Depositary in order to surrender those SilverCrest Shares under the Arrangement.
Any use of the mail to transmit a certificate (if applicable) for SilverCrest Shares and a related Letter of Transmittal is at the
risk of the SilverCrest Shareholder. If these documents are mailed, it is recommended that registered mail, properly insured,
be used. Whether or not SilverCrest Shareholders forward the certificate(s) (if applicable) representing their SilverCrest
Shares, upon completion of the Arrangement on the Effective Date, SilverCrest Shareholders will cease to be SilverCrest
Shareholders as of the Effective Date and will only be entitled to receive such First Majestic Shares, New SilverCrest
Shares and cash to which they are entitled under the Arrangement or, in the case of SilverCrest Shareholders who properly
exercise Dissent Rights, the right to receive fair value for their SilverCrest Shares in accordance with the dissent
procedures. See “Rights of Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholders”.
The Depositary will act as the agent of persons who have surrendered SilverCrest Shares pursuant to the Arrangement for
the purpose of receiving the Consideration from First Majestic and the New SilverCrest Shares from New SilverCrest and
transmitting same to such persons, and receipt of the Consideration and the New SilverCrest Shares by the Depositary will
be deemed to constitute receipt of payment by persons surrendering SilverCrest Shares.
Settlement with persons who surrender SilverCrest Shares pursuant to the Arrangement will be effected by the Depositary
forwarding by first class insured mail, postage prepaid certificate(s) or DRS Advice Statement(s) representing First Majestic
Shares and New SilverCrest Shares to be issued in exchange and a cheque for the cash portion of the Consideration.
Unless otherwise directed in the Letter of Transmittal, the certificates or DRS Advice Statements representing the First
Majestic Shares and the New SilverCrest Shares and cheque for the cash portion of the Consideration will be issued in the
name of the registered holder of SilverCrest Shares so surrendered. Unless the person who surrenders SilverCrest Shares
instructs the Depositary to hold the share certificates and cheques for pick up by checking the appropriate box in the Letter
of Transmittal, certificates or DRS Advice Statements and cheques will be forwarded by first class insured mail to the
addresses supplied in the Letter of Transmittal. If no address is provided, certificates and cheques will be forwarded to the
address of the person as shown on the share register of SilverCrest.
Entitlement to Cash Consideration
In any case where the aggregate cash consideration payable to a SilverCrest Shareholder under the Arrangement would (a)
be less than one cent, then the aggregate cash consideration payable to such SilverCrest Shareholder will be rounded up
to one cent; or (b) be at least one cent, but including a fraction of a cent, then the aggregate cash consideration payable to
such SilverCrest Shareholder will be rounded down to the nearest whole cent.
Treatment of Fractional Shares
No fractional First Majestic Shares or fractional New SilverCrest Shares will be issued to SilverCrest Shareholders pursuant
to the Arrangement. The number of First Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares to be received by a SilverCrest
Shareholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole First Majestic Share and nearest whole New SilverCrest Share
and no cash or other consideration will be paid to such SilverCrest Shareholder in lieu of the issuance of any fractional First
Majestic Share or fractional New SilverCrest Share.
- 63 -
Return of SilverCrest Share Certificates
If the Arrangement is not completed, any deposited SilverCrest Shares will be returned to the depositing SilverCrest
Shareholder at SilverCrest’s expense upon written notice to the Depositary from SilverCrest, by returning the deposited
SilverCrest Shares (and any other relevant documents) by first class insured mail in the name of and to the address
specified by the SilverCrest Shareholder in the Letter of Transmittal or, if such name and address is not so specified, in such
name and to such address as shown on the register maintained by the Transfer Agent.
Lost Certificates
A SilverCrest Shareholder who has lost or misplaced SilverCrest Share certificates (where issued) should complete the
Letter of Transmittal as fully as possible and forward it to the Depositary together with a letter explaining the loss or
misplacement. The Depositary will assist in making arrangements for the necessary affidavit (which will include a bonding
requirement) for receipt of the Consideration and the New SilverCrest Shares in accordance with the Arrangement.
If any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more outstanding SilverCrest Shares that
were transferred pursuant to Section 2.3 of the Plan of Arrangement shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary shall
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the consideration that such holder is entitled to receive in
accordance with Section 2.3 of the Plan of Arrangement. When authorizing such delivery of the consideration that such
holder is entitled to receive in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the holder shall, as a condition
precedent to the delivery of such consideration, give a bond satisfactory to First Majestic, SilverCrest, New SilverCrest and
the Depositary in such amount as First Majestic and New SilverCrest may direct, or otherwise indemnify First Majestic,
SilverCrest, New SilverCrest and the Depositary in a manner satisfactory to First Majestic, SilverCrest, New SilverCrest and
the Depositary, against any claim that may be made against First Majestic, SilverCrest, New SilverCrest and the Depositary
with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
Cancellation of Rights after Three Years
Any SilverCrest Share, and any SilverCrest Share certificate which immediately before the Effective Date
represented SilverCrest Shares and which has not been surrendered to the Depositary with a properly completed
and duly executed Letter of Transmittal, with all other documents required by the Depositary, on or before the third
anniversary of the Effective Date, will cease to represent any claim against or interest of any kind or nature in
SilverCrest, First Majestic, New SilverCrest or the Depositary. Accordingly, persons who tender letters of transmittal in
respect of the surrender of SilverCrest Shares pursuant to the Arrangement, and certificates for SilverCrest Shares (where
issued) after the third anniversary of the Effective Date will not receive the Consideration from First Majestic or the New
SilverCrest Shares, will not own any interest in First Majestic or New SilverCrest, and will not receive any securities or be
paid any cash or other compensation.
Withholding Rights
First Majestic, SilverCrest, New SilverCrest or the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable under the Plan of Arrangement and from all dividends or other distributions
otherwise payable to any former securityholders of SilverCrest, such amounts as First Majestic, SilverCrest, New
SilverCrest or the Depositary may be required to deduct and withhold therefrom any provision of any applicable law in
respect of taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, deducted and remitted, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes hereof as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.
Right to Dissent
Under the Interim Order, Registered SilverCrest Shareholders are entitled to Dissent Rights but only if they follow the
procedures specified in the BCBCA, as modified by Article 3 of the Plan of Arrangement, the Interim Order and the Final
Order. See “Rights of Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholders”.
- 64 -
First Majestic Shareholders are not entitled to Dissent Rights in respect of the Arrangement or the First Majestic Resolution.
Delivery Requirements
The method of delivery of share certificates, the Letter of Transmittal and all other required documents is at the option and
risk of the SilverCrest Shareholder surrendering them. SilverCrest recommends that such documents be delivered by hand
to the Depositary, at the office noted in the Letter of Transmittal, and a receipt obtained therefor, or, if mailed, that registered
mail, with return receipt requested, be used and that proper insurance be obtained. SilverCrest Shareholders holding
SilverCrest Shares which are registered in the name of an Intermediary (such as a bank, trust company, securities dealer or
broker, or the trustee or administrator of a self-administered registered retirement savings plan, registered education savings
plan or similar plan) must contact such Intermediary to arrange for the surrender of their share certificates.
Interests of Certain Persons in the Arrangement
In considering the recommendation of the SilverCrest Board with respect to the Arrangement, SilverCrest Shareholders
should be aware that certain members of the SilverCrest Board and of SilverCrest’s management have interests in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement that may create actual or potential conflicts of interest in
connection with such transactions, details of which are set out below. The SilverCrest Board is aware of these interests and
considered them along with the other matters described above in “Reasons for the Recommendation of the SilverCrest
Board”.

The information as to securities of First Majestic beneficially owned or controlled or directed, directly or indirectly, not
being within the knowledge of First Majestic, has been furnished by the respective persons or obtained at www.sedi.ca.
Immediately after giving effect to the Arrangement, it is anticipated that the currently proposed directors and officers of First
Majestic post-Arrangement and their associates and affiliates, as a group, will beneficially own, directly or indirectly, or
exercise control or direction over, an aggregate of approximately 3.08% of the First Majestic Shares which are expected to
be outstanding upon completion of the Arrangement. See “Appendix F – Information Concerning First Majestic Post-
Arrangement — Directors and Executive Officers of First Majestic”.
The directors and certain officers of SilverCrest entered into the Lock-up Agreement with First Majestic pursuant to which
they agreed to vote their SilverCrest Shares for the Arrangement Resolution. See “Lock-up Agreement”.
Termination and Change of Control Benefits
SilverCrest has entered into certain management consulting agreements with companies controlled by the executive
officers listed below that grant certain benefits upon the consulting company upon the occurrence of a “change of control”
(as defined below) which will occur upon the completion of the Arrangement. Pursuant to each management consulting
agreement, SilverCrest is to pay to the consulting company an amount equal to two times of both the then applicable base
rate per annum payable to the consulting company and any bonus paid or payable to the consulting company in respect of
SilverCrest’s most recent financial year. The following table displays the amounts payable to each officer named below in
the event of a termination of the officer’s respective consulting agreement with SilverCrest within six months of a change of
control or a resignation within three months of a change of control:

Payable in the event of termination within six months of a change of control or resignation within three months of a
change of control.
For the purposes of the management consulting agreements, “change of control” means an occurrence (a) where less than
51% of the SilverCrest Board are composed of continuing directors; or (b) where any person or persons acting jointly or in
concert acquires more than 50% of the total voting rights attached to all classes of shares then outstanding in SilverCrest
having under all circumstances the right to vote on any resolution concerning the election of directors (a “Takeover”). For
the purposes of the management consulting agreements, a “continuing director” is a member of the SilverCrest Board on the
day preceding the date of a Takeover, or a person who becomes a member of the SilverCrest Board subsequent to the date
of the particular management consulting agreement by the approval of at least a majority of the members of the SilverCrest
Board who were members of the SilverCrest Board on the day preceding the date of a Takeover.
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Officers
Pursuant to the Arrangement, First Majestic has agreed that, unless prohibited by applicable laws, all rights to
indemnification or exculpation in favour of the current and former directors and officers of SilverCrest and any SilverCrest
Subsidiary provided in the current articles or by-laws (or the equivalent) of SilverCrest or any SilverCrest Subsidiary, or in
any agreement disclosed to First Majestic, and any directors’ and officers’ insurance now existing in favour of the directors
or officers of SilverCrest and any SilverCrest Subsidiary will survive the completion of the Arrangement (or be replaced with
substantially equivalent coverage from another provider of at least equivalent standing to the current provider) and shall
continue in full force and effect (either directly or via run-off insurance or insurance provided by an alternative provider of at
least equivalent standing to the current provider) for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Date. SilverCrest
may purchase run-off directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, at a cost not exceeding 200% of SilverCrest’s current annual
aggregate premium for directors’ and officers’ liability policies currently maintained by SilverCrest, providing coverage for a
period of up to six years from the Effective Date with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events which occur
on or prior to the Effective Date. In addition, SilverCrest may enter into indemnification agreements (in a form acceptable to
First Majestic) with each director and officer of SilverCrest and each of the SilverCrest Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Date. First Majestic has also agreed that from and after the Effective Date it will cause SilverCrest to honour all rights to
indemnification or exculpation in such agreements in favour of present and former officers and directors of SilverCrest and
acknowledges that such rights will survive the Effective Date and will continue in full force and effect for a period of not less
than six years from the Effective Date.
Intention of SilverCrest Directors and Officers
All of the SilverCrest directors and certain officers, who collectively beneficially owned or exercised control or direction over
in the aggregate 4,658,530 SilverCrest Shares and 6,475,000 SilverCrest Options, representing 3.92% of the outstanding
SilverCrest Shares on a non-diluted basis, and 8.61% of the outstanding SilverCrest Shares on a fully-diluted basis, as of
the Record Date, have each agreed with First Majestic under the Lock-up Agreement that, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, to vote their SilverCrest Shares for the Arrangement Resolution. In addition, the other officers of
SilverCrest, who beneficially owned or exercised control or direction over in the aggregate 249,000 SilverCrest Shares and
2,370,000 SilverCrest Options representing approximately 0.21% of the SilverCrest Shares on a non-diluted basis, or 2.02%
of the outstanding SilverCrest Shares on a fully-diluted basis, as of the Record Date, have advised SilverCrest of their
intention to vote for the Arrangement Resolution.
- 68 -
Intention of First Majestic Directors and Officers
All of the First Majestic directors and officers, who beneficially owned or exercised control or direction over in the aggregate
4,811,656 First Majestic Shares and 4,022,763 First Majestic Options, representing 3.94% of the outstanding First Majestic
Shares on a non-diluted basis, and 6.74% of the outstanding First Majestic Shares on a fully-diluted basis, as of the Record
Date, have advised First Majestic of their intention to vote for the First Majestic Resolution.
Depositary
SilverCrest and First Majestic have retained the services of the Depositary for the receipt of the Letter of Transmittal and the
certificates (if applicable) representing SilverCrest Shares and for the delivery of the First Majestic Shares and cash and the
New SilverCrest Shares in exchange for the SilverCrest Shares under the Arrangement. The Depositary will receive
reasonable and customary compensation for its services in connection with the Arrangement, will be reimbursed for certain
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will be indemnified against certain liabilities, including liabilities under securities
laws and expenses in connection therewith.
Expenses of the Arrangement
SilverCrest, First Majestic and New SilverCrest have agreed in the Arrangement Agreement that each party will pay its
respective legal and accounting costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation, execution and
delivery of the Arrangement Agreement and all documents and instruments executed pursuant to the Arrangement
Agreement.
Regulatory Matters
Canadian Securities Law Matters
Distribution and Resale of First Majestic Shares
The First Majestic Shares to be issued in exchange for SilverCrest Shares pursuant to the Arrangement will be issued in
reliance upon exemptions from the prospectus requirements of securities legislation in each province and territory of
Canada. Subject to restrictions under applicable securities laws applicable to distributions of shares that constitute “control
distributions”, the First Majestic Shares issued pursuant to the Arrangement may be resold in each province and territory in
Canada.
Distribution and Resale of New SilverCrest Shares
The New SilverCrest Shares to be distributed to former SilverCrest Shareholders pursuant to the Arrangement will be
issued in reliance upon exemptions from the prospectus requirements of securities legislation in each province and territory
of Canada. Subject to restrictions under applicable securities laws applicable to distributions of shares that constitute
“control distributions”, the New SilverCrest Shares issued pursuant to the Arrangement may be resold in each province and
territory in Canada.
MI 61-101
MI 61-101 regulates certain types of transactions to ensure equality of treatment among securityholders and may require
enhanced disclosure, approval by a majority of security holders (excluding “interested parties” under applicable law),
independent valuations and, in certain instances, approval and oversight of certain transactions by a special committee of
independent directors. The protections afforded by MI 61-101 apply to, among other transactions, “related party
transactions” (as defined in MI 61-101), being transactions with a “related party” (as defined in MI 61-101), and “business
combinations”’ (as defined in MI 61-101) which may terminate the interests of securityholders without their consent.
- 69 -
MI 61-101 provides that where a “related party” of an issuer is entitled to receive a “collateral benefit” (as defined in MI 61-
101) in connection with an arrangement transaction (such as the Arrangement) which would result in the termination of the
interests of securityholders without their consent, such transaction is considered a “business combination” for the purposes
of MI 61-101. A “collateral benefit” (as defined under MI 61-101) includes any benefit that a “related party” of SilverCrest
(which includes the directors and senior officers of SilverCrest) is entitled to receive as a consequence of the Arrangement,
including, without limitation, an increase in salary, a lump sum payment, a payment for surrendering securities, or other
enhancement in benefits related to past or future services as an employee, director or consultant of SilverCrest. However,
MI 61-101 excludes from the meaning of “collateral benefit” certain benefits to a related party received solely in connection
with the related party’s services as an employee, director or consultant of an issuer or an affiliated entity of the issuer or a
successor to the business of the issuer where, among other things, (a) the benefit is not conferred for the purpose, in whole
or in part, of increasing the value of the consideration paid to the related party for securities relinquished under the
transaction, (b) the conferring of the benefit is not, by its terms, conditional on the related party supporting the transaction in
any manner, (c) full particulars of the benefit are disclosed in the disclosure document for the transaction, and (d)(i) at the
time the transaction was agreed to, the related party and its associated entities beneficially own or exercise control or
direction over less than 1% of the outstanding shares of the issuer or (ii) an independent committee, acting in good faith,
determines that the value of the collateral benefit, net of any offsetting costs to the related party, is less than 5% of the value
of the consideration the related party expects to receive in exchange for the related party’s equity securities under the terms
of the Arrangement.
MI 61-101 requires that, in addition to any other required securityholder approval, a business combination is subject to
“minority approval” (as defined in MI 61-101). In relation to the Arrangement and for purposes of the required SilverCrest
Shareholder approval for the Arrangement, the “minority” shareholders of SilverCrest are all SilverCrest Shareholders other
than (i) SilverCrest, (ii) any interested party to the Arrangement within the meaning of MI 61-101, (iii) any related party to
such interested party within the meaning of MI 61-101 (subject to the exceptions set out therein), and (iv) any person that is
a joint actor with a person referred to in the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii) for the purposes of MI 61-101.
As described below, the SilverCrest Executive Shareholders are interested parties in connection with the Arrangement and
are entitled to receive a “collateral benefit” such that any SilverCrest Shares beneficially owned, or over which control or
direction is exercised by the SilverCrest Executive Shareholders or any of their joint actors must be excluded for purposes
of determining whether the SilverCrest Minority Approval has been obtained.
To the knowledge of the directors and executive officers of SilverCrest, after reasonable inquiry, SilverCrest has determined
that:
As of the Record Date, Mr. Drever owned beneficially or exercised control or direction over 1,498,326 SilverCrest Shares,
·
which represent approximately 1.26% of the issued and outstanding SilverCrest Shares as of the Record Date.
As of the Record Date, Mr. Fier owned beneficially or exercised control or direction over 1,278,977 SilverCrest Shares,
·
which represent approximately 1.08% of the issued and outstanding SilverCrest Shares as of the Record Date.
As of the Record Date, Mr. Magnusson owned beneficially or exercised control or direction over 1,625,727 SilverCrest
·
Shares, which represent approximately 1.37% of the issued and outstanding SilverCrest Shares as of the Record Date.
- 70 -
For the purposes of MI 61-101, each of Messrs. Drever, Fier and Magnusson is considered to beneficially own more than
1% of the SilverCrest Shares and SilverCrest Options. SilverCrest has determined that the value of the “change of control”
payments to be received by each of Messrs. Drever, Fier and Magnusson as a result of the Arrangement, as described
under “Interests of Certain Persons in the Arrangement – Termination and Change of Control Benefits”, net of any offsetting
costs, is more than 5% of the amount of the consideration that each of Messrs. Drever, Fier and Magnusson expects to be
beneficially entitled to receive under the terms of the Arrangement in exchange for the SilverCrest Shares that he
beneficially owns. Accordingly, the change of control payments and cash bonuses that each of Messrs. Drever, Fier and
Magnusson may receive as a result of the completion of the Arrangement constitute a collateral benefit under MI 61-101.
Accordingly, any SilverCrest Shares beneficially owned, or over which control or direction is exercised by either of Messrs.
Drever, Fier and Magnusson will be excluded for the purposes of determining whether the SilverCrest Minority Approval has
been obtained.
SilverCrest is not required to obtain a formal valuation under MI 61-101 as no related party of SilverCrest is, as a
consequence of the Arrangement, directly or indirectly acquiring SilverCrest or its business and neither the Arrangement nor
the transactions contemplated thereunder is a ‘‘related party transaction’’ for which SilverCrest would be required to obtain
a formal valuation.
United States Securities Law Matters
The following discussion is a general overview of certain requirements of U.S. federal securities laws that may be
applicable to SilverCrest Shareholders who are resident in the United States. The discussion is based in part on non-
binding interpretations and no-action letters provided by the staff of the SEC, which do not have the force of law. All
SilverCrest Shareholders who are resident in the United States are urged to consult with their own legal counsel to
ensure that any subsequent resale of securities issued or distributed to them under the Arrangement complies with
applicable securities legislation. Further information applicable to SilverCrest Shareholders who are resident in the
United States is disclosed under the heading “Joint Management Information Circular – Information for United States
Shareholders”.
The following discussion does not address the Canadian securities laws that will apply to the issue or resale of securities
by SilverCrest Shareholders within Canada. SilverCrest Shareholders who are resident in the United States and who resell
their securities in Canada must comply with Canadian securities laws. See “Canadian Securities Law Matters”.
The First Majestic Shares, New SilverCrest Shares, SilverCrest Replacement Options, New SilverCrest Options and First
Majestic Replacement Options to be issued pursuant to the Arrangement will not be registered under the provisions of the
U.S. Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the
U.S. Securities Act. Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act exempts securities issued in exchange for one or more
outstanding securities from the general requirement of registration where the terms and conditions of the issuance and
exchange of such securities have been approved by a court of competent jurisdiction, after a hearing upon the fairness of
the terms and conditions of the issuance and exchange at which all persons to whom the securities will be issued have the
right to appear and receive timely notice thereof. Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act does not exempt the issuance of
securities upon the exercise of securities that were issued pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act. As a
result, Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act does not exempt the issuance of First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest
Shares upon the exercise of the First Majestic Replacement Options and New SilverCrest Options, respectively, to be
issued pursuant to the Arrangement.
The First Majestic Shares and the New SilverCrest Shares to be received by SilverCrest Shareholders pursuant to the
Arrangement will be freely tradable in the U.S. under U.S. federal securities laws, except by persons who are “affiliates” of
First Majestic (with respect to the First Majestic Shares) or “affiliates” of New SilverCrest (with respect to the New
SilverCrest Shares) at the time of their proposed transfer or within 90 days prior to their proposed transfer. Persons who may
be deemed to be “affiliates” of an issuer include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
control with, the issuer, and generally include executive officers and directors of the issuer as well as principal shareholders
of the issuer. Any resale of such First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest Shares, as applicable, by such an affiliate may be
subject to the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, absent an exemption
therefrom. It is not intended for New SilverCrest Shares to be listed on a United States stock exchange.
- 71 -
Resales by Affiliates of First Majestic or New SilverCrest under Regulation S
In general, under Regulation S, persons who are affiliates of First Majestic and/or New SilverCrest solely by virtue of their
status as an officer or director of First Majestic and/or New SilverCrest, respectively, may sell their First Majestic Shares or
New SilverCrest Shares, respectively, outside the United States in an “offshore transaction” (which would include a sale
through the physical trading floor of an established non-U.S. stock exchange or through the facilities of certain specified
non-U.S. stock exchanges as long as neither the seller nor any person acting on its behalf knows that the transaction has
been prearranged with a buyer in the United States) if neither the seller nor any person acting on its behalf engages in
“directed selling efforts” in the United States and no selling commission, fee or other remuneration is paid in connection with
such sale other than a usual and customary broker’s commission. For purposes of Regulation S, “directed selling efforts”
means “any activity undertaken for the purpose of, or that could reasonably be expected to have the effect of, conditioning
the market in the United States for any of the securities being offered” in the sale transaction.
Exercise of the First Majestic Replacement Options and New SilverCrest Options
The First Majestic Replacement Options and New SilverCrest Options may not be exercised in the United States (as
defined in Rule 902(l) of Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act) unless registered under the U.S. Securities Act or
pursuant to an exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act. First Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares
issued upon such respective exercise pursuant to an exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act may not be
offered or resold in the United States except pursuant to registration or in a transaction not subject to the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. First Majestic and New SilverCrest may require the delivery of an opinion of
counsel or other evidence or certifications reasonably satisfactory to First Majestic and New SilverCrest, as applicable, to
the effect that the issuance of such First Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares, as applicable, does not require
registration under the U.S. Securities Act. Any such exercise must also comply with applicable state securities laws.
The foregoing discussion is only a general overview of certain requirements of United States securities laws applicable to
the securities received upon completion of the Arrangement. All holders of such securities are urged to consult with counsel
to ensure that the resale of their securities complies with applicable United States securities laws.
Mexican Antitrust Clearance
Under the Mexican Competition Law, the proposed transaction cannot be consummated until the issuance of a clearance
resolution from COFECE, which must be issued within 60 business days after the filing of a notice of concentration or the
submission of all additional required information and documentation. However, for complicated cases, COFECE may
extend the period up to 40 additional business days. First Majestic has made the application and will file responses as may
be requested by COFECE during such period. Under the Mexican Competition Law, once the term has expired and no
decision has been issued by COFECE, it is generally understood that they have no objection.
Stock Exchange Approvals
The First Majestic Shares currently trade on the TSX under the symbol “FR” and on the NYSE under “AG”. First Majestic
has applied to the TSX and the NYSE to list the First Majestic Shares issuable: (i) under the Arrangement and (ii) upon the
exercise of the Replacement Options. It is a condition of closing that First Majestic will have obtained approval of the TSX,
subject only to the customary listing conditions of the TSX, and of the NYSE, subject to fulfilling the requirements of the
NYSE. The TSX has granted approval of the listing of such First Majestic Shares, conditional upon satisfaction of customary
conditions.

Non-Solicitation Covenants and Rights to Accept a Superior Proposal
From the date of the Arrangement Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the time at which the Arrangement
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, SilverCrest has agreed to certain non-solicitation covenants which
provide, among other things, that it (and its or any of the SilverCrest Subsidiaries’ officers, directors, employees,
consultants, advisors, representatives or agents) will not:
(a)
make, solicit, initiate, encourage or otherwise facilitate (including by way of furnishing information or according access to
any information or any site visit) any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute an Acquisition Proposal or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;
(b)
participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish information to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any
person (other than First Majestic and its affiliates) regarding any Acquisition Proposal or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;
(c)
effect any Change of Recommendation; or
accept, enter into, or propose publicly to accept or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, term
sheet, agreement in principle, agreement, arrangement or understanding related to any Acquisition Proposal (except as
(d)
permitted under the Arrangement Agreement).
Notwithstanding the above, in the event that SilverCrest receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from any person
after the date of the Arrangement Agreement and prior to the SilverCrest Meeting that was not solicited by SilverCrest and
that did not otherwise result from a breach of the Arrangement Agreement, and subject to SilverCrest’s compliance with the
Arrangement Agreement, SilverCrest may (i) contact such person solely to clarify the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish information with respect to it to such person pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality
agreement, provided that (A) SilverCrest provides a copy of such acceptable confidentiality agreement to First Majestic
promptly upon its execution and (B) SilverCrest contemporaneously provides to First Majestic a list of all non-public
information concerning SilverCrest that is provided to such person and provides to First Majestic copies of any such non-
public information which was not previously provided to First Majestic, and (iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding such Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that, prior to taking any action described in clauses (ii) or (iii)
above, the SilverCrest Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal would be reasonably likely, if consummated in accordance with its terms, to be a
Superior Proposal and failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. After
the date of the SilverCrest Meeting, SilverCrest is not permitted to consider, negotiate, accept or recommend an Acquisition
Proposal or furnish any information with respect to it to any person who has made an Acquisition Proposal.
- 75 -
SilverCrest must (i) not release any persons from, or terminate, amend, modify, waive or fail to enforce on a timely basis any
obligation of any other person under any confidentiality or standstill agreement or amend any such agreement or other
conditions included in any agreement between SilverCrest and a third party entered into prior to the date of the Arrangement
Agreement, (ii) promptly and diligently enforce all standstill, non-disclosure, non-disturbance, non-solicitation and similar
covenants of any other person in any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, term sheet, agreement in principle,
agreement, arrangement or understanding that it has entered into prior to the date hereof or enters into after the date of the
Arrangement Agreement, (iii) not accept or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, term sheet,
agreement in principle, agreement, arrangement or understanding requiring SilverCrest to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Arrangement or providing for the payment of any break, termination or other fees or expenses to any
person proposing an Acquisition Proposal in the event that SilverCrest completes the transactions contemplated by the
Arrangement Agreement or any other transaction with First Majestic or any of its affiliates, and (iv) except with the prior
written consent of First Majestic, not take any action to terminate, amend, extend the “Separation Time” under or waive the
Shareholder Rights Plan, or the application of its Shareholder Rights Plan to, any Acquisition Proposal, or any person
making an Acquisition Proposal, not subject to its Shareholder Rights Plan (including redemption of any rights created
under its Shareholder Rights Plan). In the event that any person requests any governmental entity to invalidate or cease
trade its Shareholder Rights Plan, SilverCrest must oppose any such application unless the SilverCrest Board determines,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that to do so is not consistent with its fiduciary duties.
The SilverCrest Board must reaffirm its recommendation of the Arrangement by press release: (i) promptly after any
Acquisition Proposal (which is determined not to be a Superior Proposal) is publicly announced or made; (ii) promptly after
the SilverCrest Board determines that a proposed amendment to the provisions of this Agreement would result in the
Acquisition Proposal not being a Superior Proposal; or (iii) as soon as practicable after receipt of any reasonable request
from First Majestic to do so. First Majestic and its legal advisors must be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the form and content of any such press release and SilverCrest is required to incorporate all reasonable
comments made by First Majestic and its legal advisors.
SilverCrest must promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours of receipt) notify First Majestic, at first orally and then in
writing, of any Acquisition Proposal and any enquiry that may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal.
Such notice must include a description of the material terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the
person making such proposal or enquiry, a copy of any written form of Acquisition Proposal and any other documents
representing the Acquisition Proposal. In addition, SilverCrest must keep First Majestic fully informed with respect to the
status of any Acquisition Proposal or enquiry, and provide to First Majestic copies of all correspondence and other written
material sent or provided to or by SilverCrest in connection with any Acquisition Proposal. SilverCrest may not provide
confidential non-public information to a third party who has made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
unless SilverCrest has first obtained an acceptable confidentiality agreement from the third party. SilverCrest must also
send a copy of any such confidentiality agreement to First Majestic and concurrently provide First Majestic with a list or
copies of the information provided to the third party and access to similar information if not already provided.
Provided SilverCrest has complied with the foregoing, SilverCrest may, before the SilverCrest Meeting, accept, approve,
recommend or enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement in respect of a Superior Proposal if the following
conditions are met:
(a)
SilverCrest has provided First Majestic with (i) a copy of the Superior Proposal document and any other documents
representing the Superior Proposal, (ii) written notice advising First Majestic of the determination of the SilverCrest Board
that the Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and that the SilverCrest Board has resolved, subject to compliance
with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement and the termination of the Arrangement Agreement, to accept, approve,
recommend or enter into an agreement in respect of the Superior Proposal, specifying the terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal and identifying the person making the Superior Proposal, and (iii) written notice from the SilverCrest
Board regarding the value or range of values in financial terms that the SilverCrest Board has, in consultation with its
financial advisors, determined should be ascribed to any non-cash consideration offered under the Superior Proposal;
- 76 -
(b)
five full business days have elapsed since the date First Majestic received the documentation set out in paragraph (a)
above (the “Match Period”); and
(c)
SilverCrest has previously or concurrently paid to First Majestic the Termination Payment, if any, payable under the
Arrangement Agreement, and terminated the Arrangement Agreement in accordance with its terms.
First Majestic’s Right to Match
During the Match Period, First Majestic has the right (but not the obligation) to offer to amend the terms of the Arrangement
Agreement, and SilverCrest must co-operate (including negotiating in good faith) with First Majestic during the Match
Period. The SilverCrest Board must review in good faith any offer by First Majestic to amend the terms of the Arrangement
Agreement in order to determine, in consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, whether First
Majestic’s offer, upon acceptance by SilverCrest, would result in an Acquisition Proposal ceasing to be a Superior
Proposal. SilverCrest agrees that, subject to its disclosure obligations under applicable securities laws, the fact of the
making of, and each of the terms of, any such proposed amendments shall be kept strictly confidential and shall not be
disclosed to any person (including without limitation, the person having made the Superior Proposal), other than
SilverCrest’s representatives, without First Majestic’s prior written consent. If the SilverCrest Board determines that such
Acquisition Proposal would cease to be a Superior Proposal as a result of the amendments proposed by First Majestic,
SilverCrest must forthwith so advise First Majestic and must promptly thereafter accept the offer by First Majestic to amend
the terms of the Arrangement Agreement and the Arrangement and the parties are required to take such actions and
execute such documents as are necessary to give effect to the foregoing. SilverCrest must, within two business days of
entering into such amendment, reaffirm its recommendation of the Arrangement and issue a press release to that effect.
If the SilverCrest Board continues to believe, in good faith and after consultation with financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and therefore rejects First Majestic’s amended
proposal, SilverCrest may terminate the Arrangement Agreement; provided, however, that SilverCrest must concurrently
therewith pay to First Majestic the Termination Payment, if any, payable to First Majestic and must prior to or concurrently
with such termination enter into a binding agreement, understanding or arrangement with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal. See “Termination” and “Termination Payment”.
If, less than six business days before the SilverCrest Meeting, SilverCrest has provided First Majestic with a notice of a
Superior Proposal, an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly disclosed or announced and the Match Period has not
elapsed, then, subject to applicable laws, at First Majestic’s request, SilverCrest must postpone or adjourn the SilverCrest
Meeting to a date acceptable to First Majestic and SilverCrest, acting reasonably, which cannot be less than six business
days or more than 12 business days after the scheduled date of the SilverCrest Meeting and must, if First Majestic and
SilverCrest amend the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, ensure that the details of the amended Arrangement
Agreement are communicated to the SilverCrest Shareholders at or before the resumption of the adjourned SilverCrest
Meeting.
Each successive modification to any material term or condition of an Acquisition Proposal or that results in an increase in or
modification of the consideration (or value of such consideration) to be received by SilverCrest or the SilverCrest
Shareholders or which otherwise results in the SilverCrest Board determining that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal will constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the Match Period provisions under the Arrangement
Agreement and will initiate an additional five Business Day notice period. Nothing contained in the Superior Proposal
provisions of the Arrangement Agreement will prohibit the SilverCrest Board from (i) responding through a directors’ circular
or otherwise as required by law to an Acquisition Proposal that it determines is not a Superior Proposal, provided that such
circular or other disclosure recommends that SilverCrest Shareholders reject the Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) calling and/or
holding a meeting of SilverCrest Shareholders requisitioned by SilverCrest Shareholders in accordance with the BCBCA,
provided that any information circular or other document required in connection with such meeting recommends that
SilverCrest Shareholders vote against any proposed resolution in favour of or necessary to complete the Acquisition
Proposal.
- 77 -

The Arrangement Agreement may be terminated at any time whether before or after the holding of the SilverCrest Meeting
but not later than the Effective Date:

to cause any condition in favour of both parties or in favour of the other party not to be satisfied, or (v) the Effective Time
does not occur on or before the Outside Date, provided that a party may not terminate the Arrangement Agreement if the
failure of the Effective Time to so occur has been caused by, or is a result of, a breach by such party of any of its
representations or warranties or the failure of such party to perform any of its covenants or agreements under the
(b)
Arrangement Agreement;
(c)

SilverCrest Shareholders and is not publicly withdrawn prior to the earlier of the date of the SilverCrest Meeting and the

notice of termination by First Majestic.
If (i) SilverCrest terminates the Arrangement Agreement because any representation or warranty of First Majestic is untrue

cause any condition in favour of both parties or in favour of First Majestic not to be satisfied, or (ii) either SilverCrest or First
Majestic terminate the Arrangement Agreement because the First Majestic Meeting is held and the First Majestic Resolution
is not approved by the First Majestic Shareholders in accordance with applicable laws, then First Majestic is required to pay
to SilverCrest an expense reimbursement fee of US$1,000,000 within five business days after written notice of termination
by SilverCrest.
Each of SilverCrest and First Majestic have agreed that the Termination Payment or the expense reimbursement fee, as

losses incurred or suffered by such party as a result of any breach of the Arrangement Agreement by the other party,
seeking injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants or agreements set forth in the
Arrangement Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise, or seeking specific performance of any of such
covenants or agreements, without the necessity of posting bond or security in connection therewith.
Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Considerations
The following is a summary of the principal Canadian federal income tax considerations under the Tax Act generally
applicable to a SilverCrest Shareholder who, for purposes of the Tax Act, holds SilverCrest Shares, and will hold First
Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares acquired pursuant to the Arrangement, as capital property, deals at arm’s
length with each of SilverCrest, First Majestic and New SilverCrest and is not affiliated with SilverCrest, First Majestic or
New SilverCrest and who disposes of SilverCrest Shares pursuant to the Arrangement. SilverCrest Shares, First Majestic
Shares and New SilverCrest Shares generally will be considered capital property to a SilverCrest Shareholder for purposes
of the Tax Act unless the SilverCrest Shareholder holds such shares in the course of carrying on a business of buying and
selling securities or the SilverCrest Shareholder has acquired or holds them in a transaction or transactions considered to
be an adventure or concern in the nature of trade.
- 79 -
This summary is based on the current provisions of the Tax Act, the regulations thereunder (the “Tax Regulations”) in force
on the date hereof, and counsel’s understanding of the current published administrative policies and assessing practices of
the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”). The summary takes into account all specific proposals to amend the Tax Act and the
Tax Regulations publicly announced by or on behalf of the Minister of Finance (Canada) prior to the date hereof (the “Tax
Proposals”), and assumes that all Tax Proposals will be enacted in the form proposed. However, there is no certainty that
the Tax Proposals will be enacted in the form currently proposed, if at all. The summary does not otherwise take into
account or anticipate any changes in law, whether by judicial, governmental or legislative decision or action, or other
changes in administrative policies or assessing practices of the CRA, nor does it take into account provincial, territorial or
foreign income tax legislation or considerations, which may materially differ from Canadian federal income tax legislation or
considerations.
This summary does not apply to a SilverCrest Shareholder (i) that is a “financial institution” for the purposes of the mark-to-
market rules in the Tax Act, (ii) that is a “specified financial institution”, (iii) an interest in which would be, or whose
SilverCrest Shares are, a “tax shelter” or a “tax shelter investment”, each as defined in the Tax Act, or (iv) that has elected to
report its “Canadian tax results” (as defined in the Tax Act) in a currency other than Canadian currency. This summary also
does not apply to a SilverCrest Shareholder who has entered into or will enter into a “derivative forward agreement” (as
defined in the Tax Act) with respect to SilverCrest Shares, New SilverCrest Shares or the First Majestic Shares.
In addition, this summary does not address the tax considerations relevant to SilverCrest Shareholders who acquired their
SilverCrest Shares on the exercise of a SilverCrest Option. Such SilverCrest Shareholders should consult their own tax
advisors. This summary also does not apply to a SilverCrest Optionholder.
This summary is of a general nature only and is not exhaustive of all possible Canadian federal income tax
considerations and is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, legal, business or tax advice or
representations to any particular SilverCrest Shareholder. Accordingly, SilverCrest Shareholders should consult
their own tax advisors with respect to their particular circumstances, including the application and effect of the
income and other tax laws of any country, province, state or local tax authority.
Shareholders Resident in Canada
The following portion of this summary is applicable to a SilverCrest Shareholder who, at all relevant times, is resident, or
deemed to be resident, in Canada for the purposes of the Tax Act (a “Resident Shareholder”). In circumstances where
SilverCrest Shares, First Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares may not otherwise constitute capital property to a
particular Resident Shareholder, such holder may be entitled to elect that such shares be deemed to be capital property by
making an irrevocable election under subsection 39(4) of the Tax Act to deem every “Canadian security” (as defined in the
Tax Act) owned by such holder in the taxation year of the election and in each subsequent taxation year to be capital
property. Resident Shareholders contemplating such an election should first consult their own tax advisors. Where a
Resident Shareholder makes an election with First Majestic under section 85 of the Tax Act, as described below, the First
Majestic Shares received will not be “Canadian securities” to such holder and will not be deemed to be capital property
under subsection 39(4) of the Tax Act.
Distribution of New SilverCrest Shares
SilverCrest will distribute the New SilverCrest Shares held by it on the Effective Date to SilverCrest Shareholders as part of
the Arrangement (the “Distribution”). The fair market value of the New SilverCrest Shares distributed on the Distribution up
to the paid-up capital (as defined in the Tax Act) of the SilverCrest Shares outstanding on the Effective Date should be
treated as a return of paid-up capital to Resident Shareholders. To the extent that the fair market value of New SilverCrest
Shares received by a Resident Shareholder exceeds the paid-up capital of such SilverCrest Shares, the excess amount will
be treated as a taxable dividend received by the Resident Shareholder from a taxable Canadian corporation. SilverCrest
expects, without giving assurances, that the fair market value of the New SilverCrest Shares distributed will not exceed the
paid-up capital of the SilverCrest Shares.
A Resident Shareholder who receives New SilverCrest Shares on the Distribution as a return of paid-up capital on
SilverCrest Shares held by it should not be subject to tax on the receipt, however, such a holder will be required to reduce
the adjusted cost base of the SilverCrest Shares by the difference, if any, between the fair market value of the New
SilverCrest Shares received and the amount of any taxable dividend resulting from the receipt of the New SilverCrest
Shares. If, as a result of such reduction, a Resident Shareholder’s adjusted cost base of SilverCrest Shares held by it
becomes negative (i.e. the amount of the reduction exceeds the adjusted cost base), such negative amount will be deemed
to be a capital gain realized by the holder in the taxation year that includes the Distribution. See “Taxation of Capital Gains
and Losses”.
- 80 -
A Resident Shareholder who is an individual and who is deemed to have received a dividend as a result of the receipt of
New SilverCrest Shares on the Distribution will be required to include the amount of the dividend in income in accordance
with the gross-up and dividend tax credit provisions of the Tax Act, including the enhanced gross-up and dividend tax credit
rules applicable to dividends designated by SilverCrest as “eligible dividends”, as defined in the Tax Act. Where the
Resident Shareholder is a corporation the amount of such deemed dividend will generally be required to be included in the
income of such holder but such amount will generally be deductible in computing the taxable income of such holder. In
certain circumstances, subsection 55(2) of the Tax Act will treat a taxable dividend received by a Canadian resident
corporation as proceeds of disposition or a capital gain. Corporate Resident Shareholders that receive a dividend from
SilverCrest should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the potential application of subsection 55(2) of the Tax Act
to such dividend.
Private corporations and certain other corporations controlled by or for the benefit of an individual or a related group of
individuals generally will be liable for a refundable tax under Part IV of the Tax Act in an amount equal to 33 1⁄3% of all
taxable dividends received by each such corporation to the extent that the amount of such dividends is deductible, by virtue
of specific provisions of the Tax Act, in computing the taxable income of each such corporation.
The cost of the New SilverCrest Shares acquired by a Resident Shareholder under the Arrangement should be equal to the
fair market value of such shares at the time of the Distribution.
Exchange of SilverCrest Shares for First Majestic Shares and Cash — No Section 85 Election
As part of the Arrangement, each SilverCrest Share will be exchanged for 0.2769 of a First Majestic Share and C$0.0001 of
cash. A Resident Shareholder whose SilverCrest Shares are exchanged for First Majestic Shares and cash pursuant to the
Arrangement, and who does not make a valid Tax Election jointly with First Majestic with respect to the exchange, will be
considered to have disposed of the SilverCrest Shares for proceeds of disposition equal to the aggregate fair market value,
as at the time of the exchange, of the First Majestic Shares and cash so acquired by the Resident Shareholder. As a result,
the Resident Shareholder will generally realize a capital gain (or capital loss) to the extent that such proceeds of
disposition, net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the adjusted cost base of the Resident
Shareholder’s SilverCrest Shares immediately before the exchange. See “Taxation of Capital Gains and Losses” below for
a general discussion of the treatment of capital gains and capital losses under the Tax Act.
The aggregate cost to the Resident Shareholder of the First Majestic Shares acquired on the exchange will equal the fair
market value of such First Majestic Shares as at the time of the exchange. If the Resident Shareholder separately owns
other First Majestic Shares as capital property at that time, for the purposes of determining the adjusted cost base of all First
Majestic Shares owned by the Resident Shareholder as capital property immediately after the exchange the cost of such
First Majestic Shares will be determined by averaging the cost of the First Majestic Shares acquired on the exchange with
the adjusted cost base of those other First Majestic Shares.
Exchange of SilverCrest Shares for First Majestic Shares and Cash — Section 85 Election
The following applies to a Resident Shareholder who is an Eligible Holder. An Eligible Holder may obtain a full or partial
tax deferral in respect of the disposition of SilverCrest Shares by filing with the CRA (and, where applicable, with a
provincial tax authority) an election (the “Tax Election”) under subsection 85(1) of the Tax Act or, in the case of a
partnership, under subsection 85(2) of the Tax Act (and the corresponding provisions of any applicable provincial tax
legislation) provided all members of the partnership jointly elect, made jointly by the Eligible Holder and First Majestic. The
amount specified in the Tax Election as the proceeds of disposition of the Eligible Holder’s SilverCrest Shares must be an
amount (the “Elected Amount”) which is not less than the greater of:
(a)
the lesser of the adjusted cost base to the Eligible Holder of such SilverCrest Shares and the fair market value of such
SilverCrest Shares at the time of disposition; or
(b)
the fair market value of any cash received as a result of such disposition.
- 81 -
The Elected Amount may not be greater than the fair market value of such SilverCrest Shares at the time of the disposition.
An Elected Amount which does not comply with these limitations will automatically be adjusted under the Tax Act so that it
is in compliance.
Where a valid Tax Election is filed:
(a)
SilverCrest Shares that are the subject of the Tax Election will be deemed to be disposed of for proceeds of disposition
equal to the Elected Amount. Subject to the limitations set out in subsection 85(1) or 85(2) of the Tax Act regarding the
Elected Amount, if the Elected Amount is equal to the aggregate of the adjusted cost base of such SilverCrest Shares
immediately before the disposition and any reasonable costs of disposition, no capital gain or capital loss will be realized
by the Eligible Holder. Subject to such limitations, to the extent that the Elected Amount in respect of such SilverCrest
Shares exceeds (or is less than) the aggregate of the adjusted cost base and any reasonable costs of disposition, such
holder will realize a capital gain (or a capital loss). See “Taxation of Capital Gains and Losses”.
(b)
The aggregate cost to the Eligible Holder of the First Majestic Shares received will be equal to the amount, if any, by
which the Elected Amount exceeds the aggregate fair market value of cash received from First Majestic as a result of the
disposition. If the Eligible Holder separately owns other First Majestic Shares as capital property at that time, for the
purposes of determining the adjusted cost base of such First Majestic Shares received, the cost of such First Majestic
Shares will be determined by averaging the adjusted cost base of such First Majestic Shares with the adjusted cost base
of the other First Majestic Shares held by the Eligible Holder at that time as capital property.
First Majestic has agreed to make a Tax Election pursuant to subsection 85(1) or 85(2) of the Tax Act (and any similar
provision of any provincial tax legislation) with an Eligible Holder at the amount determined by such Eligible Holder, subject
to the limitations set out in subsection 85(1) and 85(2) of the Tax Act (or any applicable provincial tax legislation).
A tax instruction letter providing certain instructions on how to complete the Tax Election forms may be obtained
from the Depositary by checking Box G on the Letter of Transmittal and submitting the Letter of Transmittal to the
Depositary within 90 days of the Effective Date in accordance with the procedures set out under “The Arrangement
– Letter of Transmittal”. A tax instruction letter may also be obtained on First Majestic’s website at
www.firstmajestic.com on or around the Effective Date.
In order to make an election, an Eligible Holder must provide the completed Tax Election form to First Majestic in
accordance with the procedures set out in the tax instruction letter on or before 90 days after the Effective Date. Subject to
the form complying with the provisions of the Tax Act (and any applicable provincial income tax law), the form will be signed
by First Majestic and returned to the Eligible Holder for filing with the CRA (or the applicable provincial tax authority). Each
Eligible Holder is solely responsible for ensuring the Tax Election form is completed correctly and filed with the
CRA (and any applicable provincial income tax authorities) by the required deadline.
First Majestic will make a Tax Election only with an Eligible Holder, and at the amount selected by the Eligible Holder
subject to the limitations set out in the Tax Act (and any applicable provincial tax legislation). Neither First Majestic nor
SilverCrest will be responsible for the proper completion or filing of any Tax Election form and the Eligible Holder will be
solely responsible for the payment of any late filing penalty. First Majestic agrees only to execute any Tax Election form
received by First Majestic within 90 days of the Effective Date and which complies with the provisions of the Tax Act (and
any applicable provincial tax law) and to return such Tax Election form to the Eligible Holder for filing with the CRA (and any
applicable provincial tax authority). At its sole discretion, First Majestic may accept and execute a Tax Election form that is
not received within the 90 day period; however, no assurances can be given that First Majestic will do so. Accordingly, all
Eligible Holders who wish to make a Tax Election with First Majestic should give their immediate attention to this matter.
With the exception of execution of the Tax Election form by First Majestic, compliance with the requirements for a valid Tax
Election will be the sole responsibility of the Eligible Holder making the election. Accordingly, neither First Majestic,
SilverCrest nor the Depositary will be responsible or liable for taxes, interest, penalties, damages or expenses resulting
from the failure to properly complete any Tax Election form or to properly file it within the time prescribed and in the form
prescribed under the Tax Act (or the corresponding provisions of any applicable provincial tax legislation).
- 82 -
In order for the CRA (and where applicable the provincial tax authorities) to accept a Tax Election without a late filing
penalty being paid by an Eligible Holder, the Tax Election form must be received by such tax authorities on or before the
day that is the earliest of the days on or before which either First Majestic or the Eligible Holder is required to file an income
tax return for the taxation year in which the disposition occurs. First Majestic’s 2015 taxation year is scheduled to end on
December 31, 2015, although First Majestic’s taxation year could end earlier as a result of an event such as an
amalgamation, and its tax return is required to be filed within six months from the end of the taxation year. Eligible Holders
are urged to consult their own advisors as soon as possible respecting the deadlines applicable to their own particular
circumstances. However, regardless of such deadlines, the completed Tax Election form must be received by First
Majestic in accordance with the procedures set out in the tax instruction letter no later than 90 days after the
Effective Date.
Any Eligible Holder who does not ensure that a Tax Election form has been received by First Majestic in accordance with
the procedures set out in the tax instruction letter on or before 90 days after the Effective Date will not be able to benefit from
the tax deferral provisions of the Tax Act (or the corresponding provisions of any applicable provincial tax legislation).
Accordingly, all Eligible Holder who wish to enter into a Tax Election with First Majestic should give their immediate
attention to this matter. The instructions for requesting a tax instruction letter are set out in the Letter of Transmittal. Eligible
Holders are referred to Information Circular 76-19R3 and Interpretation Bulletin IT-291R3 issued by the CRA for further
information respecting the Tax Election. Eligible Holders wishing to make the Tax Election should consult their own tax
advisors. An Eligible Holder who does not make a valid election under section 85 of the Tax Act (or the corresponding
provisions of any applicable provisional tax legislation) may realize a taxable capital gain. The comments herein with
respect to the Tax Election are provided for general assistance only. The law in this area is complex and contains numerous
technical requirements.
Dividends on First Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares
A Resident Shareholder who is an individual will be required to include in income any dividends received or deemed to be
received on the Resident Shareholder’s First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest Shares, and will be subject to the gross-
up and dividend tax credit rules applicable to taxable dividends received from taxable Canadian corporations, including the
enhanced gross-up and dividend tax credit rules applicable to any dividends designated by First Majestic or New
SilverCrest, as the case may be, as “eligible dividends”, as defined in the Tax Act.
A Resident Shareholder that is a corporation will be required to include in income any dividend received or deemed to be
received on the Resident Shareholder’s First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest Shares, as the case may be, but generally
will be entitled to deduct an equivalent amount in computing its taxable income. In certain circumstances subsection 55(2)
of the Tax Act will treat a taxable dividend received by a Resident Shareholder that is a corporation as proceeds of a
disposition or a capital gain. Resident Shareholders that are corporations should consult their own tax advisors in this
regard.
A “private corporation” or a “subject corporation” (as defined in the Tax Act) may be liable under Part IV of the Tax Act to pay
a refundable tax of 33 1⁄3% on any dividend that it receives or is deemed to receive on First Majestic Shares or New
SilverCrest Shares to the extent that the dividend is deductible in computing the corporation’s taxable income.
Taxable dividends received by an individual or trust, other than certain specified trusts, may give rise to minimum tax under
the Tax Act.
Disposition of First Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares
A Resident Shareholder that disposes or is deemed to dispose of a First Majestic Share or a New SilverCrest Share in a
taxation year generally will realize a capital gain (or capital loss) equal to the amount by which the proceeds of disposition
of the First Majestic Share or New SilverCrest Share, as the case may be, exceed (or are less than) the aggregate of the
Resident Shareholder’s adjusted cost base of such First Majestic Share or New SilverCrest Share, determined immediately
before the disposition and any reasonable costs of disposition. See “Taxation of Capital Gains and Losses”.
- 83 -
Taxation of Capital Gains and Losses
Generally, a Resident Shareholder will be required to include in computing its income for a taxation year one-half of the
amount of any capital gain (a “taxable capital gain”) realized by it in that year. A Resident Shareholder must deduct one-half
of the amount of any capital loss (an “allowable capital loss”) realized in a taxation year from taxable capital gains realized
by the Resident Shareholder in that year. Allowable capital losses in excess of taxable capital gains for a taxation year may
be carried back to any of the three preceding taxation years or carried forward to any subsequent taxation year and
deducted against net taxable capital gains realized in such years to the extent and under the circumstances specified in the
Tax Act.
Where a Resident Shareholder is a corporation, the amount of any capital loss arising on a disposition or deemed
disposition of any SilverCrest Share, First Majestic Share or New SilverCrest Share, as the case may be, may be reduced
by the amount of dividends received or deemed to have been received by it on such share to the extent and under the
circumstances described in the Tax Act. Similar rules may apply where a corporation is a member of a partnership or a
beneficiary of a trust that owns SilverCrest Shares, First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest Shares, as the case may be, or
where a trust or partnership of which a corporation is a beneficiary or is a member of a partnership or a beneficiary of a trust
that owns any such shares.
A Resident Shareholder that is a “Canadian-controlled private corporation” (as defined in the Tax Act) may be required to
pay an additional 6 2⁄3% refundable tax on certain investment income, which includes taxable capital gains.
Capital gains realized by an individual or trust, other than certain specified trusts, may give rise to minimum tax under the
Tax Act.
Dissenting Shareholders
A Resident Shareholder who is a Dissenting Shareholder (a “Dissenting Resident Shareholder”) who, consequent upon
the exercise of Dissent Rights, disposes of SilverCrest Shares in consideration for a cash payment from First Majestic will
realize a capital gain (or capital loss) to the extent that the proceeds of disposition, net of any reasonable costs of
disposition, exceed (or are less than) the adjusted cost base of the Dissenting Resident Shareholder’s SilverCrest Shares.
See “Taxation of Capital Gains and Losses”. Interest awarded by a court to a Dissenting Resident Shareholder will be
included in the holder’s income for purposes of the Tax Act.
Non-Residents of Canada
This part of the summary is applicable to a SilverCrest Shareholder, who, for purposes of the Tax Act and any applicable
income tax treaty, has not been and will not be resident or deemed to be resident in Canada at any time while it has held or
will hold SilverCrest Shares, First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest Shares and who does not use or hold, will not use or
hold and is not and will not be, deemed to use or hold such SilverCrest Shares, First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest
Shares in carrying on a business in Canada (a “Non-Resident Shareholder”). Special rules, which are not discussed in
this summary, may apply to a non-resident that is an insurer carrying on business in Canada and elsewhere.
Distribution
The fair market value of the New SilverCrest Shares distributed on the Distribution up to the paid-up capital of the
SilverCrest Shares outstanding on the Effective Date should be treated as a return of paid-up capital to Non-Resident
Shareholders. To the extent that the fair market value of the New SilverCrest Shares received by a Non-Resident
Shareholder exceeds the paid-up capital of such SilverCrest Shares, the excess amount will be deemed to be a taxable
dividend received by the holder from a taxable Canadian corporation. SilverCrest expects, without giving assurances, that
the fair market value of the New SilverCrest Shares distributed will not exceed the paid-up capital of the SilverCrest Shares.
- 84 -
A Non-Resident Shareholder who receives New SilverCrest Shares on the Distribution as a return of paid-up capital on
SilverCrest Shares held by it will not be subject to Canadian tax on the receipt; however, such a holder will be required to
reduce the adjusted cost base of the SilverCrest Shares by the difference, if any, between the fair market value of the New
SilverCrest Shares received and the amount deemed to be a dividend. If, as a result of such reduction, a Non-Resident
Shareholder’s adjusted cost base of SilverCrest Shares held by it becomes negative (i.e. the amount of the reduction
exceeds the adjusted cost base), such negative amount will be deemed to be a capital gain realized by the holder in the
taxation year that includes the Distribution. See “Exchange of SilverCrest Shares for First Majestic Shares and Cash and
Disposition of Shares”.
To the extent that the Non-Resident Shareholder is considered to receive a taxable dividend as a consequence of the
Distribution, such dividend will be subject to Canadian withholding tax of 25% of the gross amount of the dividend, as
reduced by any applicable income tax treaty. In the case of a beneficial owner of dividends who is a resident of the United
States for purposes of the Canada-US Tax Convention (1980) and who is entitled to the benefits of that treaty, the rate of
withholding will generally be reduced to 15%.
The cost of the New SilverCrest Shares acquired by a Non-Resident Shareholder under the Arrangement should be equal
to the fair market value of such shares at the time of the Distribution.
Exchange of SilverCrest Shares for First Majestic Shares and Cash and Disposition of Shares
A Non-Resident Shareholder will not be subject to tax under the Tax Act on the exchange of SilverCrest Shares for First
Majestic Shares and cash, or on the disposition of First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest Shares, unless the SilverCrest
Shares, First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest Shares, as the case may be, constitute “taxable Canadian property” of the
Non-Resident Shareholder for purposes of the Tax Act and the Non-Resident Shareholder is not entitled to relief under an
applicable income tax treaty or convention.
Generally, the SilverCrest Shares, First Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares will not constitute “taxable Canadian
property” to a Non-Resident Shareholder at the time of a disposition of such shares provided that the shares (i) are listed on
a “designated stock exchange” (which currently includes the TSX and the TSX-V) for purposes of the Tax Act at that time,
and (ii) either (A) at no time during the 60-month period immediately preceding the disposition of the shares were 25% or
more of the issued shares of any class or series of the capital stock of the applicable corporation owned by either the Non-
Resident Shareholder, by persons with whom the Non-Resident Shareholder did not deal at arm’s length, by partnerships in
which the Non-Resident Shareholder or any such non-arm’s length person holds a membership interest (either directly or
through one or more partnerships) or by the Non-Resident Shareholder together with all such persons, or (B) at no time
during the 60-month period did the shares of the applicable corporation derive more than 50% of their fair market value from
one or any combination of real or immovable property situated in Canada, “Canadian resource properties”, “timber resource
properties” (each as defined in the Tax Act), and options in respect of, or interests in, or for civil law rights in, any such
properties (whether or not such property exists).
In certain circumstances, a Non-Resident Shareholder’s shares may also be deemed to be taxable Canadian property for
purposes of the Tax Act. Non-Resident Shareholders should consult with their own tax advisors as to whether the
SilverCrest Shares, First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest Shares constitute taxable Canadian property having regards
to their particular circumstances.
Even if any of the SilverCrest Shares, First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest Shares are taxable Canadian property to a
Non-Resident Shareholder at a particular time such holder may be exempt from tax by virtue of an income tax treaty or
convention to which Canada is a signatory.
In the event SilverCrest Shares, First Majestic Shares, or New SilverCrest Shares, as the case may be, are taxable
Canadian property to a Non-Resident Shareholder at the time of disposition and such Non-Resident Shareholder is not
exempt from tax by a tax treaty, the tax consequences described above under “Shareholders Resident in Canada —
Exchange of SilverCrest Shares for First Majestic Shares and Cash — No Section 85 Election, “Shareholders Resident in
Canada — Disposition of First Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares” and “Shareholders Resident in Canada —
Taxation of Capital Gains and Losses” will generally apply.
- 85 -
Dividends on First Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares
Dividends paid or credited, or deemed to be paid or credited, on a Non-Resident Shareholder’s First Majestic Shares or
New SilverCrest Shares will be subject to withholding tax under the Tax Act at a rate of 25% unless the rate is reduced
under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or convention. In the case of a beneficial owner of dividends who is
a resident of the United States for purposes of the Canada-US Tax Convention (1980) and who is entitled to the benefits of
that treaty, the rate of withholding will generally be reduced to 15%.
Dissenting Non-Resident Shareholders
A Non-Resident Shareholder who exercises their Dissent Rights with respect to the Arrangement will not be subject to tax
under the Tax Act on any capital gain realized on the disposition of SilverCrest Shares to First Majestic, provided that the
SilverCrest Shares are not “taxable Canadian property” (as defined in the Tax Act), as discussed above under “Exchange of
SilverCrest Shares for First Majestic Shares and Cash and Disposition of Shares”, to the Non-Resident Shareholder at the
time of the disposition or an applicable income tax treaty or convention exempts the capital gain from tax under the Tax Act.
Interest (if any) awarded by a court to a dissenting Non-Resident Shareholder generally should not be subject to
withholding tax under the Tax Act.
Eligibility for Investment
The First Majestic Shares to be issued pursuant to the Arrangement would at a particular time, be “qualified investments”
under the Tax Act for a Registered Plan provided that, at that time, the First Majestic Shares are listed on a “designated
stock exchange” as defined for purposes of the Tax Act (which includes the TSX) or First Majestic is a “public corporation”
as defined in the Tax Act. A “Registered Plan” means trusts governed by registered retirement savings plans (“RRSPs”),
registered retirement income funds (“RRIF”), registered disability savings plans, deferred profit sharing plans, registered
education savings plans and tax-free savings accounts (“TFSAs”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a holder of First Majestic
Shares will be subject to a penalty tax if the First Majestic Shares, are held in a RRSP, RRIF, TFSA, as the case may be,
and are a “prohibited investment” for such RRSP, RRIF, TFSA under the Tax Act. The First Majestic Shares will not be a
prohibited investment for a RRSP, RRIF or TFSA, as the case may be, held by a particular holder or annuitant provided the
holder or annuitant deals at arm’s length with First Majestic for the purposes of the Tax Act, and does not have a “significant
interest” (as defined in the Tax Act) in First Majestic. First Majestic Shares will generally not be a prohibited investment if the
First Majestic Shares are “excluded property” as defined in the Tax Act. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisors
as to whether the First Majestic Shares will be a prohibited investment in their particular circumstances, including with
respect to whether the First Majestic Shares would be “excluded property”.
The New SilverCrest Shares to be issued pursuant to the Arrangement would, at a particular time, be “qualified
investments” under the Tax Act for Registered Plans, provided, at that time, such shares are listed on a designated stock
exchange or New SilverCrest is a “public corporation” as defined in the Tax Act. If the New SilverCrest Shares are not listed
on a designated stock exchange at the time they are issued pursuant to the Arrangement, but such shares become listed on
a designated stock exchange in Canada before the due date for New SilverCrest’s first income tax return and New
SilverCrest makes the appropriate election under the Tax Act in that return or New SilverCrest elects to be a “public
corporation” as defined in the Tax Act, such shares will be considered qualified investments for Registered Plans from the
date of issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a holder of New SilverCrest Shares will be subject to a penalty tax if the
New SilverCrest Shares are held in a RRSP, RRIF or TFSA, as the case may be, and are “prohibited investments” for such
RRSP, RRIF or TFSA under the Tax Act. New SilverCrest Shares will not be prohibited investments for a RRSP, RRIF or
TFSA, held by a particular holder or annuitant provided the holder or annuitant deals at arm’s length with New SilverCrest
for the purposes of the Tax Act, and does not have a “significant interest” (as defined in the Tax Act) in New SilverCrest as
the case may be. In addition, New SilverCrest Shares will generally not be prohibited investments if the New SilverCrest
Shares are “excluded property” as defined in the Tax Act. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisors as to whether
New SilverCrest Shares will be prohibited investments in their particular circumstances, including with respect to whether
the New SilverCrest Shares, as the case may be, would be “excluded property.”

Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations
The following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to U.S. Holders
and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) relating to the Arrangement and to the ownership and disposition of First
Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares received pursuant to the Arrangement. This summary is based upon the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (“Treasury
Regulations”), judicial authorities, the Convention between the United States and Canada with respect to Taxes on Income
and Captial of 1980, as amended (the “Canada-U.S. Tax Convention”), published positions of the Internal Revenue
Services (the “IRS”), and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date hereof. Any of the authorities on which this
summary is based could be changed in a material and adverse manner at any time, and any such change could be applied
on a retroactive basis.
This discussion is not binding on the IRS or any court, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge any of the
tax considerations described in this summary, and the IRS is not precluded from taking a position that is different from, and
contrary to, the positions taken in this summary. In addition, because the authorities on which this summary is based are
subject to various interpretations, the IRS and the U.S. courts could disagree with one or more of the positions taken in this
summary. Neither SilverCrest nor First Majestic has obtained, nor do either intend to obtain, a ruling from the IRS or an
opinion from legal counsel or other tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed herein.
This summary addresses only certain considerations arising under U.S. federal income tax law, and it does not address any
other federal tax considerations or any tax considerations arising under the laws of any state, locality or non-U.S. taxing
jurisdiction.
This summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences of transactions effected prior or subsequent to,
or concurrently with the Arrangement (whether or not any such transactions are undertaken in connection with the
Arrangement), including, without limitation, the following:
any conversion into SilverCrest Shares, New SilverCrest Shares or First Majestic Shares of any notes, debentures or other
·
debt instruments;
any vesting, conversion, assumption, disposition, exercise, exchange, or other transaction involving any rights to acquire
·
SilverCrest Shares, New SilverCrest Shares or First Majestic Shares, including the SilverCrest Options and the New
SilverCrest Options; and
any transaction, other than the Arrangement, in which SilverCrest Shares, New SilverCrest Shares or First Majestic Shares
·
are acquired.
This summary is of a general nature only and does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be
relevant to a U.S. Holder or Non-U.S. Holder in light of such U.S. Holder’s or Non-U.S. Holder’s circumstances. In particular,
this discussion only deals with U.S. Holders or Non-U.S. Holders that hold SilverCrest Shares, New SilverCrest Shares and
First Majestic Shares, as applicable, as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property
held for investment purposes), and does not address the special tax rules that may apply to special classes of taxpayers,
such as:
· securities broker-dealers;
persons that hold SilverCrest Shares, New SilverCrest Shares or First Majestic Shares as part of a hedging or integrated
·
financial transaction or a straddle;
· U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;
·
U.S. expatriates;
persons that are owners of an interest in a partnership or other pass-through entity that is a holder of SilverCrest Shares,
·
New SilverCrest Shares or First Majestic Shares;
· partnerships or other pass-through entities;
· regulated investment companies;
· banks, thrifts, mutual funds and other financial institutions;
- 87 -
·
insurance companies;
· traders that have elected a mark-to-market method of accounting;
· tax-exempt organizations and pension funds;
persons that own, or have owned, directly, indirectly or by attribution, 5% or more of the total combined voting power of all
issued and outstanding shares of SilverCrest or who will own immediately following the Arrangement, directly, indirectly or
·
by attribution, 5% or more of the total combined voting power of all issued and outstanding shares of First Majestic or New
SilverCrest;
· PFICs or “controlled foreign corporations” (“CFCs”);
·Non-U.S. Holders that are, or previously were, engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States;
Non-U.S. Holders who are individuals present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the
·
Arrangement and who satisfy certain other conditions;
·U.S. Holders liable for alternative minimum tax or the “Medicare” tax on net investment income; and
persons who hold SilverCrest Options or persons who received their SilverCrest Shares upon the exercise of employee
·
stock options or otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan.
It is assumed for purposes of this summary that each of SilverCrest, New SilverCrest and First Majestic is not, has not at any
time been, and will not be following the consummation of the Arrangement a “controlled foreign corporation” as defined in
Section 957(a) of the Code. This summary further assumes that SilverCrest has never been treated as a U.S. domestic
corporation pursuant to Section 897(i) of the Code.
For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of SilverCrest Shares, New SilverCrest Shares or
First Majestic Shares, as the case may be, who is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:
· an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under
·
the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof;
·an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
a trust (i) that validly elects to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (ii) the administration over
·
which a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision and all of the substantial decisions of which one or more U.S. persons
have the authority to control.
A “Non-U.S. Holder” means any person who is a beneficial owner of SilverCrest Shares, New SilverCrest Shares or First
Majestic Shares, as the case may be, and who is not a U.S. Holder or a partnership or other entity or arrangement that is
classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If a partnership holds SilverCrest Shares, the tax treatment
of a partner of such partnership generally will depend upon the status of such partner and the activities of the partnership.
Partners of partnerships holding SilverCrest Shares should consult their own tax advisers regarding the specific tax
consequences of the Arrangement and of the ownership and disposition of First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest
Shares.
PFIC Assumptions Regarding SilverCrest, New SilverCrest and First Majestic
SilverCrest believes that it was not a PFIC for its tax years ending December 31, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, and based on
current business plans and financial expectations, SilverCrest expects that it will not be a PFIC during its current tax year
which includes the Effective Date. SilverCrest believes that it was likely a PFIC in one or more years prior to 2011.
- 88 -
Although SilverCrest believes that it is not currently a “passive foreign investment company” as defined in Section 1297 of
the Code (“PFIC”) for United States federal income tax purposes, it has not undertaken the analysis to reach a firm
conclusion as to its PFIC status and it is not certain whether SilverCrest has been a PFIC in past years. The determination
of whether SilverCrest is or has been a PFIC for any taxable year is made on an annual basis and is based on the types of
income earned and the types and value of the corporation’s assets from time to time, all of which are subject to change. In
addition, this analysis depends, in part, on the application of complex United States federal income tax rules, which are
subject to differing interpretations. As a result, whether SilverCrest is, has been, or will be a PFIC for the current or any
subsequent taxable year cannot be predicted with certainty and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge
any determination made by SilverCrest concerning their PFIC status.
First Majestic believes that it was not a PFIC in the prior taxable year and will not be a PFIC for the current taxable year.
Based on its projected income, assets and activities, SilverCrest believes that New SilverCrest is likely to be treated as a
PFIC for the current taxable year and may be treated as a PFIC for future years. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding an interest in a PFIC.
In the event these beliefs and projections prove to be inaccurate, the following summary may not apply and material
adverse United States federal income tax consequences may result to U.S. Holders as a result of the Arrangement and
holding First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest Shares. For information concerning the possible impact of PFIC status,
see “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations” below.
Holders of SilverCrest Shares are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the tax consequences of the
Arrangement and of the ownership and disposition of First Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares received
pursuant to the Arrangement in light of their particular circumstances, as well as the tax consequences under state,
local, and non-U.S. tax law and the possible effect of changes in tax law.
U.S. Holders
Receipt of First Majestic Shares and Cash Pursuant to the Arrangement
Reorganization Treatment
Following the exchange of SilverCrest Shares for First Majestic Shares and cash pursuant to the Arrangement (the
“Exchange”), First Majestic intends to execute additional transactions (the “Amalgamation Transactions”) which, if they
occur and are considered for United States federal income tax purposes to be part of a single integrated transaction that
includes the Exchange and not separate transactions, may qualify the Exchange and Amalgamation Transactions as a tax-
deferred Reorganization. Assuming that the Amalgamation Transactions occur, and that the Substantially All Assets
Requirement discussed below is satisfied, First Majestic expects that the Exchange will qualify as a Reorganization.
However, there can be no assurance that the IRS or a U.S. court would not take a contrary view of the Exchange and the
Amalgamation Transactions.
There are many requirements that must be satisfied for a transaction to qualify as a Reorganization for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. Among them is the requirement that First Majestic must acquire “substantially all” of the assets of SilverCrest
(the “Substantially All Assets Requirement”) in order for tax-deferred treatment to apply. In determining whether First
Majestic will acquire the requisite amount of SilverCrest’s assets, certain assets will not be considered as SilverCrest
assets acquired by First Majestic, including, without limitation, the New SilverCrest Shares distributed to SilverCrest
Shareholders and any cash or other assets directly or indirectly paid or otherwise transferred by SilverCrest to any
SilverCrest Shareholder. For ruling purposes, the IRS defines “substantially all” as at least 70% of the gross assets and at
least 90% of the net assets of SilverCrest. Thus, if the fair market value of the New SilverCrest Shares distributed to
SilverCrest Shareholders is significant, the Exchange may fail to qualify as a Reorganization solely by reason of a failure to
satisfy the Substantially All Assets Requirement. In that case, the Exchange would constitute a fully taxable transaction for
U.S. Holders of SilverCrest Shares (see “Taxable Exchange Treatment” below). If the fair market value of the SilverCrest
Shares on the Effective Date approximately equals the value of the SilverCrest Shares on the date of this Circular, First
Majestic and SilverCrest believe that the Substantially All Assets Requirement should be satisfied. The Exchange may fail
to qualify as a Reorganization for reasons other than a failure to satisfy the Substantially All Assets Requirement.
- 89 -
If the Exchange, considered as part of a single integrated transaction with the Amalgamation Transactions qualifies as a
Reorganization, and subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications referred to herein and the PFIC rules
discussed below, the Exchange would result in the following United States federal income tax consequences to U.S.
Holders:
Gain (but not loss) will be recognized in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the sum of (x) the fair
market value of the First Majestic Shares and (y) the U.S. dollar amount of the cash received and fair market value of the
New SilverCrest Shares received in the Exchange that are attributable to the historic assets of First Majestic (without
reduction for any Canadian income tax withheld) (“New SilverCrest Share Consideration”), over (B) the tax basis of such
·
U.S. Holder in the SilverCrest Shares exchanged pursuant to the Exchange, or (ii) the fair market value of such New
SilverCrest Share Consideration plus the cash received in the Exchange (without reduction for any Canadian income tax
withheld).
The aggregate tax basis of the First Majestic Shares that a U.S. Holder of SilverCrest Shares receives in exchange for its
·
SilverCrest Shares will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of its SilverCrest Shares exchanged, increased by the
amount of gain (if any) recognized by such U.S. Holder in the Arrangement.
The holding period for First Majestic Shares received in the Arrangement will include the U.S. Holder’s holding period for
·
the SilverCrest Shares surrendered pursuant to the Arrangement.
The aggregate tax basis of the New SilverCrest Shares received by a U.S. Holder will be equal to the fair market value of
·
such New SilverCrest Shares at the time of receipt.
The holding period of a U.S. Holder for the New SilverCrest Shares acquired by a U.S. Holder will begin on the day after
·
the date of receipt.
U.S. Holders that exchange SilverCrest Shares for First Majestic Shares pursuant to the Exchange generally will be
·
required to report certain information to the IRS on their U.S. federal income tax returns for the taxable year in which the
Exchange occurs, and to retain certain records related to the Exchange.
U.S. Holders that own, directly, indirectly, or by attribution, 5% or more, by voting power or value, of the outstanding First
Majestic Shares after the Effective Time will be required to enter into a “gain recognition agreement” within the meaning of
·
Section 1.367(a)-8 of the U.S. Treasury Regulations in order to benefit from Reorganization treatment. If such a U.S. Holder
does not enter into a “gain recognition agreement,” the transaction will be a taxable transaction with respect to that U.S.
Holder with the consequences described in “Taxable Exchange Treatment” below.
If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of SilverCrest Shares at different times or at different prices, such U.S. Holder’s
tax basis and holding period in its First Majestic Shares may be determined with reference to each block of SilverCrest
·
Shares exchanged.
The IRS could challenge a U.S. Holder’s treatment of the Exchange as a Reorganization. If this treatment were successfully
challenged, then the Exchange would be treated as a fully taxable transaction, with the consequences to U.S. Holders
discussed immediately below (including the recognition of any realized gain).
Taxable Exchange Treatment
Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, if the Exchange fails to qualify as a Reorganization, the Exchange
would constitute a taxable disposition of SilverCrest Shares by U.S. Holders and would result in the following
United States federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders:
A U.S. Holder would recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the sum of the fair market
value of the First Majestic Shares, the New SilverCrest Share Consideration and the United States dollar value on the
·
Effective Date of the Canadian currency received in the Exchange, and (ii) the adjusted tax basis (expressed in United
States dollars) of such U.S. Holder in the SilverCrest Shares exchanged therefor;
- 90 -
The aggregate tax basis of the First Majestic Shares received by a U.S. Holder in the Exchange would be equal to the fair
·
market value of the First Majestic Shares at the time of receipt; and
The holding period of the First Majestic Shares received by a U.S. Holder in the Exchange would begin on the day after
·
receipt.
Subject to the PFIC rules discussed blow, any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder in the Exchange would be long-
term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for such SilverCrest Shares was more than one year at the
Effective Date. Preferential tax rates for long-term capital gains are generally applicable to a U.S. Holder that is an
individual, estate or trust. There are currently no preferential tax rates for long-term capital gains applicable to a U.S. Holder
that is a corporation. Deductions for capital losses are subject to significant limitations.
Distributions with Respect to First Majestic Shares
Subject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations,” the gross amount of
distributions, if any, payable on First Majestic Shares generally will be treated as a foreign-source dividend income to the
extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax rules, and
generally will be “passive income” for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. A distribution on First Majestic Shares in excess of
current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in such shares and, to the extent in excess of adjusted tax basis, as capital gain. See “Sale or Other
Disposition of First Majestic Shares” below. However, First Majestic may not maintain the calculations of earnings and
profits in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles, and each U.S. Holder therefore may have to assume that any
distribution by First Majestic with respect to First Majestic Shares will constitute ordinary dividend income. Dividends
received on the First Majestic Shares generally will not constitute qualified dividend income eligible for the “dividends
received deduction.”
A dividend paid by First Majestic to a U.S. Holder who is an individual, estate or trust generally will be taxed at the
preferential tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains if First Majestic is a “qualified foreign corporation” (“QFC”) and
certain holding period requirements for the U.S. Holder’s shares and other requirements are met. A corporation generally
will be a QFC if the corporation is eligible for the benefits of the Canada-US Tax Convention or its shares are readily
tradable on an established securities market in the U.S. However, even if First Majestic satisfies one or more of these
requirements, First Majestic would not be treated as a QFC if either corporation is a PFIC for the tax year during which First
Majestic pays a dividend or for the preceding tax year. (See the section below under the heading “Passive Foreign
Investment Company Considerations.”) The dividend rules are complex, and each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax
advisor regarding the application of such rules.
Canadian withholding tax on dividend distributions paid by First Majestic to a U.S. Holder generally may be reduced to 15%
pursuant to the Canada-U.S. Tax Convention in the case of U.S. Holders who are eligible for benefits under the Canada-
U.S. Tax Convention. A U.S. Holder generally may treat the amount of any Canadian income taxes withheld from
distributions with respect to the First Majestic Shares either as a deduction from gross income or as a dollar-for-dollar credit
against such holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, subject to numerous and complex limitations and restrictions, which
must be determined and applied on an individual basis by each U.S. Holder. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should consult their
own tax advisers concerning the foreign tax credit rules in light of their particular circumstances.
Sale or Other Disposition of First Majestic Shares
Subject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations”, a U.S. Holder who sells or
otherwise disposes of First Majestic Shares in a taxable disposition will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference, if
any, between the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on such sale or other taxable disposition and the U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis in such shares. Subject to the PFIC rules, any such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be
long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period for the First Majestic Shares is more than one year at the
time of the sale or other disposition. For non-corporate U.S. Holders, long-term capital gains recognized in connection with
a sale or other disposition of First Majestic Shares generally will be taxed at preferential capital gain rates. The deductibility
of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any such gain or loss generally will be treated as U.S.-source income for U.S.
foreign tax credit purposes, although special rules apply to U.S. Holders who have a fixed place of business outside the
United States to which the gain is attributable. Special considerations may apply to a U.S. Holder who receives foreign
currency in connection with a sale or other taxable disposition of common shares. See “Foreign Currency Considerations”
below.
- 91 -
Receipt of New SilverCrest Shares Pursuant to the Arrangement
Because of the form of the distribution of New SilverCrest Shares and the fact that the assets of New SilverCrest will
consist, in part, of historic First Majestic assets, the treatment of the distribution of New SilverCrest Shares with regard to
U.S. Holders receiving such shares is not clear. Specifically, upon the receipt of the distribution of New SilverCrest Shares,
U.S. Holders receiving such shares may be treated as receiving: (a) additional consideration paid by First Majestic to U.S.
Holders for their SilverCrest Shares in the Exchange to the extent that the value of the New SilverCrest Shares is
attributable to the historic assets of First Majestic, with the remaining value of such New SilverCrest Shares treated as a
taxable distribution under Section 302 or under Section 301 of the Code; (b) additional consideration paid by First Majestic
to U.S. Holders for their SilverCrest Shares in the Exchange to the extent of the entire value of the New SilverCrest Shares;
or (c) a separate taxable distribution under Section 302 or under Section 301 of the Code to the extent of the entire value of
the New SilverCrest Shares (because the distribution would not qualify as a tax-free spin-off under Section 355 of the
Code). Although the matter is unclear, to the extent that the value of the New SilverCrest Shares distributed to U.S. Holders
is attributable to the historic assets of First Majestic, this summary assumes that such New SilverCrest Shares will be
treated as additional consideration paid by First Majestic to U.S. Holders for their SilverCrest Shares in the Exchange. Each
U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the receipt of New
SilverCrest Shares in connection with the Exchange.
Tax Consequences of the Distribution of New SilverCrest Shares if the Exchange Qualifies as a Reorganization
To the extent that the distribution of New SilverCrest Shares is treated as additional consideration paid by First Majestic to
U.S. Holders for their SilverCrest Shares in the Exchange, the U.S. federal income tax consequences would be as
described above under the heading “Receipt of First Majestic Shares and Cash Pursuant to the Arrangement -
Reorganization Treatment.”
To the extent that all or a portion of the distribution of New SilverCrest Shares is treated as a distribution under Section 302
of the Code, rather than as additional consideration paid by First Majestic to U.S. Holders for their SilverCrest Shares, a
U.S. Holder of SilverCrest Shares will be treated as if it had sold or exchanged a portion of its SilverCrest Shares for the
distributed New SilverCrest Shares.
To the extent that all or a portion of the distribution of New SilverCrest Shares is not treated as additional consideration paid
by First Majestic to U.S. Holders for their SilverCrest Shares, but is instead treated as a taxable distribution under Section
301 of the Code, a U.S. Holder of SilverCrest Shares would be treated as receiving a distribution from SilverCrest in an
amount equal to the fair market value of the New SilverCrest Shares received (without reduction for any Canadian income
tax withheld). This distribution would be treated as a dividend to a U.S. Holder of SilverCrest Shares to the extent of
SilverCrest’s current or accumulated “earnings and profits” (as determined under the Code). To the extent that this
distribution exceeds SilverCrest’s current or accumulated “earnings and profits”, such distribution generally will be treated
first as a non-taxable return of capital with respect to a SilverCrest Share to the extent of such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax
basis in each such SilverCrest Share and then as a gain from the sale or exchange of each such SilverCrest Share.
Subject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations”, such gain generally would
be a capital gain, which would be long-term capital gain if such SilverCrest Shares have been held for more than one year
at the time of the distribution. Certain non-corporate U.S. Holders are entitled to preferential treatment for net long-term
capital gains. SilverCrest has not maintained and does not plan to maintain calculations of earnings and profits for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. Holder will generally be required to include the entire amount of any such
distribution in income as a dividend. Such distribution would not be eligible for the “dividends received deduction” under the
Code.
A distribution to a U.S. Holder with respect to a SilverCrest Share that is treated as a dividend generally will constitute
income from sources outside the United States and generally will be categorized for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes as
“passive category income” or, in the case of some U.S. Holders, as “general category income”. Distributions treated as
dividends that are received by certain non-corporate U.S. persons (including individuals) in respect of stock of a non-U.S.
corporation (other than a corporation that is, in the taxable year during which the distributions are made or the preceding
taxable year, a PFIC) that is a “qualified foreign corporation” generally qualify for a preferential tax rate (plus, potentially,
additional tax discussed below under “Medicare Taxes”) so long as certain holding period and other requirements are met.
A qualified foreign corporation includes a foreign corporation that is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax
treaty with the United States which the United States Treasury Department determines to be satisfactory for these purposes
and which includes an exchange of information provision. The United States Treasury Department has determined that the
U.S. Treaty meets these requirements and SilverCrest believes that it is eligible for the benefits of the U.S. Treaty.
- 92 -
However, SilverCrest would not be a qualified foreign corporation and the preferential tax rate would not be available if,
SilverCrest is a PFIC for the current year or the preceding taxable year. See “Passive Foreign Investment Company
Considerations”. If a dividend qualifies for the preferential rate, special rules apply for purposes of determining the
recipient’s investment income (which may limit deductions for investment interest) and foreign income (which may affect the
amount of U.S. foreign tax credit) and to certain extraordinary dividends. Each U.S. Holder that is a non-corporate taxpayer
should consult its own tax advisor regarding the possible applicability of the reduced tax rate and the related restrictions and
special rules.
In such cases, the tax basis of a U.S. Holder in each of the New SilverCrest Shares should be equal to the fair market value
of the New SilverCrest Shares on the date of receipt, and the holding period of a U.S. Holder in the New SilverCrest Shares
should begin on the day after the date of receipt.
Tax Consequences of the Distribution of New SilverCrest Shares if the Exchange Fails to Qualify as a Reorganization
To the extent that all or a portion of the distribution of New SilverCrest Shares is treated as additional consideration in
exchange for SilverCrest Shares or a taxable distribution under Section 302 of the Code, the tax consequences to U.S.
Holders of the distribution of New SilverCrest Shares received are discussed above under the heading “Taxable Exchange
Treatment.”
To the extent that all or a portion of the distribution of New SilverCrest Shares is treated as a taxable distribution under
Section 301 of the Code, the tax consequences are discussed above under the heading “Tax Consequences of the
Distribution of New SilverCrest Shares if the Exchange Qualifies as a Reorganization.”
In such cases, the tax basis of a U.S. Holder in each of the New SilverCrest Shares should be equal to the fair market value
of the New SilverCrest Shares on the date of receipt, and the holding period of a U.S. Holder in the New SilverCrest Shares
should begin on the day after the date of receipt. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the receipt of New SilverCrest Shares in connection with the Exchange.
Distributions with respect to New SilverCrest Shares
Subject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations”, a U.S. Holder that receives
a distribution of cash or other property (other than certain distributions of New SilverCrest stock or rights to acquire New
SilverCrest stock) with respect to a New SilverCrest Share generally will be required to include the amount of such
distribution in gross income as a dividend under the rules discussed above under “Receipt of New SilverCrest Shares
Pursuant to the Arrangement”. New SilverCrest does not plan to maintain calculations of earnings and profits for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. Holder may be required to include the entire amount of any such
distribution in income as a dividend.
Sale, Exchange or Other Disposition of New SilverCrest Shares
Subject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations”, upon a sale, exchange or
other disposition of New SilverCrest Shares, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference
between the amount realized on such sale, exchange or other disposition and such U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such New
SilverCrest Shares. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder held such New
SilverCrest Shares for more than one year at the time of disposition. Certain non-corporate U.S. Holders are entitled to
preferential treatment for net long-term capital gains. The ability of a U.S. Holder to offset capital losses against ordinary
income is limited.
- 93 -
U.S. Holders Exercising Dissent Rights Pursuant to the Arrangement
A U.S. Holder of SilverCrest Shares that exercises Dissent Rights in the Arrangement and is paid cash in exchange for all
of its SilverCrest Shares generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the
amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in exchange for SilverCrest Shares (other than amounts, if any, that are or are
deemed to be interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which amounts will be taxed as ordinary income) and (ii) the tax
basis of such U.S. Holder in such SilverCrest Shares surrendered. Preferential tax rates apply to long-term capital gains of a
U.S. Holder that is an individual, estate, or trust. There are no preferential tax rates for long-term capital gains of a U.S.
Holder that is a corporation. Deductions for capital losses are subject to complex limitations under the Code. If SilverCrest
has been a PFIC at any time during which a U.S. Holder has held SilverCrest Shares, such gain, if any, will be taxable in
the manner described below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations.”
Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations
PFIC Status of SilverCrest
The tax consequences of the Arrangement to a particular U.S. Holder will depend on whether SilverCrest was a PFIC
during any year in which a U.S. Holder owned SilverCrest Shares, and, if so, whether First Majestic and/or New SilverCrest
is a PFIC at the time of the transaction pursuant to the Arrangement. In general, a non-U.S. corporation is a PFIC for any
taxable year in which either (i) 75% or more of the non-U.S. corporation’s gross income is passive income, or (ii) 50% or
more of the average quarterly value of the non-U.S. corporation’s assets produce or are held for the production of passive
income. Passive income includes, for example, dividends, interest, certain rents and royalties, certain gains from the sale of
stock and securities, and certain gains from commodities transactions, but passive income does not include gains from the
sale of commodities that arise in the active conduct of a commodities business by a non-U.S. corporation, provided that
certain other requirements are satisfied. In determining whether or not it is classified as a PFIC, a non-U.S. corporation must
take into account its pro rata portion of the income and assets of each corporation in which it owns, directly or indirectly, at
least a 25% interest by value. As described above, SilverCrest currently believes it is not a PFIC but may have been a PFIC
in years prior to 2011, and First Majestic believes it was not a PFIC in the prior tax year and will not be a PFIC for its current
taxable year.
U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding an
interest in a PFIC. The determination of PFIC status, however, is complex. PFIC classification is factual in nature, generally
cannot be determined until the close of the taxable year in question, and is determined annually.
Even if the Arrangement qualifies as a Reorganization, a U.S. Holder generally may recognize gain (but not loss) upon
exchanging its SilverCrest Shares for First Majestic Shares if First Majestic is not a PFIC for its taxable year in which the
Arrangement becomes effective. If SilverCrest were a PFIC during any year in which a U.S. Holder owned SilverCrest
Shares, and if First Majestic were not a PFIC at the time of the Exchange, then, in general, under proposed Treasury
Regulations, the amount of U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized by a U.S. Holder upon the consummation of the
Arrangement would be increased by an interest charge to compensate for tax deferral. The amount of income tax, before the
imposition of the interest charge, would be calculated as if such gain was earned ratably over the period the U.S. Holder
held its SilverCrest Shares, and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the highest rate applicable to ordinary
income for the relevant taxable years, regardless of the tax rate otherwise applicable to the U.S. Holder, subject to certain
exceptions. Similarly, if SilverCrest were a PFIC during any year in which a U.S. Holder owned SilverCrest Shares and First
Majestic were a PFIC for its taxable year in which the Arrangement becomes effective, and the Arrangement does not
qualify as a Reorganization, then a U.S. Holder should be subject to the rules described below discussing the PFIC status
of First Majestic. However, if SilverCrest were a PFIC during any year in which a U.S. Holder owned SilverCrest Shares,
and First Majestic were a PFIC for its taxable year in which the Arrangement becomes effective, and the Arrangement
qualifies as a Reorganization, a U.S. Holder should be subject to the rules described above discussing the Reorganization
treatment.
U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the consequences of the Arrangement under the PFIC rules.
- 94 -
PFIC Status of First Majestic
If First Majestic is a PFIC during any year in which a U.S. Holder owns First Majestic Shares, then gain on a disposition or
deemed disposition by the U.S. Holder of such First Majestic Shares, and certain distributions payable on such First
Majestic Shares, would be subject to tax as an “excess distribution” allocated ratably to all days in the U.S. Holder’s holding
period and taxable at the highest marginal rates applicable to ordinary income for the “prior-year PFIC period” (i.e., days in
the U.S. Holder’s prior taxable years during which the company was a PFIC), and would be subject to an interest charge
levied as an additional tax, unless the U.S. Holder timely makes a Mark-to-Market Election or a QEF Election.
First Majestic does not believe that it was a PFIC for its previous taxable year and does not expect to be a PFIC for the
current taxable year. However, the determination of PFIC status is fundamentally factual in nature, depends on the
application of complex U.S. federal income tax rules which are subject to differing interpretations, and generally cannot be
determined until the close of the taxable year in question. Consequently, no assurance can be provided that First Majestic is
not, and will not be, classified as a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds First Majestic Shares. U.S.
Holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the consequences of the Arrangement and of the ownership and
disposition of First Majestic Shares under the PFIC rules.
PFIC Status of New SilverCrest
Based on its projected income, assets and activities, SilverCrest believes that New SilverCrest is likely to be treated as a
PFIC for the current taxable year and may be treated as a PFIC for future years. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding an interest in a PFIC.
The determination of whether any corporation was, or will be, a PFIC for a tax year depends, in part, on the application of
complex U.S. federal income tax rules, which are subject to differing interpretations. In addition, whether any corporation will
be a PFIC for any tax year depends on the assets and income of such corporation over the course of each such tax year
and, as a result, cannot be predicted with certainty as of the date of this document. Accordingly, there can be no assurance
that the IRS will not challenge any determination made by First Majestic, SilverCrest, or New SilverCrest (or any subsidiary
of First Majestic or New SilverCrest) concerning its PFIC status. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisors
regarding the PFIC status of First Majestic, SilverCrest or New SilverCrest and any subsidiary of First Majestic or New
SilverCrest.
Distributions
In the event that SilverCrest or New SilverCrest is treated as a PFIC with respect to a U.S. Holder, distributions by
SilverCrest or New SilverCrest (as applicable) to such U.S. Holder (without reduction for any non-U.S. tax withheld from the
distribution), including the distribution of New SilverCrest Shares pursuant to the Arrangement, generally will be treated as
an ‘‘excess distribution’’ to the extent the distribution does not exceed its ratable portion of the ‘‘total excess distribution’’ to
such U.S. Holder for such taxable year. This determination is made with respect to a U.S. Holder on a share-by-share basis,
except that shares with the same holding period may be aggregated. The total excess distribution to a U.S. Holder with
respect to a share for a taxable year is generally the excess of (i) all distributions to such U.S. Holder on such share during
such taxable year over (ii) 125% of the average annual distributions to such U.S. Holder on such share during the preceding
three taxable years (or shorter period during which such U.S. Holder held such share). The total excess distribution with
respect to a share is deemed to be zero for the taxable year in which such U.S. Holder’s holding period for such share
begins. The tax payable by a U.S. Holder on an excess distribution with respect to a share will be determined by allocating
such excess distribution ratably to each day of such U.S. Holder’s holding period for such share. The amount of excess
distribution allocated to the taxable year of such distribution will be included as ordinary income for the taxable year of such
distribution. The amount of excess distribution allocated to any other period included in such U.S. Holder’s holding period
cannot be offset by any net operating losses of such U.S. Holder and will be taxed at the highest marginal rates applicable
to ordinary income for each such period and, in addition, an interest charge will be imposed on the amount of tax so derived
for each such period. Furthermore, only the portion of any excess distribution includable in income in the taxable year of
such distribution will be taken into account in determining the amount of the total excess distribution for any subsequent
taxable year.
- 95 -
If the distribution of New SilverCrest Shares to a U.S. Holder is treated as a taxable dividend under the Tax Act and is
subject to Canadian withholding tax, such U.S. Holder may be entitled to a foreign tax credit. The rules governing foreign
tax credits with respect to distributions from a PFIC are very complicated, and U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors about these rules, including the availability of a foreign tax credit.
To the extent a distribution to a U.S. Holder is not treated as an excess distribution, such U.S. Holder generally will be
required to include the amount of such distribution in gross income as a dividend pursuant to the rules discussed above
under “Distributions with Respect to New SilverCrest Shares” and “Receipt of New SilverCrest Shares Pursuant to the
Arrangement”.
Sale or Other Disposition of Shares
A U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the sale, exchange or other
disposition (including, without limitation, gain with respect to certain transfers upon death, gifts and pledges) of a SilverCrest
Share or New SilverCrest Share in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on the sale,
exchange or other disposition and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such share. Any such gain generally will be
treated as an excess distribution subject to the tax consequences relating to an excess distribution described above under
“Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations - Distributions.” Any such loss generally will be treated as a capital
loss. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Qualified Electing Fund Election
In the event that First Majestic, SilverCrest or New SilverCrest were to be treated as a PFIC, the tax consequences
described above in “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations - Distributions” and “Passive Foreign Investment
Company Considerations - Sale or Other Disposition of Shares” relating to distributions from a PFIC and gain on the
disposition of shares in a PFIC generally would not apply if a QEF Election to treat First Majestic, SilverCrest or New
SilverCrest, as applicable, as a “qualified electing fund” under Section 1295 of the Code (a “QEF”, and such an election, a
“QEF Election”) were available and a U.S. Holder had validly made such an election as of the beginning of such U.S.
Holder’s holding period for the First Majestic Shares, SilverCrest Shares or New SilverCrest Shares, as the case may be. In
such event, such U.S. Holder generally would be required to include in income on a current basis such U.S. Holder’s pro
rata share of First Majestic’s, SilverCrest’s or New SilverCrest’s ordinary income and net capital gains in each taxable year
in which First Majestic, SilverCrest or New SilverCrest was a PFIC. A QEF Election would be available to a U.S. Holder,
however, only if First Majestic, SilverCrest or New SilverCrest agrees to provide such U.S. Holder with certain information.
There can be no assurance that First Majestic, SilverCrest or New SilverCrest will provide U.S. Holders with the required
information and U.S. Holders should assume that a QEF Election will not be available.
Mark-To-Market Election
The tax consequences relating to excess distributions described above under “Passive Foreign Investment Company
Considerations - Distributions” and “Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations - Sale or Other Disposition of
Shares” generally will not apply if a “Mark-to-Market Election” under Section 1296 of the Code (a “Mark-to-Market
Election”) is available and a U.S. Holder has validly made such an election as of the beginning of such U.S. Holder’s
holding period for a First Majestic Share, SilverCrest Share or New SilverCrest Share, as the case may be. If such election
is made, distributions with respect to a First Majestic Share, SilverCrest Share or New SilverCrest Share and gain on the
sale, exchange or other disposition of a First Majestic Share, SilverCrest Share or New SilverCrest Share will not be treated
as excess distributions to such U.S. Holder. Instead, such U.S. Holder generally would be required to take into account the
difference, if any, between the fair market value of, and its adjusted tax basis in, such First Majestic Share, SilverCrest
Share or New SilverCrest Share at the end of each taxable year in which First Majestic, SilverCrest or New SilverCrest is a
PFIC as ordinary income or, to the extent of any net mark-to-market gains previously included in income, ordinary loss, and
to make corresponding adjustments to the tax basis in such First Majestic Share, SilverCrest Share or New SilverCrest
Share. In addition, any gain from a sale, exchange or other disposition of a First Majestic Share, SilverCrest Share or New
SilverCrest Share in a taxable year in which First Majestic, SilverCrest or New SilverCrest is a PFIC would be treated as
ordinary income, and any loss from such sale, exchange or other disposition would be treated first as ordinary loss to the
extent of any net mark-to-market gains previously included in income and thereafter as capital loss. A Mark-to-Market
Election is available to a U.S. Holder with respect to a First Majestic Share, SilverCrest Share or New SilverCrest Share
only if such share is considered to be “marketable stock”. Generally, stock is considered to be marketable stock if it is
“regularly traded” on a “qualified exchange” within the meaning of applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations. A class of stock is
regularly traded during any calendar year during which such class of stock is traded, other than in de minimis quantities, on
at least 15 days during each calendar quarter. A non-U.S. securities exchange constitutes a qualified exchange if it is
regulated or supervised by a governmental authority of the country in which the securities exchange is located and meets
certain trading, listing, financial disclosure and other requirements set forth in U.S. Treasury Regulations. The SilverCrest
Shares are listed on the TSX (symbol: SVL). The New SilverCrest Shares are not currently listed. While it is intended that
an application to list the New SilverCrest Shares will be made, there can be no assurance as to if, or when, the New
SilverCrest Shares will be listed or traded. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor with respect to the
availability and tax consequences of a Mark-to-Market Election with respect to a First Majestic Share, SilverCrest Share or
New SilverCrest Share.
- 96 -
Investment by New SilverCrest in other PFICs
New SilverCrest may acquire interests in entities that are PFICs. The rules relating to an excess distribution described
above under “Receipt of New SilverCrest Shares Pursuant to the Arrangement” generally will apply to direct and indirect
dispositions of New SilverCrest’s interests in such other entities (including dispositions by a U.S. Holder of New SilverCrest
Shares and dispositions by New SilverCrest of its interests in such entities) and distributions by such entities. If a U.S.
Holder owns PFIC stock indirectly through another PFIC, separate QEF Elections must be made for the PFIC in which such
U.S. Holder is a direct shareholder and the PFIC in which such U.S. Holder is an indirect shareholder for the QEF rules to
apply to both PFICs. A Mark-to-Market Election will not apply to PFICs in which such U.S. Holder is an indirect shareholder,
as stock of such PFICs will not be “marketable stock.” U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax
consequences to them of New SilverCrest’s investment in other PFICs.
Foreign Tax Credit
A U.S. Holder that pays (whether directly or through withholding) Canadian income tax in connection with the Arrangement
or in connection with the ownership or disposition of First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest Shares may be entitled, at the
election of such U.S. Holder, to receive either a deduction or a credit for such Canadian income tax paid. Generally, a credit
will reduce a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis, whereas a deduction will reduce a
U.S. Holder’s income subject to U.S. federal income tax. This election is made on a year-by-year basis and applies to all
foreign taxes paid (whether directly or through withholding) by a U.S. Holder during a tax year.
Complex limitations apply to the foreign tax credit, including the general limitation that the credit cannot exceed the
proportionate share of a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability that such U.S. Holder’s “foreign source” taxable
income bears to such U.S. Holder’s worldwide taxable income. In applying this limitation, a U.S. Holder’s various items of
income and deduction must be classified, under complex rules, as either “foreign source” or “U.S. source.” Generally,
dividends paid by a foreign corporation should be treated as foreign source for this purpose, and gains recognized on the
sale of stock of a foreign corporation by a U.S. Holder should be treated as U.S. source for this purpose, except as
otherwise provided in an applicable income tax treaty, and if an election is properly made under the Code. However, the
amount of a distribution with respect to the SilverCrest Shares, First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest Shares that is
treated as a “dividend” may be lower for U.S. federal income tax purposes than it is for Canadian federal income tax
purposes, resulting in a reduced foreign tax credit allowance to a U.S. Holder. In addition, this limitation is calculated
separately with respect to specific categories of income. The foreign tax credit rules are complex, and each U.S. Holder
should consult its own U.S. tax advisor regarding the foreign tax credit rules.
Medicare Taxes
In addition to regular U.S. federal income tax, certain U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts are subject to a
3.8% tax on all or a portion of their “net investment income,” which may include all or a portion of their income arising from a
distribution with respect to SilverCrest Shares, First Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares and net gain from the
sale, exchange or other disposition of SilverCrest Shares, First Majestic Shares and New SilverCrest Shares. Special rules
apply to PFICs. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the application of this tax.
- 97 -
Foreign Currency Considerations
A U.S. Holder that receives Canadian dollars and converts such Canadian dollars into U.S. dollars on the day the amount is
otherwise includible in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally will not be required to recognize gain or loss
arising from exchange rate fluctuations. A U.S. Holder that receives Canadian dollars and converts them into U.S. dollars
subsequent to such day will generally have foreign exchange gain or loss based on any appreciation or depreciation in the
value of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar (subject to certain de minimis exceptions), which generally will be U.S.-
source ordinary gain or loss.
Non-U.S. Holders
Exchange of SilverCrest Shares and Exercise of Dissent Rights
In general, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the exchange of
SilverCrest Shares for First Majestic Shares, cash and New SilverCrest Shares pursuant to the Arrangement or upon the
receipt of cash from SilverCrest as a result of such Non-U.S. Holder’s exercise of Dissent Rights.
Ownership and Disposition of First Majestic Shares
In general, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on distributions from First Majestic or upon any
gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of First Majestic Shares.
Ownership and Disposition of New SilverCrest Shares
In general, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on distributions from New SilverCrest or upon
any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of New SilverCrest Shares.
Information Reporting, Backup Withholding and Other Reporting Requirements
U.S. Holders of SilverCrest Shares who exercise Dissent Rights may be subject to information withholding and may be
subject to backup withholding, currently at a rate up to 28%, on any cash payments received in exchange for SilverCrest
Shares.
Payments of distributions on, or the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of, SilverCrest Shares, First Majestic Shares
or New SilverCrest Shares, paid within the United States may be subject to information reporting and may be subject to
backup withholding. Payments of distributions on, or the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, SilverCrest Shares,
First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest Shares to or through a foreign office of a broker generally will not be subject to
backup withholding, although information reporting may apply to those payments in certain circumstances.
Backup withholding generally will not apply, however, to a U.S. Holder who:
furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that he, she or it is not subject to backup withholding on IRS
·
Form W-9 (or substitute form); or
· is otherwise exempt from backup withholding.
Non-U.S. Holders generally will not be subject to U.S. information reporting or backup withholding. However, such holders
may be required to provide certification of non-U.S. status (generally, on IRS Form W-8) in connection with payments
received in the United States or through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld from a payment to a holder under the backup
withholding rules may be credited against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, and a holder may obtain a refund of
any excess amounts withheld by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS in a timely manner and furnishing any
required information. Each U.S. Holder should consult its own tax advisor regarding the information reporting and backup
withholding rules in their particular circumstances and the availability of and procedures for obtaining an exemption from
backup withholding.
- 98 -
Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals must report information relating to an interest in “specified foreign financial
assets,” including shares issued by a non-U.S. corporation, for any year in which the aggregate value of all specified foreign
financial assets exceeds certain threshold amounts, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for ordinary
shares held in custodial accounts maintained with a U.S. financial institution). Penalties may be imposed for a failure to
disclose such information. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the effect, if any, of these additional
reporting requirements on their ownership and disposition of SilverCrest Shares, First Majestic Shares or New SilverCrest
Shares.
A U.S. Holder who owns SilverCrest Shares or New SilverCrest Shares during any taxable year in which SilverCrest or
New SilverCrest is treated as a PFIC with respect to such U.S. Holder generally would be required to file statements with
respect to such shares on IRS Form 8621 with their U.S. federal income tax returns. Failure to file such statements may
result in the extension of the period of limitations on assessment and collection of U.S. federal income taxes.
The discussion of reporting requirements set forth above is not intended to constitute an exhaustive description of all
reporting requirements that may apply to a U.S. Holder. A failure to satisfy certain reporting requirements may result in an
extension of the time period during which the IRS can assess a tax, and under certain circumstances, such an extension
may apply to assessments of amounts unrelated to any unsatisfied reporting requirement. Each U.S. Holder should consult
its own tax advisors regarding the information reporting and backup withholding rules.

Risk Factors
In addition to the risk factors described in the SilverCrest AIF and the First Majestic AIF under the heading “Risk Factors”
which are specifically incorporated by reference into this Circular and the risk factors described in “Appendix H –
Information Concerning New SilverCrest Post-Arrangement – Risk Factors”, the following are additional and supplemental
risk factors which First Majestic Shareholders should carefully consider before making a decision regarding approving the
First Majestic Resolution and which SilverCrest Shareholders should carefully consider before making a decision regarding
approving the Arrangement Resolution. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those currently unknown or considered
immaterial by First Majestic, SilverCrest and New SilverCrest, may also adversely affect the SilverCrest Shares, the First
Majestic Shares, the New SilverCrest Shares and/or the businesses of First Majestic and New SilverCrest following the
Arrangement. If any of the risk factors materialize, the expectations, and the predictions based on them, may need to be re-
evaluated.
Risk Factors Relating to the Arrangement
There can be no certainty that the Arrangement will be completed
Completion of the Arrangement is subject to a number of conditions, certain of which are outside the control of both First
Majestic and SilverCrest, including, without limitation, the requisite approvals of the First Majestic Shareholders and the
SilverCrest Shareholders and the receipt of the Final Order and receipt of the Mexican Antitrust Clearance. There can be no
certainty, nor can First Majestic or SilverCrest provide any assurance, that these conditions will be satisfied or, if satisfied,
when they will be satisfied.
Each of First Majestic and SilverCrest has the right to terminate the Arrangement Agreement in certain circumstances.
Accordingly, there is no certainty, nor can either party provide any assurance, that the Arrangement Agreement will not be
terminated by the other party before completion of the Arrangement.
If the Arrangement is not completed for any reason, the market price of the First Majestic Shares and the SilverCrest Shares
may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Arrangement will be completed,
and their respective businesses may suffer. In addition, First Majestic and SilverCrest will each remain liable for significant
consulting, accounting and legal costs relating to the Arrangement and will not realize anticipated synergies, growth
opportunities and other benefits of the Arrangement in the event that the Arrangement is not completed. If the Arrangement
is not completed and the SilverCrest Board decides to seek another merger or arrangement, there can be no assurance that
it will be able to find a party willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive price than the total consideration to be paid
pursuant to the Arrangement. If the Arrangement is delayed, the achievement of synergies and the realization of growth
opportunities could be delayed and may not be available to the same extent.
- 100 -
The Termination Payment provided under the Arrangement Agreement may discourage other parties from attempting to
acquire SilverCrest and could have an adverse effect on its financial condition
Under the Arrangement Agreement, SilverCrest would be required to pay a termination payment of C$8,000,000 in the
event the Arrangement Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances. This Termination Payment may discourage other
parties from attempting to acquire SilverCrest or otherwise make an Acquisition Proposal to SilverCrest, even if those
parties would otherwise be willing to offer greater value than that offered under the Arrangement. Payment of this amount
could also have an adverse effect on SilverCrest’s financial condition following any such termination of the Arrangement
Agreement.
SilverCrest directors and executive officers may have interests in the Arrangement that are different from those of the
SilverCrest Shareholders
In considering the recommendation of the SilverCrest Board to vote for the Arrangement Resolution, SilverCrest
Shareholders should be aware that certain SilverCrest executive officers have agreements or arrangements that provide
them with interests in the Arrangement that differ from, or are in addition to, those of SilverCrest Shareholders generally.
See “The Arrangement – Interests of Certain Persons in the Arrangement”.
There is a risk that the Exchange will be a fully taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes
First Majestic and SilverCrest intend that the Exchange qualify as part of a partially tax-deferred Reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code if the Substantially All Assets Requirement is satisfied and the Amalgamation Transactions
occur as intended by First Majestic. However, there is a risk that the Arrangement could fail to so qualify and could be a fully
taxable transaction. Even if the Arrangement does qualify as a tax-deferred Reorganization, a U.S. Holder (as defined in
“Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” below) will be subject to U.S. tax in connection with its receipt
of the cash and the New SilverCrest Share Consideration. In addition, regardless of whether the Exchange qualifies as a
Reorganization, if it is determined that SilverCrest is a PFIC (or was a PFIC for any year during a U.S. Holder’s holding
period in SilverCrest Shares), the transactions contemplated herein may result in the application of certain adverse tax rules
in respect of the Exchange to a U.S. Holder if the U.S. Holder does not have in effect a “QEF Election” or a “Mark-to-Market
Election” (each as defined under “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” below) with respect to its
SilverCrest Shares. These adverse tax rules include, but are not limited to, (a) the gain resulting from the Arrangement
being fully taxable at ordinary income rather than capital gain rates and (b) an interest charge being imposed on the amount
of the gain treated as being deferred under the PFIC rules. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding all
aspects of the Reorganization and PFIC rules. For a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of the Exchange, including the consequences under the PFIC rules, see “Certain United States Federal Income Tax
Considerations”.
It is expected that New SilverCrest will be a PFIC for the current taxable year and may be a PFIC in subsequent years,
which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for U.S. Holders
Based on current business plans and financial expectations, SilverCrest expects that New SilverCrest will be a PFIC for the
current tax year and may be a PFIC in subsequent years, which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences
for U.S. Holders. If New SilverCrest is a PFIC for any year during a U.S. Holder’s (as defined under “Certain United States
Federal Income Tax Considerations”) holding period, then that U.S. Holder generally will be subject to a special adverse tax
regime with respect to so-called “excess distributions” received on New SilverCrest Shares. Gain realized upon a
disposition of New SilverCrest Shares (including upon certain dispositions that would otherwise be tax-deferred) also will
be treated as excess distributions. Further, distributions from a PFIC will not qualify for preferential tax rates as “qualified
dividends.” For a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Arrangement, including the
consequences under the PFIC rules, see “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations”.
- 101 -
A U.S. Holder of PFIC shares may make a “QEF Election” or a “Mark-to-Market Election” (each as defined under “Certain
United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” below) with respect to such shares to mitigate the adverse tax rules that
apply to PFICs. These elections may accelerate the recognition of taxable income and may result in the recognition of
ordinary income. A U.S. Holder who makes a QEF Election generally must report on a current basis its pro rata share of net
capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which New SilverCrest is a PFIC, whether or not New SilverCrest
distributes any amounts to its shareholders. A U.S. Holder may make a QEF election only if the U.S. Holder receives certain
information (known as a “PFIC annual information statement”) from New SilverCrest annually. There can be no assurance
that New SilverCrest, if it were classified as a PFIC, will supply the information and statements necessary for the U.S.
Holder to make and maintain a valid QEF Election. A U.S. Holder who makes the Mark-to-Market Election generally must
include as ordinary income each year the excess of the fair market value of New SilverCrest Shares over the U.S. Holder’s
basis therein.
Risk Factors Relating to First Majestic Post-Arrangement
The value of the First Majestic Shares that SilverCrest Shareholders receive under the Arrangement, or of the First Majestic
Shares that existing First Majestic Shareholders retain following the Arrangement, may be less than the value of the
SilverCrest Shares or First Majestic Shares, as applicable, as of the date of the Arrangement Agreement or the dates of the
First Majestic Meeting and the SilverCrest Meeting
The consideration payable to SilverCrest Shareholders pursuant to the Arrangement is based on a fixed exchange ratio and
there will be no adjustment for changes in the market price of First Majestic Shares or SilverCrest Shares prior to the
consummation of the Arrangement. None of the parties are permitted to terminate the Arrangement Agreement and abandon
the Arrangement solely because of changes in the market price of the First Majestic Shares or SilverCrest Shares.
There may be a significant amount of time between the date when First Majestic Shareholders and SilverCrest
Shareholders vote at their respective shareholder meetings and the date on which the Arrangement is completed. As a
result, the relative or absolute prices of the First Majestic Shares or the SilverCrest Shares may fluctuate significantly
between the dates of the Arrangement Agreement, this Circular, the shareholder meetings and completion of the
Arrangement.
These fluctuations may be caused by, among other factors, changes in the businesses, operations, results and prospects of
the companies, market expectations of the likelihood that the Arrangement will be completed and the timing of its
completion, the prospects for First Majestic post-Arrangement operations, the effect of any conditions or restrictions imposed
on or proposed with respect to First Majestic post-Arrangement by governmental entities and general market and economic
conditions and the other risk factors set forth in the First Majestic AIF.
Historical market prices are not indicative of future market prices or the market value of the First Majestic Shares that
SilverCrest Shareholders will receive on completion of the Arrangement. There can be no assurance that the market value
of the First Majestic Shares that SilverCrest Shareholders will receive on completion of the Arrangement will equal or
exceed the market value of the SilverCrest Shares held by such SilverCrest Shareholders prior to such time. In addition,
there can be no assurance that the trading price of the First Majestic Shares will not decline following completion of the
Arrangement.
The integration of First Majestic and SilverCrest may not occur as planned
The ability to realize the benefits of the Arrangement including, among other things, those set forth in “Appendix F –
Information Relating to First Majestic Post-Arrangement” to this Circular will depend in part on successfully consolidating
functions and integrating operations, procedures and personnel in a timely and efficient manner, as well as on the First
Majestic’s ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and synergies, efficiencies and cost savings from integrating
First Majestic’s and SilverCrest’s businesses following completion of the Arrangement. This integration will require the
dedication of substantial management effort, time and resources which may divert management’s focus and resources from
other strategic opportunities following completion of the Arrangement and from operational matters during this process. The
integration process may result in the loss of key employees and the disruption of ongoing business and employee
relationships that may adversely affect the ability of First Majestic to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Arrangement.
- 102 -
First Majestic may not realize the benefits of its growth projects
As part of its strategy, First Majestic will continue its efforts to develop and acquire new mineral projects and will have an
expanded portfolio of such projects as a result of the acquisition of SilverCrest and the Santa Elena mine. A number of risks
and uncertainties are associated with the exploration, development and acquisition of these types of projects, including
political, regulatory, design, construction, labour, operating, technical and technological risks, uncertainties relating to
capital and other costs and financing risks.
The level of production and capital and operating cost estimates relating to the expanded portfolio of growth projects are
based on certain assumptions and are inherently subject to significant uncertainties. It is likely that actual results for First
Majestic’s projects will differ from its current estimates and assumptions, and these differences may be material. In addition,
experience from actual mining or processing operations may identify new or unexpected conditions which could reduce
production below, and/or increase capital and/or operating costs above, current estimates. If actual results are less
favourable than current estimates, the combined company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity
could be adversely impacted.
Mineral reserve and mineral resource figures pertaining to First Majestic’s and SilverCrest’s properties are only estimates
and are subject to revision based on developing information
Information pertaining to First Majestic’s and SilverCrest’s mineral reserves and mineral resources presented in this Circular
or incorporated by reference herein are estimates and no assurances can be given as to their accuracy. Such estimates are,
in large part, based on interpretations of geological data obtained from drill holes and other sampling techniques. Actual
mineralization or formations may be different from those predicted. Mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates are
materially dependent on the prevailing price of minerals (principally silver), and the cost of recovering and processing
minerals at the individual mine sites. Market fluctuations in the price of minerals (principally silver), or increases in recovery
costs, as well as various short-term operating factors, may cause a mining operation to be unprofitable in any particular
accounting period.
Following the Arrangement the market price of the First Majestic Shares may be volatile
The market price of the First Majestic Shares has been and may continue to be subject to material fluctuations and may
increase or decrease in response to a number of events and factors. Following the completion of the Arrangement, a
significant number of additional First Majestic Shares will be available for trading in the public market. The increase in the
number of First Majestic Shares may lead to sales of such shares or the perception that such sales may occur, either of
which may adversely affect the market for, and the market price of, First Majestic Shares. The potential that shareholders
may sell First Majestic Shares in the public market (commonly referred to as “market overhang”), as well as any actual sales
of such First Majestic Shares in the public market, could adversely affect the market price of the First Majestic Shares.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an
indication of First Majestic’s condition or results of operations following the Arrangement
The pro forma consolidated financial statements contained in this Circular are presented for illustrative purposes only and
may not be an accurate indication of First Majestic’s financial condition or results of operations following the Arrangement
for several reasons. The pro forma consolidated financial statements have been derived from the historical financial
statements of First Majestic and SilverCrest and certain assumptions have been made. The information upon which these
assumptions have been made is historical, preliminary and subject to change. Moreover, the pro forma consolidated
financial statements may not reflect all costs to be incurred by First Majestic and SilverCrest in connection with the
Arrangement. For example, the impact of any incremental costs incurred in integrating First Majestic and SilverCrest is not
reflected in the pro forma consolidated financial statements. In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma
consolidated financial information may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect First Majestic’s financial
condition or results of operations following the Arrangement. The market price of the First Majestic Shares may be adversely
affected if its actual results after the Arrangement fall short of the pro forma consolidated financial statements contained in
this Circular. See “Appendix F – Information Concerning First Majestic Post-Arrangement – Selected Unaudited Pro Forma
Consolidated Financial Information” and the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements of First Majestic
attached as Appendix G to this Circular.
- 103 -
First Majestic may be subject to significant capital requirements and operating risks associated with its expanded
operations
First Majestic must generate sufficient internal cash flows and/or be able to utilize available financing sources to finance its
continued growth and sustain capital requirements. If First Majestic does not realize satisfactory prices for its products
(principally silver), it could be required to raise significant additional capital through the capital markets and/or incur
significant borrowings to meet its capital requirements. These financing requirements may result in dilution to existing First
Majestic Shareholders and could adversely affect First Majestic’s credit ratings and its ability to access the capital markets
in the future to meet any external financing requirements First Majestic might have. If there are significant delays in when
these projects are completed and are producing on a commercial and consistent scale, and/or their capital costs were to be
significantly higher than estimated, these events could have a significant adverse effect on First Majestic’s results of
operation, cash flow from operations and financial condition.
In addition, First Majestic’s mining operations and processing and related infrastructure facilities are subject to risks
normally encountered in the mining and metals industry. Such risks are described in the First Majestic AIF and include,
without limitation, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, labour disputes, changes in laws, technical difficulties or
failures, late delivery of supplies or equipment, unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures, cave-ins, pit-wall
failures, rock falls, unanticipated ground, grade or water conditions, flooding, periodic or extended interruptions due to the
unavailability of materials and force majeure events. Such risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral
properties or producing facilities, personal injury, environmental damage, delays in mining or processing, losses and
possible legal liability. Any prolonged downtime or shutdowns at First Majestic’s mining or processing operations could
materially adversely affect First Majestic’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
Following completion of the Arrangement, First Majestic may issue additional equity securities
Following completion of the Arrangement, First Majestic may issue equity securities to finance its activities, including in
order to finance acquisitions. If First Majestic were to issue First Majestic Shares, a holder of such shares may experience
dilution in First Majestic’s earnings per share. Moreover, as First Majestic’s intention to issue additional equity securities
becomes publicly known, First Majestic’s share price may be materially adversely affected.
First Majestic may become subject to legal proceedings
First Majestic may, from time to time, become involved in various claims, legal proceedings, regulatory investigations and
complaints. First Majestic cannot reasonably predict the likelihood or outcome of any actions, should they arise. If First
Majestic is unable to resolve any such disputes favorably, it may have a material adverse impact on First Majestic’s
financial performance, cash flows, and results of operations. First Majestic’s assets and properties may become subject to
further liens, agreements, claims, or other charges as a result of such disputes. Any claim by a third party on or related to
any of First Majestic’s properties, especially where mineral reserves have been located, could result in First Majestic losing
a commercially viable property. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, it may potentially affect First Majestic’s operations due to
the high costs of defending against the claim. If First Majestic loses a commercially viable property, such a loss could lower
its future revenues.
Rights of Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholders
The following is a summary of the provisions of the BCBCA relating to a SilverCrest Shareholder’s dissent and appraisal
rights in respect of the Arrangement Resolution. Such summary is not a comprehensive statement of the procedures to be
followed by a Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholder who seeks payment of the fair value of its SilverCrest Shares and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of sections 237 to 247 of the BCBCA, which is attached to this Circular as
Appendix M, as modified by Article 3 of the Plan of Arrangement, the Interim Order.
- 104 -
The statutory provisions dealing with the right of dissent are technical and complex. Any Dissenting SilverCrest
Shareholders should seek independent legal advice, as failure to comply strictly with the provisions of sections 237
to 247 of the BCBCA, as modified by Article 3 of the Plan of Arrangement and the Interim Order, may result in the
loss of all Dissent Rights.
The Interim Order expressly provides Registered SilverCrest Shareholders with the right to dissent with respect to the
Arrangement Resolution. Each Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholder is entitled to be paid the fair value (determined as of
immediately before the passing of the Arrangement Resolution) of all, but not less than all, of the holder’s SilverCrest
Shares, provided that the holder duly dissents to the Arrangement Resolution and the Arrangement becomes effective.
In many cases, SilverCrest Shares beneficially owned by a holder are registered either (a) in the name of an Intermediary
that such SilverCrest Shareholder deals with in respect of such shares, such as, among others, banks, trust companies,
securities brokers, trustees and other similar entities, or (b) in the name of a depository, such as CDS, of which the
Intermediary is a participant. Accordingly, such Beneficial SilverCrest Shareholders will not be entitled to exercise his, her
or its rights of dissent directly (unless the SilverCrest Shares are reregistered in such beneficial shareholder’s name).
With respect to SilverCrest Shares in connection to the Arrangement, pursuant to the Interim Order, a Registered SilverCrest
Shareholder, other than an affiliate of SilverCrest, may exercise rights of dissent under Sections 237 to 247 of the BCBCA,
as modified by the Plan of Arrangement, the Interim Order and the Final Order; provided that, notwithstanding section 242(2)
of the BCBCA, the written objection to the Arrangement Resolution must be sent to SilverCrest by SilverCrest Shareholders
who wish to dissent not later than 4:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on the day that is two business days immediately preceding
the SilverCrest Meeting (as may be postponed or adjourned from time to time) thereof. SilverCrest’s address for such
purpose is 19th Floor, 885 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6C 3H4.
To exercise Dissent Rights, a SilverCrest Shareholder must dissent with respect to all SilverCrest Shares of which it is the
registered and beneficial owner. A Registered SilverCrest Shareholder who wishes to dissent must deliver written Dissent
Notice to SilverCrest as set forth above and such Dissent Notice must strictly comply with the requirements of section 242 of
the BCBCA. Any failure by a SilverCrest Shareholder to fully comply with the provisions of the BCBCA, as modified
by Article 3 of the Plan of Arrangement, the Interim Order and the Final Order, may result in the loss of that holder’s
Dissent Rights. Beneficial SilverCrest Shareholders who wish to exercise Dissent Rights must cause each Registered
SilverCrest Shareholder holding their SilverCrest Shares to deliver the Dissent Notice.
To exercise Dissent Rights, a Registered SilverCrest Shareholder must prepare a separate Dissent Notice for him, her or
itself, if dissenting on his, her or its own behalf, and for each other Beneficial SilverCrest Shareholder who beneficially owns
SilverCrest Shares registered in the SilverCrest Shareholder’s name and on whose behalf the Registered SilverCrest
Shareholder is dissenting; and must dissent with respect to all of the SilverCrest Shares registered in his, her or its name or
if dissenting on behalf of a Beneficial SilverCrest Shareholder, with respect to all of the SilverCrest Shares registered in his,
her or its name and beneficially owned by the Beneficial SilverCrest Shareholder on whose behalf the Registered
SilverCrest Shareholder is dissenting. The Dissent Notice must set out the number of SilverCrest Shares in respect of which
the Dissent Rights are being exercised (the “Notice Shares”) and: (a) if such SilverCrest Shares constitute all of the
SilverCrest Shares of which the SilverCrest Shareholder is the registered and beneficial owner and the SilverCrest
Shareholder owns no other SilverCrest Shares beneficially, a statement to that effect; (b) if such SilverCrest Shares
constitute all of the SilverCrest Shares of which the SilverCrest Shareholder is both the registered and beneficial owner, but
the SilverCrest Shareholder owns additional SilverCrest Shares beneficially, a statement to that effect and the names of the
registered SilverCrest Shareholders, the number of SilverCrest Shares held by each such registered SilverCrest
Shareholder and a statement that written notices of dissent are being or have been sent with respect to such other
SilverCrest Shares; or (c) if the Dissent Rights are being exercised by a Registered SilverCrest Shareholder who is not the
beneficial owner of such SilverCrest Shares, a statement to that effect and the name of the beneficial shareholder and a
statement that the Registered SilverCrest Shareholder is dissenting with respect to all SilverCrest Shares of the beneficial
shareholder registered in such registered holder’s name.
- 105 -
If the Arrangement Resolution is approved by SilverCrest Shareholders, and SilverCrest notifies a registered holder of
Notice Shares of SilverCrest’s intention to act upon the Arrangement Resolution pursuant to section 243 of the BCBCA, in
order to exercise Dissent Rights, such SilverCrest Shareholder must, within one month after SilverCrest gives such notice,
send to SilverCrest a written notice that such holder requires the purchase of all of the Notice Shares in respect of which
such holder has given Dissent Notice. Such written notice must be accompanied by the certificate or certificates
representing those Notice Shares (including a written statement prepared in accordance with section 244(1)(c) of the
BCBCA if the dissent is being exercised by the SilverCrest Shareholder on behalf of a beneficial shareholder), whereupon,
subject to the provisions of the BCBCA relating to the termination of Dissent Rights, the SilverCrest Shareholder becomes a
Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholder, and is bound to sell and SilverCrest is bound to purchase those SilverCrest Shares.
Such Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholder may not vote, or exercise or assert any rights of a SilverCrest Shareholder in
respect of such Notice Shares, other than the rights set forth in Division 2 of Part 8 of the BCBCA, as modified by Article 3 of
the Plan of Arrangement, the Interim Order and the Final Order.
Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholders who are:
(a)
ultimately entitled to be paid fair value for their SilverCrest Shares, will be paid an amount equal to such fair value by
SilverCrest, and will be deemed to have transferred such SilverCrest Shares as of the Effective Time to SilverCrest,
without any further act or formality, and free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances; or
(b)
ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to be paid fair value for their SilverCrest Shares, will be deemed to have
participated in the Arrangement, as of the Effective Time, on the same basis as a non-Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholder
and will be entitled to receive only 0.2769 of a First Majestic Share and C$0.0001 in exchange for each SilverCrest
Share held pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Arrangement.
If a Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholder is ultimately entitled to be paid by SilverCrest for their Dissent Shares, such
Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholder may enter an agreement with SilverCrest for the fair value of such Dissent Shares. If
such Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholder does not reach an agreement with SilverCrest, such Dissenting SilverCrest
Shareholder, or SilverCrest, may apply to the Court, and the Court may determine the payout value of the Dissent Shares
and make consequential orders and give directions as the Court considers appropriate. There is no obligation on
SilverCrest to make application to the Court. The Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholder will be entitled to receive the fair value
that the SilverCrest Shares had immediately before the passing of the Arrangement Resolution, excluding any appreciation
or depreciation in anticipation of the vote (unless such exclusion would be inequitable).
After a determination of the fair value of the Dissent Shares, SilverCrest must then promptly pay that amount to the
Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholder. In no case will First Majestic, the Depositary or any other person be required to
recognize Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholders as SilverCrest Shareholders after the Effective Time, and the names of such
Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholders will be deleted from the central securities register as SilverCrest Shareholders at the
Effective Time.
In no circumstances will First Majestic, SilverCrest or any other person be required to recognize a person as a Dissenting
SilverCrest Shareholder: (i) unless such person is the holder of the SilverCrest Shares in respect of which Dissent Rights
are purported to be exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time; (ii) if such person has voted or instructed a proxy
holder to vote such Notice Shares for the Arrangement Resolution; or (iii) unless such person has strictly complied with the
procedures for exercising Dissent Rights set out in Division 2 of Part 8 of the BCBCA, as modified by Article 3 of the Plan of
Arrangement, the Interim Order and the Final Order and does not withdraw such Dissent Notice prior to the Effective Time.
In no circumstances will First Majestic, SilverCrest or any other person be required to recognize a Dissenting SilverCrest
Shareholder as the holder of any SilverCrest Share in respect of which Dissent Rights have been validly exercised at and
after the completion of the steps contemplated in the Plan of Arrangement. Holders of SilverCrest Options will not be entitled
to exercise Dissent Rights in respect of SilverCrest Options. Dissent Rights with respect to Notice Shares will terminate and
cease to apply to the Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholder if, before full payment is made for the Notice Shares, the
Arrangement in respect of which the Dissent Notice was sent is abandoned or by its terms will not proceed, a court
permanently enjoins or sets aside the corporate action approved by the Arrangement Resolution, or the Dissenting
SilverCrest Shareholder withdraws the Dissent Notice with SilverCrest’s written consent. If any of these events occur,
SilverCrest must return the share certificates representing the SilverCrest Shares to the Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholder
and the Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholder regains the ability to vote and exercise its rights as a SilverCrest Shareholder.
- 106 -
The discussion above is only a summary of the Dissent Rights, which are technical and complex. A SilverCrest
Shareholder who intends to exercise Dissent Rights must strictly adhere to the procedures established in sections 237 to
247 of the BCBCA, as modified by Article 3 of the Plan of Arrangement, the Interim Order and the Final Order, and failure to
do so may result in the loss of all Dissent Rights. Persons who are beneficial SilverCrest Shareholders registered in the
name of an Intermediary, or in some other name, who wish to exercise Dissent Rights should be aware that only the
registered owner of such SilverCrest Shares is entitled to dissent.
There can be no assurance that the amount Dissenting SilverCrest Shareholders receive as fair value for their SilverCrest
Shares will be more than or equal to the Consideration under the Arrangement.
Accordingly, each SilverCrest Shareholder wishing to avail himself, herself or itself of the Dissent Rights should
carefully consider and comply with the provisions of the Interim Order and sections 237 to 247 of the BCBCA,
which are attached to this Circular as Appendices K and M, respectively, and seek his, her or its own legal advice.
Interest of Informed Persons in Material Transactions
Other than as disclosed in this Circular or the documents incorporated by reference herein, within the three years prior to the
date of this Circular, no insider of SilverCrest or First Majestic, director or associate or affiliate of any insider or director of
SilverCrest or First Majestic, has or had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction or proposed transaction
which has materially affected or could materially affect SilverCrest or First Majestic or any of their respective subsidiaries.
APPROVAL OF New SilverCrest Stock Option Plan
At the SilverCrest Meeting, SilverCrest Shareholders will be asked to consider and, if deemed advisable, approve the
adoption by New SilverCrest of the New SilverCrest Option Plan which will authorize the New SilverCrest Board to grant
stock options to directors, officers, employees and other eligible service providers (or corporations controlled by such
persons) of New SilverCrest and its subsidiaries, subject to the rules and regulations of applicable regulatory authorities
and any stock exchange upon which the New SilverCrest Shares may be listed or may trade from time to time. The New
SilverCrest Option Plan will be substantially similar to the SilverCrest Stock Plan. See “Appendix H – Information
Concerning New SilverCrest Post-Arrangement – Options and Other Rights to Purchase Securities of New SilverCrest –
Material Terms of the New SilverCrest Option Plan” for a summary of the material terms of the New SilverCrest Option Plan.
A copy of the New SilverCrest Option Plan is also available upon request to New SilverCrest (Attention: President,
Suite 501, 570 Granville Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 3P1, Telephone: (604) 694-1730 or Email:
info@silvercrestmines.com).
If approved, the New SilverCrest Option Plan will be implemented if and when New SilverCrest lists the New SilverCrest
Shares on a stock exchange. The New SilverCrest Option Plan is a rolling stock option plan that sets the number of New
SilverCrest Shares issuable thereunder at a maximum of 10% of the New SilverCrest Shares issued and outstanding at the
time of any grant. As of the date of the Circular, no stock options have been granted nor have any other rights or securities to
purchase New SilverCrest Shares been issued. Approximately 1,593,652 New SilverCrest Options will be issued at the
Effective Time pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, in connection with the exchange of the then issued and outstanding
SilverCrest Options. The New SilverCrest Options issued pursuant to the Arrangement will be governed by the New
SilverCrest Option Plan. The New SilverCrest Board does not intend to grant any stock options under the New SilverCrest
Option Plan until such time following the listing of the New SilverCrest Shares on a stock exchange such that a fair market
value exercise price for options can be determined.
- 107 -
At the SilverCrest Meeting, SilverCrest Shareholders will be asked to consider and, if deemed advisable, to approve the
following ordinary resolution to approve the adoption of the New SilverCrest Option Plan:
‘‘BE IT RESOLVED AS AN ORDINARY RESOLUTION OF THE SHAREHOLDERS THAT:
1.
Effective on the Effective Date (as defined in the joint information circular (the “Circular”) of First Majestic Silver Corp. and
SilverCrest Mines Inc. dated August 24, 2015), the stock option plan (the “New SilverCrest Option Plan”) of SilverCrest
Metals Inc. (“New SilverCrest”) be and is hereby approved and adopted as the Stock Option Plan of New SilverCrest with
such modifications, if any, as may be required by any stock exchange upon which the shares of New SilverCrest may be
listed or may trade from time to time.
2.
Any officer or director of New SilverCrest is hereby authorized to do all such acts and execute and file all instruments and
documents necessary or desirable to carry out this resolution, including making appropriate filings with regulatory
authorities including any applicable stock exchange.”
In order for the foregoing resolution to be passed, it must be approved by a simple majority of the votes cast on such
resolution by SilverCrest Shareholders who vote in person or by proxy at the SilverCrest Meeting.
The SilverCrest Board unanimously recommends that holders of SilverCrest Shares vote FOR the approval of the
New SilverCrest Option Plan. In the absence of a contrary instruction, the persons designated by management of
SilverCrest in the enclosed form of proxy intend to vote FOR the approval of the resolution to approve the New
SilverCrest Option Plan.
Legal Matters
Certain Canadian legal matters relating to the Arrangement will be reviewed by Koffman Kalef LLP on behalf of SilverCrest
and by McCullough O’Connor Irwin LLP on behalf of First Majestic. Certain U.S. legal matters relating to the Arrangement
will be reviewed by Dorsey & Whitney LLP on behalf of SilverCrest and by Alexander Holburn Beaudin + Lang LLP on
behalf of First Majestic. As of the date hereof, the partners and associates of Koffman Kalef LLP as a group beneficially
owned, directly or indirectly, less than one percent of the SilverCrest Shares. Bernard Poznanski, whose law corporation is
a partner of Koffman Kalef LLP, is the Corporate Secretary of SilverCrest. As of the date hereof, the partners and associates
of McCullough O’Connor Irwin LLP as a group beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, less than one percent of the First
Majestic Shares.

pursuant to and on the terms and conditions set out in the SilverCrest Conveyance Agreement, SilverCrest will subscribe

C-6
(g)
each SilverCrest Option which is outstanding and has not been duly exercised prior to the Effective Time will be
exchanged for an option (each, a “SilverCrest Replacement Option”) to purchase from SilverCrest a SilverCrest Share
and an option (each, a “SpinCo Option”) to purchase from SpinCo such number of SpinCo Shares as is equal to the
SpinCo Exchange Ratio (and when aggregated with the other similar SpinCo Options of a holder of such options
resulting in a fraction of a SpinCo Share, they shall all be rounded down to the nearest whole number of SpinCo Shares).
Each SilverCrest Replacement Option shall provide for an exercise price per SilverCrest Share (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price per SilverCrest Share that would otherwise be payable to acquire a
SilverCrest Share pursuant to the SilverCrest Option it replaces. Each SpinCo Option shall provide for an exercise price
per SpinCo Share equal to $0.06. All terms and conditions of a SilverCrest Replacement Option or a SpinCo Option,
including the term to expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising, will be the same as the SilverCrest Option for which
it was exchanged and shall be governed by the terms of the SilverCrest Option Plan (in the case of SilverCrest
Replacement Options) or the SpinCo Option Plan (in the case of SpinCo Options) and any document previously
evidencing the SilverCrest Replacement Option shall thereafter evidence and be deemed to evidence such SilverCrest
Replacement Option and SpinCo Option. It is intended that subsection 7(1.4) of the ITA apply to such exchange of
options. Accordingly, and notwithstanding the foregoing, if required, the exercise price of the SilverCrest Replacement
Options and SpinCo Options issued to any particular former holder of SilverCrest Options will be increased on a pro rata
basis such that the aggregate In-the-Money Amount of the SilverCrest Replacement Options and the In-the-Money
Amount of the SpinCo Options held by such holder immediately after the exchange does not exceed the In-the-Money
Amount of the SilverCrest Options held by such holder immediately before the exchange;
(h)
the SpinCo Shares referred to in Section 2.3(c) shall be distributed by SilverCrest to the SilverCrest Shareholders (other
than SilverCrest Shareholders who have validly exercised Dissent Rights) such that each such holder will receive such
number of SpinCo Shares in respect of each SilverCrest Share held as is equal to the SpinCo Exchange Ratio, such
SpinCo Shares to be distributed as a return of share capital pursuant to a reorganization of SilverCrest’s business and a
distribution of proceeds from a disposition of SilverCrest’s property outside the ordinary course of SilverCrest’s business,
with the result that the paid up capital in respect of the SilverCrest Shares shall be reduced by an amount equal to the fair
market value thereof;
each SilverCrest Share (other than any SilverCrest Share held by any Dissenting Shareholder) will, without further act or
(i)
formality and by or on behalf of a holder of SilverCrest Shares, be irrevocably assigned and transferred by the holder
thereof to First Majestic (free and clear of any liens, charges and encumbrances of any nature whatsoever) in exchange
for such number of First Majestic Shares as is equal to the First Majestic Exchange Ratio and $0.0001 in cash for each
SilverCrest Share held;
(j)
each SilverCrest Replacement Option which is outstanding and has not been duly exercised prior to the Effective Time
will be exchanged for an option (each, a “First Majestic Replacement Option”) to purchase from First Majestic such
number of First Majestic Shares as is equal to the First Majestic Exchange Ratio (and when aggregated with the other
similar First Majestic Replacement Options of a holder of such options resulting in a fraction of a First Majestic Share, they
shall all be rounded down to the nearest whole number of First Majestic Shares). Each First Majestic Replacement Option
shall provide for an exercise price per First Majestic Share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise
price per SilverCrest Share that would otherwise be payable pursuant to the SilverCrest Replacement Option it replaces,
divided by the First Majestic Exchange Ratio. All terms and conditions of a First Majestic Replacement Option, including
the term to expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising, will be the same as the SilverCrest Replacement Option for
which it was exchanged, and shall be governed by the terms of the First Majestic Option Plan and any document
previously evidencing the SilverCrest Replacement Option shall thereafter evidence and be deemed to evidence such
First Majestic Replacement Option. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the terms and conditions of the First Majestic Option
Plan relating to accelerated expiry of First Majestic Options on account of early termination after ceasing to hold office or
ceasing to be an employee or consultant shall not apply to the First Majestic Replacement Options, such that there will be
no accelerated expiry of First Majestic Replacement Options on account of early termination after ceasing to hold office or
ceasing to be an employee or consultant;
C-7
(k)with respect to each SilverCrest Share transferred and assigned in accordance with Section 2.3(b) or Section 2.3(i):
(i)
the registered holder thereof shall cease to be the registered holder of such SilverCrest Share and the name of such
registered holder shall be removed from the register of SilverCrest Shareholders as of the Effective Time;
(ii)
the registered holder thereof shall be deemed to have executed and delivered all consents, releases, assignments and
waivers, statutory or otherwise, required to transfer and assign such SilverCrest Share; and
(iii)
First Majestic will be the holder of all of the outstanding SilverCrest Shares and the register of SilverCrest Shareholders
shall be revised accordingly; and
(l)
the exchanges, cancellations and other steps provided for in this Section 2.3 will be deemed to occur on the Effective
Date, notwithstanding that certain of the procedures related thereto are not completed until after the Effective Date.
2.4Post-Effective Time Procedures.
(a)
Following receipt of the Final Order and prior to the Effective Date, First Majestic shall deliver or arrange to be delivered
to the Depositary the Consideration, including certificates representing the First Majestic Shares and SpinCo shall
deliver or arrange to be delivered to the Depositary the SpinCo Shares required to be issued to the former SilverCrest
Shareholders, in either case in accordance with Section 2.3 hereof, which certificates shall be held by the Depositary as
agent and nominee for the former SilverCrest Shareholders for distribution to the former SilverCrest Shareholders in
accordance with the provisions of Article 4 hereof.
(b)
Subject to the provisions of Article 4 hereof, and upon return of a properly completed Letter of Transmittal by a registered
former SilverCrest Shareholder together with certificates, if any, which, immediately prior to the Effective Date,
represented SilverCrest Shares and such other documents as the Depositary may require, former SilverCrest
Shareholders shall be entitled to receive delivery of the certificates representing the First Majestic Shares, the SpinCo
Shares and cheques representing the cash to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(i).
(c)
An Eligible Holder whose SilverCrest Shares are exchanged for the Consideration pursuant to the Arrangement shall be
entitled to make an income tax election, pursuant to section 85 of the ITA (and any analogous provision of provincial
income tax law) (a “Section 85 Election”) with respect to the exchange by providing the necessary information in
accordance with the procedures set out in the tax instruction letter on or before the date 90 days after the Effective Date.
Neither SilverCrest, First Majestic nor any successor corporation shall be responsible for the proper completion of any
election form nor, except for the obligation to sign and return duly completed election forms which are received within 90
days of the Effective Date, for any taxes, interest or penalties resulting from the failure of an Eligible Holder to properly
complete or file such election forms in the form and manner and within the time prescribed by the ITA (or any applicable
provincial legislation). In its sole discretion, First Majestic or any successor corporation may choose to sign and return an
election form received by it more than 90 days following the Effective Date, but will have no obligation to do so.
C-8
(d)
Upon receipt of a Letter of Transmittal in which an Eligible Holder has indicated that such holder wishes to receive a tax
instruction letter, First Majestic will promptly deliver a tax instruction letter to such holder. The tax instruction letter will
provide general instructions on how to make the Section 85 Election with First Majestic in order to obtain a full or partial
tax deferred rollover for Canadian income tax purposes in respect of the sale of the Eligible Holder’s SilverCrest Shares
to First Majestic.
2.5                        No Fractional Cash Consideration. In any case where the aggregate cash consideration payable to a
particular SilverCrest Shareholder under this Arrangement would, but for this provision, (a) be less than one cent, then the
aggregate cash consideration payable to such SilverCrest Shareholder shall be rounded up to one cent; or (b) be at least
one cent, but including a fraction of a cent, then the aggregate cash consideration payable to such SilverCrest Shareholder
shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent.
2.6                        No Fractional Shares. In no event shall any holder of SilverCrest Shares be entitled to a fractional First
Majestic Share or a fractional SpinCo Share. Where the aggregate number of First Majestic Shares to be issued to a former
SilverCrest Shareholder as consideration under this Arrangement would result in a fraction of a First Majestic Share being
issuable, the number of First Majestic Shares to be received by such SilverCrest Shareholder shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole First Majestic Share and no Person will be entitled to any compensation in respect of a fractional First
Majestic Share. Where the aggregate number of SpinCo Shares to be issued to a former SilverCrest Shareholder as
consideration under this Arrangement would result in a fraction of a SpinCo Share being issuable, the number of SpinCo
Shares to be received by such SilverCrest Shareholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole SpinCo Share and no
Person will be entitled to any compensation in respect of a fractional SpinCo Share and any remaining SpinCo shares held
by SilverCrest as a result will be returned by SilverCrest and will be deemed to be cancelled.
2.7                        Adjustments to Exchange Ratios. The First Majestic Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into First
Majestic Shares, other than stock dividends paid in lieu of ordinary course dividends), consolidation, reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to First Majestic Shares occurring after the date of the Arrangement
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time. The SpinCo Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into SpinCo Shares),
consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to SpinCo Shares occurring after the date of
the Arrangement Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

Business Corporations Act must be received by SilverCrest not later than 5:00 p.m. (Vancouver time) on the Business

or adjourned and provided further that Dissenting Shareholders who:
(i)
are ultimately entitled to be paid fair value for their SilverCrest Shares, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in section 245 of the Business Corporations Act, shall be deemed to have transferred such SilverCrest Shares to First
Majestic as of the Effective Time without any further act or formality and free and clear of all liens, claims and
encumbrances, in consideration for the payment by First Majestic of the fair value thereof, in cash; or
C-9
(ii)

participated in the Arrangement on the same basis as a non-dissenting holder of SilverCrest Shares and shall be entitled
to receive only the consideration contemplated in Sections 2.3(h) and 2.3(i) that such holder would have received
pursuant to the Arrangement if such holder had not exercised Dissent Rights;
but in no case shall First Majestic, SilverCrest, SpinCo or any other Person be required to recognize such Persons as
holders of SilverCrest Shares after the Effective Time, and the names of such Persons shall be deleted from the registers of
holders of SilverCrest Shares at the Effective Time.
(b)
In addition to any other restrictions set forth in the Business Corporations Act, none of the following shall be entitled to
exercise Dissent Rights:

Resolution.
Article 4
DELIVERY OF CONSIDERATION
4.1Delivery of Consideration.
(a)
Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate that immediately before the Effective Time represented
one or more outstanding SilverCrest Shares that were exchanged for the Consideration in accordance with Section 2.3(i)
hereof together with such other documents and instruments as would have been required to effect the transfer of the
SilverCrest Shares formerly represented by such certificate under the Business Corporations Act and the articles of
SilverCrest and such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, the holder of
such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Depositary shall deliver to such
holder following the Effective Time, a certificate representing the First Majestic Shares, a certificate representing the
SpinCo Shares and a cheque representing the cash that such holder is entitled to receive in accordance with Sections
2.3(h) and 2.3(i) hereof.
(b)
After the Effective Time and until surrendered for cancellation as contemplated by Section 4.1(a) hereof, each certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more SilverCrest Shares shall be deemed at all times to
represent only the right to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the First Majestic Shares, a certificate
representing the SpinCo Shares and a cheque representing the cash that such holder is entitled to receive in accordance
with Sections 2.3(h) and 2.3(i) hereof.
4.2                        Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates. No dividends or other distributions declared or
made after the Effective Time with respect to First Majestic Shares or SpinCo Shares with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate which, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented
outstanding SilverCrest Shares that were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.3 unless and until the holder of record of such
certificate shall surrender such certificate in accordance with Section 4.1. Subject to applicable law and to Section 4.5, at
the time of such surrender of any such certificate (or in the case of clause (ii) below, at the appropriate payment date), there
shall be paid to the holder of record of the certificates formerly representing whole SilverCrest Shares, without interest,
(i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole First Majestic Share or SpinCo Share, as the case may be, and (ii) on the appropriate payment date, the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole First Majestic Share or SpinCo Share, as the case may be.
C-10
4.3                        Lost Certificates. In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one
or more outstanding SilverCrest Shares that were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.3(i) shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Depositary shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, one or more certificates representing
one or more First Majestic Shares (and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto) and one or more certificates
representing one or more SpinCo Shares (and any dividends or distributions with respect thereto) deliverable in accordance
with such holder’s Letter of Transmittal. When authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the Person to whom certificates representing First Majestic Shares and SpinCo Shares are to be issued shall, as
a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, give a bond satisfactory to First Majestic, SpinCo and the Depositary in such
sum as First Majestic and SpinCo may direct, or otherwise indemnify First Majestic, SpinCo and the Depositary in a manner
satisfactory to First Majestic, SpinCo and the Depositary against any claim that may be made against First Majestic, SpinCo
or the Depositary with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
4.4                        Extinction of Rights. Any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
SilverCrest Shares that were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.3(i) and not deposited, with all other instruments required by
Section 4.1 on or prior to the third anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to represent a claim or interest of any kind or
nature as a shareholder of First Majestic and SpinCo. On such date, the First Majestic Shares and the SpinCo Shares to
which the former registered holder of the certificate referred to in the preceding sentence was ultimately entitled shall be
deemed to have been surrendered to First Majestic or SpinCo, respectively, together with all respective entitlements to
dividends, distributions and interest thereon held for such former registered holder. None of First Majestic, SilverCrest,
SpinCo or the Depositary shall be liable to any person in respect of any First Majestic Shares or SpinCo Shares (or
dividends, distributions and interest in respect thereof) delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.
4.5                        Withholding and Sale Rights. Any of the Parties and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from (i) any consideration issuable or payable pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement to any holder of SilverCrest Shares (for
greater certainty, including the distribution of the SpinCo Shares), or (ii) any dividend or consideration otherwise payable to
any holder of First Majestic Shares or SpinCo Shares such amounts as First Majestic, SpinCo or the Depositary,
respectively, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such issuance or payment, as the case may be, under the
ITA, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or any provision of provincial, state, local or foreign tax law, in each case as amended.
To the extent that the amount so required to be deducted or withheld from the First Majestic Shares, the SpinCo Shares,
dividends or consideration otherwise issuable or payable to a holder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration
otherwise payable to such holder, each of First Majestic, SpinCo and the Depositary is hereby authorized to sell or
otherwise dispose of, at such times and at such prices as it determines, in its sole discretion, such portion of the First
Majestic Shares or the SpinCo Shares, as the case may be, otherwise issuable or payable to such holder as is necessary to
provide sufficient funds to First Majestic, SpinCo or the Depositary, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with such
deduction or withholding requirement, and shall notify the holder thereof and remit to such holder any unapplied balance of
the net proceeds of such sale or disposition (after deducting applicable sale commissions and any other reasonable
expenses relating thereto) in lieu of the First Majestic Shares, SpinCo Shares or other consideration so sold or disposed of.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld or First Majestic Shares, SpinCo Shares or other consideration are so sold or
disposed of, such withheld amounts, or shares or other consideration so sold or disposed of, shall be treated for all
purposes as having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such deduction, withholding, sale or
disposition was made, provided that such withheld amounts, or the net proceeds of such sale or disposition, as the case
may be, are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. None of First Majestic, SpinCo or the Depositary shall be
obligated to seek or obtain a minimum price for any of the First Majestic Shares or the SpinCo Shares or other consideration
sold or disposed of by it hereunder, nor shall any of them be liable for any loss arising out of any such sale or disposition.
4.6                        Paramountcy. From and after the Effective Time:
(a)
this Plan of Arrangement shall take precedence and priority over any and all SilverCrest Shares and SilverCrest Options
issued prior to the Effective Time; and
C-11
(b)
the rights and obligations of the SilverCrest Shares and SilverCrest Options shall be solely as provided in this Plan of

Overview
This Appendix D to the Circular contains certain information on SilverCrest before the completion of the Arrangement and
should be read to exclude the SilverCrest Transferred Assets to be transferred by SilverCrest to New SilverCrest
immediately prior to closing pursuant to the SilverCrest Conveyance Agreement.
SilverCrest is a Canadian precious metals producer headquartered in Vancouver, BC. SilverCrest’s flagship property is the
100%-owned Santa Elena Mine. SilverCrest’s other material property is the La Joya Project in Durango state, Mexico,
which contains a large polymetallic deposit that is being explored with the aim of developing silver, copper, gold and
tungsten resources. SilverCrest is currently focusing on Sonoran Property targets within a 30/60 kilometre radius from Santa
Elena operations which includes the Ermitaño Property and the Cumobabi Property to provide new discoveries that might
be treated at the Santa Elena facility.
Pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, SilverCrest will transfer the Las Chispas, Cruz de Mayo, Angel de
Plata, Huasabas and Estacion Llano exploration properties, as well as C$5,250,000 in cash and certain other assets
currently owned by SilverCrest to New SilverCrest immediately prior to closing of the Arrangement.
Further information regarding the business of SilverCrest, its operations and its mineral properties can be found in the
SilverCrest AIF and the other materials incorporated by reference into this Circular. See “Information Concerning
SilverCrest - Documents Incorporated by Reference”.
Mineral Properties
Santa Elena Project
The Santa Elena Project is located 150 kilometres northeast of Hermosillo, near Banamichi in the State of Sonora, Mexico.
The Santa Elena Project is comprised of seven mineral concessions totalling 51,172.5 hectares, portions of which include
the producing gold and silver Santa Elena Mine. The mine at Santa Elena is a high-grade, epithermal silver and gold
producer, with a current reserve estimated life of mine of 8 years and estimated average operating cash costs of US$12 per
ounce of silver equivalent for the life of mine (64.5:1 Ag:Au based on ounces sold). The Santa Elena Mine is currently
producing gold and silver from a new 3,000 tonnes per day fully commissioned Merrill Crowe/CCD processing facility. Mill
feed for the Santa Elena operation involves the combined processing of underground ore, currently being mined at a rate of
1220 tonnes per day from updated underground reserves, and reprocessing of partially depleted ore from an existing heap
leach pad. SilverCrest anticipates the 3,000 tpd conventional mill facility at the Santa Elena Mine should recover an
average of 1.6 million ounces of silver and 33,800 ounces of gold per annum over the current reserve life.
Table 1 sets out the most recent mineral reserve and resource estimates for the Santa Elena Project prepared under the
supervision of N. Eric Fier, C.P.G., P.Eng as of December 31, 2014.

All numbers are rounded. Underground and leach pad reserves and resources are based on life of mine plan metal price
trends of US$19.50/oz silver, US$1,300/oz gold and metallurgical recoveries of 92% Au and 67.5% Ag. All mineral
resources and reserves conform to NI 43-101 and CIM definitions for resources and reserves. Inferred resources have
been estimated from geological evidence and limited sampling and must be treated with a lower level of confidence than
indicated resources.
Underground probable reserve is based on a cut-off grade of 2.49 gpt AuEq with an average est. 10% dilution and 90%
mine recovery. Average true thickness of the designed stopes is 10 metres.
Open pit reserve is based on a cut-off grade of 0.20 gpt AuEq in a constrained pit shell with applied capping of 8 gpt Au
and 300 gpt Ag.
Leach pad reserve based on production and drill hole data for volumetrics and grade model using a cut-off grade of 0.5
gpt AuEq. No capping was applied.
Mineral resources exclude mineral reserves and are based on a 1.5 gpt AuEq cut-off grade using assumptions for prices
and recoveries as stated in note above. Capping was applied at 12 gpt Au and 700 gpt Ag.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, SilverCrest mined and processed 213,017 tonnes of ore on the leach pad at Santa
Elena at an average grade of 1.79 g/t gold and 68.23 g/t silver, for a total of 27,609 ounces of gold and 1,157,021 ounces of
silver. For the period ended June 30, 2015, SilverCrest mined and processed 549,778 tonnes of ore at Santa Elena at an
average grade of 1.65 g/t gold and 95.92 g/t silver, for a total of 27,392 ounces of gold and 1,146,694 ounces of silver.
La Joya Project
The La Joya property is approximately 75 km southeast of the state capital city of Durango, state of Durango, Mexico. The
property consists of 15 concessions with a total nominal area of 4,647 hectares. Three deposits which include the MMT,
Santo Nino, and Coloradito were previously delineated on the property. A mineral reserve has not been estimated for the La
Joya project.

Mineral Properties
La Encantada Silver Mine
La Encantada Silver Mine is an underground producing silver mine and processing facility located in the state of Coahuila,
México. The mine is wholly-owned and operated by Minera La Encantada, S.A. de C.V., a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary
of First Majestic. La Encantada Silver Mine consists of two main silver underground mines: the La Encantada and the El
Plomo mines which have been consolidated into one operation, an industrial complex that includes a 4,000 tpd cyanidation
plant and a 1,000 tpd flotation plant (currently in care-and-maintenance, except for the crushing and grinding areas which
remain in operation).
La Encantada consists of 22 mining concessions, which provide mineral rights over an area of 4,076 hectares (10,072
acres). The rights on all of the concessions expire after 2030 but they can be extended for an additional 50 year period.
Additionally, First Majestic owns land surface rights through purchase and lease agreements covering a total of 1,343
hectares. With the purpose of securing potential water sources, in March 2015, First Majestic acquired adjacent surface
rights covering approximately 20,000 hectares.
First Majestic uses conventional sectional methods, assisted by computer assisted design software and computer
databases to estimate the tonnage and average grades of the mineral resources (as defined in NI 43-101) and mineral
reserves (as defined in NI 43-101) at La Encantada. First Majestic has compiled all data into a database and is creating a
geologic 3D model in Surpac™. First Majestic has reviewed and estimated resources and reserves for La Encantada to
assess the current status of the property and to use it as a basis for future production estimates.
The La Encantada reserve blocks are estimated by applying modifying factors to the resource blocks. Table 1 sets out the
most recent mineral reserve estimates for the La Encantada Silver Mine prepared under the supervision of First Majestic’s
internal Qualified Person (as defined in NI 43-101), Mr. Ramon Mendoza Reyes as of December 31, 2014.

San Martín Silver Mine, Jalisco State, Mexico
The San Martín Silver Mine is an underground mine and processing plant located next to the town of San Martín de Bolaños
in Jalisco State, Mexico. The San Martín Silver Mine is wholly-owned and operated by First Majestic through Minera El
Pilón, S.A. de C.V., a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of First Majestic.
San Martín consists of 33 contiguous mining concessions in the San Martín de Bolaños mining district that cover mineral
rights for 37,518 hectares (91 acres) including the application to acquire two new mining concessions covering 29,676
hectares which are in the process of registration. These include 33 mining concessions with exploitation rights. Mineral
rights for the earliest titled concessions expire in the year 2024, and most other claims have expiration dates in the 2060s;
these however, may be renewed for another 50 years. No royalties or any other encumbrances are payable on any of the
San Martín mining concessions.
In addition to mineral rights, San Martín consists of 1,296 hectares of surface land that cover the areas where First Majestic
has the mine’s access, mine installations, and part of the access roads, as well as 160 hectares of surface land where the
processing plant, camp, office facilities, maintenance shops, and tailings dams are located. A portion of the access roads to
the mine are located on land owned by private owners. Some surface rights agreements with individual land owners also
exist for parts of the access roads.
First Majestic uses conventional, manual methods, assisted by computer databases, to estimate the tonnage and average
grades of the mineral resources and reserves. No further independent resource estimates have been conducted since
December 31, 2012, the effective date of the San Martín NI 43-101 Technical Report. Table 5 sets out the most recent
mineral reserve estimate for the San Martín Silver Mine prepared and reviewed by First Majestic’s internal Qualified Person,
Mr. Ramon Mendoza Reyes, P.Eng. as of December 31, 2014.

Del Toro Silver Mine, Zacatecas State, Mexico
The Del Toro Silver Mine is located near the municipality of Chalchihuites, in the northwestern part of the State of
Zacatecas, México. The property is wholly-owned and operated by First Majestic Del Toro, S.A. de C.V., a wholly-owned
indirect subsidiary of First Majestic.
The Del Toro Silver Mine consists of 40 mining concessions including 27 contiguous concessions, five concessions in a
neighboring area, plus nine other concessions that have been recently acquired by First Majestic and are under registration,
covering a total mineral rights surface of 1,060 hectares (2,496 acres). These mining concessions include exploitation
rights. Mexican mining concessions include mineral rights for a renewable period of 50 years from the date of the title. The
earliest dates of renewal of First Majestic's concessions at the Del Toro Silver Mine are for the Perseverancia concession
which has a renewal date of April 23, 2021. All mineral rights in the concessions are owned, including the recently acquired
Beatriz, Zaragoza, Milagros, Ivone, Santa Clara 3, Caridad and San Marcelo. The Verdiosa and Nueva India mining claims
have a 1% net smelter returns royalty capped at US$200,000 and US$500,000, respectively. There are no other
encumbrances on the Del Toro Silver Mine mining concessions.
First Majestic’s planned exploration program for 2015 is focused on expanding resources around the known veins and
chimneys in San Juan, Perseverancia, drilling shallow vein targets around Lupita and Purisima veins and deeper chimney
and manto type targets around Perseverancia mine. A surface drilling program is also planned to explore for oxides at
shallow depths in the Purisima and Santa Teresa areas. First Majestic continues with an exploration program in the area
with the goal of increasing, upgrading and adding new resources at Del Toro.

La Guitarra Silver Mine, México State, México
La Guitarra Silver Mine comprises two operating mines: La Guitarra and Coloso and three exploration areas: Nazareno,
Mina de Agua and El Rincon. The La Guitarra Silver Mine is a producing property situated within the Temascaltepec mining
district in the Municipality of Temascaltepec, State of México, México, approximately 130 kilometres southwest of México
City. It is comprised of 44 exploitation concessions covering 39,714 hectares. La Guitarra is operated and owned by La
Guitarra Compañia Minera S.A. de C.V., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of First Majestic.
All concessions have an annual minimum investment to complete, and an annual mining tax to be paid to keep the
concessions in good standing. All concessions are exploitation concessions that have a 50 year life, and can be renewed
as long as the mine is active. Surface rights in the area of the mining concessions are held both privately and through group
ownership either as communal lands, or Ejido lands. La Guitarra Compañia Minera S.A. de C.V. currently leases surface
rights covering 62 hectares from the community of La Albarrada under a temporary occupation agreement in effect for 15
years from January 1, 2012. The current areas of operations, the existing mill and the majority of the existing infrastructure
are located within these 62 hectares. There are no royalties in effect over the concessions at La Guitarra.

Assumptions include commodity prices of US$22/oz Ag, US$1,350/oz Au, process recoveries of 85% for Ag and 79% for
Au, US$17.93/tonne mining cost, US$15.84/tonne process cost, US$46.12/tonne G&A, Indirect cost and Sustaining
Capital cost, Payable Ag and Au 94.7%, Treatment and Refining US$4.43/oz.
Formula for Ag metal equivalent is Ag-Eq (g/t) = Ag (g/t) + Au (g/t) x 57.032 (using metal prices and metallurgical
recoveries stated above).
Mineral resources are amenable to underground mining methods and are mined using a cut-and-fill method with a
minimum mining width of 0.5m.
An economic cut-off was based on the estimated operating costs and selective mining method. The cut-off grade is 180
g/t silver equivalent (which is equivalent to approximately US$82/t).
No allowances were made for mining losses or external dilution; planned internal dilution within minable shapes is
included.

Mineral Reserves, whose definitions are incorporated by reference into NI 43-101.
In all cases, metal prices considered for Mineral Reserves estimates were US$20/oz Ag, US$1,200/oz Au, US$0.95/lb
Pb, and US$1.00/lb Zn.
The Mineral reserves information provided above for La Encantada, La Parrilla, Del Toro and San Martín is based on
internal estimates prepared as of December 31, 2014. The information provided was reviewed and validated by the
Company’s internal Qualified Person, Mr. Ramon Mendoza Reyes, P.Eng., who has the appropriate relevant
qualifications, and experience in mining and reserves estimation practices.
Mineral reserve estimates for La Guitarra are based on the La Guitarra Silver Mine Technical Report dated March 15,
2015 compiled by First Majestic with contribution of Amec Foster Wheeler.
Silver-equivalent grade is estimated considering: metal price assumptions, metallurgical recovery for the corresponding
mineral type/mineral process and the metal payable of the corresponding contract of each mine. Estimation details are
listed in each mine section in First Majestic’s AIF.
The cut-off grades and modifying factors used to convert mineral reserves from mineral resources are different for all
mines. The cut-off grades are listed in each mine section in First Majestic’s AIF.

NOTES TO THE PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited) (tabular amounts are expressed in thousands of United States dollars, unless otherwise stated)
1. DESCRIPTION OF THE TRANSACTION
On July 27, 2015, First Majestic Silver Corp. (“First Majestic” or the “Company”) and SilverCrest Mines Inc.
(“SilverCrest”) jointly announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement (the "Arrangement
Agreement") pursuant to which First Majestic has agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common
shares of SilverCrest for a consideration of 0.2769 common shares of First Majestic (the "Exchange Ratio") and
CAD$0.0001 in cash per common share of SilverCrest. Outstanding SilverCrest stock options will be exchanged for
equivalent fully vested options of First Majestic based on the Exchange Ratio.
In connection with the Arrangement Agreement, each SilverCrest shareholder will also receive 0.1667 common
shares in a newly formed company (“New SilverCrest”) for each SilverCrest common share held. SilverCrest will
transfer the Las Chispas, Cruz de Mayo, Angel de Plata, Huasabas and Estacion Llano exploration properties
located in northern Mexico, as well as CAD$5.25 million in cash and certain other assets currently owned by
SilverCrest to New SilverCrest. First Majestic will transfer its Guadalupe exploration property located in Durango,
Mexico to New SilverCrest and will own approximately 9.9% of the shares of New SilverCrest following completion
of the transaction.
The transaction will be carried out by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement and will require the approval of
at least 66 2/3% of the votes cast by the shareholders of SilverCrest, and approval by the "majority of the minority",
being a majority of the votes cast by SilverCrest shareholders other than J. Scott Drever, N. Eric Fier and Barney
Magnusson, whose votes will not be included in determining minority approval pursuant to Multilateral Instrument
61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions. The transaction will also require the
approval of a simple majority of the shareholders of First Majestic in accordance with the rules of the TSX and the
NYSE. The special meetings of shareholders of SilverCrest and First Majestic are expected to take place in late
September 2015.
These unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements have been prepared in connection with the proposed
acquisition by First Majestic of all of the outstanding shares of SilverCrest.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of financial position of First Majestic as at June 30,
2015 and the unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of (loss) earnings for the six months ended June 30,
2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2014 have been prepared, for illustrative purposes only, to give effect to
the proposed acquisition of SilverCrest by First Majestic pursuant to the assumptions described in notes 3 and 4 of
these unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements. These unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on financial statements which were in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and have been compiled from the following historical
information:
a) Pro forma condensed consolidated statements of financial position combining:
i)The unaudited condensed interim consolidated statements of financial position of First Majestic as at June 30, 2015; and
ii)The unaudited condensed interim consolidated statements of financial position of SilverCrest as at June 30, 2015.
b)Pro forma condensed consolidated statements of (loss) earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2015 combining:
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim statements of (loss) earnings of First Majestic for the three and six months
i)
ended June 30, 2015; and
The unaudited condensed consolidated interim statements of operations and comprehensive earnings of SilverCrest for
the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.
ii)
c) Pro forma consolidated statements of loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 combining:
i)The audited consolidated statements of loss of First Majestic for the year ended December 31, 2014; and
ii)
The audited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss of SilverCrest for the year ended

NOTES TO THE PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited) (tabular amounts are expressed in thousands of United States dollars, unless otherwise stated)
2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION (continued)
The pro forma condensed consolidated statements of financial position as at June 30, 2015 has been prepared as if
the transactions described in notes 3 and 4 had occurred on June 30, 2015. The pro forma consolidated statements
of income for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2014 have been prepared
as if the transactions described in notes 1, 3 and 4 had occurred on January 1, 2014.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are not intended to reflect the financial
performance or the financial position of First Majestic, which would have actually resulted had the transactions
been effected on dates indicated. Actual amounts recorded upon consummation of the agreement will likely differ
from those recorded in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements information.
Similarly, the calculation and allocation of the purchase price has been prepared on a preliminary basis and is
subject to change between the time such preliminary estimations were made and closing as a result of several
factors which could include among others: changes in fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the
market price of the related common shares and stock options. Any potential synergies that may be realized and
integration costs that may be incurred upon consummation of the transactions have been excluded from the
unaudited pro forma financial information. Further, the pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative
of the financial performance that may be obtained in the future.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements of First Majestic and SilverCrest for the year ended December 31, 2014, and
notes thereto; as well as the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of First Majestic and
SilverCrest for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.
The accounting policies used in the preparation of these unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
statements are those set out in First Majestic’s audited consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2014.
In preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements, a review was undertaken to
identify accounting policy differences between First Majestic and SilverCrest where the impact was potentially
material. The significant accounting policies of SilverCrest conform in all material respects to those of First
Majestic.
3. PRO FORMA PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION
These unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the assumption
that a total of 33,145,817 First Majestic common shares will be issued in exchange for (a) 118,753,205 SilverCrest
shares outstanding as at June 30, 2015 and (b) 950,000 SilverCrest shares expected to be issued on the exercise of
in-the-money SilverCrest options that will expire before closing of the transaction. The value of the First Majestic
common shares issued was calculated based on the closing price of First Majestic common shares on August 20,
2015 of CAD$5.23 for the purpose of preparing these consolidated pro forma financial statements. The final
common share purchase consideration will be determined based on the market price of First Majestic’s common
shares on the closing date of the acquisition.
The transaction has an estimated total consideration of $135.0 million including the following items at June 30,
2015:
i)33,145,817 First Majestic common shares at $4.00 per share (CAD$5.23) for total share consideration of $132.5 million;
ii) 2,672,085 First Majestic replacement options with fair value of $2.4 million;
iii)Cash payment of $9,000 (CAD$12,000) as a result of cash consideration of CAD$0.0001 per SilverCrest share.

NOTES TO THE PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited) (tabular amounts are expressed in thousands of United States dollars, unless otherwise stated)
3. PRO FORMA PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION (continued)
The fair value of the First Majestic replacement options was determined using a Black-Scholes model using the
following weighted average assumptions:
Weighted average exercise price (CAD$)
 $6.58  
Weighted average fair value at grant date (CAD$) $1.20
Average risk-free interest rate (%)
Expected life (years)
Expected volatility (%)
0.71 %
   2.97  
   44.00%
The transaction will be accounted for as a business combination. First Majestic has allocated the consideration
estimating the fair value of the non-mining interest net assets to be equal to their carrying value, with the exception
of finished goods inventory which have been adjusted to their estimated fair value. The balance of the
consideration has been estimated to be the fair value of the acquired mining interests resulting in a $4.4 million pro-
forma adjustment to mining interests. A deferred income tax asset of $0.3 million arising from temporary difference
on purchase price allocation is recognized as a result of the fair value adjustments to inventories and mining
interests.
The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
financial statements is summarized in the table below:

3. PRO FORMA PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION (continued)
The Company will complete a full and detailed valuation of the fair value of the net assets of SilverCrest acquired
with the assistance of an independent third party. Additionally, the consideration given by First Majestic will be
valued at the date of closing of the transaction and therefore the final consideration may be significantly different
from that used in this pro forma information. A change of CAD$1.00 in the First Majestic share price would increase
or decrease the consideration expected to be transferred by approximately $25.3 million. Therefore, it is likely that
the purchase price and fair values of assets and liabilities acquired will vary from those shown below and the
differences may be material. The allocation of the purchase price is based upon management’s preliminary
estimates and certain assumptions with respect to the fair value increment associated with the assets to be
acquired and the liabilities to be assumed. The actual fair values of the assets and liabilities will be determined as of
the date of acquisition and may differ materially from the amounts disclosed above in the assumed pro forma
purchase price allocation because of changes in fair values of the assets and liabilities up to the date of the
transaction, and as further analysis (including the identification of intangible assets, for which no amounts have
been estimated and included in the preliminary amounts shown above) is completed. Consequently, the actual
allocation of the purchase price may result in different adjustments than those in the unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated statements of financial position.
4. PRO FORMA ASSUMPTIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS

as if the business combination of SilverCrest had occurred on June 30, 2015.

Corporate Structure and History
New SilverCrest was incorporated under the name “1040669 B.C. Ltd.” under the BCBCA on June 23, 2015 for the
purposes of completing the Arrangement. The Notice of Articles of New SilverCrest was subsequently amended on
August 11, 2015 to change the name of the company to “SilverCrest Metals Inc.”
New SilverCrest has not carried on any active business since incorporation. See in this Appendix H, “Description
of the Business — Acquisition of the New SilverCrest Assets”. New SilverCrest is not a reporting issuer (or the
equivalent) in any jurisdiction. New SilverCrest intends to file an application with the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSX-
V”) for listing of the New SilverCrest Shares following completion of the Arrangement. Listing of the New
SilverCrest Shares will be subject to New SilverCrest meeting all of the listing terms and conditions of the TSX-V.
Upon completion of the Arrangement, New SilverCrest expects to become a reporting issuer (or the equivalent) in
all of the provinces of Canada except Quebec.
New SilverCrest is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of SilverCrest. At the Effective Time, New SilverCrest will
cease to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of SilverCrest and it is expected that 100% of the New SilverCrest Shares
will be owned by Former SilverCrest Shareholders (other than Dissenting Shareholders). First Majestic will hold
approximately 9.9% of the then issued New SilverCrest Shares. Pursuant to the Arrangement, New SilverCrest will
acquire the New SilverCrest Assets and assume the New SilverCrest Transferred Liabilities (other than the liabilities
relating solely to the SilverCrest Transferred Properties). Following completion of the Arrangement, New
SilverCrest intends to be engaged in the exploration and, if appropriate, the development of the New SilverCrest
Exploration Properties (as defined below) as well as the acquisition of additional exploration and development
properties. See in this Appendix H, “Description of the Business”. In addition, New SilverCrest will have
approximately C$5,250,000 in cash to pursue its exploration business. See in this Appendix H, “General
Description of the Business” and “Available Funds”, and see in the Circular, “The Arrangement”.
H-2
While New SilverCrest plans to obtain a listing for the New SilverCrest Shares, there can be no assurance when, or
if, the New SilverCrest Shares will be listed on the TSX-V or on any other stock exchange. As at the date of the
Circular, there is no market through which the New SilverCrest Shares to be distributed pursuant to the
Arrangement may be sold and New SilverCrest Shareholders may not be able to resell the New SilverCrest Shares
to be distributed to them pursuant to the Arrangement. This may affect the pricing of the New SilverCrest Shares in
the secondary market, the transparency and availability of trading prices, the liquidity of the New SilverCrest
Shares, and the extent of the regulations to which New SilverCrest is subject. See in this Appendix H, “Market for
Securities” and “Risk Factors”.
The head office of New SilverCrest is located at Suite 501, 570 Granville Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6C
3P1. The registered office of New SilverCrest is located at 19th Floor, 885 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British
Columbia, V6C 3H4.
New SilverCrest currently has one subsidiary, Compañía Minera La Llamarada, SA de CV, a company governed by
the laws of Mexico (“New SilverCrest Sub”), which will hold the New SilverCrest Exploration Properties. Other than
New SilverCrest Sub, upon completion of the Arrangement New SilverCrest will have no subsidiaries and no
interest in any partnership, corporation or other business organization.
Description of the Business
General Description of the Business
New SilverCrest has as its focus, the further exploration and, if appropriate, development of the New SilverCrest
Exploration Properties as well as the acquisition, exploration and development of properties that it considers to
have potential for base mineral and precious metals discoveries in Mexico. New SilverCrest’s strategy will be to
create shareholder value through the acquisition, exploration, advancement and development of mineral
properties.
At the Effective Time, New SilverCrest will acquire the following mineral claims (whether patented or unpatented),
concessions, leases, licenses, surface rights or other mineral rights and other interests from SilverCrest (other than
the Guadalupe Property (as defined below) which will be acquired from First Majestic) in respect of:
1. the Cruz de Mayo exploration property located in Sonora, Mexico (the “Cruz de Mayo Property”);
2.
the Las Chispas exploration property located in Sonora, Mexico;
3.
the Angel de Plata exploration property located in Sonora, Mexico;
4.
the Huasabas exploration property located in Sonora, Mexico;
5. the Estacion Llano exploration property located in Sonora, Mexico; and
6. the Guadalupe exploration property located in Durango, Mexico (the “Guadalupe Property”),
(collectively, the “New SilverCrest Exploration Properties”).
Of the New SilverCrest Exploration Properties, management of New SilverCrest considers the Cruz de Mayo
Property to be material for the purposes of NI 43-101. See in this Appendix H, “Properties — The Cruz de Mayo
Property”. The remaining properties are each in a preliminary stage and exploration to date on these properties by
SilverCrest has been minimal.
At the Effective Time, New SilverCrest will also acquire (i) the SilverCrest name and logo, (ii) the office lease or a
sublease of SilverCrest’s existing offices located at Suites 501 and 503, 570 Granville Street, Vancouver, British
Columbia (the “New SilverCrest Offices”), and (iii) all office furniture, office equipment or office supplies located at
the New SilverCrest Offices and all associated computer software licenses (collectively, with the New SilverCrest
Exploration Properties, the “New SilverCrest Assets”). For a summary of the agreements relating to the transfer
from SilverCrest and First Majestic to New SilverCrest of the New SilverCrest Assets, see in this Appendix H,
“Description of the Business — Acquisition of the New SilverCrest Assets” below.
H-3
Business Objectives and Operations
The primary business objective of New SilverCrest is to attempt to achieve growth by advancing the exploration on
the New SilverCrest Exploration Properties and through the acquisition of additional mineral properties.
New SilverCrest will consider additional acquisitions of mineral property interests, or corporations holding mineral
property interests, on a going-forward basis after the Effective Time, with the objectives of: (i) creating additional
value for shareholders through the acquisition of additional mineral exploration properties; and (ii) helping to
minimize exploration risk by attempting to diversify New SilverCrest’s property portfolio. Although New SilverCrest
believes that the current exploration prospects for the Cruz de Mayo Property are positive and the other New
SilverCrest Exploration Properties show considerable upside potential, mineral exploration in general is both
uncertain and subject to fluctuating commodity prices resulting from changing trends in supply and demand. As a
result, New SilverCrest believes that by acquiring additional mineral properties, some of which may be prospective
in other commodities, it will be better able to minimize overall exploration risk and risks associated with fluctuating
commodities. Accordingly, New SilverCrest may seek to acquire additional mineral resource properties in the near
future. However, there can be no assurance that New SilverCrest will be able to identify suitable additional mineral
properties, that New SilverCrest will have sufficient financial resources to acquire such mineral properties, or that
such properties will be available on terms acceptable to New SilverCrest or at all.
In determining whether to make an expenditure to acquire an additional mineral property that New SilverCrest
considers prospective, the New SilverCrest Board will consider criteria such as the exploration history of the
properties, their location, or a combination of these and other factors. There can be no assurances that New
SilverCrest will be able to identify any such properties, or to acquire any such properties on favourable terms. Risk
factors to be considered in connection with New SilverCrest’s search for and acquisition of additional mineral
properties include the significant expenses required to locate and establish mineral reserves; the fact that
expenditures made by New SilverCrest may not result in discoveries of commercial quantities of minerals;
environmental risks; risks associated with land title, option and/or joint venture agreements, and property disputes;
the competition faced by New SilverCrest; and the potential failure of New SilverCrest to generate adequate funding
for any such acquisitions. As New SilverCrest’s portfolio of properties grows, New SilverCrest anticipates that there
will be a greater emphasis on the exploration of such properties, with the long-term goal of developing the
properties and achieving commercial production. New SilverCrest may enter into partnerships or joint ventures in
order to fully exploit the exploration and production potential of its exploration assets.
Acquisition of the New SilverCrest Assets
At the Effective Time, New SilverCrest will have entered into a conveyance agreement (the “SilverCrest
Conveyance Agreement”) with SilverCrest to effect the sale and transfer of the New SilverCrest Assets, other than
the Guadalupe Property, (the “SilverCrest Transferred Properties”) and will have entered into a conveyance
agreement (the “First Majestic Conveyance Agreement”) with First Majestic to effect the sale and transfer of the
Guadalupe Property. The particulars of these conveyance agreements are set out below.
Pursuant to and on the terms and conditions set out in the SilverCrest Conveyance Agreement, SilverCrest will
subscribe for and New SilverCrest will issue to SilverCrest such number of fully paid and non assessable New
SilverCrest Shares as is equal to the total number of SilverCrest Shares issued and outstanding at the Effective
Time (other than SilverCrest Shares held by Dissenting Shareholders) multiplied by 0.1667 for an aggregate
purchase price of C$5,291,635 and, in satisfaction of such purchase price, SilverCrest will (i) pay to New SilverCrest
cash in the amount of C$5,250,000, (ii) transfer to New SilverCrest all right, title and interest which it holds in and to
(or, in the case of (B), at the discretion of First Majestic, arrange for a sublease of) (A) the SilverCrest name and
logo, (B) the office lease of SilverCrest relating to SilverCrest’s existing offices located at Suites 501 and 503, 570
Granville Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, and (C) all office furniture, office equipment or office supplies located
at such office location and all associated computer software licenses; (iii) endorse over to New SilverCrest the non
interest bearing demand promissory note (the “Nusantara Note”) issued to SilverCrest by its subsidiary, Nusantara
de Mexico S.A. de C.V., in the amount of C$24,235, which note will be immediately assigned by New SilverCrest to
New SilverCrest Sub; and (iv) assume all of the SilverCrest Transferred Liabilities (other than SilverCrest
Transferred Liabilities relating solely to the SilverCrest Transferred Properties).
H-4
Pursuant to and on the terms and conditions set out in the SilverCrest Conveyance Agreement, SilverCrest shall
cause its subsidiaries to assign and transfer to New SilverCrest Sub and New SilverCrest shall cause New
SilverCrest Sub to accept all right, title and interest in and to the SilverCrest Transferred Properties for an
aggregate purchase price of C$24,235 and, in satisfaction of such purchase price, New SilverCrest Sub will (i) set-
off the Nusantara Note against the cash portion of such purchase price and will surrender the Nusantara Note for
cancellation; and (ii) assume all of the SilverCrest Transferred Liabilities relating solely to the SilverCrest
Transferred Properties;
Pursuant to and on the terms and conditions set out in the First Majestic Conveyance Agreement, First Majestic will
subscribe for and New SilverCrest will issue to First Majestic such number of fully-paid and non-assessable New
SilverCrest Shares as is equal to the number of New SilverCrest Shares issued to SilverCrest under the SilverCrest
Conveyance Agreement multiplied by 0.1099 for an aggregate purchase price equal the aggregate purchase price
under the SilverCrest Conveyance Agreement multiplied by 0.1099. The purchase price will be satisfied by First
Majestic causing First Majestic Sub to assign and transfer to New SilverCrest Sub all right, title and interest in and
to the Guadalupe Property.
See in the Circular, “The Arrangement — Description of the Arrangement”.
Environmental Regulation
All aspects of New SilverCrest’s field operations will be subject to environmental regulations and generally will
require approval by appropriate regulatory authorities prior to commencement. Any failure to comply could result
in fines and penalties. With all projects at the exploration stage, the financial and operational impact of
environmental protection requirements is minimal. Should any projects advance to the production stage, then more
time and money would be involved in satisfying environmental protection requirements. Compliance with such
legislation can require significant expenditures or result in operational restrictions. Breaches of such requirements
may also result in suspension or revocation of necessary licenses and authorizations, potential civil liability and
the imposition of fines and penalties, all of which might have a significant negative impact on New SilverCrest. New
SilverCrest intends to maintain a policy of operating its business in compliance with all environmental regulations.
Social and Environmental Policies
New SilverCrest will operate under principles of environmental and sociological best practices, and it will be its
objective to be a responsible operator and friendly neighbour. New SilverCrest’s goal will be to work with
community stakeholders to make positive contributions to local economic development. New SilverCrest intends to
place a priority on hiring local workers and assisting in supporting local community development projects, where it
can.
Employees
As of the date of the Circular, the sole employees of New SilverCrest are N. Eric Fier as President and Chief
Executive Officer and Barney Magnusson as Chief Financial Officer. At the Effective Time, New SilverCrest expects
to continue to have two (2) employees, with Mr. Fier employed full time and Mr. Magnusson employed part time. New
SilverCrest also intends to hire, from time to time, additional employees in the future and contractors and
consultants to perform specialized services.
New SilverCrest believes that its success is dependent on the performance of its management and key employees,
many of whom will have specialized knowledge and skills relating to the precious metals and mineral exploration
business. New SilverCrest believes it will have adequate personnel with the specialized skills required to
successfully carry out its operations.
Competitive Conditions
The mineral exploration and mining industry is competitive in all phases of exploration, development and
production. New SilverCrest will compete with numerous companies and individuals that have resources
significantly in excess of the resources of New SilverCrest, in the search for (i) attractive mineral properties; (ii)
qualified service providers and employees; and (iii) equipment and suppliers.
The ability of New SilverCrest to acquire and explore additional properties depends on its success in exploring and
developing its existing property interests and on its ability to select, acquire and bring to production suitable
properties or prospects for mineral exploration and development. Factors beyond the control of New SilverCrest
may affect the marketability of any minerals mined or discovered by New SilverCrest.
H-5
Market Trends
New SilverCrest’s financial success will depend upon the extent to which it can discover mineralization and the
economic viability of developing its properties. Such development may take years to complete and the resulting
income, if any, is difficult to determine with any certainty. The sales value of any mineralization discovered by New
SilverCrest will be largely dependent upon factors beyond New SilverCrest’s control, such as the market value of
the commodities produced.
There are significant uncertainties regarding the price of minerals and the availability of equity financing for the
purposes of mineral exploration and development. New SilverCrest’s future performance is largely tied to the
development of its current mineral property interests and the overall financial markets. Current financial markets
are likely to be volatile in Canada, reflecting ongoing concerns about the stability of the global economy and
weakening global growth prospects. As well, concern about global growth has led to sustained drops in the
commodity markets. Unprecedented uncertainty in the credit markets has also led to increased difficulties in
borrowing and raising funds. Companies worldwide have been affected negatively by these trends. As a result,
New SilverCrest may have difficulties raising equity financing for the purposes of mineral exploration and
development, particularly without excessively diluting New SilverCrest Shareholders. With continued market
volatility and slower worldwide economic growth, New SilverCrest’s strategy is to seek out prospective resource
properties to acquire, continue exploring the Cruz de Mayo Property, financing the ongoing exploration of the other
New SilverCrest Exploration Properties. New SilverCrest believes this strategy will enable it to meet the near-term
challenges presented by the capital markets while maintaining the momentum on key initiatives. These trends may
limit New SilverCrest’s ability to develop and/or further explore the Cruz de Mayo Property, the other New
SilverCrest Exploration Properties and/or other property interests acquired in the future.
Apart from these and the risk factors noted under the heading “Risk Factors”, management is not aware of any
other trends, commitments, events or uncertainties that would have a material effect on New SilverCrest’s
business, financial condition or results of operations.
Properties of New SilverCrest
If the Arrangement is completed, New SilverCrest will, directly or indirectly, acquire the interests in the New
SilverCrest Exploration Properties. Of these properties, management of New SilverCrest considers the Cruz de
Mayo Property to be material for the purposes of NI 43-101. The Cruz de Mayo Property is discussed in more detail
below.
The Cruz de Mayo Property
The information in this Appendix H with respect to the Cruz de Mayo Property is the executive summary extracted
from a technical report entitled “Mineral Resource Estimate for the Cruz de Mayo Property, Sonora, Mexico”
effective August 17, 2015 pertaining to the Cruz de Mayo Property (the “Technical Report”) that was commissioned
by and prepared for SilverCrest and New SilverCrest by Tetra Tech EBA Inc. in compliance with NI 43-101. Mr.
James Barr is a “Qualified Person” and considered “independent” as both those terms are defined in NI 43-101.
See in this Appendix H, “Interests of Experts”.
A copy of the Technical Report may be inspected by SilverCrest Shareholders at the head office of SilverCrest at
Suite 501, 570 Granville Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6C 3P1 during normal business hours prior to the
SilverCrest Meeting, or at the SilverCrest Meeting. It can also be accessed under SilverCrest’s profile on SEDAR at
www.sedar.com. Following completion of the Arrangement, the Technical Report will be filed electronically with
regulators by New SilverCrest and will be available for public viewing under New SilverCrest’s profile on SEDAR at
www.sedar.com.
Property Description and Ownership
The Cruz de Mayo property is located in the State of Sonora, Mexico, approximately 22 km northwest of the town of
Cumpas and 163 km north east of Hermosillo. The project is located 35 km directly northeast, and approximately
150 km total distance when travelled by paved road, of the Santa Elena mine. The Cruz de Mayo Property consists
of two mineral concessions, Cruz de Mayo 2 and El Gueriguito, combining for a total area of 452 hectares. The Cruz
de Mayo Property is to be transferred to New SilverCrest as part of the friendly acquisition of SilverCrest by First
Majestic as announced on July 27, 2015. Transfer of property rights to New SilverCrest is currently underway. The
shares of New SilverCrest are to be distributed to the shareholders of SilverCrest as a part of the First Majestic
Transaction, resulting in New SilverCrest becoming the owner of the property as a separate, standalone company.
When completed, New SilverCrest will hold a 100% ownership of the Cruz de Mayo 2 and El Gueriguito concessions
through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Minera Llamarada S.A de C.V. The El Gueriguito concession is subject to a
2.5% NSR, to a maximum of US$1,000,000.
H-6
Geology and Mineralization
The Cruz de Mayo Project is located in the north-central part of the Sierra Madre Occidental, on the western flank of
the Moctezuma River valley. The geology of the property consists of a sequence of felsic to intermediate volcanic
and volcaniclastic rocks that have been thrust over andesite rocks in the footwall. The thrust sequence gives rise
to the northwest trending ridge that is host to the deposit.
Mineralization is largely restricted to a series of discontinuous quartz veins that occupy the broad deformation
zone created by the thrust fault. Cruz de Mayo is categorized as a low-sulphidation, epithermal silver deposit with
minor gold, copper, and zinc. Mineralization occurs in banded quartz veins, stockwork and breccia and is
commonly associated with silver sulfosalts, fluorite, calcite and minor sulphides. Iron oxides, including limonite,
jarosite, goethite and hematite are also commonly associated with mineralization.
It is postulated that the structural deformation associated with the thrust fault provided a conduit system for
mineralizing fluids, and was further enhanced by an increase in porosity and heterogeneity in the rhyolitic and
volcaniclastic rocks.
Drilling and Exploration
The property has been the focus of small-scale exploration and mining efforts for over one hundred years. Records
and local sources indicate that mining took place on the property prior to the Mexican Revolution in 1910, and on
and off between 1945 and 1970. Unofficial reports suggest that approximately 5,000 tonnes of ore mined from the
Cruz de Mayo deposit were shipped to the nearby La Caridad smelter for flux at a grade of 0.5 g/t gold and 150 g/t
silver. No official records exist of this and no old tailings remain onsite.
Previously, SilverCrest carried out a number of exploration programs since acquiring the property in 2005,
including over 15,000 metres of reverse circulation and diamond drilling. New SilverCrest has recently completed
acquisition and assessment review of the exploration potential in the concessions. The results of this work have
been reviewed in detail as part of the resource update.
Four separate metallurgical test programs have been completed between 2007 and 2012 by SilverCrest. The results
of these test programs indicate that the mineralized samples leached favourably with cyanide, however, the results
pertaining to metal recovery are inconclusive at this stage. Silver recoveries ranged from 25% to 91% and gold
recoveries ranged from 51% to 95%, depending on test work parameters and conditions.
Mineral Resource Estimates
Tetra Tech EBA updated the resource estimates for Cruz de Mayo using Gemcom GEMS v. 6.6 modelling software.
The estimate includes drilling results up to the end of 2012. The effective date for this work is August 15, 2015.
For the purpose of defining a suitable grade cut-off, the resource estimate is contemplated to support an
autonomous onsite coarse crushing heap leach operation with both open pit and underground resource potential.
The project was previously contemplated (EBA, 2011) as a remote open pit operation feeding material to the newly
expanded Santa Elena Mine heap leach and processing plant, however, this is no longer considered for the project.
The updated resource estimate includes an additional 74 diamond drill and reverse circulation holes (9,304.8
metres), and a total of 4,764 samples which have been collected across the property since the previous Technical
Report. Drilling was completed in mid-2012.
The resource was constrained within a geological model and within a 15 g/t silver mineralized 3D wireframe. A block
size of 10 m x 10 m x 5 m was chosen for the model, and grades interpolated into the blocks using the inverse
distance squared methodology. Silver grades are capped at 700 g/t and gold grades are capped at 1 g/t.

gpt AgEq for underground resources. Cut-off grades were estimated from metal prices and recoveries used for AgEq
calculation and mining costs from similar mining projects in Mexico.
Conclusions and Recommendations
The Cruz de Mayo property is host to a near-surface, low-sulphidation epithermal silver deposit, located in Sonora,
Mexico. Additional drilling on the property warranted a re-examination of the previous Mineral Resource Estimates
reported in 2007 and 2011, which is part of this 43-101 report. The estimates completed by Tetra Tech EBA show a
significant upgrade in resources from the inferred to the indicated categories, while reducing the overall tonnage
from previous estimates.
The following recommendations are suggested for further work at Cruz de Mayo:
· Evaluation of nearby potential acquisitions for expansion of resource.
· Carry out more metallurgical work to define optimal recoveries
·Resampling or twinned hole programs in areas with assays obtained exclusively with 4 acid digest.
·Increase drillhole density in areas with potential to host high-grade shoots

*Based on results and success of Phase I
The Las Chispas Property
The Las Chispas property is located approximately 180 kilometres northeast of Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. The
community of Arizpe (est. pop. 2,000) is located approximately 12 kilometres to the north of the property. The
property consists of 17 concessions totalling to 1326.78 hectares.
In 1640, rich silver veins where discovered near Arizpe by soldiers under the command of Pedro de Perra. The
property did not receive any notable exploration or production until the late 1800’s. From 1880 to 1930, several
mines on the property had intermittent production. From public information, approximately 120 million ounces of
silver and 200 thousand ounces of gold were cumulatively produced from the property. Since 1930, no significant
work has been completed on the property.
During the early 1980’s, a local Mexican company reprocessed old waste and tailings dumps from Las Chispas.
Processing was by vat leaching with no production records available.
In 2011, Minefinders Corp., completed a 7 hole reverse circulation drill program adjacent to one of the several
mineralized zones on the property. Drill results were generally negative. Minefinders was unable to drill the main
defined targets on the property due to the inability to secure rights to concessions.
In the first half of 2015, SilverCrest completed negotiations with local Mexican individuals and a Mexican company
to acquire the property under several option to purchase agreements.
Geologically, the Las Chispas property consists of a Late Cretaceous – Early Tertiary low sulfidation epithermal
system. Host rocks are volcanic tuffs, rhyolites, agglomerates and rhyolite breccias. Andesite dykes are noted in
underground workings sub-parallel to mineralized structures.
The Las Chispas Mine is known for its world-class silver mineral specimens including polybasite, stephanite, native
silver and pyrargyrite. Specimens are on display in private collections and museums worldwide.
Mineralization occurs in 0.5 to 5 metre wide veins with adjacent stockwork and breccias trending northwest-
southeast for 1 to 1.5 kilometres. Depth from surface of known mineralization is estimated at 300 metres. Main veins
dip 55 to 85 degrees to the southwest. Fourteen (14) epithermal veins have been previously defined on the property
of which 3 have had notable production. The historical producing veins included Las Chispas, Guillermo Tell, and
Babicanora. From public information, the Las Chispas mill production between 1908 through 1911 was
approximately 25,000 tonnes grading 35 gpt gold and 4,500 gpt silver totalling an estimated 25,000 ounces of gold
and 3.2 million ounces of silver. Several kilometres of underground workings exist on the property and are partially
accessible.
H-9
Targets for modern exploration include drilling of near-surface (0 to 100 metres) vein extensions, depth (200 to
400 metres) extensions of historical producing areas, potential open pitable stockwork and breccia zones, and
possibly reprocessing remaining waste and old tailings dumps.
The Silver Angel Property
The Silver Angel property is located approximately 165 kilometres northeast of Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. The
community of Arizpe (est. pop. 2,000) is located approximately 25 kilometres to the west of the property. The
property consists of one concession totalling 619 hectares.
The property did not receive any notable exploration or production until the late 1800’s and early 1900’s.
Production from the Silver Angel was minor with no available records. An adit exists on the property with access to
mineralization.
In 2005 and 2006, SilverCrest conducted a limited core drilling program to test a potential lower grade silver open
pit target. Results were negative. A sulfide rich vein approximately five metres wide is exposed in the face of
underground workings. The vein strikes east-west and is near vertical. Channel sampling of the face graded 280
gpt silver.
Geologically, the Silver Angel property consists of Late Cretaceous – Early Tertiary high sulfidation epithermal
system. Host rocks are rhyolites and andesites.
Mineralization occurs in a 0.5 to 5 metre wide veins with adjacent stockwork trending east-west for 200 metres.
Depth from surface of known mineralization is unknown. Vein dip is vertical.
Target for further exploration is the depth extension of the higher grade silver sulfide vein.
The Huasabas Property
The Huasabas property is located approximately 190 kilometres northeast of Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. The
community of Huasabas (est. pop. 1,000) is located approximately 15 kilometres to the southeast of the property.
The property consists of 1 concessions totalling to 800 hectares.
The property was claimed by SilverCrest in 2013 during a reconnaissance trip. No previous history is available for
the property.
Geologically, the Huasabas property consists of Late Cretaceous – Early Tertiary low sulfidation epithermal system.
Host rocks are andesite flows, volcanic tuffs, and rhyolite flows.
Mineralization occurs in a 5 to 50 metre wide vein with chalcedony, lattice and crustiform textures, stockwork and
breccias trending north-south for approximately one kilometre. Depth from surface of mineralization is unknown.
The vein dips 65 to 85 degrees to the west. Surface channel sampling results show anomalous gold (up to 0.2 gpt),
silver (up to 2.5 gpt), mercury (up to 73 ppm), arsenic (up to 64 ppm) and antimony (up to 31 ppm).
The target is considered to be a high level low sulfidation epithermal system with the potential precious metals zone
starting at 50 to 200 metres from surface.
The Estacion Llano Property
The Estacion Llano property is located approximately 140 kilometres north of Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. The
community of Estacion Llano (est. pop. 1,000) is located approximately 8 kilometres to the east of the property.
Also, the Timmins’ San Francisco mine is adjacent to the property. The property consists of one concession
totalling to 2,378.76 hectares.
Minimal work has been completed on the property to date. Timmins Gold has completed drilling near the property.
The target is the extension of west-northwest mineralization from the San Francisco Mine.
H-10
This property is currently subject to litigation and depending on the outcome, may not be transferable to New
SilverCrest.
The Guadalupe Property
The Guadalupe Property is located approximately 110 kilometres northwest of Durango City, Durango, Mexico. The
community of Gavilanes (est. pop. 145) is located adjacent to the property and San Miguel de Cruces (est. pop.
1,800) is approximately 25 kilometres north. The property consists of one concession totalling 4,762.2 hectares.
The property was claimed by Hochschild Mining in 2007 and subsequently acquired by First Majestic in 2010. The
property is located in the Gavilanes mining district with intermittent mining since the 1700’s. Santa Cruz Silver
Mining recently discovered the “Gavilanes Deposit” immediately adjacent to the property. Primero Mining’s San
Dimas Mine is approximately 20 kilometres to the southwest.
Geologically, the Guadalupe Property consists of Late Cretaceous – Early Tertiary intermediate sulfidation
epithermal system. Host rocks are andesite and rhyolite flows.
Mineralization occurs in a 1 to 2 metre wide veins with stockwork and breccias trending northwest-southeast for
approximately one kilometre. Depth from surface of mineralization is unknown. Veins dip 65 to 85 degrees to the
west. Surface channel sampling results show anomalous gold (up to 3.77 gpt), silver (up to 680 gpt), lead (up to 0.6
%), and zinc (up to 0.08%).
The target is considered to be an epithermal system with the precious and base metal zones starting at the surface.
Available Funds and Principal Purposes
Available Funds
Pursuant to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement and assuming completion of the Arrangement and the
transfer of the New SilverCrest Assets in the manner described above under “Description of the Business —
Acquisition of the New SilverCrest Assets”, on the Effective Date it is anticipated that New SilverCrest will have
available working capital of approximately C$5,250,000. It is expected that these available funds will be used to
carry out the business objectives of New SilverCrest set out under the heading “Description of the Business —
Business Objectives and Operations”. See also in Schedules IV and V to this Appendix H, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis”, and see in the Circular, “The Arrangement — Description of the Arrangement”.
Principal Purposes
The following table summarizes expenditures anticipated by New SilverCrest based on current plans required to
achieve its business objectives during the 18 month period following completion of the Arrangement. In addition to
the amounts set out below, New SilverCrest may make additional acquisitions of mineral properties or interests as
more fully described above, under the heading “Description of the Business — Business Objectives and
Operations”.

See in this Appendix H, “Properties of New SilverCrest — The Cruz de Mayo Property”.
(2)
Estimated general and administrative expenses, professional fees and other corporate costs for the 18 months following
completion of the Arrangement, comprised of wages and employment benefits (C$157,500), office rent (C$112,500),
legal, listing and filing fees (C$150,000), general corporate expenses (C$300,000) and audit fees (C$40,000).
H-11
Based on initial working capital available and the expenditures assumed (as listed above), New SilverCrest expects
to have sufficient funds for at least the next 18 months. While New SilverCrest currently intends to spend the funds
available to it as stated in the table above, there may be circumstances where the New SilverCrest Board
determines that a reallocation of funds is necessary or advisable in order for New SilverCrest to meet its business
objectives. If, due to unexpected additional capital requirements, New SilverCrest does not have sufficient funds to
satisfy its capital obligations, it may be required to seek additional sources of capital. See in this Appendix H, “Risk
Factors”.
Following completion of the Arrangement, under the Arrangement Agreement, New SilverCrest has agreed to
indemnify First Majestic, SilverCrest and others from all losses suffered or incurred by them arising directly or
indirectly out or in connection with the SilverCrest Transferred Liabilities. See in this Appendix H, “Risk Factors –
Indemnified Liability Risk”.
Business Objectives
Following completion of the Arrangement, New SilverCrest proposes to undertake a strategic review of its
properties to determine the projects and programs which will maximize shareholder value. New SilverCrest will also
consider additional acquisitions of mineral property interests, or corporations holding mineral property interests,
on a going forward basis, with the objectives of: (i) creating additional value for shareholders through the
acquisition of additional mineral exploration and development properties; and (ii) helping to minimize exploration
risk by attempting to diversify New SilverCrest’s property portfolio. Although New SilverCrest believes that the
current exploration prospects for its exploration projects are positive, mineral exploration in general is both
uncertain and subject to fluctuating commodity prices resulting from changing trends in supply and demand.

Corporate Cease Trade Orders, Bankruptcies, Penalties or Sanctions
Other than as disclosed herein, no current or proposed director or executive officer of New SilverCrest is, as at the
date of the Circular, or has been, within the ten years preceding the date of the Circular, a director, chief executive
officer or chief financial officer of any company (including New SilverCrest) that
(a)
was subject to a cease trade or similar order or an order that denied the relevant company access to any exemption
under securities legislation, that was in effect for a period of more than 30 consecutive days, when such order was issued
while the person was acting in the capacity of a director, chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the relevant
company; or
(b)
was subject to a cease trade or similar order or an order that denied the relevant company access to any exemption
under securities legislation, that was in effect for a period of more than 30 consecutive days, that was issued after such
person ceased to be a director, chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the relevant company, and which
resulted from an event that occurred while the person was acting in the capacity of a director, chief executive officer or
chief financial officer of the relevant company.
The current directors and executive officers of New SilverCrest (with the exception of Ross O. Glanville and
Dunham L. Craig) were directors and/or executive officers of SilverCrest in December 2010 when SilverCrest
received notification of administrative proceedings from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
This notification was issued as a result of a registration statement filed in 1999 by Strathclair Ventures Ltd., a
predecessor company to SilverCrest which was under different management until SilverCrest assumed control in
2003. The order alleged that Strathclair (now SilverCrest) had not filed periodic reports with the SEC sufficient to
maintain its registration in the United States. Following discussions with the SEC and in order to remedy the
situation, SilverCrest entered into a consent order with the SEC dated January 10, 2011 through which SilverCrest
agreed to the revocation of the registration of its common shares under the United States Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. As a result, broker-dealers in the United States were unable to effect transactions in the common shares of
SilverCrest. On May 31, 2011, SilverCrest filed a registration statement on Form 40 F for the purpose of registering
its common shares under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Upon the registration statement
taking effect on August 1, 2011, broker dealers in the United States were able to effect transactions in common
shares of SilverCrest in the United States.
H-19
Ross O. Glanville, a director of New SilverCrest, was also a director of Clifton Star Resources Inc., when the British
Columbia Securities Commission issued a cease trade order on July 22, 2011 in connection with the failure to file
technical reports and material change reports in the required forms disclosing Clifton’s mineral resource estimates
on its material properties. After changes in the management and board of directors (including the appointment of
Mr. Glanville as Chairman of Clifton Star), and the filing of the relevant documents, the cease trade order was
revoked on March 5, 2012.
Bernard Poznanski, the Corporate Secretary of New SilverCrest, was a director of Energem Resources Inc. when
certain management cease trade orders were issued against the insiders of Energem. Mr. Poznanski ceased to be a
director of Energem on May 1, 2006. Particulars of the orders are as follows:
(a)
On March 7, 2006, the BCSC issued a management cease trade order in connection with the late filing of Energem’s
2005 comparative annual financial statements, 2005 annual MD&A and a 2005 Annual Information Form. The
management cease trade order was revoked on May 31, 2006, after the relevant documents were filed; and
(b)
On April 20, 2005, the BCSC issued a management cease trade order in connection with the late filing of Energem’s
2004 comparative annual financial statements, 2005 first interim period financial statements and MD&A for the 2005 first
interim period. The management cease trade order was revoked on June 2, 2005 after the relevant documents were filed.
Other than as disclosed herein, no current or proposed director or executive officer of New SilverCrest or any
shareholder holding a sufficient number of common shares of New SilverCrest to affect materially the control of
New SilverCrest:
(a)
is, as at the date of the Circular, or has been, within the ten years preceding the date of the Circular, a director or
executive officer of any company (including New SilverCrest) that, while that person was acting in that capacity, or within
a year of that person ceasing to act in that capacity, became bankrupt, made a proposal under any legislation relating to
bankruptcy or insolvency or was subject to or instituted any proceedings, arrangement or compromise with creditors or
had a receiver, receiver manager or trustee appointed to hold its assets;
(b)
has, within the ten years preceding the date of the Circular, become bankrupt, made a proposal under any legislation
relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, or become subject to or instituted any proceedings, arrangement or compromise with
creditors, or had a receiver, receiver manager or trustee appointed to hold the assets of that person;
(c)
has been subject to any penalties or sanctions imposed by a court relating to securities legislation or by a securities
regulatory authority or has entered into a settlement agreement with a securities regulatory authority; or
(d)
has been subject to any other penalties or sanctions imposed by a court or regulatory body that would likely be
considered important to a reasonable investor in making an investment decision regarding New SilverCrest.
The foregoing information, not being within the knowledge of New SilverCrest, has been furnished by the
respective directors, officers and shareholders holding a sufficient number of securities of New SilverCrest to affect
materially the control of New SilverCrest.
Conflicts of Interest
There are potential conflicts of interest to which the directors and officers of New SilverCrest will be subject in
connection with the business of New SilverCrest. In particular, certain of the proposed directors and/or officers of
New SilverCrest serve as directors and/or officers of other companies that are similarly engaged in the business of
acquiring, developing and exploiting natural resource properties and whose business may, from time to time, be in
direct or indirect competition with New SilverCrest. Such associations may give rise to conflicts of interest from
time to time. The directors of New SilverCrest are required by law to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the
best interests of New SilverCrest and to disclose any interest, which they may have in any project opportunity of
New SilverCrest. Conflicts, if any, will be subject to and governed by laws applicable to directors’ and officers’
conflicts of interest, including the procedures and remedies available under the BCBCA. The BCBCA provides that,
in the event that a director has an interest in a contract or proposed contract or agreement, the director shall
disclose his interest in such contract or agreement and shall refrain from voting on any matter in respect of such
contract or agreement unless otherwise provided by the BCBCA. As at the date of the Circular, New SilverCrest is
not aware of any existing or potential material conflicts of interest between New SilverCrest and any current or
proposed director or officer of New SilverCrest. See in this Appendix H, “Risk Factors — Conflicts of Interest”.

Executive Compensation
For purposes of this section, the terms “Named Executive Officers” or “NEO” refer to each of the following
individuals:
(a)
a chief executive officer (“CEO”) of New SilverCrest;
(b)
a chief financial officer (“CFO”) of New SilverCrest;
(c)
each of New SilverCrest’s three most highly compensated executive officers, or the three most highly compensated
individuals acting in a similar capacity, other than the CEO and CFO, at the end of the most recently completed financial
year whose total compensation was, individually, more than C$150,000; and
(d)
each individual who would be an NEO under paragraph (c) above but for the fact that the individual was neither an
executive officer of New SilverCrest, nor acting in a similar capacity, at the end of that financial year.
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
It is expected that the compensation committee of the New SilverCrest Board (the “Compensation Committee”) will
be responsible for ensuring that New SilverCrest has in place an appropriate plan for executive compensation and
for making recommendations to the New SilverCrest Board with respect to the compensation of New SilverCrest’s
executive officers. It is expected that the Compensation Committee will ensure that total compensation paid to all
Named Executive Officers is fair and reasonable and is consistent with New SilverCrest’s compensation
philosophy.
Compensation plays an important role in achieving short and long-term business objectives that ultimately drive
business success. New SilverCrest’s compensation philosophy will be to foster entrepreneurship at all levels of the
organization through, among other things, the granting of stock options, which will be a significant component of
executive compensation. This approach is based on the assumption that the performance of the New SilverCrest
Share price over the long term is an important indicator of long term performance.
H-22
It is expected that New SilverCrest’s compensation philosophy will be based on the following fundamental
principles:
(a)
Compensation programs align with shareholder interests — New SilverCrest aligns the goals of executives with
maximizing long term shareholder value;
(b)
Performance sensitive — compensation for executive officers should be linked to operating and market performance of
New SilverCrest and fluctuate with the performance; and
(c)
Offer market competitive compensation to attract and retain talent — the compensation program should provide market
competitive pay in terms of value and structure in order to retain existing employees who are performing according to their
objectives and to attract new individuals of the highest caliber.
The objectives of the compensation program in compensating all NEOs will be developed based on the above-
mentioned compensation philosophy and will be as follows:
· to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers;
to align the interests of executive officers with shareholders’ interests and with the execution of New SilverCrest business
·
strategy;
·to evaluate executive performance on the basis of key measurements that correlate to long-term shareholder value; and
to tie compensation directly to those measurements and rewards based on achieving and exceeding predetermined
·
objectives.
Aggregate compensation for each NEO will be designed to be competitive. The Compensation Committee will
review from time to time the compensation practices of similarly situated companies when considering New
SilverCrest’s executive compensation policy. Although the Compensation Committee will review each element of
compensation for market competitiveness, and it may weigh a particular element more heavily based on the NEO’s
role within New SilverCrest, it will be primarily focused on remaining competitive in the market with respect to total
compensation.
From time to time, on an ad hoc basis, the Compensation Committee will review data related to compensation levels
and programs of various companies that are similar in size to New SilverCrest and operate within the mining
exploration and development industry. The Compensation Committee will also rely on the experience of its
members as officers and/or directors at other companies in similar lines of business as New SilverCrest in
assessing compensation levels. These other companies are identified in this Appendix H under the heading
“Corporate Governance — Directorships”.
Aligning the Interests of the NEOs with the Interests of the New SilverCrest Shareholders
New SilverCrest believes that transparent, objective and easily verified corporate goals, combined with individual
performance goals, play an important role in creating and maintaining an effective compensation strategy for the
NEOs. New SilverCrest’s objective will be to establish benchmarks and targets for its NEOs which, if achieved, will
enhance shareholder value. A combination of fixed and variable compensation will be used to motivate executives
to achieve overall corporate goals. The three basic components of New SilverCrest’s executive officer
compensation program will be:
·
fixed salary;
· annual incentives (cash bonus); and
· option based compensation.
H-23
Fixed salary will comprise a portion of the total cash-based compensation; however, annual incentives and option
based compensation represent compensation that is “at risk” and thus may or may not be paid to the respective
executive officer depending on: (i) whether the executive officer is able to meet or exceed his or her applicable
performance targets; and (ii) market performance of the New SilverCrest Shares. To date, no specific formulae have
been developed to assign a specific weighting to each of these components. Instead, the New SilverCrest Board
will consider each performance target and New SilverCrest’s performance and assigns compensation based on
this assessment and the recommendations of the Compensation Committee.
Base Salary
The Compensation Committee and the New SilverCrest Board will approve the salary ranges for the NEOs. The
base salary review for each NEO will be based on assessment of factors such as current competitive market
conditions, compensation levels within compensation practices of similarly situated companies and particular
skills, such as leadership ability and management effectiveness, experience, responsibility and proven or expected
performance of the particular individual. New SilverCrest may consider comparative data for New SilverCrest’s peer
group which would be accumulated from a number of external sources including independent consultants. New
SilverCrest’s policy for determining salary for executive officers will be consistent with the administration of
salaries for all other employees. As of the date of the Circular, New SilverCrest has not paid any salaries.
Annual Incentives
To date, New SilverCrest has not awarded any annual incentives by way of cash bonuses. However, New
SilverCrest, in its discretion, may award such incentives in order to motivate executives to achieve short-term
corporate goals. The Compensation Committee and the New SilverCrest Board will approve annual incentives.
The success of NEOs in achieving their individual objectives and their contribution to New SilverCrest in reaching
its overall goals are to be factors in the determination of their annual bonus. The Compensation Committee shall
assess each NEO’s performance on the basis of his or her respective contribution to the achievement of the
predetermined corporate objectives, as well as to needs of New SilverCrest that arise on a day to day basis. This
assessment will be used by the Compensation Committee in developing its recommendations to the New
SilverCrest Board with respect to the determination of annual bonuses for the NEOs. Where the Compensation
Committee cannot unanimously agree, the matter will be referred to the full New SilverCrest Board for decision. The
New SilverCrest Board will rely heavily on the recommendations of the Compensation Committee in granting
annual incentives.
Option-Based Awards
Following completion of the Arrangement, the directors and executive officers of New SilverCrest will hold
approximately the following New SilverCrest Options to purchase New SilverCrest Shares under the New
SilverCrest Option Plan (assuming that no SilverCrest Options are exercised prior to the Effective Time):

   12,503
Options held by management will be taken into consideration by the Compensation Committee at the time of any
subsequent option grants under the New SilverCrest Option Plan in determining the quantum or terms of any such
subsequent option grants. Options may be granted to directors, management, employees and certain service
providers as long-term incentives to align the individual’s interests with those of New SilverCrest. The size of the
option awards is anticipated to be in proportion to the deemed ability of the individual to make an impact on New
SilverCrest’s success, as determined by the New SilverCrest Board. See in this Appendix H, “Options and Other
Rights to Purchase Securities of New SilverCrest”.
H-24
Compensation of Executives
As at the date of the Circular, no remuneration or other compensation has been paid or provided by New
SilverCrest to its executive officers for their services.
The New SilverCrest Board will approve targeted amounts of annual incentives for each NEO at the beginning of
each financial year. The targeted amounts will be determined by the Compensation Committee based on a number
of factors, including comparable compensation of similar companies.
Achieving predetermined individual and/or corporate targets and objectives, as well as general performance in day-
to-day corporate activities, will trigger the award of a bonus payment to the NEOs. The NEOs will receive a partial or
full incentive payment depending on the number of the predetermined targets met and the Compensation
Committee’s and the New SilverCrest Board’s assessment of overall performance. The determination as to whether
a target has been met will ultimately be made by the New SilverCrest Board and the New SilverCrest Board will
reserve the right to make positive or negative adjustments to any bonus payment if they consider them to be
appropriate.
At or prior to the Effective Time, New SilverCrest expects to enter into employment agreements with each of its
Named Executive Officers, pursuant to which the Named Executive Officers will provide management and
administrative services to, and be compensated for those services by, New SilverCrest, as more particularly
described in this Appendix H below under the heading “Executive Compensation — Employment Agreements”.
Employment Agreements
At or prior to the Effective Time, New SilverCrest will enter into an employment agreement with N. Eric Fier pursuant
to which Mr. Fier will provide his services as President and Chief Executive Officer of New SilverCrest in
consideration of an annual base salary of C$60,000. The agreement will include a severance clause which provides
for payment of one and one-half times of then applicable base salary, bonus and benefits if Mr. Fier is terminated
without cause or two times of then applicable base salary, bonus and benefits if New SilverCrest undergoes a
change in control, as defined in Mr. Fier’s employment agreement.
At or prior to the Effective Time, New SilverCrest will enter into an employment agreement with Barney Magnusson
pursuant to which Mr. Magnusson will provide his services as Chief Financial Officer of New SilverCrest on a part-
time basis in consideration of annual fees of approximately C$45,000 per year. The agreement will include a
severance clause which provides for payment of one and one-half times of then applicable base salary, bonus and
benefits if Mr. Magnusson is terminated without cause or two times of then applicable base salary, bonus and
benefits if New SilverCrest undergoes a change in control, as defined in Mr. Magnusson’s employment agreement.
Pension Plan Benefits, Termination and Change of Control Benefits
New SilverCrest does not anticipate having in place any pension or retirement plan. New SilverCrest has not
provided compensation, monetary or otherwise to any person who now acts as a NEO of New SilverCrest, in
connection with or related to the retirement, termination or resignation of such person and New SilverCrest has
provided no compensation to such persons as a result of a change of control of New SilverCrest, its subsidiaries or
affiliates. Other than as may be provided pursuant to employment agreement with Mr. Fier, as described herein,
New SilverCrest is not now and will not be at the Effective Time party to any compensation plan or arrangement
with NEOs resulting from the resignation, retirement or the termination of employment of any person.
Compensation Risk Considerations
The Compensation Committee will be responsible for considering, establishing and reviewing executive
compensation programs, and whether the programs encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking. New
SilverCrest anticipates the programs will be balanced and will not motivate unnecessary or excessive risk taking.
New SilverCrest does not currently have a policy that restricts directors or NEOs from purchasing financial
instruments, including, for greater certainty, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, or units of
exchange funds that are designed to hedge or offset a decrease in market value of equity. However, to the
knowledge of New SilverCrest, as of the date of hereof, no director or NEO of New SilverCrest has participated in
the purchase of such financial instruments.
H-25
Base salaries will be fixed in amount and will not encourage risk taking. While annual incentive awards will focus on
the achievement of short-term or annual goals and short-term goals may encourage the taking of short-term risks
at the expense of long term results, New SilverCrest’s annual incentive award program will represent a small
percentage of employees’ compensation opportunities. Annual incentive awards will be based on various personal
and company-wide achievements. Such performance goals are subjective and include achieving individual and/or
corporate targets and objectives, as well as general performance in day-to-day corporate activities which would
trigger the award of a bonus payment to the NEO. The determination as to whether a target has been met will
ultimately be made by the New SilverCrest Board (after receiving recommendations of the Compensation
Committee) and the New SilverCrest Board will reserve the right to make positive or negative adjustments to any
bonus payment if they consider them to be appropriate. Funding of the annual incentive awards will be capped at
the company level and the distribution of funds to the executive officers will be at the discretion of the
Compensation Committee.
Stock option awards are important to further align employees’ interests with those of the New SilverCrest
Shareholders. The ultimate value of the awards is tied to the price of the New SilverCrest Shares and since awards
are expected to be staggered and subject to long-term vesting schedules, they will help ensure that NEOs have
significant value tied in long-term stock price performance.
Compensation of Directors
At the date of the Circular, New SilverCrest has seven directors and, following the Effective Time, New SilverCrest
expects to continue to have seven directors. See in this Appendix H, “Directors and Officers of New SilverCrest”.
No remuneration has been paid to the directors for their services as directors to the date hereof.
New SilverCrest does not plan to provide cash remuneration for its directors. In addition, each of the directors will
be entitled to participate in the New SilverCrest Option Plan as more fully described under the heading “Limitations
on Option Grants to Non-Employee Directors”.
Options and Other Rights to Purchase Securities of New SilverCrest
New SilverCrest will adopt the New SilverCrest Option Plan, subject to its ratification and confirmation by the
SilverCrest Shareholders at the SilverCrest Meeting. See in the Circular “Approval of New SilverCrest Option Plan”.
If approved, the New SilverCrest Option Plan will be implemented at the Effective Time. The New SilverCrest Option
Plan is a rolling stock option plan that sets the number of New SilverCrest Shares issuable thereunder at a
maximum of 10% of the New SilverCrest Shares issued and outstanding at the time of any grant.
As of the date of the Circular, no stock options have been granted nor have any other rights or securities to
purchase New SilverCrest Shares been issued by New SilverCrest. At the Effective Time, 1,593,652 New SilverCrest
Options will be issued at the Effective Time pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, as described below, in connection
with the exchange of the then issued and outstanding SilverCrest Options. The New SilverCrest Options will be
governed by the New SilverCrest Option Plan. The New SilverCrest Board does not intend to grant any additional
incentive stock options pursuant to the New SilverCrest Option Plan until the New SilverCrest Shares are listed on
the TSX-V or other stock exchange such that a fair market value exercise price for options can be determined. See
also in this Appendix H, “Executive Compensation — Option-Based Awards” and “Consolidated Capitalization”.

The following is a summary of the principal terms of the New SilverCrest Stock Option Plan (the “Option Plan”).
Material Terms of the New SilverCrest Option Plan
The following is a summary of the material terms of the Option Plan:
The number of New SilverCrest Shares to be reserved and authorized for issuance pursuant to options granted under the
·
Option Plan is 10% of the issued and outstanding New SilverCrest Shares from time to time.
The Option Plan is administered by a “Committee” which means the Board of Directors of New SilverCrest or such
·
committee of the Board of Directors that the Board of Directors has designated to administer the Option Plan.
The exercise price for options granted under the Option Plan will not be less than the “market price” of the New SilverCrest
·
Shares (which, under the Option Plan, is the last closing price of the New SilverCrest Shares on the TSX-V before the date
of the option grant) or such other minimum exercise price as may be required or permitted by the TSX-V.
Options may be exercisable for a term of up to ten years, subject to earlier termination in the event of death or the
·
optionee’s cessation of services to New SilverCrest.
The vesting for each option shall be determined by the Committee at the time that the option is granted, and shall be
·
specified in the option agreement or certificate in respect of the option.
Options granted to any optionee who is a director, officer, employee or consultant shall expire the earlier of: (a) that date
which is 90 days (30 days for optionees engaged in investor relations activities) after the optionee ceases to be in at least
·
one of such categories unless an earlier date is provided for in the optionee’s option agreement or certificate; and (b) the
expiry of the option period. New SilverCrest may extend the period specified in the aforementioned clause (a) in respect of
any option for a specified period up to the expiry of the option period, subject to any applicable regulatory approvals.
Options are non transferable and non assignable, except by will and by the laws of descent and distribution. During the
·
lifetime of an optionee, the option may be exercised only by the optionee.
H-27
In the event of the death of an optionee while in service to New SilverCrest or a related entity of New SilverCrest, each
outstanding option held by the optionee (to the extent then vested and not exercised) shall be exercisable until the earlier of
·
(a) the expiration of one year following such death unless an earlier date is provided for in the option agreement or
certificate with respect to the option, and (b) the expiry of the option period, but only by the persons to whom the optionee’s
rights under the option shall pass by the optionee’s will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
If the expiry date of any option would otherwise occur during or within 10 business days following the end of a period in
which the trading of the New SilverCrest Shares is restricted by the policies of New SilverCrest (a “Blackout Period”), then
·
the expiry date of such option shall be extended to the date which is the 10th business day following the expiration of the
Blackout Period.
The Committee may, in its discretion but subject to any necessary regulatory approvals, provide for the extension of the
exercisability of a stock option, accelerate the vesting or exercisability of any option, eliminate or make less restrictive any
·
restrictions contained in an option, waive any restriction or other provision of the Option Plan or an option or otherwise
amend or modify an option in any manner that is either (a) not adverse to the optionee or (b) consented to by such optionee.
If there is a takeover bid or tender offer made for all or any of the issued and outstanding New SilverCrest Shares (a “Bid”),
then the Committee may, by resolution, permit all outstanding options to become immediately exercisable in order to permit
the New SilverCrest Shares issuable under such options to be tendered to such Bid. If the Bid is not completed within the
·
time specified therein or all of the New SilverCrest Shares tendered by the optionee pursuant to the Bid are not taken up or
paid for by the offeror in respect thereof, the New SilverCrest Shares received pursuant to such exercise, including any
New SilverCrest Shares that are not taken up and paid for pursuant to the Bid, may be returned by the optionee to New
SilverCrest, and the Option shall be reinstated as if it had not been exercised.
In lieu of exercising an option, the Committee may permit an optionee to elect to receive, without payment by the optionee
of any additional consideration, New SilverCrest Shares equal to the value of the option (or the portion thereof being
exercised) by surrender of the option to New SilverCrest, together with written notice reflecting such “cashless” exercise. In
such event, the optionee shall receive that number of New SilverCrest Shares, disregarding fractions, which, when
multiplied by the market price on the date of the cashless exercise, have a total value equal to the product of that number of
·
New SilverCrest Shares subject to the option times the difference between the market price on the date of the cashless
exercise and the option exercise price. For the purpose of cashless exercises of options, the market price of one New
SilverCrest Share as of a particular cashless exercise date is the volume weighted average trading price of one New
SilverCrest Share on the TSX-V, or another stock exchange where the majority of the trading volume and value of the New
SilverCrest Shares occurs, for the five trading days immediately preceding such date.
The New SilverCrest Board may in its absolute discretion amend the Option Plan without shareholder approval at any time,
provided that no such amendment will adversely affect any outstanding options granted thereunder without the optionee’s
·
consent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the New SilverCrest Board may make the following types of
amendments to the Option Plan without shareholder approval:
(a) any amendment pertaining to the vesting provisions of each option;
(b)
any amendment to the terms of the Option Plan relating to the effect of termination, cessation of employment, disability or
death of an optionee on the right to exercise options;
(c)
any amendment as may be necessary or desirable to bring the Option Plan into compliance with securities, corporate or
tax laws and the rules and policies of any stock exchange upon which the New SilverCrest Shares are from time to time
listed;
(d)
any amendment of a “housekeeping” nature including, but not limited to, amendments of a clerical, grammatical or
typographical nature;
(e) any amendment with respect to the administration of the Option Plan;
H-28
(f)
any amendment to correct any defect, supply any information or reconcile any inconsistency in the Option Plan in such
manner and to such extent as shall be deemed necessary or advisable to carry out the purposes of the Option Plan;
(g)
any amendment to the termination provisions of the Option Plan or any option, other than an amendment extending the
expiry date of such option beyond its original expiry date;
(h) any amendment to the class of eligible persons that may participate under the Option Plan; and
(i)
any other amendments, whether fundamental or otherwise, not requiring shareholder approval under applicable law or the
rules, regulations and policies of any stock exchange on which New SilverCrest’s shares are listed and of all securities
commissions or similar securities regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over New SilverCrest.
Any amendment to the Option Plan is also subject to any necessary approvals of any stock exchange or regulatory
body having jurisdiction over the securities of New SilverCrest and, where required for such approvals, the
approval of the shareholders of New SilverCrest.
Limitations on Option Grants to Non-Employee Directors
As a pre-production mineral company that is still in the development stage, New SilverCrest will have a small
number of employees and will rely extensively on the input and expertise of its non-employee directors. In its
efforts to attract and retain experienced directors, New SilverCrest may choose to compensate directors partly with
incentive stock options, thereby conserving its cash resources and, equally importantly, aligning the directors’
incentives with the interests of the shareholders of New SilverCrest by providing them with the opportunity to
participate in the upside that results from their contribution. While other larger and/or established operating
companies may place limitations on non-employee director compensation to a maximum amount per director per
year in order to satisfy external policies and proxy voting guidelines, New SilverCrest believes that some
methodologies used to quantify the value of options at the time of the grant (using an option pricing model that
values options based on a theoretical value at the time of grant) are not suited to calculating such a limit in the case
of New SilverCrest. Because such methodologies typically incorporate stock volatility into the calculation of option
value, the volatility of New SilverCrest’s stock (compared with more established operating companies) can
significantly inflate option value. The result is that an option grant in a given year could be valued at well in excess
of the proposed limits discussed above even if the option is out-of-the money on the date of grant. While New
SilverCrest does not object to the principle of limiting non-employee director compensation, New SilverCrest
believes that it is not currently at the right stage of its development to impose such limitations based on external,
generalized criteria. Accordingly, New SilverCrest intends to continue to evaluate the concept of granting options
to non-employee directors on a case-by-case basis, making grants based on the contribution of the directors and
having regard to the levels of compensation offered by companies in analogous stages of development.
Indebtedness of Directors and Executive Officers
None of the current or proposed directors or officers of New SilverCrest, nor any affiliate or associate of the current
or proposed directors or officers of New SilverCrest, is or was indebted to New SilverCrest (or to another entity
which is the subject of a guarantee support agreement, letter of credit, or other similar arrangement or undertaking
provided by New SilverCrest entered into in connection with a purchase of securities or otherwise per item 10.1 of
Form 51-102F5 — Information Circular,) at any time since its incorporation.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee will be responsible for monitoring New SilverCrest’s accounting and financial reporting
practices and procedures, the adequacy of internal accounting controls and procedures, the quality and integrity
of financial statements and for directing the auditors’ examination of specific areas. The initial members of the Audit
Committee will be Ross O. Glanville, George W. Sanders and Graham C. Thody, all of whom are “independent”
directors as defined in National Instrument 52-110 — Audit Committees (“NI 52-110”). Each member of the Audit
Committee is considered to be “financially literate” within the meaning of NI 52-110 which includes the ability to
read and understand a set of financial statements that present a breadth and level of complexity of accounting
issues that are generally comparable to the breadth and complexity of New SilverCrest’s financial statements. The
New SilverCrest Board has adopted the Audit Committee charter (the “Audit Committee Charter”) which is attached
as Schedule VI to this Appendix H.
H-29
Relevant Education and Experience
Ross O. Glanville — Mr. Glanville has over forty years of resource-related experience in numerous countries, and
has been involved in the exploration, financing, development, and operation of a number of mines. Mr. Glanville
obtained a Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering (Mining) in 1970, became a member of the Professional
Engineers Association of British Columbia in 1972, obtained a Masters Degree in Business Administration in 1974,
and became a member of the Certified General Accountants Association of B.C. in 1980. He has specialized in
valuations, fairness opinions, and litigation support, often as expert witness, related to the mining and exploration
industry. He has prepared hundreds of valuations and fairness opinions for mining and exploration companies in
North America, Africa, Australia, South America, Asia, and Europe. Mr. Glanville has formed public companies,
listed on the TSX, the Australian Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, and the TSX-V, and has served on the Boards of
Directors of five companies with producing mines, and still serves as a director of three of these companies.
George W. Sanders — Mr. Sanders is a mining entrepreneur with over 35 years in mining and exploration finance
experience. Mr. Sanders is also a Director of Bitterroot Resources Ltd., and a Director and President of Goldcliff
Resource Corporation. He spent over 15 years as a registered representative and precious metals specialist with
the investment firm Canaccord Capital Corporation (now Canaccord Genuity Corp.) and its predecessor
companies. Mr. Sanders has held Corporate Development positions with Richmont Mines Ltd., Consolidated Cinola
Mines and Shore Gold Inc. He provides the Company with a solid base in corporate finance and investor relations.
Graham C. Thody — Mr. Thody is a member of the British Columbia Institute of Chartered Accountants as well as
the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. He served as a member of the BCICA By-Laws Committee for
several years. Mr. Thody has also served as a Director and Executive Member of the Lions Gate Hospital
Foundation, as well as the Chair of its Finance Committee. He holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree (Marketing)
from the University of British Columbia. He was a Partner of Nemeth Thody Anderson, Chartered Accountants of
Vancouver, British Columbia from 1979 until his retirement in 2007. His practice focus included audits of reporting
companies, corporate finance (including initial public offerings), corporate mergers and acquisitions as well as
domestic and international tax matters. He was President and CEO of UEX Corporation from November 2009 until
his retirement in January 2014. He is currently a director of several reporting companies which are involved in
mineral exploration and development throughout North, Central and South America.
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
The Audit Committee shall pre-approve all audit and non-audit services not prohibited by law to be provided by the
independent auditors of New SilverCrest.
Corporate Governance
National Policy 58-201 — Corporate Governance Guidelines of the Canadian Securities Administrators sets out a
series of guidelines for effective corporate governance (the “Guidelines”). The Guidelines address matters such as
the constitution and independence of corporate boards, the functions to be performed by boards and their
committees and the effectiveness and education of board members. National Instrument 58-101 — Disclosure of
Corporate Governance Practices (“NI 58-101”) requires the disclosure by each listed corporation of its approach to
corporate governance with reference to the Guidelines as it is recognized that the unique characteristics of
individual corporations will result in varying degrees of compliance.
Set out below is a description of New SilverCrest’s intended approach to corporate governance in relation to the
Guidelines.
H-30
The Board of Directors
NI 58-101 defines an “independent director” as a director who has no direct or indirect material relationship with
New SilverCrest. A “material relationship” is in turn defined as a relationship which could, in the view of the New
SilverCrest Board, be reasonably expected to interfere with such member’s independent judgment. At the Effective
Time, the New SilverCrest Board is expected to be comprised of seven members, five of whom the New SilverCrest
Board has determined are “independent directors” within the meaning of NI 58-101. Dunham L. Craig, J. Scott
Drever, Ross O. Glanville, George W. Sanders and Graham C. Thody are considered independent directors within
the meaning of NI 58-101 since they are each independent of management and free from any material relationship
with New SilverCrest. The basis for this determination is that, since the date of incorporation of New SilverCrest,
none of the independent directors have worked for New SilverCrest, received remuneration from New SilverCrest or
had material contracts with or material interests in New SilverCrest which could interfere with their ability to act with
a view to the best interests of New SilverCrest. N. Eric Fier and Barney Magnusson are not independent directors
since each of them is also an officer of New SilverCrest.
The New SilverCrest Board believes that it will function independently of management. To enhance its ability to act
independent of management, the New SilverCrest Board may in the future meet in the absence of members of
management or may excuse such persons from all or a portion of any meeting where an actual or potential conflict
of interest arises or where the New SilverCrest Board otherwise determines is appropriate.
Directorships
Except for N. Eric Fier and Barney Magnusson, all of the directors of New SilverCrest are currently directors of
SilverCrest; however, upon completion of the Arrangement none of these directors will remain directors of
SilverCrest. In addition, certain of the directors of New SilverCrest are also current directors of other reporting
issuers (or equivalent) in a jurisdiction or a foreign jurisdiction as follows:

Orientation and Continuing Education
While New SilverCrest currently has no formal orientation and education program for new board members, it is
expected that sufficient information (such as recent financial statements, technical reports and various other
operating, property and budget reports) will be provided to all new board members to ensure that new directors are
familiarized with New SilverCrest’s business and the procedures of the New SilverCrest Board. In addition, new
directors will be encouraged to visit and meet with management on a regular basis. New SilverCrest will also
encourage continuing education of its directors and officers where appropriate in order to ensure that they have
the necessary skills and knowledge to meet their respective obligations to New SilverCrest. The New SilverCrest
Board’s continuing education will also consist of correspondence with New SilverCrest’s legal counsel to remain
up to date with developments in relevant corporate and securities’ law matters.
Ethical Business Conduct
The fiduciary duties placed on individual directors by New SilverCrest’s governing corporate legislation and the
common law and the restrictions placed by applicable corporate legislation on an individual director’s participation
in decisions of the New SilverCrest Board in which the director has an interest will ensure that the New SilverCrest
Board operates independently of management and in the best interests of New SilverCrest.
Under corporate legislation, a director is required to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests
of New SilverCrest and to exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in
comparable circumstances. In addition, as some of the directors and proposed directors of New SilverCrest also
serve as directors and officers of other companies engaged in similar business activities, directors must comply
with the conflict of interest provisions of the BCBCA, as well as the relevant securities regulatory instruments, in
order to ensure that directors exercise independent judgment in considering transactions and agreements in
respect of which a director or officer has a material interest.
Any interested director will be required to declare the nature and extent of his interest and will not be entitled to
vote at meetings of directors which evoke such a conflict.
Board Committees
The New SilverCrest Board will have three standing committees: the Audit Committee, a corporate governance and
nominating committee (the “Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee”) and the Compensation
Committee. The proposed members of these committees are Ross O. Glanville, George W. Sanders and Graham C.
Thody. The New SilverCrest Board has adopted the Audit Committee Charter which is attached as Schedule VI to
this Appendix H. The New SilverCrest Board intends to adopt a charter for the Compensation Committee prior to
the Effective Time.
Nomination of Directors
Responsibility for identifying new candidates to join the New SilverCrest Board will belong to the New SilverCrest
Board as a whole. The New SilverCrest Board will encourage all directors to participate in the process of identifying
and recruiting new candidates. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will have the responsibility
of making recommendations to the New SilverCrest Board with respect to the new nominees and for assessing
directors on an on-going basis. While there are no specific criteria for New SilverCrest Board membership, New
SilverCrest will seek to attract and retain directors with business knowledge and a particular expertise in mineral
exploration and development or other areas of specialized knowledge (such as finance) which will assist in guiding
the officers of New SilverCrest. The initial members of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will be
Ross O. Glanville, George W. Sanders and Graham C. Thody, all of whom are independent directors within the
meaning of NI 58-101.
Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee will be responsible for assisting New SilverCrest in determining compensation of
senior management of New SilverCrest as well as reviewing the adequacy and form of the directors’ compensation.
The Compensation Committee is expected to annually review the goals and objectives of New SilverCrest’s Chief
Executive Officer for the upcoming year and to perform an appraisal of New SilverCrest’s Chief Executive Officer’s
performance for the past year. The Compensation Committee will also administer and make recommendations
regarding the operation of New SilverCrest’s incentive plans. The initial members of the Compensation Committee
will be Ross O. Glanville, George W. Sanders and Graham C. Thody, all of whom are independent directors within
the meaning of NI 58-101.
H-32
Compensation
The Compensation Committee of the New SilverCrest Board will review, on an annual basis, the adequacy and form
of compensation of directors and officers and will ensure that the levels of compensation of the New SilverCrest
Board reflect the responsibilities, time commitment and risks involved in being an effective director.
Because of New SilverCrest’s status as a pre-production mineral company that is still in the development stage,
New SilverCrest will have a relatively small number of employees and will rely extensively on the input and
expertise of its non-employee directors. In its efforts to attract and retain experienced directors, New SilverCrest
may compensate directors partly with New SilverCrest Options, thereby conserving its cash resources and, equally
importantly, aligning the directors’ incentives with the interests of the New SilverCrest shareholders by providing
them with the opportunity to participate in any increase in shareholder value that results from their contribution.
See in this Appendix H, “Executive Compensation — Compensation of Directors” and “Options and Other Rights
to Purchase Securities of New SilverCrest — Limitations on Option Grants to Non-Employee Directors”.
Audit Committee
On or before the Effective Date, New SilverCrest will establish an Audit Committee comprised of a majority of
directors considered to be independent and financially literate in accordance with applicable securities laws. The
Audit Committee Charter is attached as Schedule VI to this Appendix H. See in this Appendix H, “Audit
Committee”.
Other Board Committees
Other than the Audit Committee, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Compensation
Committee, it is not anticipated that New SilverCrest will have any additional committees immediately following the
Effective Time. The New SilverCrest Board may, however, establish additional committees (such as an
Occupational Health and Safety Committee and Disclosure Committee) after the Effective Time, depending on the
needs of New SilverCrest.
Board Mandate
The New SilverCrest Board has adopted a written mandate (the “Board Mandate”), a copy of which is attached as
Schedule VII to this Appendix H.
Assessments
Given its early stage of development, the New SilverCrest Board will not initially take any formal steps to assess the
performance of the New SilverCrest Board or its committees. The New SilverCrest Board will consider New
SilverCrest Board and committee performance, from time to time, as required.
Risk Factors
There are a number of risks that may have a material and adverse impact on the future operating and financial
performance of New SilverCrest and could cause New SilverCrest’s operating and financial performance to differ
materially from the estimates described in forward-looking statements related to New SilverCrest. These include
widespread risks associated with any form of business and specific risks associated with New SilverCrest’s
business and its involvement in the mineral exploration and development industry. An investment in the New
SilverCrest Shares, as well as New SilverCrest’s prospects, are highly speculative due to the high-risk nature of its
business and the present stage of its operations. New SilverCrest Shareholders may lose their entire investment.
The risks described below are not the only ones facing New SilverCrest. Additional risks not currently known to
New SilverCrest, or that New SilverCrest currently deems immaterial, may also impair New SilverCrest’s business or
operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, New SilverCrest’s business, financial condition, operating
results and prospects could be adversely affected.
H-33
SilverCrest Shareholders should consult with their professional advisors to assess the Arrangement and their
resulting investment in New SilverCrest. In evaluating New SilverCrest and its business and whether to vote in
favour of the Arrangement, SilverCrest Shareholders should carefully consider, in addition to the other information
contained in the Circular and this Appendix H, the risk factors which follow, as well as the risks associated with the
Arrangement (see in the Circular “Risks Factors Relating to the Arrangement”). These risk factors may not be a
definitive list of all risk factors associated with the Arrangement, an investment in New SilverCrest or in connection
with New SilverCrest’s business or operations.
No Assurance of Listing of New SilverCrest Shares
The New SilverCrest Shares are not currently listed on any stock exchange. Although an application will be made
for listing of the New SilverCrest Shares on the TSX-V, there is no assurance when, or if, the New SilverCrest
Shares will be listed on the TSX-V or on any other stock exchange. Listing will be subject to New SilverCrest
meeting the listing requirements and other conditions of the TSX-V. Listing of the New SilverCrest Shares on the
TSX-V or on any other exchange is not a condition to the completion of the Arrangement. Until the New SilverCrest
Shares are listed on a stock exchange, shareholders of New SilverCrest may not be able to sell their New
SilverCrest Shares. Even if a listing is obtained, ownership of New SilverCrest Shares will entail a high degree of
risk.
In addition, First Majestic is entitled to more than 9.9% of the outstanding New SilverCrest Shares as at the Effective
Date if the New SilverCrest Shares are not listed and posted for trading on the TSX-V by certain dates, as follows: (i)
if not within 90 days of the Effective Date, then New SilverCrest must ensure that a total of 10.89% of the New
SilverCrest Shares are held by First Majestic or one of its affiliates upon the listing of New SilverCrest on the TSX-V;
(ii) if not within 120 days of the Effective Date, then New SilverCrest shall ensure that a total of 12.52% of the New
SilverCrest Shares are held by First Majestic or one of its affiliates upon the listing of New SilverCrest on the TSX-V;
and (iii) if not within 365 days of the Effective Date, then New SilverCrest shall ensure that a total of 14.4% of the
New SilverCrest Shares are held by First Majestic or one of its affiliates upon the listing of New SilverCrest on the
TSX-V. In any such case, the shares of other New SilverCrest Shareholders will be further diluted.
Tax risks if the New SilverCrest Shares are not listed on a designated stock exchange
If the New SilverCrest Shares are not listed on a designated stock exchange in Canada before the due date for New
SilverCrest’s first income tax return or if New SilverCrest does not otherwise satisfy the conditions in the Tax Act to
be a “public corporation”, the New SilverCrest Shares will not be considered to be a qualified investment for a
Registered Plan from their date of issue. Where a Registered Plan acquires a New SilverCrest Share in
circumstances where the New SilverCrest Share is not a qualified investment under the Tax Act for the Registered
Plan, adverse tax consequences may arise for the Registered Plan and the annuitant under the Registered Plan,
including that the Registered Plan may become subject to penalty taxes, the annuitant of such Registered Plan may
be deemed to have received income therefrom or be subject to a penalty tax or, in the case of a registered
education savings plan, such plan may have its tax exempt status revoked.
Market Price of New SilverCrest Shares
The New SilverCrest Shares do not currently trade on any exchange or market. Securities of micro-cap and small-
cap companies have experienced substantial volatility in the past, often based on factors unrelated to the financial
performance or prospects of the companies involved. These factors include macroeconomic developments in
North America and globally and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries. The price of the
New SilverCrest Shares is also likely to be significantly affected by short-term changes in mineral prices or in its
financial condition or results of operations as reflected in its quarterly earnings reports. Other factors unrelated to
New SilverCrest’s performance that may have an effect on the price of the New SilverCrest Shares include the
following: (i) the extent of analytical coverage available to investors concerning New SilverCrest’s business may be
limited if investment banks with research capabilities do not follow New SilverCrest’s securities; (ii) lessening in
trading volume and general market interest in New SilverCrest’s securities may affect an investor’s ability to trade
significant numbers of New SilverCrest Shares; (iii) the size of New SilverCrest’s public float may limit the ability of
some institutions to invest in New SilverCrest’s securities; and (iv) a substantial decline in the price of the New
SilverCrest Shares that persists for a significant period of time could cause New SilverCrest’s securities, if listed on
an exchange, to be delisted from such exchange, further reducing market liquidity.
H-34
As a result of any of these factors, the market price of the New SilverCrest Shares at any given point in time may not
accurately reflect New SilverCrest’s long-term value. Securities class action litigation often has been brought
against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. New SilverCrest may in the
future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and damages and divert
management’s attention and resources.
The fact that no market currently exists for the New SilverCrest Shares may affect the pricing of the New SilverCrest
Shares in the secondary market, the transparency and availability of trading prices, the liquidity of the New
SilverCrest Shares and the extent of the regulations to which New SilverCrest is subject.
No History of Operations or Earnings
New SilverCrest has no history of operations or earnings. New SilverCrest is an exploration stage company and no
operating revenues are anticipated until one of New SilverCrest’s projects comes into production, which may or
may not occur. As such, any future revenues and profits are uncertain. New SilverCrest is subject to many risks
common to such enterprises, including under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel,
financial and other resources and lack of revenues. There is no assurance that New SilverCrest will be successful
in achieving a return on the SilverCrest Shareholders’ investment in the New SilverCrest Shares and the likelihood
of success must be considered in light of its early stage of operations. New SilverCrest will require additional
financing to further explore, develop, acquire, and achieve commercial production on its property interests and, if
financing is unavailable for any reason, New SilverCrest may become unable to acquire and retain its property
interests and carry out its business plan.
There can be no assurance that the Cruz de Mayo Property or any other property will be successfully placed into
production, produce minerals in commercial quantities or otherwise generate operating earnings. Advancing
projects from the exploration stage into development and commercial production requires significant capital and
time and will be subject to further technical studies, permitting requirements and construction of mines, processing
plants, roads and related works and infrastructure. New SilverCrest will continue to incur losses until mining-related
operations successfully reach commercial production levels and generate sufficient revenue to fund continuing
operations. There is no certainty that New SilverCrest will generate revenue from any source, operate profitably or
provide a return on investment in the future.
No Mineral Production
New SilverCrest does not have an interest in a mineral-producing property. There is no assurance that commercial
quantities of minerals will be discovered at any New SilverCrest property, nor is there any assurance that any future
exploration programs of New SilverCrest on the Cruz de Mayo Property or any other properties will yield any
positive results. Even where commercial properties of minerals are discovered, there can be no assurance that any
property of New SilverCrest will ever be brought to a stage where mineral reserves can be profitably produced
thereon. Factors which may limit the ability of New SilverCrest to produce mineral resources from its properties
include, but are not limited to, the price of mineral resources are explored, availability of additional capital and
financing and the nature of any mineral deposits.
Exploration and Development Risks
New SilverCrest is a junior resource company focused primarily on the acquisition, exploration and development of
mineral properties located in Mexico. New SilverCrest’s properties, including the Cruz de Mayo Property, have no
established Mineral Reserves (as defined by NI 43-101). There is no assurance that any of New SilverCrest’s
projects can be mined profitably. Accordingly, it is not assured that New SilverCrest will realize any profits in the
short to medium term, if at all. Any profitability in the future from the business of New SilverCrest will be dependent
upon developing and commercially mining an economic deposit of minerals, which in itself is subject to numerous
risk factors.
The exploration and development of mineral deposits involves a high degree of financial risk over a significant
period of time that even a combination of management’s careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not
eliminate. While discovery of ore-bearing structures may result in substantial rewards, few properties that are
explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Major expenses may be required to establish reserves and
resources by drilling and to construct mining and processing facilities at a particular site. It is impossible to ensure
that the current or future exploration and development programs of New SilverCrest will result in profitable
commercial mining operations. The profitability of New SilverCrest’s operations will be, in part, directly related to
the cost and success of its exploration and development programs, which may be affected by a number of factors.
Substantial expenditures are required to establish mineral reserves that are sufficient to support commercial
mining operations and to construct, complete and install mining and processing facilities on those properties that
are actually developed.
H-35
Exploration, Development and Operating Risks
Mining operations generally involve a high degree of risk. New SilverCrest’s operations are subject to all the
hazards and risks normally encountered in the exploration, development and production of silver and other
minerals, including unusual and unexpected geologic formations, seismic activity, rock bursts, cave-ins, flooding
and other conditions involved in the drilling and removal of material, any of which could result in damage to, or
destruction of, mines and other producing facilities, damage to life or property, environmental damage and
possible legal liability. The financing, exploration, development and mining of any of New SilverCrest’s properties is
furthermore subject to a number of macroeconomic, legal and social factors, including commodity prices, laws and
regulations, political conditions, currency fluctuations, the ability to hire and retain qualified people, the inability to
obtain suitable adequate machinery, equipment or labour and obtaining necessary services in jurisdictions in
which New SilverCrest operates. Unfavourable changes to these and other factors have the potential to negatively
affect New SilverCrest’s operations and business.
The exploration for and development of mineral deposits involves significant risks which even a combination of
careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate or even mitigate. While the discovery of a mineral-
bearing structure may result in an increase in value for shareholders, few properties which are explored are
ultimately developed into producing mines.
Major expenses may be required to locate and establish mineral reserves, to develop metallurgical processes and
to construct mining and processing facilities at a particular site. It is impossible to ensure that the exploration or
development programs planned by New SilverCrest will result in a profitable commercial mining operation. Whether
a silver, gold or other precious or base metal or mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number
of factors, some of which are: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as quantity and quality of mineralization
and proximity to infrastructure; mineral prices which are highly cyclical; and government regulations, including
regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and
environmental protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of
these factors may result in New SilverCrest not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.
There is no certainty that the expenditures made by New SilverCrest towards the exploration and evaluation of
silver, gold, copper or other minerals will result in discoveries or production of commercial quantities of silver, gold
or other minerals. In addition, once in production, mineral reserves are finite and there can be no assurance that
New SilverCrest will be able to locate additional reserves as its existing reserves are depleted.
Reliability of Mineral Resource Estimates
Mineral Resources are estimates based on sampling of the mineralized material in a deposit. Such estimates may
not be found to be accurate. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated
economic viability. The estimation of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting,
legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues. Inferred Resources are ones for which there
has been insufficient exploration to define an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further
exploration will result in upgrading them to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource category.
Unless otherwise indicated, mineralization figures presented in this Appendix H and the Technical Report are
based upon estimates made by geologists and New SilverCrest’s personnel. Although the Mineral Resource
figures set out in this Appendix H and in the Technical Report have been carefully prepared and reviewed or
verified by qualified persons, these amounts are estimates only and no assurance can be given that an identified
mineral resource will ever become a Mineral Reserve or in any way qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable)
ore body which can be legally and economically exploited. These estimates are imprecise and depend upon
geological interpretation and statistical inferences drawn from drilling and sampling analysis, all of which may
prove to be unreliable. Furthermore, there are risks related to the reliability of analytical results and unforeseen
possible variations in grade or other considerations.
Global Financial Conditions
Recent global financial conditions have been characterized by increased volatility and access to public financing,
particularly for junior mineral exploration companies, has been negatively impacted. These conditions may affect
New SilverCrest’s ability to obtain equity or debt financing in the future on terms favourable to New SilverCrest or at
all. If such conditions continue, New SilverCrest’s operations could be negatively impacted.
H-36
Commodity Markets
The price of New SilverCrest’s securities, its financial results, and its access to the capital required to finance its
exploration activities may in the future be adversely affected by declines in the price of precious and base metals.
Precious metal prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond New SilverCrest’s control
such as the sale or purchase of precious metals by various dealers, central banks and financial institutions,
interest rates, exchange rates, inflation or deflation, currency exchange fluctuation, global and regional supply and
demand, production and consumption patterns, speculative activities, increased production due to improved
mining and production methods, government regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use,
importing and exporting of minerals, environmental protection, and international political and economic trends,
conditions and events. If these or other factors continue to adversely affect the price of precious and base metals,
the market price of New SilverCrest’s securities may decline.
Market Fluctuation and Commercial Quantities
The market for minerals is influenced by many factors beyond New SilverCrest’s control, including without
limitation the supply and demand for minerals. In addition, the metals industry in general is intensely competitive
and there is no assurance that, even if apparently commercial quantities and qualities of metals (such as silver) are
discovered, a market will exist for their profitable sale. Commercial viability of precious and base metals and other
mineral deposits may be affected by other factors that are beyond New SilverCrest’s control, including particular
attributes of the deposit such as its size, quantity and quality, the cost of mining and processing, proximity to
infrastructure, the availability of transportation and sources of energy, financing, government legislation and
regulations including those relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, import and export restrictions,
exchange controls, restrictions on production, and environmental protection. It is impossible to assess with
certainty the impact of various factors that may affect commercial viability such that any adverse combination of
such factors may result in New SilverCrest not receiving an adequate return on invested capital or having its
mineral projects be rendered uneconomic.
Insurance and Uninsured Risks
New SilverCrest’s business is subject to a number of risks and hazards generally, including adverse environmental
conditions, industrial accidents, labour disputes, unusual or unexpected geological conditions, ground or slope
failures, cave-ins, changes in the regulatory environment, natural phenomena such as inclement weather
conditions, floods and earthquakes. Such occurrences could result in damage to mineral properties, personal
injury or death, environmental damage to New SilverCrest’s properties or the properties of others, delays in the
ability to undertake exploration, monetary losses and possible legal liability.
New SilverCrest may also be unable to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums.
Insurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be adequate to cover any resulting liability.
Moreover, insurance against risks such as environmental pollution or other hazards as a result of exploration and
production is not generally available to New SilverCrest or to other companies in the mining industry on acceptable
terms. New SilverCrest might also become subject to liability for pollution or other hazards which it may not be
insured against or which New SilverCrest may elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other
reasons. Losses from these events may cause New SilverCrest to incur significant costs that could have a material
adverse effect upon its financial performance and results of operations.
Environmental Risks and Hazards
The mining and mineral processing industries are subject to extensive governmental regulations for the protection
of the environment, including regulations relating to air and water quality, mine reclamation, solid and hazardous
waste handling and disposal and the promotion of occupational health and safety, which may adversely affect New
SilverCrest or require it to expend significant funds. There is also a risk that environmental and other laws and
regulations may become more onerous, making it more costly for New SilverCrest to remain in compliance with
such laws and regulations.
There is no assurance that future changes in environmental regulation, if any, will not adversely affect New
SilverCrest’s operations. Environmental hazards may exist on the properties on which New SilverCrest holds
interests which are unknown to New SilverCrest at present and which have been caused by previous or existing
owners or operators of the properties.
H-37
New SilverCrest cannot give any assurances that breaches of environmental laws (whether inadvertent or not) or
environmental pollution will not materially and adversely affect its financial condition. There is no assurance that
any future changes to environmental regulation, if any, will not adversely affect New SilverCrest.
Foreign Mineral Properties
New SilverCrest’s properties are located in Mexico and therefore exposed to various levels of political, economic
and other risks and uncertainties which could result in work stoppages, blockades of New SilverCrest’s business
activities and appropriation of assets. Some of New SilverCrest’s properties are located in areas where Mexican
drug cartels may operate. These risks and uncertainties vary from region to region and include, but are not limited
to, terrorism; hostage taking; local drug gang activities; military repression; expropriation; extreme fluctuations in
currency exchange rates; high rates of inflation; labour unrest; the risks of war or civil unrest; renegotiation or
nullification of existing concessions, licenses, permits and contracts; illegal mining; changes in taxation policies;
restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation; and changing political conditions, currency controls and
governmental regulations that favour or require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign
contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction.
Local opposition to mine development projects could arise in Mexico, and such opposition could be violent. There
can be no assurance that such local opposition will not arise with respect to New SilverCrest’s foreign operations. If
New SilverCrest were to experience resistance or unrest in connection with its operations, it could have a material
adverse effect on its operations and profitability.
To the extent New SilverCrest acquires mineral properties in jurisdictions other than Mexico, it may be subject to
similar and additional risks with respect to its operations in those jurisdictions.
Surface Rights
A mineral concession in Mexico does not confer any ownership of surface rights. The majority of New SilverCrest’s
mineral properties are located in remote and relatively uninhabited areas. There are currently no areas of interest to
New SilverCrest within its mineral concessions that are overlain by significant habitation or industrial users,
however there are potential overlapping surface usage issues in some areas. Some surface rights are owned by
local communities or “Ejidos” and some surface rights are owned by private ranching or residential interests. New
SilverCrest will be required to negotiate the acquisition of surface rights in those areas where it may wish to
develop mining operations. SilverCrest’s mineral interests are located on community or private land, and it is
necessary to deal with the owners for access and any potential development or exploitation rights. There can be no
assurance that New SilverCrest will be able to negotiate and acquire surface access rights on terms acceptable to
New SilverCrest or at all.
Land Title
The acquisition of the right to explore and/or exploit mineral properties is a detailed and time-consuming process.
The principal property interests that New SilverCrest owns or controls, including those interests comprising of the
Cruz de Mayo Property, come under the laws of Mexico, which has its own registration and management systems.
Although New SilverCrest has either obtained title opinions or reviewed title for the Cruz de Mayo property, there is
no guarantee that title to such mineral property interest will not be challenged or impugned. New SilverCrest’s
mineral property interests may be subject to prior unregistered agreements or transfers, and title may be affected
by undetected defects. New SilverCrest may also experience challenges in effecting the transfer of title to certain of
its mineral properties. There may be valid challenges to the title of the mineral property interests which, if
successful, could impair development and/or operations.
H-38
Competitive Industry Environment
The mining industry is highly competitive in all of its phases, both domestically and internationally. New
SilverCrest’s ability to acquire properties and develop mineral reserves in the future will depend not only on its
ability to develop its present properties, but also on its ability to select and acquire suitable producing properties or
prospects for mineral exploration, of which there is a limited supply. New SilverCrest may be at a competitive
disadvantage in acquiring additional mining properties because it must compete with other individuals and
companies, many of which have greater financial resources, operational experience and technical capabilities than
New SilverCrest. Competition could adversely affect New SilverCrest’s ability to attract necessary funding or
acquire suitable producing properties or prospects for mineral exploration in the future. Competition for services
and equipment could result in delays if such services or equipment cannot be obtained in a timely manner due to
inadequate availability, and could also cause scheduling difficulties and cost increases due to the need to
coordinate the availability of services or equipment, any of which could materially increase project development,
exploration or construction costs and result in project delays. See above in this Appendix H, “Competitive
Conditions”.
Additional Capital and Financing Risks
New SilverCrest plans to focus on exploring for minerals and will use its working capital to carry out such
exploration. Although at the Effective Time, New SilverCrest will receive C$5,250,000 in cash from SilverCrest, New
SilverCrest has no source of operating cash flow. The exploration and development of the Cruz de Mayo Property
and/or New SilverCrest’s other properties may be dependent upon New SilverCrest’s ability to obtain financing
through equity or debt, and there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future
or that the terms of such financing will be favourable. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result in the
delay or indefinite postponement of further exploration and development of New SilverCrest’s projects.
Government Regulation
New SilverCrest’s exploration operations are subject to government legislation, policies and controls relating to
prospecting, development, production, environmental protection, mining taxes and labour standards. In order for
New SilverCrest to carry out its activities, its various licences and permits must be obtained and kept current. There
is no guarantee that New SilverCrest’s licences and permits will be granted, or that once granted will be extended.
In addition, the terms and conditions of such licences or permits could be changed and there can be no
assurances that any application to renew any existing licences will be approved. There can be no assurance that all
permits that New SilverCrest requires will be obtainable on reasonable terms, or at all. Delays or a failure to obtain
such permits, or a failure to comply with the terms of any such permits that New SilverCrest has obtained, could
have a material adverse impact on New SilverCrest. New SilverCrest may be required to contribute to the cost of
providing the required infrastructure to facilitate the development of its properties. New SilverCrest will also have to
obtain and comply with permits and licences that may contain specific conditions concerning operating
procedures, water use, waste disposal, spills, environmental studies, abandonment and restoration plans and
financial assurances. There can be no assurance that New SilverCrest will be able to comply with any such
conditions. Future taxation of mining operators cannot be predicted with certainty so planning must be undertaken
using present conditions and best estimates of any potential future changes.
Dividend Policy
It is not anticipated that dividends will be paid on the New SilverCrest Shares in the short to medium term. Investors
in New SilverCrest’s securities cannot expect to receive a dividend on their investment in the foreseeable future, if
at all. Accordingly, it is unlikely that investors will receive any return on their investment in New SilverCrest’s
securities other than through possible share price appreciation.
Reliance on Key Personnel
New SilverCrest’s development will depend on the efforts of key management and other key personnel. Loss of any
of these people, particularly to competitors, could have a material adverse effect on New SilverCrest’s business.
Further, with respect to future development of New SilverCrest’s projects, it may become necessary to attract both
international and local personnel for such development. The marketplace for key skilled personnel is becoming
more competitive, which means the cost of hiring, training and retaining such personnel may increase. Factors
outside New SilverCrest’s control, including competition for human capital and the high level of technical expertise
and experience required to execute this development, will affect New SilverCrest’s ability to employ the specific
personnel required. Due to the relatively small size of New SilverCrest, the failure to retain or attract a sufficient
number of key skilled personnel could have a material adverse effect on New SilverCrest’s business, results of
future operations and financial condition. New SilverCrest does not intend to take out ‘key person’ insurance in
respect of any directors, officers or other employees.
H-39
Internal Controls
Internal controls over financial reporting are procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are properly authorized, assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use, and
transactions are properly recorded and reported. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance with respect to the reliability of financial reporting and
financial statement preparation. New SilverCrest has no history of operations and has not made any assessment as
to the effectiveness of its internal controls. Though New SilverCrest intends to put into place a system of internal
controls appropriate for its size, and reflective of its level of operations, there are limited internal controls currently
in place.
Conflicts of Interest
Certain of the directors and/or officers of New SilverCrest also serve as directors and/or officers of other
companies involved in natural resource exploration and development and consequently there exists the possibility
for such directors and officers to be in a position of conflict. Any decision made by any of such directors and
officers involving New SilverCrest should be made in accordance with their duties and obligations to deal fairly and
in good faith with a view to the best interests of New SilverCrest and its shareholders. In addition, each of the
directors is required to declare and refrain from voting on any matter in which such directors may have a conflict of
interest in accordance with the procedures set forth in the BCBCA and other applicable laws.
Indemnified Liability Risk
Pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement, New SilverCrest has covenanted and agreed that, following the Effective
Time, it will indemnify First Majestic, SilverCrest and their subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, partners,
employees, advisors, shareholders and agents (each an “Indemnified Party”) from all losses suffered or incurred
by an Indemnified Party as a result of or arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with the SilverCrest
Transferred Liabilities (as such term is defined in the Arrangement Agreement), which includes:
(a)
all liabilities or obligations (contingent or otherwise) (other than any liability or obligation for Taxes) in respect (but only in
respect) of the SilverCrest Transferred Assets (including the operations or activities in connection therewith);
(b)
all liabilities or obligations for Taxes payable to any Governmental Entity arising from, or in connection with the
transaction contemplated under the SilverCrest Conveyance Agreement;
(c)
all liabilities or obligations for Taxes payable but not yet paid or reflected in the contingencies or commitments in the
annual audited consolidated financial statements of SilverCrest as at, and for the years ended, December 31, 2014 and
December 31, 2013 including the notes thereto, to any Governmental Entity and imposed on, or is in respect of, the
SilverCrest Transferred Assets and/or any liabilities or obligations referred to as a SilverCrest Transferred Liability net of
all applicable credits, deductions, and other amounts available (including any loss carryforwards) with respect to the
SilverCrest Transferred Assets; and
(d) TSX-V fees in respect of the listing of the New SilverCrest Shares on the TSX-V.
New SilverCrest will remain liable under this indemnity for two years following the Effective Date. Because of New
SilverCrest’s limited financial resources, any requirement to indemnify under these provisions could have a
material adverse effect on the ability of New SilverCrest to carry out its business plan.
Passive Foreign Investment Corporation (“PFIC”)
Based on current business plans and financial expectations, it is expected that New SilverCrest will be a PFIC for
the current tax year and may be a PFIC in subsequent years, which could have adverse U.S. federal income tax
consequences for U.S. Holders (as defined in the Circular under “Certain United States Federal Income Tax
Considerations”). If New SilverCrest is a PFIC for any year during a U.S. Holder’s holding period, then such U.S.
Holder generally will be subject to a special adverse tax regime with respect to so-called “excess distributions”
received on New SilverCrest Shares. Gain realized upon a disposition of New SilverCrest Shares (including upon
certain dispositions that would otherwise be tax-deferred) also will be treated as excess distributions. Further,
distributions from a PFIC will not qualify for preferential tax rates as “qualified dividends.”
H-40
A U.S. Holder of PFIC shares may make a “QEF Election” or a “Mark-to-Market Election” (each as defined in the
Circular under “Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations”) with respect to such shares to mitigate
the adverse tax rules that apply to PFICs. These elections may accelerate the recognition of taxable income and
may result in the recognition of ordinary income. A U.S. Holder who makes a QEF Election generally must report on
a current basis its pro rata share of net capital gain and ordinary earnings for any year in which New SilverCrest is a
PFIC, whether or not New SilverCrest distributes any amounts to its shareholders. A U.S. Holder may make a QEF
Election only if the U.S. Holder receives certain information (known as a “PFIC annual information statement”) from
New SilverCrest annually. There can be no assurance that New SilverCrest, if it were classified as a PFIC, will
supply the information and statements necessary for the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a valid QEF Election. A
U.S. Holder who makes the Mark-to-Market Election generally must include as ordinary income each year the
excess of the fair market value of New SilverCrest Shares over the U.S. Holder’s basis therein.
For a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Arrangement, including the
consequences under the PFIC rules, please see the discussion in the Circular under “Certain United States Federal
Income Tax Considerations”.
Interest of Management in Material Transactions
Since New SilverCrest’s incorporation, no director, executive officer, or New SilverCrest Shareholder who
beneficially owns, or controls or directs, directly or indirectly, more than 10% of the outstanding New SilverCrest
Shares, or any known associates or affiliates or such persons, has or has had any material interest, direct or
indirect, in any transaction or in any proposed transaction that has materially affected or is reasonably expected to
materially affect New SilverCrest other than SilverCrest in connection with New SilverCrest’s incorporation (see in
this Appendix H, “Corporate Structure and History”), the entering into of the Arrangement Agreement (see in the
Circular, “The Arrangement”), and the transfer of the New SilverCrest Assets to New SilverCrest in connection with
the Arrangement (see in this Appendix H, “Description of the Business”).
Certain directors and officers of New SilverCrest are also currently directors and officers of SilverCrest but will not
remain directors and officers of SilverCrest following the Effective Time.
Material Contracts
The only material contracts entered into by New SilverCrest, other than in the ordinary course of business, since
the date of incorporation of New SilverCrest or to be entered into in connection with the Arrangement are as
follows:
1.
the Arrangement Agreement dated as of July 26, 2015, among SilverCrest, New SilverCrest and First Majestic (see in the
Circular, “The Arrangement”);
2.
the SilverCrest Conveyance Agreement to be entered into prior to the Effective Date (see in this Appendix H, “Description
of the Business — Acquisition of the New SilverCrest Assets” and “Properties of New SilverCrest — The Cruz de Mayo
Property”); and
3.
the First Majestic Conveyance Agreement to be entered into prior to the Effective Date (see in this Appendix H,
“Description of the Business — Acquisition of the New SilverCrest Assets”).
A copy of the Arrangement Agreement may be inspected by SilverCrest Shareholders at the registered office of
SilverCrest at 19th Floor, 885 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6C 3H4 during normal business
hours prior to the Meeting, or at the Meeting. It can also be accessed under SilverCrest’s profile on SEDAR at

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Directors of
SilverCrest Metals Inc.
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of SilverCrest Metals Inc., which comprise the statement of
financial position as at June 30, 2015, and the statements of comprehensive earnings (loss), cash flows and
changes in shareholder’s equity for the period from incorporation on June 23, 2015 to June 30, 2015, and a
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Management’s Responsibility for the financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as management determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we comply
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our audit is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, these financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SilverCrest
Metals Inc. as at June 30, 2015 and its financial performance and its cash flows for the period from incorporation on
June 23, 2015 to June 30, 2015 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Emphasis of Matter
Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to Note 1 in the financial statements which describes conditions
and matters that indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about SilverCrest
Metals Inc.’s ability to continue as a going concern.

NOTES TO THE FINANICAL STATEMENTS
(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)
PERIOD FROM INCORPORATION ON JUNE 23, 2015 TO JUNE 30, 2015
1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN
SilverCrest Metals Inc. (“SilverCrest Metals Inc.”, the “Company” or “SCM”) was incorporated under the Business
Corporation Act (British Columbia) on June 23, 2015 under the name 1040669 B.C. Ltd. and is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of SilverCrest Mines Inc. (“SilverCrest” or “SVL”). Articles of amendment were subsequently filed on
August 11, 2015 to change the name of the Company to SilverCrest Metals Inc. The head office and principal
address of the Company is 570 Granville Street, Suite 501, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V6C 3P1. The address of the
Company’s registered and records office is 19th Floor, 885 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V6C 3H4.
SVL is in the process of completing an arrangement as described in Note 4 that will result in SCM holding title to
various exploration properties located in Mexico. These financial statements reflect the financial position,
comprehensive earnings (loss), cash flows and changes in shareholder equity of the Company as at June 30, 2015
and for the period from incorporation on June 23, 2015 to June 30, 2015. SCM has not begun any operating
activities.
While these financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the realization of
assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business, there are material uncertainties that may cast
significant doubt upon the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has no sources of
funding and its business and arrangement disclosed in Note 4 are dependent on approvals by the shareholders of
SVL, applicable regulatory authorities and the Supreme Court of British Columbia.
2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. These financial statements were approved for
issuance by the Board of Directors on August 24, 2015.
3. SHARE CAPITAL
The Company’s authorized share capital consists of an unlimited number of common shares and preferred shares
without par value. Upon incorporation on June 23, 2015, the Company issued one common share at a price of $1 to
SVL.
4. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On July 26 2015, SVL, SCM and First Majestic Silver Corp. (“First Majestic”) entered into an arrangement agreement
whereby First Majestic will acquire, through an arrangement, all the outstanding common shares of SVL. Under the
arrangement, each SVL shareholder will receive 0.2769 common shares of First Majestic plus $0.0001 in cash for
each SVL common share held, and 0.1667 common shares of SCM for each SVL common share held.
As part of the arrangement, SVL will transfer the Cruz de Mayo, Las Chispas, Angel de Plata, Huasabas and
Estacion Llano exploration properties located in northern Mexico, as well as $5.25 million in cash and certain other
assets currently owned by SVL to SCM. First Majestic will transfer its Guadalupe exploration property located in
Durango, Mexico to SCM, and First Majestic will own approximately 9.9% of the shares of SCM following completion
of the transaction.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Directors of
SilverCrest Mines Inc. (Exploration Properties Business)
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of SilverCrest Mines Inc. (Exploration
Properties Business), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2014
and 2013 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, cash flows and changes
in equity in net assets for the years then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information.
Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we comply with ethical
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation
and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained in our audits is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of SilverCrest Mines Inc. (Exploration Properties Business) as at December 31, 2014 and 2013 and its financial
performance and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
Emphasis of Matter
Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to Note 2 in the consolidated financial statements which indicate
that SilverCrest Mines Inc. (Exploration Properties Business) has suffered recurring losses from operations and
has a net capital deficiency. These matters, along with the other matters set forth in Note 2, indicate the existence of
material uncertainties that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.

SILVERCREST MINES INC. (EXPLORATION PROPERTIES BUSINESS)
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Expressed in United States Dollars)
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 and 2013
1.NATURE OF OPERATIONS
These consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of
SilverCrest Mines Inc. (Exploration Properties Business) (the “Business” or “Exploration Properties Business”).
The head office and principal address of SilverCrest Mines Inc. (“SVL” or “SilverCrest”) is 570 Granville Street,
Suite 501, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V6C 3P1. The address of SVL’s registered and records office is 19th Floor, 885
West Georgia Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V6C 3H4. SVL is participating in the arrangement (the
“Arrangement”) announced July 27, 2015, whereby First Majestic Silver Corp. (“First Majestic”) proposed to acquire
SVL. As part of the Arrangement, SVL will transfer the Cruz de Mayo, Las Chispas, Angel de Plata, Huasabas and
Estacion Llano exploration properties, as well as CAD$5.25 million in cash and certain other assets currently
owned by SVL to SilverCrest Metals Inc. (“SCM”). First Majestic will transfer its Guadalupe exploration property
located in Durango, Mexico to SCM, and First Majestic will own approximately 9.9% of the shares of SCM following
completion of the transaction. Closing of the arrangement is dependent on approvals by the shareholders of SVL,
applicable regulatory authorities and the Supreme Court of British Columbia.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared for the purposes of the Arrangement, and reflect the
financial position, operations and cash flows of the Cruz de Mayo, Las Chispas, Huasabas and Estacion Llano
exploration properties derived from the accounting records of SVL. The consolidated statements consist of
statements of financial position, statements of operations and comprehensive loss, statements of cash flows and
statements of changes in equity in net assets as if the Business had been operating independently during the
periods presented.
2.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Preparation and Measurement
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and interpretations of the
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”). The policies applied in these consolidated
financial statements are based on IFRSs in effect as at December 31, 2014.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis. Additionally, these
consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting, except for cash flow
information.
The consolidated financial statements have been presented under the continuity of interest’s basis of accounting
with the consolidated statements of financial position based on the amounts recorded by SilverCrest. The
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2014, and 2013
reflect nominal activity at the Mexican exploration properties as SilverCrest’s primary focus during this period was
implementing expansion plans at its flag ship property, the Santa Elena Mine, Sonora, Mexico.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management on a going concern basis which
assumes that the Business will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of
business for the foreseeable future. The Business has incurred ongoing losses, does not generate revenues and
will require additional contributions from SVL in order to meet its ongoing level of operations and discharge its
liabilities as they come due. These material uncertainties raise substantial doubt upon the Business’s ability to
continue as a going concern. The continuing operations of the Business is dependent upon its ability to continue
to receive financial support, successfully complete the exploration and development of its mineral properties and
commence profitable operations in the future.
These financial statements were approved for issuance by the Board of Directors on August 24, 2015.
Basis of Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Business and its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Nusantara de Mexico S.A. de C.V., a Mexico corporation.
The Business consolidates subsidiaries where the Business has the ability to exercise control. Control is achieved
when the Business has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity. Control is normally
achieved through ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the voting power. Control can also be
achieved through power over more than half of the voting rights by virtue of an agreement with other investors or
through the exercise of de facto control. All intercompany balances, transactions, income and expenses, and
profits or losses have been eliminated on consolidation.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Expressed in United States Dollars)
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 and 2013
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses. The cost of an item of PPE consists of the purchase price, any costs directly attributable to
bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for its intended use and an initial estimate of the costs of
dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located.
Carrying amounts of PPE are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the estimated useful lives of the
assets or the estimated life of the related mine or plant, if shorter. Where components of an asset have different
useful lives, depreciation is calculated on each separate component.
Depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the following terms:
Computer equipment and furniture3-5 years 
 
Computer software
1 year
An item of PPE is derecognized upon disposal, when held for sale, or when no future economic benefits are
expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on disposal of the asset, determined
as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, is recognized in profit or
loss.
Mineral properties and exploration and evaluation assets
Pre-exploration costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
Once the legal right to explore a mineral property has been acquired, all costs related to the acquisition, exploration
and evaluation of mineral properties are capitalized by property. These direct expenditures include such costs as
materials used, surveying costs, geological studies, drilling costs, payments made to contractors and depreciation
of plant and equipment during the exploration phase. Costs not directly attributable to exploration and evaluation
activities, including general administrative overhead costs, are expensed in the period in which they occur.
Exploration and evaluation expenditures for each mineral property are carried forward as an asset provided that
one of the following conditions is met:
Such costs are expected to be recouped in full through successful development and exploration of the mineral property or
·
alternatively, by sale; or
Exploration and evaluation activities in the mineral property have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable
·
assessment of the existence of economically recoverable reserves but active and significant operations in relation to the
mineral property are continuing, or planned for the future.
The carrying values of capitalized amounts are reviewed annually, or when indicators of impairment are present. In
the case of undeveloped properties, there may be only inferred resources to allow management to form a basis for
the impairment review. The review is based on the Business’s intentions for the development of such a property. If
a mineral property does not prove viable, all unrecoverable costs associated with the property are charged to the
consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss at the time the determination is made. Once the
technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting the mineral resource has been determined, the property
is considered to be a mine under development and is classified as “mining assets”. Exploration and evaluation
expenditures accumulated are also tested for impairment before the mineral property costs are transferred to
development properties.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
At each financial position reporting date the carrying amounts of the Business’s assets are reviewed to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount
of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment, if any. The recoverable amount is the
higher of fair value less costs to dispose (“FVLCTD”) and value in use, which is the present value of future cash
flows expected to be derived from the asset. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its
carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss is
recognized in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Expressed in United States Dollars)
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 and 2013
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
For the purposes of impairment testing, exploration and evaluation assets are allocated to cash-generating units to
which the exploration activity relates. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the
recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. Where an impairment
loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (or cash-
generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in the statement of
operations and comprehensive loss.
Asset retirement obligations
The Business recognizes a legal liability for obligations relating to the reclamation of mineral interests (exploration
and evaluation assets) and property, plant, and equipment when those obligations arise from the acquisition,
construction, development, or normal operation of those assets. Such asset retirement costs must be recognized
at fair value, when a reliable estimate of fair value can be made, in the period in which it is incurred, added to the
carrying value of the asset, and amortized into income on a systematic basis over its useful life. When the extent of
disturbance increases over the life of an operation, the provision is increased accordingly. Provisions are
measured at the present value of the expected future expenditures required to settle the obligation, using a risk-
free pre-tax discount rate reflecting the time value of money and risks specific to the liability. The liability is
increased for the passage of time, and adjusted for changes to the current market-based risk-free discount rate as
well as changes in the estimated amount or timing of the expected future expenditures.
Foreign currency translation
The presentation and functional currency of the Business and its subsidiary is the United States dollar. The
functional currency of each entity is determined after consideration of the primary economic environment of the
entity. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies (currencies other than the functional currency of an
operation) are translated at the exchange rates on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the reporting date exchange rates.
Taxation
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income taxes. Current and deferred income taxes are
recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that they relate to items recognized directly in equity. Current
income tax expense is the expected tax payable on taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at year end, adjusted for amendments to tax payable with regards to previous years.
The Business follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantively enacted tax rates and laws expected
to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change
in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the period of substantive
enactment.
A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the asset can be utilized. To the extent that the Business does not consider it probable that a
deferred tax asset will be recovered, the deferred tax asset is not recorded. Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are presented as non-current in the financial statements.
Contributions
Contributions from SVL to the Business are presented as part of equity. The Business has no share capital,
options or warrants, and as a result, there is no applicable share-related disclosures.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Expressed in United States Dollars)
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 and 2013
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Financial instruments
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified into one of the following categories based on the purpose for which the asset was
acquired. All transactions related to financial instruments are recorded on a trade date basis. The Business’s
accounting policy for each category is as follows:
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”)
A financial asset is classified at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held for trading or is designated
as such upon initial recognition. Financial assets are designated as at FVTPL if the Business manages such
investments and makes purchase and sale decisions based on their fair value in accordance with the Business’s
risk management strategy. Attributable transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss when incurred. FVTPL are
measured at fair value, and changes are recognized in profit or loss.
Held-to-maturity (“HTM”)
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the
Business’s management has the intention and ability to hold to maturity. These assets are measured at amortized
cost using the effective interest method. If there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, determined by
reference to external credit ratings and other relevant indicators, the financial asset is measured at the present
value of estimated future cash flows. Any changes to the carrying amount of the investment, including impairment
losses, are recognized in profit or loss.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active
market. Such assets are initially recognized at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest
method, less any impairment losses.
Available-for-sale (“AFS”)
Non-derivative financial assets not included in the above categories are classified as available-for-sale. They are
carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized directly in equity. Where a decline in the fair value of an
available-for-sale financial asset constitutes objective evidence of impairment, the amount of the loss is removed
from equity and recognized in profit or loss.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified into one of two categories:
- Fair value through profit or loss; and
- Other financial liabilities.
Fair value through profit or loss
This category comprises derivatives, or liabilities, acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or
repurchasing it in the near term. They are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with changes in
fair value recognized in profit or loss.
Other financial liabilities
This category typically includes accounts payable and accrued liabilities and long-term debt, all of which are
recognized at amortized cost.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting
period. Financial assets are impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial assets, the estimated future cash flows of the investments have
been impacted.
For all financial assets, objective evidence of impairment could include:
- significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
- default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
- it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organization.
For certain categories of financial assets, such as receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired
individually are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis. The carrying amount of financial
assets is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of receivables, where the
carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a receivable is considered
uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written
off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are
recognized in profit or loss.

2.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss
is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment
is reversed does not exceed what the amortized cost would have been had the impairment not been recognized.
3. CRITICAL JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the valuation of assets and liabilities
and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the year.
These judgments and estimates are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s experience and
knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances. Actual results may differ from the estimates. Revisions to
estimates and the resulting effects on the carrying amounts of the Business’s assets and liabilities are accounted
for prospectively. Information about such judgments and estimates is contained in the description of accounting
policies (note 2) and/or other notes to the financial statements. Management has made the following critical
judgments and estimates:
Critical Judgments in applying Accounting Policies
The critical judgments that the Business’s management has made in the process of applying the Business’s
accounting policies, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts
recognized in the Business’s consolidated financial statements are as follows:
Economic Recoverability and Probability of Future Economic Benefit of Exploration and Evaluation Costs
Management has determined that costs related to exploration drilling, evaluation studies and other work that have
been capitalized have probable future benefit and are economically recoverable. Management uses several criteria
in its assessments of economic recoverability and probability of future economic benefit including geologic and
metallurgic information, history of conversion of mineral deposits to probable reserves, scoping and feasibility
studies, accessible facilities, existing permits and life of mine plans.
Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty
The significant assumptions about the future and other major sources of estimation uncertainty as at the end of the
reporting period that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of the
Business’s assets and liabilities are as follows:
Provisions for Asset Retirement Obligations
The Business’s provision for asset retirement obligations represents management’s best estimate of the present
value of the future cash outflows required to settle the liability. Management assesses these provisions on an
annual basis or when new information becomes available. This assessment includes the estimation of the future
rehabilitation costs, the timing of these expenditures, inflation, and the impact of changes in discount rates, interest
rates and foreign exchange rates. The actual future expenditures may differ from the amounts currently provided if
the estimates made are significantly different than actual results or if there are significant changes in environmental
and/or regulatory requirements in the future.
4.
MANAGEMENT OF CAPITAL
The Business’s objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Business’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to support the exploration and evaluation of its mineral properties. The capital of the Business
consists of items included in equity in net assets.
The Business manages and adjusts its capital structure when changes to the risk characteristics of the underlying
assets or changes in economic conditions occur. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Business may
attempt to raise new funds.
In order to facilitate the management of its capital requirements, the Business prepares semi-annual expenditure
budgets which are revised periodically based on the results of its exploration programs, availability of financing
and industry conditions. The semi-annual and updated budgets are approved by the Board of Directors. There are
no external restrictions on management of capital. The Business believes it will be able to raise new funds as
required in the long term to fund its exploration programs, but recognizes there will be risks involved that may be
beyond its control.

Title to mineral properties involves certain inherent risks due to the difficulties of determining the validity of certain
claims as well as the potential for problems arising from the frequently ambiguous conveyancing history
characteristic of many mineral properties. The Business has investigated title to all of its mineral properties and, to
the best of its knowledge, title to all of its properties are in good standing except as otherwise disclosed. However,
this should not be considered as a guarantee of title. The mineral properties may be subject to prior claims or
agreements, or transfers, and rights of ownership may be affected by undetected defects.

6. EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION ASSETS (continued)
Cruz de Mayo Project, Sonora, Mexico
The Business purchased a 100% interest in certain mineral concessions, located in Sonora State, Mexico, in 2004,
and on November 19, 2010, finalized an assignment agreement to acquire a 100% interest in the El Guereguito
concession in the same state. The Business has the right to acquire the 100% interest in the El Guereguito
concession by making staged option payments totaling $1,000,000. From November 2010 to November 2014, the
Business has made staged option payments totalling $195,000. The Business has the right to make early payment
with no additional consideration. There is a 2.5% NSR on revenues from production of minerals which ceases on
cumulative payments of $1,000,000.
For the year ended December 31, 2014, an impairment charge of $2,875,168 was recognized in respect of the Cruz
de Mayo Project, representing all expenditures and acquisition costs incurred to date. The Business is currently
focusing its efforts on properties other than Cruz de Mayo and does not anticipate incurring significant exploration
and evaluation expenditures on this project. The Business intends to maintain the Cruz de Mayo Project on a care
and maintenance. All future expenditures will be reflected directly in the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss.
Other Properties, Sonora, Mexico
The Business has a number of other Mexican exploration properties that includes Las Chispas, Angel de Plata,
Huasabas and Estacion Llano with nominal exploration activity.
7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Business is exposed to various financial instrument risks and assesses the impact and likelihood of this
exposure. These risks include liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. Where material, these risks are reviewed and
monitored by the Board of Directors.
a.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Business will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The
Business has in place a planning and budgeting process to help determine the funds required to ensure the
Business has the appropriate liquidity to meet its operating and growth objectives.
b.Foreign Currency Risk
The Business operates in Canada and Mexico, and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from
transactions denominated in a foreign currency. The operating results and the financial position of the Business
are reported in United States dollars. The fluctuations of the operating currencies in relation to the United States
dollar will, consequently, have an impact upon the reporting results of the Business, and may also affect the value
of the Business’s assets and liabilities. The Business has not entered into any agreements or purchased any
instruments to hedge possible currency risks at this time.
8.INCOME TAXES
A reconciliation of income taxes calculated at the combined statutory tax rate to the income tax expense is as
follows:

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Expressed in United States Dollars)
THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015 and 2014
1.     NATURE OF OPERATIONS
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect the financial position, results of operations and
cash flows of SilverCrest Mines Inc. (Exploration Properties Business) (the “Business” or “Exploration Properties
Business”). The head office and principal address of SilverCrest Mines Inc. (“SVL” or “SilverCrest”) is 570 Granville
Street, Suite 501, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V6C 3P1. The address of SVL’s registered and records office is 19th
Floor, 885 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V6C 3H4. SVL is participating in the arrangement (the
“Arrangement”) announced July 27, 2015, whereby First Majestic Silver Corp. (“First Majestic”) proposed to acquire
SVL. As part of the Arrangement, SVL will transfer the Cruz de Mayo, Las Chispas, Angel de Plata, Huasabas and
Estacion Llano exploration properties, as well as CAD$5.25 million in cash and certain other assets currently
owned by SVL to SilverCrest Metals Inc. (“SCM”). First Majestic will transfer its Guadalupe exploration property
located in Durango, Mexico to SCM, and First Majestic will own approximately 9.9% of the shares of SCM following
completion of the transaction. Closing of the arrangement is dependent on approvals by the shareholders of SVL,
applicable regulatory authorities and the Supreme Court of British Columbia.
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared for the purposes of the
Arrangement, and reflect the financial position, operations and cash flows of the Cruz de Mayo, Las Chispas,
Huasabas and Estacion Llano exploration properties derived from the accounting records of SVL. The condensed
consolidated interim statements consist of statements of financial position, statements of operations and
comprehensive loss, statements of cash flows and statements of changes in equity in net assets as if the Business
had been operating independently during the periods presented.
2.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Statement of Compliance
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with Business’s audited
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, which include information necessary or
useful to understanding the Business and financial statement presentation. In particular, the Business’s significant
accounting policies, use of judgments and estimates were presented in notes 2 and 3, respectively, of these
audited consolidated financial statements, and have been consistently applied in the preparation of these
condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
Basis of Preparation
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis.
Additionally, these consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting,
except for cash flow information.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management on a going concern basis which
assumes that the Business will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of
business for the foreseeable future. The Business has incurred ongoing losses, does not generate revenues and
will require additional contributions from SVL in order to meet its ongoing level of operations and discharge its
liabilities as they come due. These material uncertainties raise substantial doubt upon the Business’s ability to
continue as a going concern. The continuing operations of the Business is dependent upon its ability to continue
to receive financial support, successfully complete the exploration and development of its mineral properties and
commence profitable operations in the future.
These financial statements were approved for issuance by the Board of Directors on August 24, 2015.
Basis of Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Business and its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Nusantara de Mexico S.A. de C.V., a Mexico corporation.
The Business consolidates subsidiaries where the Business has the ability to exercise control. Control is achieved
when the Business has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity. Control is normally
achieved through ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the voting power. Control can also be
achieved through power over more than half of the voting rights by virtue of an agreement with other investors or
through the exercise of de facto control. All intercompany balances, transactions, income and expenses, and
profits or losses have been eliminated on consolidation.

NOTES TO THE PRO-FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JUNE 30, 2015
(Unaudited - Expressed in Canadian Dollars)
1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The unaudited pro-forma condensed consolidated financial statements (the “pro-forma financial statements”) of
SilverCrest Metals Inc. (“SCM”) have been prepared for inclusion in the Joint Information Circular of SilverCrest
Mines Inc. (“SVL”), First Majestic Silver Corp. (“First Majestic”) and SCM, dated August 24, 2015, relating to
proposed acquisition of SVL by First Majestic through an arrangement. As part of the arrangement, SVL will
transfer the Cruz de Mayo, Las Chispas, Angel de Plata, Huasabas and Estacion Llano exploration properties
(collectively the “Mexico Exploration Properties” or the “Exploration Properties Business”) as well as $5.25 million
in cash and certain other assets currently owned by SVL to SCM. First Majestic will transfer its Guadalupe
exploration property located in Durango, Mexico to SCM, and First Majestic will own approximately 9.9% of the
shares of SCM following completion of the transaction.
These pro-forma financial statements have been derived from the audited financial statements of SCM as at June
30, 2015, the audited carve-out consolidated financial statements of the Exploration Properties Business of SVL as
at December 31, 2014, and the unaudited carve-out condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the
Exploration Properties Business of SVL as at June 30, 2015.
The pro-forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position has been prepared as if the arrangement
had occurred on June 30, 2015. The pro-forma condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the
six months ended June 30, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2014 have been prepared as if the arrangement
had occurred on January 1, 2014.
The pro-forma financial statements have been prepared by the management of SVL in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and
incorporate the principal accounting polices expected to be used to prepare the carve-out consolidated financial
statements of the Exploration Properties Business of SVL.
The pro-forma adjustments are based on certain estimates and assumptions and it is likely that the actual
adjustments will differ from the pro-forma adjustments and it is possible the differences may be material. The pro-
forma financial statements have been prepared for illustrative purposes only and may not be indicative of SCM’s
financial position or operating results that would have occurred if the arrangement had been in effect at the dates
indicated. Further, these pro-forma financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the financial position that
may be obtained in the future. These pro-forma financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and other information available to SCM, as referred to above.
2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies used in the preparation of these pro-forma financial statements are consistent with those
set out in the Exploration Properties Business of SVL’s audited consolidated financial statements as at December
31, 2014. For the purpose of these pro-forma financial statements, the amounts under the Exploration Properties
Business of SVL were adjusted to reflect conversion from United States dollar to Canadian dollars. The statements
of comprehensive loss were translated to Canadian dollars using an average exchange ratio of US$1.00 to C$1.23,
while the statement of financial position was considered by Management to be immaterial to translate.
3.  PRO-FORMA ASSUMPTIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS
The pro-forma financial statements were prepared on the following assumptions:
a)Elimination of historical equity accounts of SCM at the date of the transaction.
The transfer by SVL of $5.25 million in cash, the Mexico Exploration Properties, and certain Vancouver office assets for
b)an aggregate subscription price of $5,291,635.
c) The transfer by First Majestic of the Guadalupe exploration property for an amount of $581,434.
d)
As part of the arrangement, all outstanding SVL share purchase options were exchanged at the exchange ratio of 0.1667
resulting in 1,608,655 new SCM options exercisable for common shares of SCM at exercise price of $0.06. The fair value
of the new SCM options amounted to $336,290 and was recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.
The fair value was determined using a Black-Scholes model using the following weighted average assumptions at June
30, 2015:
Options  
 
  0.59

Risk-free interest rate
Expected dividend yield

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
PERIOD FROM INCORPORATION ON JUNE 23, 2015 TO JUNE 30, 2015
INTRODUCTION
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) is an overview of the activities of SilverCrest Metals Inc.
(the “Company” or “SCM”) for the period from incorporation on June 23, 2015 to June 30, 2015. The MD&A is
intended to help the reader understand the Company’s operations, financial performance and present and future
business environment. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements at June 30, 2015, and the related notes contained therein which have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. All
amounts are stated Canadian dollars. The date of this MD&A is August 24, 2015.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
SCM was incorporated on June 23, 2015 under the name 1040669 B.C. Ltd. to focus on the exploration and
development of precious metals mineral projects with an emphasis on projects throughout Mexico. Articles of
amendment were subsequently filed on August 11, 2015 to change the name of the Business to SilverCrest Metals
Inc. The head office and principal address of the Company is 570 Granville Street, Suite 501, Vancouver, BC,
Canada, V6C 3P1. SilverCrest Mines Inc. (“SilverCrest” or “SVL”) is the Company’s only shareholder.
As of the date of this MD&A, the Company does not have any assets or liabilities and has incurred no operations.
SVL is in the process of completing an arrangement with First Majestic Silver Corp. (“First Majestic”) whereby First
Majestic will acquire all the outstanding common shares of SVL. Under the arrangement, each SVL shareholder will
receive 0.2769 common shares of First Majestic, plus $0.0001 in cash, and 0.1667 common shares of SCM for each
SVL common share held.
As part of the arrangement, SVL will transfer the Cruz de Mayo, Las Chispas, Angel de Plata, Huasabas and
Estacion Llano exploration properties located in Sonora, Mexico, as well as $5.25 million in cash and certain other
assets currently owned by SVL to SCM. First Majestic will transfer its Guadalupe exploration property located in
Durango, Mexico to SCM, and First Majestic will own approximately 9.9% of the shares of SCM following completion
of the transaction.
The Board of Directors of SilverCrest has unanimously approved the transaction. The transaction will be carried
out by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement and will require the approval of at least 66 2/3% of the votes
cast by the shareholders of SilverCrest. The transaction will also require the approval of a simple majority of the
shareholders of First Majestic in accordance with the rules of the TSX and the NYSE. The special meetings of
shareholders of SilverCrest and First Majestic will take place on September 25, 2015 to seek approval for the
transaction with closing expected to occur early in October.
In addition to shareholder, court and creditor approvals, the transaction is subject to applicable regulatory
approvals and the satisfaction of certain other closing conditions customary in transactions of this nature.
Upon closing of the Arrangement, SCM intends to make an application to the TSX Venture Exchange for its shares
to be listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange. If the SCM shares do not become listed or quoted for trading
on any stock exchange, this could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of the SCM shares and negatively
impact the share price of SCM shares following the completion of the Arrangement.
Of the exploration properties, management of SCM considers the Cruz de Mayo Property to be material for the
purposes of National Instrument 43-101 – Standards for Disclosure of Mineral Projects. The remaining properties
are each in a preliminary stage and exploration to date of these properties by SilverCrest and First Majestic has
been minimal. Further information about Cruz de Mayo and other exploration properties can be obtained from
Appendix H to the Joint Information Circular of SilverCrest and First Majestic, dated August 24, 2015, which is
available under SilverCrest and First Majestic’s profiles on www.sedar.com.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014
INTRODUCTION
This management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) is an overview of the activities of SilverCrest Mines Inc.
(Exploration Properties Business) (the “Exploration Properties Business”) for the three and twelve months ended
December 31, 2014. The MD&A is dated August 24, 2015, unless otherwise indicated and should be read in
conjunction with the audited “carve-out” consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Exploration
Properties Business for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 included elsewhere in the Joint Information
Circular (the “Circular”) of SilverCrest Mines Inc. (“SVL”), First Majestic Silver Corp. (“First Majestic”) and
SilverCrest Metals Inc. (“SCM”). The Circular, relating to the Arrangement (as defined below), is dated August 24,
2015 and is available on SEDAR under SVL and First Majestic’s profiles on www.sedar.com. The results presented
for years ended December 31, 2014, and 2013 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for
any future period. All amounts are stated in United States dollars (US$) unless Canadian dollars (C$) are indicated.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
SVL is participating in an arrangement (the “Arrangement”) whereby First Majestic will acquire all the outstanding
common shares of SVL. Under the Arrangement, each SVL shareholder will receive 0.2769 common shares of First
Majestic, plus C$0.0001 in cash, and 0.1667 common shares of SCM for each SVL common share held.
As part of the Arrangement, SVL will transfer the Cruz de Mayo, Las Chispas, Angel de Plata, Huasabas and

as well as C$5.25 million in cash and certain other assets currently owned by SVL to SCM. First Majestic will

The Board of Directors of SVL has unanimously approved the transaction. The transaction will be carried out by

the shareholders of SVL. The transaction will also require the approval of a simple majority of the shareholders of
First Majestic in accordance with the rules of the TSX and the NYSE. The special meetings of shareholders of SVL

to occur early in October.
In addition to shareholder, court and creditor approvals, the transaction is subject to applicable regulatory
approvals and the satisfaction of certain other closing conditions customary in transactions of this nature.
Upon closing of the Arrangement, SCM intends to make an application to the TSX Venture Exchange for its shares
to be listed for trading on the TSX Venture Exchange. If the SCM shares do not become listed or quoted for trading
on any stock exchange, this could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of the SCM shares and negatively
impact the share price of SCM shares following the completion of the Arrangement.
DISCUSSION OF OPERATIONS
The carve-out consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 have been
prepared for the purposes of the Arrangement, and reflect the assets, liabilities, operations, and cash flows of the
Exploration Properties Business derived from the accounting records of SVL. The consolidated statements consist
of statements of financial position, statements of operations and comprehensive loss, statements of cash flows
and statements of changes in equity in net assets as if the Exploration Properties Business had been operating
independently during the periods presented.
The consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss of the Exploration Properties Business for the
years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 reflect nominal activity at the Mexico Exploration Properties as SVL’s
primary focus during this period was implementing expansion plans at its flag ship property, the Santa Elena Mine,
Sonora, Mexico. Corporate and administrative expenses incurred during fiscal 2014 of $46,824 and during fiscal
2013 of $51,575 related to depreciation of property, plant and equipment and the care and maintenance of the
Mexico Exploration Properties.

SILVERCREST MINES INC. (EXPLORATION PROPERTIES BUSINESS)
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014
MINERAL PROPERTY INTERESTS
As part of the Arrangement, SVL’s 100% interest in the Mexico Exploration Properties will be transferred to SCM.
During fiscal 2013 and 2014 the Exploration Properties Business did not carry out significant exploration programs
on the Mexico Exploration Properties. The Exploration Properties Business is in the process of considering
appropriate programs for the Mexico Exploration Properties. Further information about the Mexico Exploration
Properties can be obtained from Appendix H to the Circular.
During fiscal 2014 and 2013, the Exploration Properties Business incurred $156,527 and $58,817, respectively, in
concession taxes for the Mexico Exploration Properties.
SELECTED ANNUAL INFORMATION
The following financial data has been prepared in accordance with IFRS:
Revenues
 
Net and comprehensive loss (1) $1,931,992  $247,575   $425,090  
Total assets (2)

2013
  $-
2014
 $-
2012
  $-
(1)
The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased significantly primarily from a $2.88 million non-cash
impairment charge recognized in respect of the Cruz de Mayo Project, representing all expenditures and acquisition costs
incurred to date and partially offset by a recovery of deferred taxes. SVL elected to write off the Cruz de Mayo Project as it
has been focusing its efforts on properties other than Cruz de Mayo and did not anticipate incurring significant exploration
and evaluation expenditures on this project in the near term.
(2) Total assets decreased in 2014 with the impairment charge taken on the Cruz de Mayo Project.

The following financial data is selected information for the Exploration Properties Business for the eight most

As the Exploration Properties Business has no operating revenues to generate earnings and cash flow, in most
quarters losses can be expected due to the general and administrative expenses incurred in running the
Exploration Properties Business. In addition, if the Mexico Exploration Properties are impaired, the capitalized
acquisition and exploration costs associated with such properties are written off, which can result in a significant
increase in the net loss for the quarter in question.
The net and comprehensive loss for the three months ended December 31, 2014 increased significantly primarily
from a $2.88 million non-cash impairment charge recognized in respect of the Cruz de Mayo Project, representing
all expenditures and acquisition costs incurred to date and partially offset by a recovery of deferred taxes.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Exploration Properties Business has no operations that generate cash flows, has incurred ongoing losses and
has relied primarily on contributions from SVL to finance its activities. The Exploration Properties Business’s future
financial success will depend on the discovery of one or more economic mineral deposits. This process can take
many years, can consume significant resources and is largely based on factors that are beyond the control of the
Exploration Properties Business’s management.
The continuing operations of the Exploration Properties Business are dependent upon its ability to continue to
receive financial support, successfully complete the exploration and development of its mineral properties and
commence profitable operations in the future.
There is no assurance that the Exploration Properties Business will be able to access funding at the times and in
the amounts required to fund the Exploration Properties Business’s activities. The outlook for the World economy
remains uncertain and vulnerable to various shocks that could adversely affect the Exploration Properties
Business’s ability to raise additional funds going forward.

SILVERCREST MINES INC. (EXPLORATION PROPERTIES BUSINESS)
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2014
OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As at December 31, 2014, the Exploration Properties Business had no off balance sheet arrangements.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Related parties include the Board of Directors and management, close family and enterprises that are controlled by
these individuals. A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources
or obligations between related parties. The Exploration Properties Business did not enter into any related party
transaction during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
PROPOSED TRANSACTION
As of the date of this document, the Arrangement described in the “Description of Business” section has not been
completed. Other than the Arrangement and the transactions proposed to be completed in connection therewith
there are no additional proposed transactions as at the date hereof.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Exploration Properties Business is exposed to various financial instrument risks and assesses the impact and
likelihood of this exposure. These risks include liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. Where material, these risks
are reviewed and monitored by the Board of Directors.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Exploration Properties Business will not be able to meet its financial obligations as
they fall due. The Exploration Properties Business has in place a planning and budgeting process to help
determine the funds required to ensure the Exploration Properties Business has the appropriate liquidity to meet
its operating and growth objectives.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Exploration Properties Business operates in Canada and Mexico, and is therefore exposed to foreign
exchange risk arising from transactions denominated in a foreign currency. The operating results and the financial
position of the Exploration Properties Business are reported in United States dollars. The fluctuations of the
operating currencies in relation to the United States dollar will, consequently, have an impact upon the reporting
results of the Exploration Properties Business, and may also affect the value of the Exploration Properties
Business’s assets and liabilities. The Exploration Properties Business has not entered into any agreements or
purchased any instruments to hedge possible currency risks at this time.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT DISCLAIMER
Readers of this MD&A are encouraged to read the “Risk Factors” contained in Appendix H to the Circular.
Important risk factors to consider, among others, are
· No Assurance of Listing of SCM Shares;
· No History of Operations;
· No Mineral Production;
·
· Additional Capital and Financing Risk; and
· Reliance on Key Personnel.
Land Title;
Certain statements contained in the following MD&A constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of
applicable Canadian securities legislation. Such forward-looking statements, including the closing of the proposed
transaction, the listing of SCM’s shares on the TSX Venture Exchange and the ability of obtaining sufficient
financial support, involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause
the actual results, performance or achievements of the Exploration Properties Business to be materially different
from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. The Exploration
Properties Business undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements included in this MD&A if
these beliefs, estimates and opinions or other circumstances should change, except as otherwise required by
applicable law.

During the six months end June 30, 2015 the Exploration Properties Business did not carry out significant
exploration programs on the Mexico Exploration Properties. The Exploration Properties Business is in the process
of considering appropriate programs for the Mexico Exploration Properties. Further information about the Mexico
Exploration Properties can be obtained from Appendix H to the Circular.

)
As the Exploration Properties Business has no operating revenues to generate earnings and cash flow, in most
quarters losses can be expected due to the general and administrative expenses incurred in running the
Exploration Properties Business. In addition, if the Mexico Exploration Properties are impaired, the capitalized
acquisition and exploration costs associated with such properties are written off, which can result in a significant
increase in the net loss for the quarter in question.
The net and comprehensive loss for the three months ended December 31, 2014 increased significantly primarily
from a $2.88 million non-cash impairment charge recognized in respect of the Cruz de Mayo Project, representing
all expenditures and acquisition costs incurred to date and partially offset by a recovery of deferred taxes.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Exploration Properties Business has no operations that generate cash flows, has incurred ongoing losses and
has relied primarily on contributions from SVL to finance its activities. The Exploration Properties Business’s future
financial success will depend on the discovery of one or more economic mineral deposits. This process can take
many years, can consume significant resources and is largely based on factors that are beyond the control of the
Exploration Properties Business’s management.
The continuing operations of the Exploration Properties Business are dependent upon its ability to continue to
receive financial support, successfully complete the exploration and development of its mineral properties and
commence profitable operations in the future.
There is no assurance that the Exploration Properties Business will be able to access funding at the times and in
the amounts required to fund the Exploration Properties Business’s activities. The outlook for the World economy
remains uncertain and vulnerable to various shocks that could adversely affect the Exploration Properties
Business’s ability to raise additional funds going forward.
OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As at June 30, 2015, the Exploration Properties Business had no off balance sheet arrangements.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Related parties include the Board of Directors and management, close family and enterprises that are controlled by
these individuals. A transaction is considered to be a related party transaction when there is a transfer of resources
or obligations between related parties. The Exploration Properties Business did not enter into any related party
transaction during the six months ended June 30, 2015.
PROPOSED TRANSACTION
As of the date of this document, the Arrangement described in the “Description of Business” section has not been
completed. Other than the Arrangement and the transactions proposed to be completed in connection therewith
there are no additional proposed transactions as at the date hereof.

SILVERCREST MINES INC. (EXPLORATION PROPERTIES BUSINESS)
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Exploration Properties Business is exposed to various financial instrument risks and assesses the impact and
likelihood of this exposure. These risks include liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. Where material, these risks
are reviewed and monitored by the Board of Directors.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Exploration Properties Business will not be able to meet its financial obligations as
they fall due. The Exploration Properties Business has in place a planning and budgeting process to help
determine the funds required to ensure the Exploration Properties Business has the appropriate liquidity to meet
its operating and growth objectives.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Exploration Properties Business operates in Canada and Mexico, and is therefore exposed to foreign
exchange risk arising from transactions denominated in a foreign currency. The operating results and the financial
position of the Exploration Properties Business are reported in United States dollars. The fluctuations of the
operating currencies in relation to the United States dollar will, consequently, have an impact upon the reporting
results of the Exploration Properties Business, and may also affect the value of the Exploration Properties
Business’s assets and liabilities. The Exploration Properties Business has not entered into any agreements or
purchased any instruments to hedge possible currency risks at this time.

Important risk factors to consider, among others, are
· No Assurance of Listing of SCM Shares;

of SilverCrest that has been requested by NBF. No limitation has been placed on NBF’s scope of review hereunder.
Prior Valuations
Senior officers of SilverCrest have represented to NBF that, to the best of their knowledge, there have been no prior
valuations (as defined for the purposes of MI 61-101) of SilverCrest or any of its material assets or subsidiaries
prepared within the past 24 months. No prior bona fide offer or other material expert report was considered by NBF
in coming to the conclusions or opinions in this Opinion.
Assumptions and Limitations
With the Board’s approval and as provided for in the Engagement Agreement, we have relied upon the
completeness, accuracy and fair presentation of all financial and other information, data, advice, opinions and
representations obtained by us from public sources, or provided to us by SilverCrest, its subsidiaries or their
respective directors, officers, associates, affiliates, consultants, advisors and representatives (collectively, the
“Information”). Our Opinion is conditional upon such completeness, accuracy and fair presentation of the
Information. We have not been requested to, nor, subject to the exercise of professional judgment, have we
attempted to, verify independently the completeness, accuracy or fair presentation of the Information.
Two senior officers of SilverCrest have represented to NBF in a certificate dated July 23, 2015, among other things,
that (i) the Information provided orally by, or in the presence of, an officer or employee of SilverCrest or in writing by
SilverCrest or any of its subsidiaries, associates or affiliates or their respective directors, officers, associates,
affiliates, consultants, advisors and representatives to NBF or obtained by NBF from the System for Electronic
Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) relating to SilverCrest, its subsidiaries, associates or affiliates or the
Arrangement for the purpose of preparing the Opinion was, at the date the Information was provided to NBF, and is
at the date hereof complete, true and correct in all material respects, and did not and does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact in respect of SilverCrest, its subsidiaries, associates or affiliates, or the Arrangement
and did not and does not omit to state a material fact in respect of SilverCrest, its subsidiaries, associates or
affiliates, or the Arrangement necessary to make the Information or any statement contained therein not misleading
in light of the circumstances under which the Information was provided or any such statement was made; and that
(ii) since the dates on which the Information was provided to NBF, except as disclosed in writing to NBF, there has
been no material change, financial or otherwise, in the financial condition, assets, liabilities (contingent or
otherwise), business, operations or prospects of SilverCrest or any of its subsidiaries, associates or affiliates and
no material change has occurred in the Information or any part thereof which would have or which would
reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the Opinion.
I-5
With respect to any forecasts, projections, estimates and/or budgets provided to NBF and used in its analyses,
NBF notes that projecting future results of any company is inherently subject to uncertainty. NBF has assumed,
however, that such forecasts, projections, estimates and/or budgets were prepared using the assumptions
identified therein and that such assumptions in the opinion of SilverCrest, are (or were at the time and continue to
be) reasonable in the circumstances.
NBF has assumed that, in all respects material to its analysis, the Arrangement Agreement executed by the parties
will be in substantially the form provided to us, the representations and warranties of the parties to the
Arrangement Agreement contained therein are true, accurate and complete in all material respects, such parties will
each perform all of the respective covenants and agreements to be performed by them under the Arrangement
Agreement, and all conditions to the obligations of such parties as specified in the Arrangement Agreement will be
satisfied without any waiver thereof. NBF has also assumed that all material approvals and consents required in
connection with the consummation of the Arrangement will be obtained and that in connection with obtaining any
necessary approvals and consents, no limitations, restrictions or conditions will be imposed that would have a
material adverse effect on First Majestic.
We have also assumed that the Lock-up Agreement will be entered into by the parties thereto substantially in the
form of the drafts provided to us, that all of the representations and warranties to be contained in the Lock-up
Agreement will be correct as of the date hereof and that the Locked-Up Securityholders will vote all of their
securities in favour of the Arrangement.
We are not legal, tax or accounting experts and we express no opinion concerning any legal, tax or accounting
matters concerning the Arrangement.We express no opinion as to the value at which the First Majestic Shares or
New SilverCrest Shares may trade following completion of the Arrangement.
This Opinion is rendered as at the date hereof and on the basis of securities markets, economic and general
business and financial conditions prevailing as at the date hereof and the conditions and prospects, financial and
otherwise, of SilverCrest or First Majesticas they are reflected in the Information and as they were represented to us
in our discussions with the management of SilverCrest. In our analyses and in connection with the preparation of
our Opinion, we have made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business,
market and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of NBF and any party
involved in the Arrangement. This Opinion is provided to the Board for its use only and may not be relied upon by
any other person.NBF disclaims any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in any fact or
matter affecting the Opinion which may come or be brought to the attention of NBF after the date hereof. Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event that there is any material change in any fact or matter affecting the Opinion after
the date hereof, NBF reserves the right to change, modify or withdraw the Opinion. The preparation of a fairness
opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily capable of being partially analyzed or summarized. NBF
believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the analyses or the factors
considered by it, without considering all factors and analyses together, could create an incomplete view of the
process underlying the Opinion. The Opinion should be read in its entirety.
I-6
This Opinion is addressed to and is for the sole use and benefit of the Board, and may not be referred to,
summarized, circulated, publicized or reproduced or disclosed to or used or relied upon by any party without the
express written consent of NBF. This Opinion is not to be construed as a recommendation to any SilverCrest
Shareholder to vote in favour of, or against, the Arrangement.
Value Considerations
In support of the Opinion, NBF has performed certain value analyses on SilverCrest, based on those
methodologies and assumptions that NBF considered appropriate in the circumstances for the purposes of
providing its Opinion. In the context of the Opinion, NBF has considered, among others, the following
methodologies:
a)
the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) Approach (as defined below);
b)
the Precedent Transactions Approach (as defined below); and
c) the Comparable Trading with Control Premium Approach (as defined below).
NAV Approach
The NAV Approach builds up a value by separately considering each operating, development, exploration and
financial asset, the individual values of which are estimated through the application of the methodology viewed as
the most appropriate in the circumstances, net of obligations and liabilities, including reclamation and closure
costs, associated with each individual asset. The value of each operating, development and exploration asset is
summed to produce a total asset value from which the Company’s financial assets and liabilities are added and/or
subtracted, as well as an estimate of the present value of corporate general and administrative costs that were not
directly assignable to the operating assets (the “NAV Approach”).
SilverCrest’s principal assets consist of: i) the Santa Elena Mine, located in the State of Sonora, Mexico(“Santa
Elena Mine”) and, ii) the La Joya property in the Durango State, Mexico (the “La Joya Property”) and a portfolio of
mineral properties including the Ermitano property (collectively, the “Exploration Projects”). The La Joya Property
and Exploration Projects were ascribed value based on comparable staged properties and included in the
SilverCrest NAV.
To value the Santa Elena Mine, NBF utilized an unlevered discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis whereby NBF
calculated the present value of the unlevered after-tax cash flows over the life of the Santa Elena Mineat a
prescribed discount rate. Unlevered after-tax operating cash flows have been reduced on an annual basis by the
estimated amount of capital expenditures needed to maintain the Santa Elena Mine in good working condition
during the period of the projected cash flows and the anticipated working capital requirements to arrive at a
measure of free cash flow. Forecasts of free cash flow were based on equity research estimates, guidance provided
by SilverCrest senior management and NBF’s assessment thereof, in the exercise of its professional judgment,
over the life of the Santa Elena Mine. Silver and gold price forecasts were considered under research analyst
consensus estimates and the spot price.
NBF discounted the unlevered after-tax cash flows by a discount rate consistent with industry standard for
producing mining projects. To determine a range of values using the NAV Approach, a range of discount rates
were used.
Use of DCF analysis for the Santa Elena Mine under the NAV Approach requires that certain assumptions be made
in order to develop the projected free cash flows. NBF performed sensitivity analysis on a variety of the
assumptions including, but not limited to: silver price, gold price, discount rate, silver grade, gold grade, silver
recovery, gold recovery, production, operating costs, general and administration expenses, and sustaining capital
costs.
I-7
Precedent Transactions Approach
NBF reviewed publicly available information on acquisition transactions of comparable silver producing companies
(the “Precedent Transactions Approach”). NBF considered these transactions based upon the implied multiples of
Price/NAV and Enterprise Value (defined below) to mineral reserves (“Enterprise Value/Reserves”) and mineral
resources (“Enterprise Value/Resources”) where available, with enterprise value calculated as equity value plus
debt, less cash and cash equivalents (“Enterprise Value”). NBF then applied a range of selected multiples based
upon these transactions to the corresponding data of SilverCrest.
NBF also reviewed premia paid to shareholders of acquired companies in these transactions as at the date of
announcement of the transaction and based on the average volume weighted average prices (“VWAP”) over the
preceding 20-day period. NBF then applied a range of selected premia based upon these transactions to the
corresponding data of SilverCrest.
Comparable Trading with Control Premium Approach
NBF reviewed public market trading statistics of comparable silver producing companies and premia paid to
shareholders on acquisition transactions of comparable silver producing companies (the “Comparable Trading
with Control Premium Approach”). NBF considered multiples based on Price/NAV, Enterprise Value/Reserves,
Enterprise Value/Resources and share price to operating cash flow per share (“Price/Cash Flow”) for each of the
comparable companies. Estimated financial data for the selected comparable companies was based on publicly
available equity research analysts’ estimates and public disclosure by the selected companies. NBF also reviewed
equity research analysts’ reports and analysis on SilverCrest, with respect to, among other things, production,
cash costs, capital costs, cash flow, NAV and financial prospects. NBF applied a range of selected multiples to the
corresponding data of SilverCrest to develop an implied equity value and thereon applied a range of selected
premia based upon the reviewed acquisition transactions.
First Majestic Value Analyses
NBF also applied certain value analysis methodologies to First Majestic in order to analyse the value of the First
Majestic Shares to be received as part of the Consideration under the Arrangement. The primary methodology
used in this analysis was the review of public market trading statistics of comparable silver producing companies
(the “Comparable Trading Approach”) to First Majestic. Estimated financial data for the selected comparable
companies was based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates and public disclosure by the selected
companies. NBF also reviewed equity research analysts’ reports and analysis on First Majestic, with respect to,
among other things, production, cash costs, capital costs, cash flow, NAV and financial prospects. NBF applied a
range of selected multiples to the corresponding data of First Majestic.
NBF also evaluated and assessed the production and cash flow profile of First Majestic pro forma completion of the
Arrangement with SilverCrest (the “Pro Forma Analysis”). These considerations were assessed utilizing financial
models prepared by NBF in consultation with SilverCrest and reviewed by SilverCrest. The Pro Forma Analysis was
based on several metal price forecasts including research analyst consensus estimates and the spot price. In
addition, the Pro Forma Analysis took into consideration scenario analysis with respect to its projections of First
Majestic’s five mining operations that were the subject of the modeling analysis undertaken.
In Addition, NBF reviewed and summarized the trading liquidity of First Majestic, as well as SilverCrest including
each Company’s trading on the TSX and New York Stock Exchange. It was determined that First Majestic’s
common shares have significantly more trading liquidity than SilverCrest’s common shares based on total volume
of shares traded, as well as total value of shares traded.
I-8
Fairness Considerations
The assessment of fairness of the Consideration (excluding the value of the New SilverCrest Shares), from a
financial point of view, must be determined in the context of the particular transaction. NBF based its conclusion in
the Opinion upon a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including, but not limited to:
a)
the fact that the Exchange Ratio implies an offer price of $1.30 per SilverCrest Share based on the TSX closing price per
First Majestic Shares of $4.68 on July 24, 2015, representing a premium of 35% to the TSX closing price of $0.96 per
SilverCrest Share and a premium of approximately 37% based on the 30-day VWAP of the First Majestic Shares and
SilverCrest Shares on the TSX ended July 24, 2015;
b) the Consideration compares favourably with our analyses using the NAV Approach;
c)the Consideration compares favourably with our analyses using the Precedent Transactions Approach;
d)
the Consideration compares favourably with our analyses using the Comparable Trading with Control Premium
Approach;
e) the Arrangement being expected to provide SilverCrest Shareholders with greater liquidity;
a review of the impact of the Transaction on First Majestic’s cash position, asset diversification, geopolitical risk profile,
f)
operating profile, growth outlook and relative positioning versus peers; and
g)other factors or analyses, which we have judged, based on our experience in rendering such opinions, to be relevant.
Conclusion
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion, as of the date hereof, that the Consideration to be
received by the SilverCrest Shareholders pursuant to the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
SilverCrest Shareholders (other than First Majestic and its affiliates).
Yours very truly,
National Bank Financial Inc.

Dear Sirs,
Cormark Securities Inc. (“Cormark”) understands that First Majestic Silver Corp. (“First Majestic” or the
“Company”) and SilverCrest Mines Inc. (“SilverCrest”) intend to enter into a definitive arrangement agreement (the
“Arrangement Agreement”) pursuant to which First Majestic has agreed to acquire all of the issued and
outstanding common shares of SilverCrest for consideration of 0.2769 of a common share of First Majestic (the
"Exchange Ratio") plus C$0.0001 in cash per SilverCrest common share. The Exchange Ratio implies a value of
C$1.30 per SilverCrest share based on the closing price of First Majestic's common shares on the Toronto Stock
Exchange ("TSX") on July 24, 2015. The offer represents a premium of approximately 37% to SilverCrest's 30-day
volume-weighted average price ("VWAP") on the TSX for the period ending July 24, 2015 and a 35% premium to
SilverCrest's previous closing price. The transaction will be implemented by way of a plan of arrangement (the
"Arrangement") under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). In addition, shareholders of SilverCrest
will receive shares in a newly formed company ("New SilverCrest") which will hold certain exploration assets
currently held by SilverCrest and First Majestic. The specific terms and conditions of, and other matters relating to,
the Arrangement will be outlined in a joint information circular of First Majestic and SilverCrest to be mailed to
shareholders of First Majestic and SilverCrest (the “Circular”).
Cormark has been retained by the Company to prepare and deliver an opinion as to the fairness of the
Arrangement, from a financial point of view, to First Majestic (the “Fairness Opinion”). For the purposes of the
Fairness Opinion, Cormark has assumed that the transaction will be completed in accordance with Multilateral
Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions, having regard to all of the
elements of the transaction, including, receiving the majority of the minority votes if necessary.

ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS
Cormark has not been asked to prepare and has not prepared a formal valuation of the Company, SilverCrest or
any of their respective securities or assets, and the Fairness Opinion should not be construed as such. Cormark
has, however, conducted such analyses as it considered necessary in the circumstances. In addition, the Fairness
Opinion is not, and should not be construed as, advice as to the price at which the First Majestic or SilverCrest
shares may trade at any future date. Cormark similarly was not engaged to review any legal, tax or accounting
aspects of the Arrangement. Cormark has relied upon, without independent verification or investigation, the
assessment by the Company and its legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors with respect to legal, tax,
regulatory and accounting matters. In addition, the Fairness Opinion does not address the relative merits of the
Arrangement as compared to any other transaction involving the Company, the prospects or likelihood of any
alternative transaction or any other possible transaction involving the Company, its assets or its securities.
J-4
With the approval of the board of directors (the “Board”) and as is provided for in the Engagement Letter, Cormark
has relied upon the completeness, accuracy and fair presentation of all of the financial and other information, data,
advice, opinions and representations obtained by it from public sources or provided to it by or on behalf of the
Company and its directors, officers, agents and advisors or otherwise (collectively, the “Information”) and Cormark
has assumed that this Information does not omit any material fact or any fact necessary to be stated to make that
Information not misleading. The Fairness Opinion is conditional upon the completeness, accuracy and fair
presentation of such Information including the absence of any undisclosed material change. Subject to the
exercise of professional judgment and except as expressly described herein, Cormark has not attempted to
independently verify or investigate the completeness, accuracy or fair presentation of any of the Information.
With respect to financial and operating forecasts, projections, estimates and/or budgets provided to Cormark and
used in the analyses supporting the Fairness Opinion, Cormark has noted that projecting future results of any
company is inherently subject to uncertainty. Cormark has assumed that such forecasts, projections, estimates
and/or budgets were reasonably prepared consistent with industry practice on a basis reflecting the best currently
available assumptions, estimates and judgments of management of the Company as to the future financial
performance of First Majestic and SilverCrest and are (or were at the time and continue to be) reasonable in the
circumstances. In rendering the Fairness Opinion, Cormark expresses no view as to the reasonableness of such
forecasts, projections, estimates and/or budgets or the assumptions on which they are based.
Senior officers of the Company have represented to Cormark in a certificate delivered as of the date hereof, among
other things, that: (a) the Information provided by, or on behalf, of the Company or any of its affiliates or its
representatives and agents to Cormark for the purpose of preparing the Fairness Opinion was, at the date such
information was provided to Cormark, and is now, complete, true and correct in all material respects, and did not
and does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact in respect of the Company and its affiliates or the
Arrangement and did not and does not omit a material fact in relation to the Company and its affiliates or the
Arrangement necessary to make the Information not misleading in light of the circumstances under which it was
provided; (b) since the dates on which the Information was provided to Cormark, there has been no material
change, financial or otherwise, in the financial condition, assets, liabilities (contingent or otherwise), business,
operations or prospects of the Company and its affiliates and no material change has occurred in the Information
or any part thereof which would have or which would reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the
Fairness Opinion; (c) to the best of the Company’s knowledge, information and belief after due inquiry, there are no
independent appraisals or valuations or material non-independent appraisals or valuations relating to the
Company or any of its affiliates or any of their respective material assets or liabilities which have been prepared as
of a date within the two years preceding the date hereof and which have not been provided to Cormark; and (d)
since the dates on which the Information was provided to Cormark by the Company, no material transaction has
been entered into by the Company or any of its affiliates which has not been disclosed in complete detail to
Cormark.
This Fairness Opinion is rendered on the basis of securities markets, economic, financial and general business
conditions prevailing as at the date hereof and the condition and prospects, financial and otherwise, of the
Company and its affiliates, as they were reflected in the Information and as they have been represented to Cormark
in discussions with management of the Company. In its analyses and in preparing the Fairness Opinion, Cormark
has made certain assumptions with respect to expected industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, most of which are beyond the control of Cormark or any party involved in the
Arrangement. Cormark believes these assumptions are reasonable under the current circumstances; however,
actual future results may demonstrate that certain assumptions were incorrect.
In preparing the Fairness Opinion, Cormark has also assumed that the disclosure provided or incorporated by
reference in the Circular and any other documents prepared in connection with the Arrangement will be accurate in
all material respects and will comply with the requirements of all applicable laws, that all of the conditions required
to implement the Arrangement will be met, that the procedures being followed to implement the Arrangement are
valid and effective, and that the Circular will be distributed to First Majestic and SilverCrest shareholders in
accordance with applicable laws.
J-5
The Fairness Opinion has been prepared for the exclusive use of the Board in connection with the Arrangement.
The Fairness Opinion may not be used by any person or relied upon by any other person and may not be used or
relied upon by the Board for any purpose other than the purpose hereinbefore stated, without the express prior
written consent of Cormark. Except as contemplated herein, the Fairness Opinion is not to be reproduced,
disseminated, quoted from or referred to (in whole or in part) without our prior written consent. Cormark hereby
consents to the reference to Cormark and the description of, reference to and reproduction of the Fairness Opinion
in the Circular prepared in connection with the Arrangement for delivery to First Majestic and SilverCrest
shareholders and filing with the securities commissions or similar regulatory authorities in each province and
territory of Canada.
Cormark believes that the Fairness Opinion must be considered and reviewed as a whole and that selecting
portions of the stated analyses or factors considered by Cormark, without considering all the stated analyses and
factors together, could create a misleading view of the process underlying, or the scope of the Fairness Opinion.
The preparation of a fairness opinion of this nature is a complex process and is not necessarily amenable to partial
analysis or summary description. Any attempt to do so could lead to undue emphasis on any particular factor or
analysis. The Fairness Opinion is not to be construed as a recommendation to any First Majestic shareholder as to
whether or not to vote in favour of the Arrangement.
The Fairness Opinion is given as of the date hereof and Cormark disclaims any undertaking or obligation to advise
any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting the Fairness Opinion which may come or be brought to
Cormark’s attention after the date hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event that there is any material
change in any fact or matter affecting the Fairness Opinion after the date hereof, Cormark reserves the right to
change, modify or withdraw the Fairness Opinion.
The Fairness Opinion has been prepared in accordance with the Disclosure Standards for Fairness Opinions of the
Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (“IIROC”), but IIROC has not been involved in the
preparation or review of the Fairness Opinion.
FAIRNESS OPINION
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, Cormark is of the opinion that, as at of the date hereof, the Arrangement
is fair, from a financial point of view, to First Majestic.

DISSENT PROVISIONS UNDER THE BCBCA
Division 2 – Dissent Proceedings
Definitions and application
237 (1)In this Division:
“dissenter” means a shareholder who, being entitled to do so, sends written notice of dissent when and as required
by section 242;
“notice shares” means, in relation to a notice of dissent, the shares in respect of which dissent is being exercised
under the notice of dissent; and
“payout value” means, (a) in the case of a dissent in respect of a resolution, the fair value that the notice shares had
immediately before the passing of the resolution, (b) in the case of a dissent in respect of an arrangement approved
by a court order made under section 291(2)(c) that permits dissent, the fair value that the notice shares had
immediately before the passing of the resolution adopting the arrangement, or (c) in the case of a dissent in respect
of a matter approved or authorized by any other court order that permits dissent, the fair value that the notice
shares had at the time specified by the court order, excluding any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the
corporate action approved or authorized by the resolution or court order unless exclusion would be inequitable.
(2)           This Division applies to any right of dissent exercisable by a shareholder except to the extent that (a) the
court orders otherwise, or (b) in the case of a right of dissent authorized by a resolution referred to in section 238(1)
(g), the court orders otherwise or the resolution provides otherwise.
Right to dissent
238 (1)   A shareholder of a company, whether or not the shareholder’s shares carry the right to vote, is entitled to
dissent as follows:
(a)
under section 260, in respect of a resolution to alter the articles to alter restrictions on the powers of the company or on
the business it is permitted to carry on;
(b)under section 272, in respect of a resolution to adopt an amalgamation agreement;
(c) under section 287, in respect of a resolution to approve an amalgamation under Division 4 of Part 9;
(d) in respect of a resolution to approve an arrangement, the terms of which arrangement permit dissent;
(e)
under section 301(5), in respect of a resolution to authorize or ratify the sale, lease or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the company’s undertaking;
(f)
under section 309, in respect of a resolution to authorize the continuation of the company into a jurisdiction other than
British Columbia;
(g)in respect of any other resolution, if dissent is authorized by the resolution; or
(h)in respect of any court order that permits dissent.
(2)A shareholder wishing to dissent must:
(a)
prepare a separate notice of dissent under section 242 for (i) the shareholder, if the shareholder is dissenting on the
shareholder’s own behalf, and (ii) each other person who beneficially owns shares registered in the shareholder’s name
and on whose behalf the shareholder is dissenting;
(b)
identify in each notice of dissent, in accordance with section 242(4), the person on whose behalf dissent is being
exercised in that notice of dissent; and
M-1
(c)
dissent with respect to all of the shares, registered in the shareholder’s name, of which the person identified under
paragraph (b) of this subsection is the beneficial owner.
(3)
Without limiting subsection (2), a person who wishes to have dissent exercised with respect to shares of which the
person is the beneficial owner must
(a)
dissent with respect to all of the shares, if any, of which the person is both the registered owner and the beneficial owner,
and
(b)cause each shareholder who is a registered owner of any other shares of which the person is the beneficial owner to
dissent with respect to all of those shares.
Waiver of right to dissent
239 (1) A shareholder may not waive generally a right to dissent but may, in writing, waive the right to dissent with
respect to a particular corporate action.
(2)A shareholder wishing to waive a right of dissent with respect to a particular corporate action must
(a)
provide to the company a separate waiver for
(i) the shareholder, if the shareholder is providing a waiver on the shareholder’s own behalf, and
(ii)
each other person who beneficially owns shares registered in the shareholder’s name and on whose behalf the
shareholder is providing a waiver; and
(b)identify in each waiver the person on whose behalf the waiver is made.
(3)           If a shareholder waives a right of dissent with respect to a particular corporate action and indicates in the
waiver that the right to dissent is being waived on the shareholder’s own behalf, the shareholder’s right to dissent
with respect to the particular corporate action terminates in respect of the shares of which the shareholder is both
the registered owner and the beneficial owner, and this Division ceases to apply to
(a)
the shareholder in respect of the shares of which the shareholder is both the registered owner and the beneficial owner,
and
(b)
any other shareholders, who are registered owners of shares beneficially owned by the first mentioned shareholder, in
respect of the shares that are beneficially owned by the first mentioned shareholder.
(4)          If a shareholder waives a right of dissent with respect to a particular corporate action and indicates in the
waiver that the right to dissent is being waived on behalf of a specified person who beneficially owns shares
registered in the name of the shareholder, the right of shareholders who are registered owners of shares
beneficially owned by that specified person to dissent on behalf of that specified person with respect to the
particular corporate action terminates and this Division ceases to apply to those shareholders in respect of the
shares that are beneficially owned by that specified person.
Notice of resolution

(a)a copy of the proposed resolution; and
(b)
a notice of the meeting that specifies the date of the meeting, and contains a statement advising of the right to send a
notice of dissent.
(2)          If a resolution in respect of which a shareholder is entitled to dissent is to be passed as a consent
resolution of shareholders or as a resolution of directors and the earliest date on which that resolution can be
passed is specified in the resolution or in the statement referred to in paragraph (b), the company may, at least
21 days before that specified date, send to each of its shareholders, whether or not their shares carry the right to
vote:
(a)a copy of the proposed resolution; and
M-2
(b)a statement advising of the right to send a notice of dissent.
(3)           If a resolution in respect of which a shareholder is entitled to dissent was or is to be passed as a resolution
of shareholders without the company complying with subsection (1) or (2), or was or is to be passed as a directors’
resolution without the company complying with subsection (2), the company must, before or within 14 days after
the passing of the resolution, send to each of its shareholders who has not, on behalf of every person who

of the resolution, whether or not their shares carry the right to vote:
