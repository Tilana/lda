<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council pursuant to resolution 
</p>
<p>25/6, in which the Council requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights (OHCHR) to prepare a report on the theme of towards better investment 
</p>
<p>in the rights of the child, in close collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including States, 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), other relevant United Nations bodies and 
</p>
<p>agencies, relevant special procedures mandate holders, regional organizations and human 
</p>
<p>rights bodies, civil society, non-governmental organizations, national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions and children themselves, and to present it to the Council at its twenty-eighth 
</p>
<p>session.  
</p>
<p>2. Contributions were received from States, national human rights institutions and non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations.1  
</p>
<p><b> II. Investment in children: overview 
</b></p>
<p>3. A lack of sufficient, effective, inclusive and efficient public spending on children is 
</p>
<p>one of the main barriers to the realization of the rights of the child. Relevant policy and 
</p>
<p>legislative commitments remain empty promises unless Governments generate and 
</p>
<p>equitably allocate adequate resources for their implementation in their local and national 
</p>
<p>budgets, and ensure effective and efficient use of resources. 
</p>
<p>4. Equitable, continuous and broad-based investment in children can level the playing 
</p>
<p>field by providing every child with the same opportunities for survival and development.2 
</p>
<p>Inadequate investment, especially in the most vulnerable and marginalized, can perpetuate 
</p>
<p>the intergenerational transmission of poverty and inequality, leading to irreversible negative 
</p>
<p>impact on children&#8217;s development.3  
</p>
<p>5. Research shows that investment in children accrues considerable returns. It 
</p>
<p>generates short-term positive benefits and cumulative long-term gains, delivering benefits 
</p>
<p>not only to the individuals themselves but also to society and the economy at large; for 
</p>
<p>example, improving equity in health outcomes has been found to contribute directly to 
</p>
<p>economic growth.4 It has been estimated that achieving the Millennium Development Goal 
</p>
<p>targets on water and sanitation could yield a total annual economic benefit of $84 billion.5 
</p>
<p>Investment in pre-school enrolment has been found not only to benefit individual children, 
</p>
<p>for example in terms of higher future wages, but also to have public benefits in terms of 
</p>
<p>enhanced welfare, crime savings and tax revenues.6 Investment in quality, equitable

<p>education benefits individuals, communities and countries: it saves lives, improves 
</p>
<p>nutrition, reduces child, early and forced marriage, and leads to more equal, respectful and 
</p>
<p>open societies.7 
</p>
<p>6. Regardless of how profitable these returns are, investment in children must be 
</p>
<p>viewed through the lens of the rights of the child rather than be driven by any development 
</p>
<p>benefit. The goal must be investment in the rights of children, in addition to investment in 
</p>
<p>children. As the General Assembly emphasized in the annex to its resolution S-27/2 entitled 
</p>
<p>&#8220;A world fit for children&#8221;, investing in the rights of children lays the foundation for a just 
</p>
<p>society, a strong economy and a world free of poverty. 
</p>
<p><b> III. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Convention on the Rights of the Child places an obligation on all States parties, 
</p>
<p>including the international community, to mobilize and allocate resources in order to invest 
</p>
<p>in children. It recognizes that it is only through government budgets that services to 
</p>
<p>children, such as health, education, and social protection, are delivered and children&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>realized. 
</p>
<p>8. According to article 4 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, States parties 
</p>
<p>are required to undertake all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures for 
</p>
<p>the implementation of the rights recognized in the Convention. Whatever their economic 
</p>
<p>circumstances, therefore, States parties must take all possible measures towards the 
</p>
<p>realization of the rights of the child.8<b> </b>Article 4 also recognizes that social, economic and 
</p>
<p>cultural rights can be particularly resource intensive; in relation to such rights, States parties 
</p>
<p>must therefore take such measures to the maximum extent of their available resources and, 
</p>
<p>where needed, within the framework of international cooperation.  
</p>
<p>9. Two important points must be made in this regard. First, article 4 of the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of the Child does not relieve States parties of the obligation to realize the civil 
</p>
<p>and political rights of children immediately.<b> </b>This includes, for example, the right to birth 
</p>
<p>registration (art. 7), the right not to be separated from parents (art. 9), the right to 
</p>
<p>participation (art. 12) and the right to protection from violence (art. 19), which all have 
</p>
<p>resource implications: implementation of these rights requires legal frameworks, capable 
</p>
<p>and appropriately resourced institutions and mechanisms to support children whose rights 
</p>
<p>are violated. Resources must immediately be allocated to making such rights a reality, 
</p>
<p>regardless of the economic situation of the country. 
</p>
<p>10. Second, while recognizing that the social, economic and cultural rights of children 
</p>
<p>may not be able to be immediately realized by all States parties, article 4 imposes specific, 
</p>
<p>measurable, obligations on them by requiring that the &#8220;maximum extent of their available 
</p>
<p>resources&#8221; be focused on achieving these rights. This does not imply that poorer countries 
</p>
<p>may avoid their responsibilities; rather, it should be understood as a call for the 
</p>
<p>prioritization of children within the State budget to ensure appropriate levels of service 
</p>
<p>delivery.9 States parties that claim resource constraints must prove that every effort has 
</p>
<p>been made to move towards the full enjoyment of these rights as a matter of priority, and

<p>that they are truly unable, rather than unwilling, to meet these obligations.10 Moreover, the 
</p>
<p>Convention imposes an immediate obligation on States parties to take targeted measures to 
</p>
<p>move as expeditiously and effectively as possible towards the full realization of economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights.11 In its general comment No. 15, the Committee on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>the Child emphasized the importance of assessment tools in the use of resources and the 
</p>
<p>need to develop measurable indicators to monitor and evaluate progress in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of such rights.12 
</p>
<p>11. In 2007, the Committee on the Rights of the Child dedicated its day of general 
</p>
<p>discussion to the theme &#8220;Resources for the rights of the child: responsibility of States&#8221; to 
</p>
<p>foster a deeper understanding of the contents and implications of the Convention in relation 
</p>
<p>to investment in children. The Committee noted the concept of &#8220;minimum core obligations&#8221; 
</p>
<p>of States, which are intended to ensure, at the very least, the minimum conditions under 
</p>
<p>which one can live in dignity. All States parties, regardless of their level of development, 
</p>
<p>are required to take immediate action to implement these obligations as a matter of priority. 
</p>
<p>12. The obligation to progressively realize economic, social and cultural rights entails 
</p>
<p>the prohibition of retrogression without strong justification. States parties must avoid 
</p>
<p>measures that directly or indirectly lead to steps backward in the enjoyment of rights, 
</p>
<p>except where this is fully justified by reference to the totality of children&#8217;s rights and in the 
</p>
<p>context of the full use of maximum available resources.13<b> </b>In times of financial austerity, any 
</p>
<p>proposed policy change or adjustment must be temporary, covering only the period of 
</p>
<p>crisis; proportionate, in that the adoption of any other policy or a failure to act would be 
</p>
<p>more detrimental to children&#8217;s rights; and non-discriminatory, and comprise all possible 
</p>
<p>measures to support social transfers and mitigate inequalities that can grow in times of 
</p>
<p>crisis; and ensure that the rights of the disadvantaged and marginalized individuals and 
</p>
<p>groups are not disproportionately affected.14  
</p>
<p>13. In all matters concerning the rights of the child, States parties must uphold the 
</p>
<p>human rights principles and standards of universality, indivisibility, accountability, 
</p>
<p>transparency and the rule of law, as well as taking into account the importance of 
</p>
<p>intergenerational justice. Furthermore, all rights under the Convention on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child, including article 4, must be in full conformity with the general principles of the 
</p>
<p>Convention, namely non-discrimination, the best interests of the child, the right to life, 
</p>
<p>survival and development and the right of the child to express his or her views. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to equality and non-discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>14. Pursuant to article 2 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in developing 
</p>
<p>fiscal policy instruments, including taxation and public budgets, States parties to the 
</p>
<p>Convention must ensure equal opportunities for the realization of rights for all children 
</p>
<p>without discrimination of any kind. In particular, States should foster sustainable and 
</p>
<p>inclusive economic development so that the benefits are reflected in all segments of society. 
</p>
<p>While global progress has been made on many fronts as a result of the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals, these achievements mask huge disparities between rich and poor,

<p>urban and rural, and different ethnic groups and genders. Today, more than 70 per cent of 
</p>
<p>the world&#8217;s poorest people, including children, live in middle-income countries, but they 
</p>
<p>have not necessarily benefited from the increase in national income. Indeed, recent research 
</p>
<p>suggests that inequality is twice as high among children as the general population. 15  
</p>
<p>15. It is the responsibility of Governments to analyse and take into account the diversity 
</p>
<p>and varying vulnerabilities of children in all parts of their territory, and design and 
</p>
<p>implement responsive programmes and budgets. States parties must mobilize and allocate 
</p>
<p>resources to improve the situation of marginalized and vulnerable groups of children.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Best interests of the child  
</b></p>
<p>16. Children&#8217;s rights, and those of future generations, must be a primary consideration 
</p>
<p>in the planning and execution of all fiscal policies and budget decisions. A rights-based 
</p>
<p>approach must underpin the mobilization, allocation and spending of public resource, and 
</p>
<p>human rights should be at the heart of all decisions. Child rights impact assessments and 
</p>
<p>evaluations must be conducted so that the likely impact of decisions on children&#8217;s rights is 
</p>
<p>understood and how far the best interests of the child has been taken into account during 
</p>
<p>decision-making. 
</p>
<p>17. In particular, where resources are limited, children&#8217;s rights should be prioritized in 
</p>
<p>budgetary allocations, and resources for the implementation of children&#8217;s rights should be 
</p>
<p>the last to be cut in times of economic austerity. Within this allocation, preference should 
</p>
<p>be given to funds directed towards the most marginalized and vulnerable groups of children 
</p>
<p>and families. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to survival and development  
</b></p>
<p>18. States have an obligation to prioritize budget allocations and the effective use of 
</p>
<p>resources for interventions with a direct incidence on child survival and development. 
</p>
<p>Essential interventions to enhance child survival include services for pregnant mothers and 
</p>
<p>during childbirth, mother and child health-care services, nutrition enhancement measures 
</p>
<p>and access to clean water, particularly in the early stages of the child&#8217;s life.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>19. States must also collect and report regularly on indicators of child survival and on 
</p>
<p>the resources they are allocating to accelerate the reduction in child mortality, as well as 
</p>
<p>additional resource allocations they progressively invest to expand opportunities for child 
</p>
<p>development. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Right to participation  
</b></p>
<p>20. A child rights-based approach recognizes that children are not only beneficiaries of 
</p>
<p>government programmes but also must be active participants in policy and budgetary 
</p>
<p>processes. Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child enshrines the right of 
</p>
<p>children to form an opinion and participate in issues that affect them, and give due weight 
</p>
<p>to their opinions. As the Committee on the Rights of the Child clarified in its general 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 15  Save the Children, <i>Born Equal: How reducing inequality could give our children a better future</i>, 
</p>
<p>(London, 2012), p. vi. </p>


<p>comment No. 5, appearing to &#8220;listen&#8221; to children is relatively unchallenging; giving due 
</p>
<p>weight to their views is what requires real change.16 
</p>
<p>21. In 2014, a non-governmental organization, Save the Children, undertook 
</p>
<p>consultations with children on their views on investment in children. Involvement in the 
</p>
<p>budgeting process was a key issue of concern for the majority of children, who explained 
</p>
<p>that they were well-positioned to advise Governments because they understood the impact 
</p>
<p>of this spending on their lives. They believed that all levels of government, including those 
</p>
<p>at the local, regional and national levels, should include the views of children from diverse 
</p>
<p>ages and backgrounds in their decision-making. 
</p>
<p>22. The right of children to participation should be enshrined in law and be present 
</p>
<p>throughout the entire budgeting process, with all parts of government. Children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>participation in budget setting, spending and monitoring should be meaningful and ensure 
</p>
<p>that they are consulted and informed throughout the entire budgeting process, and their 
</p>
<p>voices are heard and taken into account on an equal basis with those of adults. This should 
</p>
<p>be formalized at all levels, from national to community level. To facilitate children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>participation, States need to ensure that child-friendly, age-appropriate and safe processes 
</p>
<p>and mechanisms are in place where children can articulate their views and 
</p>
<p>recommendations. Save the Children found that children themselves emphasized that 
</p>
<p>facilitators should ensure that children are not coerced or manipulated but give their views 
</p>
<p>voluntarily, and that consultations are conducted at a time and in a location that is 
</p>
<p>appropriate for children. 
</p>
<p>23. The participation of children requires the entire budgeting process to be open, 
</p>
<p>transparent and accountable, and that adequate information be provided in a child-friendly 
</p>
<p>manner. Fiscal and policy information must be published in a format that is easy to 
</p>
<p>understand and sufficiently disaggregated to enable children and other stakeholders to 
</p>
<p>identify and track budget line items intended to benefit children. Listening to children is 
</p>
<p>both an end in itself and a way in which States can ensure that actions on behalf of children 
</p>
<p>are sensitive to the implementation of children&#8217;s rights.17  
</p>
<p><b> IV. </b>Generating revenue for the realization of children&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>24. An essential part of improving investment in children&#8217;s rights is strengthening 
</p>
<p>revenue-raising through a human rights-based approach. Efficient, effective and 
</p>
<p>accountable mechanisms for mobilizing and equitably using existing public resources 
</p>
<p>should be established. The requirement in article 4 of the Convention on the Rights of the 
</p>
<p>Child to take measures &#8220;to the maximum extent of available resources&#8221; requires that actual 
</p>
<p>current resources and potentially available ones be taken into account to determine the 
</p>
<p>State&#8217;s efforts to mobilize resources. At its annual day of discussion in 2007, the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Rights of the Child concluded that resources must be understood in both 
</p>
<p>qualitative and quantitative terms: they include technological, economic, human, natural 
</p>
<p>and organizational resources, as well as financial resources. 
</p>
<p>25. States must take tangible measures to mobilize domestic resources in order to realize 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights under the Convention fully. Such measures include tax collection, 
</p>
<p>responsible borrowing and ensuring an enabling environment for inclusive national growth 
</p>
<p>and productivity, as well as attracting international investment and international financial 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 16  CRC/GC/2003/5. 
</p>
<p> 17  CRC/GC/2003/5. </p>


<p>and technical cooperation and assistance in a way that promotes the realization of children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights. 
</p>
<p>26. Taxation is the most sustainable and predictable source of financing for the 
</p>
<p>provision of goods and services, allowing for long-term, sustainable strengthening of 
</p>
<p>systems.18 The more a State can rely on domestic rather than external resource mobilization 
</p>
<p>for its financing, the more it will be able to sustain implementation of its development 
</p>
<p>strategies and policies that are responsive to the needs of its people and accountable to 
</p>
<p>them.19 
</p>
<p>27. States need to make their best efforts to expand tax revenue collection by, for 
</p>
<p>example, broadening the tax base, closing tax loopholes and promoting international 
</p>
<p>cooperation to avoid tax evasion, as well as by enhancing equity in revenue collection, 
</p>
<p>including by actively pursuing technical assistance to strengthen public administration 
</p>
<p>capacity in this area. Strong tax policies must be accompanied by the administrative and 
</p>
<p>institutional capacity to collect taxes fairly and efficiently.18 
</p>
<p>28. The level of income generated and the process through which income is generated 
</p>
<p>have an impact on the realization of children&#8217;s rights. Revenue collection is a critical tool in 
</p>
<p>tackling and redressing systemic discrimination; States should set up a progressive taxation 
</p>
<p>system with real redistributive capacity that preserves, and progressively increases, the 
</p>
<p>income of poorer households.
 20  
</p>
<p>29. In addition, Governments have the responsibility of ensuring that tax policy does not 
</p>
<p>perpetuate inequality or worsen the situation of poor families. Taxation schemes as a whole 
</p>
<p>should not be regressive, and any taxes with a regressive effect must be avoided or their 
</p>
<p>impact mitigated. Actions or omissions by the State must not discriminate, either directly or 
</p>
<p>indirectly, against any individual or group, or perpetuate inequality. According to the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, in order to redress structural 
</p>
<p>inequalities, States should evaluate the differential impact of existing and proposed fiscal 
</p>
<p>policies on different groups, in particular those who suffer from structural discrimination.21
 
</p>
<p>Periodic child impact assessments of fiscal and tax policies may assist Governments to 
</p>
<p>ensure that they do not undermine the progressive realization of children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>30. Ineffective taxation systems can limit the resources available for the fulfilment of 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights. States should therefore develop and implement effective laws and 
</p>
<p>regulations to obtain and manage revenue flows from all sources, ensuring transparency, 
</p>
<p>accountability and equity.

</p>
<p> According to estimates, international crime, corruption, and tax 
</p>
<p>evasion cost the developing world $946.7 billion in 2011.
23
</p>
<p> Globally, illicit outflows 
</p>
<p>represent as much as 4 per cent in lost GDP;18 it is furthermore assumed that developing 
</p>
<p>countries lose more income owing to the existence of international tax havens, illegal 
</p>
<p>capital flight and lack of transparency in the international economy than the amount they 
</p>
<p>receive in foreign aid.
24 
</p>
<p>A State that does not take strong measures to tackle tax abuse and 
</p>
<p>illicit financial flows cannot be said to be devoting the maximum available resources to the 
</p>
<p>realization of economic, social and cultural rights.25

<p><b> V. Child rights-based budgeting and spending 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Budget preparation and formulation 
</b></p>
<p>31. Economic policies are never neutral in their effect on children&#8217;s rights,26 and it is 
</p>
<p>important that, in preparing a national, regional or local budget, government officials are 
</p>
<p>fully aware of the potential impact of their decision-making on children. Officials must take 
</p>
<p>a life-cycle approach to budgeting for children, taking into account their evolving needs at 
</p>
<p>different ages to ensure that public spending for children is relevant and appropriate for 
</p>
<p>children of each age category. By using a child rights lens and a life-cycle approach, States 
</p>
<p>can better ensure that public investments made today will create long-lasting impact on 
</p>
<p>future growth, sustainable development and social cohesion.. 
</p>
<p>32. At the planning stage, officials must not only estimate projected expenditure but also 
</p>
<p>advise policy makers on the feasibility and desirability of specific budget proposals from a 
</p>
<p>macroeconomic and microeconomic perspective. Such advice, and the decisions made as a 
</p>
<p>result, must be based on empirical evidence. For this reason, in order to implement a rights-
</p>
<p>based approach to public budgeting that adequately benefits children successfully, it is 
</p>
<p>necessary that timely, comprehensive and disaggregated data be collected to inform 
</p>
<p>resource planning, allocation and spending. Such data will help Governments to ensure that 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s issues feature prominently in national and sector development strategies and that 
</p>
<p>budget decisions are responsive to all children while balancing their interests with those of 
</p>
<p>other marginalized population groups. 
</p>
<p>33. Budget preparation must be comprehensive, transparent, participatory and realistic. 
</p>
<p>Where possible, an annual budget should be prepared with a multi-year perspective so that 
</p>
<p>service providers for children are able to engage in long-term planning to ensure continued 
</p>
<p>service provision for them and other marginalized groups. When considering budget 
</p>
<p>proposals, officials should have available a review of the expenditure execution of the 
</p>
<p>previous yearly budgets and the impact that this has had on children and other marginalized 
</p>
<p>groups. Governments should provide specific, time-bound indicators in the budget with 
</p>
<p>regard to the progress that they are hoping to make, to ensure that programmes are being 
</p>
<p>assessed and managed effectively, and are achieving their desired aim.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Budget enactment and the allocation of resources 
</b></p>
<p>34. When enacting a budget, States must ensure that the achievement of children&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>is a primary consideration, and that children are prioritized in resource allocation. This 
</p>
<p>prioritization should not, however, have an adverse impact on the rights and interests of 
</p>
<p>others groups of people, particularly those who are marginalized. Although resource 
</p>
<p>allocation and deciding which policies and programmes to fund are political decisions, 
</p>
<p>States should at all times take into consideration their obligations relating to children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights, the principles of non-discrimination, the best interests of children, child survival and 
</p>
<p>development, and child participation. 
</p>
<p>35. A detailed budget helps different stakeholders to see how much a Government 
</p>
<p>allocates to budget line items that have a direct impact on children, such as education, 
</p>
<p>health, civil registration and vital statistics, child protection and the running of the general 
</p>
<p>child rights infrastructure, such as children&#8217;s ombudspersons. No Government can claim to 
</p>
<p>be fulfilling children&#8217;s rights to the maximum extent of its available resources unless it is 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 26  CRC/GC/2003/5, para. 52. </p>


<p>able to identify the proportion of its budgets allocated to children, both directly and 
</p>
<p>indirectly.27 This does not imply that there should be a separate budget for children, but 
</p>
<p>rather that budgets should be presented in such a way that specific allocations to children 
</p>
<p>can be identified. 
</p>
<p>36. Each government department should incorporate children&#8217;s issues into their 
</p>
<p>respective portfolios, and reflect their commitment to children&#8217;s rights through 
</p>
<p>corresponding policy orientation and budgetary allocation.28 There is a need for continuity 
</p>
<p>and coordination between different ministries and at the different levels of government. In 
</p>
<p>many States, essential services for children are provided at a local rather than a federal 
</p>
<p>level, and States must ensure that devolved authorities have the necessary financial, human 
</p>
<p>and other resources to discharge their responsibilities effectively. States should establish 
</p>
<p>safeguards to ensure that decentralization or devolution does not lead to discrimination in 
</p>
<p>the enjoyment of rights by children in different regions. 29 Where powers are delegated, 
</p>
<p>States should ensure that officials at lower levels of government are aware of children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights and how these must be taken into account in fiscal decision-making.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Budget execution: implementation and spending 
</b></p>
<p>37. While adjustments in budgets are often necessary, large discrepancies might indicate 
</p>
<p>that the budget was unrealistic and not based on systematic assessment; that funds have 
</p>
<p>been directed away from the programmes for which they were intended; that implementing 
</p>
<p>agencies have failed to reach the beneficiaries targeted; or that there are significant 
</p>
<p>administrative or treasury problems affecting budget execution. The actual expenditure of a 
</p>
<p>budget is an indicator of the fulfilment of its commitment, as laid out in its budget 
</p>
<p>allocation. 
</p>
<p>38. In the process of public spending, States should ensure that all children, and in 
</p>
<p>particular those who are most vulnerable and marginalized, are reached. Wherever possible 
</p>
<p>during in-year spending and in delivery of public services, children and other community 
</p>
<p>members should be engaged to ensure the participation, ownership, accountability and 
</p>
<p>sustainability of interventions. To facilitate community engagement, spending information 
</p>
<p>should be made public available in a timely manner, and public accountability and 
</p>
<p>oversight mechanisms, feedback and complaint processes should be put in place to allow 
</p>
<p>for more effective citizen engagement and to strengthen transparency and accountability. 
</p>
<p>All officials should be appropriately trained on how to respect, protect and fulfil children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights. 
</p>
<p>39. Child-sensitive budget planning, monitoring and expenditure tracking is important to 
</p>
<p>allow for an assessment of whether the amounts allocated are used for their intended 
</p>
<p>purpose. A robust budget classification system that allows the tracking of spending along 
</p>
<p>administrative, economic, functional, and programmatic lines is important. States are 
</p>
<p>encouraged to use appropriate tools, such as a public expenditure tracking survey that can 
</p>
<p>examine the manner, quality and timing of expenditures. This would also help to identify 
</p>
<p>problems in service delivery such as delays, leakages, discrimination and bureaucratic 
</p>
<p>bottlenecks that may result in ineffective or inefficient public spending on children.  
</p>
<p>Children should be included in this budget analysis and expenditure monitoring to

<p>understand and shape national and subnational budget plans, and monitor expenditure to 
</p>
<p>track its correlation with the plans made. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Accountability: monitoring, evaluation and audit 
</b></p>
<p>40. To ensure that budgeted resources reach children on time, Governments should 
</p>
<p>strengthen their public finance management systems and ensure accountability for public 
</p>
<p>resources. Such systems should ensure not only that the money has been spent in the 
</p>
<p>intended manner, but also that it has been used efficiently and effectively to achieve its aim. 
</p>
<p>Corruption and mismanagement deprive children of the right to have access to services 
</p>
<p>essential for their survival and development and, broadly, the enjoyment of their rights. 
</p>
<p>Effective remedies should be put in place to address the mismanagement of public funds. 
</p>
<p>Fighting corruption and reducing waste at all levels of public spending should be a priority 
</p>
<p>for States. 
</p>
<p>41. Financial oversight should be implemented through a variety of mechanisms, 
</p>
<p>including internal accountability through parliamentarians, government ministries and 
</p>
<p>ombudspersons; external bodies, such as independent human rights institutions; and citizen-
</p>
<p>led social accountability mechanisms, such as social audits, scorecards and participatory 
</p>
<p>budget monitoring involving student councils and children&#8217;s parliaments. A supreme audit 
</p>
<p>institution should be established as an independent body to scrutinize the use of public 
</p>
<p>funds. Governments should then submit timely annual accounts to the institution, and 
</p>
<p>engage in peer review mechanisms between and among Governments. International and 
</p>
<p>regional human rights mechanisms, such as the universal periodic review, the special 
</p>
<p>procedures and the treaty bodies can also hold States accountable for investment in 
</p>
<p>children.  
</p>
<p>42. Adequate budget planning and equitable allocation and spending require adequate 
</p>
<p>data and information and support systems. Governments should collect comprehensive 
</p>
<p>disaggregated data on children from civil registration, vital statistics and other relevant 
</p>
<p>sources that inform planning. Public financial management systems should ensure that 
</p>
<p>information on planned and spent budget on children and excluded and marginalized 
</p>
<p>groups is visible, easily extractable and interpretable. 
</p>
<p>43. Budget analysis and monitoring must be a sustained endeavour, showing 
</p>
<p>longitudinal results rather than simply a one-time project.30 The information that is 
</p>
<p>produced should be used as the basis for budget planning and formulation in the following 
</p>
<p>years. There should be a continued process of evaluation, considering outputs and 
</p>
<p>outcomes. Child rights-based indicators should be developed and used as benchmarks to 
</p>
<p>evaluate appropriately the effectiveness of programmes, and the public should be able to 
</p>
<p>see comparisons between estimated beneficiaries of interventions and actual outcomes. This 
</p>
<p>should be informed by empirically based statistical analysis and participatory mechanisms 
</p>
<p>allowing children, young people and adults to provide feedback and contribute to the 
</p>
<p>monitoring of service standards.  
</p>
<p>44. Child-sensitive participatory budget initiatives can benefit from linking children 
</p>
<p>with adult governance structures and public budget accountability mechanisms across all 
</p>
<p>levels, creating networks between and among citizens and civil, economic and political 
</p>
<p>society actors. A collaborative approach between duty-bearers and civil society actors &#8211;

</i></p>

<p>such as children&#8217;s clubs &#8211; can be a useful way to involve children in budgeting processes 
</p>
<p>and support State institutions in planning and exercising their own budgetary monitoring 
</p>
<p>functions.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Transparency and participation 
</b></p>
<p>45. Transparency at all stages of the budget cycle, including budget allocation and 
</p>
<p>spending, both internally and externally, is crucial to effective accountability. As the 
</p>
<p>Committee on the Rights of the Child emphasized during its day of general discussion in 
</p>
<p>2007, internal transparency requires that information on revenues and expenditures be 
</p>
<p>available to all governmental bodies conducting impact assessments on how major 
</p>
<p>spending decisions are likely to affect children&#8217;s rights. External transparency obliges the 
</p>
<p>Government to ensure that the budget is open and available to all stakeholders, including 
</p>
<p>civil society. All public resources (including contingency funds and earmarked resources) 
</p>
<p>and spending should be taken into account, including at all levels of government, so that a 
</p>
<p>broad overview of all available resources and use of funds for children can be achieved. 
</p>
<p>46. Budget documents should be available and accessible to the public in a timely 
</p>
<p>manner. A child-friendly citizen&#8217;s budget should be produced, with information sufficiently 
</p>
<p>disaggregated to enable children and other stakeholders to identify and track budget line 
</p>
<p>items intended to benefit children. States should act proactively to help children to 
</p>
<p>understand the budget and its implications for them. Information on budget allocations and 
</p>
<p>choices should be made available in a comprehensible, easy-to-understand and child-
</p>
<p>friendly manner, but also be linked to more detailed explanations to provide a simple access 
</p>
<p>point for those who want to know more.31  
</p>
<p>47. Not only is transparency vital for accountability; it also enables and enhances 
</p>
<p>participation. Without access to information, it is difficult for citizens to hold Governments 
</p>
<p>to account, and to participate in policy and budgetary processes. It is the responsibility of 
</p>
<p>Governments to create a supportive and enabling environment for the participation of all 
</p>
<p>citizens, including children, in accordance with article 12 of the Convention on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of the Child. To ensure the existence of a supportive environment, States must guarantee 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s civil rights and freedoms, including the rights to freedom of expression, 
</p>
<p>association and peaceful assembly, and ensure that the development of their citizenship 
</p>
<p>skills are guaranteed in practice, including through civic education and financial literacy 
</p>
<p>programmes. States should facilitate consultation with children, including those from 
</p>
<p>vulnerable groups, at every stage of the budgeting process. This is in line with States&#8217; 
</p>
<p>human right obligations, and creates the opportunity for feedback to learn and progressively 
</p>
<p>improve the design and implementation of the budget.  
</p>
<p>48. Governments should develop a direct relationship with children that goes beyond the 
</p>
<p>active advocacy role that civil society and human rights institutions play for and on behalf 
</p>
<p>of children.32 Consultations between children and executive bodies should be conducted at 
</p>
<p>the time of budget formulation; with parliamentarians, to empower them in their oversight 
</p>
<p>role of budgeting processes; and through the implementation stage, as a complement to 
</p>
<p>other internal and external accountability processes.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Child rights impact assessments and evaluations 
</b></p>
<p>49. In addition to strengthening their public finance management systems and ensuring 
</p>
<p>accountability for public resources, States must create mechanisms for systematic

<p>assessment of the impact of fiscal policies and budgets on the realization of children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights. The Committee on the Rights of the Child, in its general comment No. 5, called for 
</p>
<p>States to undertake ex-ante and ex-post child impact assessments and evaluations of budget 
</p>
<p>and fiscal processes so that the likely impact of decisions on children&#8217;s rights may be 
</p>
<p>understood and how far the best interests of the child has been a primary consideration in 
</p>
<p>decision-making. This should complement ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the 
</p>
<p>impact of laws, policies and programmes on children&#8217;s rights.33  
</p>
<p>50. States should undertake regular child rights impact assessments that assess the 
</p>
<p>impact of any proposed law, policy or budgetary allocation on children and the enjoyment 
</p>
<p>of their rights, and child impact evaluations, to assess the actual impact of 
</p>
<p>implementation.34 These assessments should be both static, to analyse individual budgets, 
</p>
<p>and dynamic, to compare the allocation of budgets over time and consider variations in 
</p>
<p>allocations and spending over different periods.35  
</p>
<p>51. Impact assessments and evaluations should consider the rights of all children 
</p>
<p>affected by a particular decision, and include consideration of the differential impact of 
</p>
<p>measures on certain categories of children who suffer from discrimination, marginalization 
</p>
<p>or exclusion. To guarantee an impartial and independent process, the State should consider 
</p>
<p>appointing an external actor to lead the assessment process; however, the State, as the party 
</p>
<p>ultimately responsible for the result, must ensure that the actor undertaking the assessment 
</p>
<p>is competent, honest and impartial.36 The analysis should result in recommendations for 
</p>
<p>amendments, alternatives and improvements and be publicly available.37  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Role of the private sector 
</b></p>
<p>52. While States have the primary responsibility to respect, protect and fulfil children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights, the private sector can also play an important role. It can promote the strengthening 
</p>
<p>and advancement of the realization of children&#8217;s rights: stimulate inclusive growth and 
</p>
<p>create decent jobs; enhance access to essential services; develop innovations to address 
</p>
<p>human and sustainable development challenges; apply expertise and resources to improve 
</p>
<p>the lives of those most in need; and reduce environmental footprints.38 However, the 
</p>
<p>realization of children&#8217;s rights is not an automatic consequence of economic growth. States 
</p>
<p>must ensure that the activities and operations of the private sector do not have an adverse 
</p>
<p>impact on their ability to realize the investment needed to implement children&#8217;s rights 
</p>
<p>fully.39  
</p>
<p>53. Illicit financial flows and tax evasion are critical barriers for States to the 
</p>
<p>mobilization of resources for the realization of children&#8217;s rights. The Taxation and Customs 
</p>
<p>Union of the European Union estimates that up to one trillion euros are lost to tax evasion 
</p>
<p>and tax avoidance in the European Union every year40 &#8211; money that could have been used to 
</p>
<p>provide essential services, including to fulfil the rights of children. States have a

<p>responsibility to ensure that non-State actors, including the private sector, respect children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>rights as set out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Global partnerships are 
</p>
<p>needed to tackle illicit financial flows and tax avoidance through international cooperation. 
</p>
<p>States should develop an international agreement on the multilateral automatic exchange of 
</p>
<p>tax information, commit to and implement a public register of beneficial ownership 
</p>
<p>information for companies and trusts, and require public country-by-country reporting for 
</p>
<p>multinational companies.41 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Obligations of international assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>54. The obligation under article 4 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to use all 
</p>
<p>available resources to implement children&#8217;s rights goes beyond those in the national 
</p>
<p>context, and extends to those available from the international community through 
</p>
<p>international assistance. Countries with resource constraints have the responsibility to seek 
</p>
<p>international cooperation and assistance to ensure the widest possible enjoyment of the 
</p>
<p>rights of the child. States should ensure that they have explored all opportunities to secure 
</p>
<p>access to funding and expertise through international cooperation, including official 
</p>
<p>development assistance, grants and technical assistance. Where States raise funds through 
</p>
<p>borrowing or loans, this should be achieved under the best financial terms possible, on the 
</p>
<p>basis of the principles of responsible borrowing, to ensure sustainable financing for 
</p>
<p>children. States should also ensure that they have rules and standards in place for 
</p>
<p>responsible lending and borrowing by any government entity at any level, and oversight 
</p>
<p>mechanisms for their enforcement. When signing international financial agreements, which 
</p>
<p>may include conditions relating to budget allocations, States must give due consideration to 
</p>
<p>the impact that the agreement may have on children, and protect critical expenditures for 
</p>
<p>them.  
</p>
<p>55. Conversely, the realization of children&#8217;s rights must be recognized as a shared 
</p>
<p>responsibility of developed and developing countries. When States ratify the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of the Child, they accept the obligation to implement its provisions within their 
</p>
<p>jurisdiction. They also accept to contribute, through international cooperation, to the global 
</p>
<p>implementation of the Convention, recognizing that some States will not be able to achieve 
</p>
<p>the full realization of economic, social and cultural rights unless other States in a position to 
</p>
<p>assist do so.42  
</p>
<p>56. Donors must take a child rights-based approach to the allocation and utilization of 
</p>
<p>official development assistance. When a State makes decisions about granting a loan, either 
</p>
<p>as an individual Government or as a member of an international financial institution, it 
</p>
<p>should consider its human rights obligations when imposing conditions on fiscal policies so 
</p>
<p>they do not jeopardize the rights of children in the recipient State or undermine that State&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>ability to use maximum available resources to realize economic, social and cultural rights.43 
</p>
<p>States must prioritize responsible lending and borrowing, and ensure that international trade 
</p>
<p>and economic transactions advance sustainable development and children&#8217;s rights.44

<p>57. Since 2000, the HAQ Centre for Child Rights has undertaken budget for children 
</p>
<p>work in India, disaggregating the various heads of account in the overall union and State 
</p>
<p>budgets to show the allocations made specifically for programmes that benefit children, and 
</p>
<p>determine how changes in financial allocation have an impact on their lives. Following this 
</p>
<p>approach, in 2008, the Government of India announced a separate statement on children in 
</p>
<p>the Finance Bill, and now provides itemized information in its budget on provisions for 
</p>
<p>expenditure on schemes that are aimed at the welfare of children.45 
</p>
<p>58. The Office of the Children&#8217;s Commissioner for England has undertaken a child 
</p>
<p>rights impact assessment of budget decisions, with the aim of identifying the impact of 
</p>
<p>budgetary decisions on the realization of children&#8217;s rights in England. The assessment 
</p>
<p>comprises an analysis of the impact of tax, tax credit and welfare benefit changes, as well 
</p>
<p>as changes to spending on public services, and disaggregates its findings according to 
</p>
<p>children in different types of families.46 
</p>
<p>59. From 2009 to 2013, Germany undertook a comprehensive evaluation of marriage 
</p>
<p>and family-related benefits, including the target of &#8220;child promotion and well-being&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Within the framework of the evaluation, most of the State&#8217;s marriage and family-related 
</p>
<p>benefits were revisited to determine what contribution they made to children&#8217;s well-being. 
</p>
<p>A basic concept for measuring the well-being of a child was developed and also used in 
</p>
<p>evaluating the benefits. 
</p>
<p>60. In Nicaragua, a &#8220;friends of children&#8221; network of municipal Governments was 
</p>
<p>established, comprising 81 per cent of all municipalities. Children engage with the network 
</p>
<p>to develop and resource policies on children based on their own analysis of available 
</p>
<p>information. In just over eight years, their participation has helped to bring about an 
</p>
<p>average 92 per cent increase in municipal investment in children in the municipalities 
</p>
<p>concerned.47 
</p>
<p>61. In the United Republic of Tanzania, Save the Children has supported children in 
</p>
<p>establishing more than 900 children&#8217;s councils in seven districts. More than 25,000 children 
</p>
<p>come together to learn about their rights and influence national and local decision-makers. 
</p>
<p>In preparation for the 2011/2012 budget, children met with district officials to present their 
</p>
<p>budget priorities, and their participation helped to increase budget allocations to benefit 
</p>
<p>school feeding programmes, the construction of hostels to enable students to attend 
</p>
<p>secondary education, and the recruitment of additional teachers.48 
</p>
<p>62. In Nepal, the Ministry of Local Development has implemented a framework for 
</p>
<p>child-friendly local governance, including additional block grants for child-friendly 
</p>
<p>spending and enhanced coordination and collaboration among sectoral line agencies, local

</p>
<p>63. In Ghana, Plan International supported children in increasing their knowledge of 
</p>
<p>equitable budgeting and to carry out participatory surveys to assess the situation of children 
</p>
<p>and particularly vulnerable groups in their communities. They analysed district budget 
</p>
<p>plans against the survey results, and negotiated better budget allocation with municipal 
</p>
<p>decision-makers.50  
</p>
<p>64. In Kenya, Plan International garnered the support of a Member of Parliament and a 
</p>
<p>minister to conduct a social audit exercise in which children and adult citizens evaluated the 
</p>
<p>transparency and efficiency of a decentralized government fund. The existing efforts of 
</p>
<p>Government and public officials to achieve greater transparency created the necessary 
</p>
<p>enabling conditions for the audit and the discussion of its results, which revealed a number 
</p>
<p>of inconsistencies and non-transparent spending patterns.51 
</p>
<p>65. In preparation for the 2015 national budget, child leaders from across Zimbabwe 
</p>
<p>presented their priorities for consideration to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on 
</p>
<p>Finance. They submitted a 10-point plan during a budget consultative meeting, which 
</p>
<p>brought together civil society, child leaders, Parliamentarians and representatives of the 
</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance. The plan included a request for the allocation of additional resources 
</p>
<p>to, inter alia, education, health, social security, school feeding schemes, the provision of 
</p>
<p>clean water and sanitation facilities, the expansion of recreational facilities, the institution 
</p>
<p>of junior councils and a junior parliament, and the establishment of a child rights 
</p>
<p>commission. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> A sustainable, equitable and broad-based investment in the rights of children is 
</b></p>
<p>crucial for the full and comprehensive realization of States&#8217; international obligations 
</p>
<p>to implement children&#8217;s rights, <b>be they civil and political, social, economic or cultural. 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> While it has been noted that efforts have been made by States to ensure 
</b></p>
<p>effective investment in children&#8217;s rights, States should:<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Regardless of their economic status, take concrete measures to mobilize 
</b></p>
<p><b>domestic and, where necessary, international resources to realize chi</b>ldren&#8217;s rights<b>; 
</b></p>
<p><b>they should also evaluate current revenue sources to ensure that resources are being 
</b></p>
<p><b>mobilized to the maximum extent possible; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Make appropriate budgetary provisions to support the realization of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights of all persons within their jurisdiction, without discrimination. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights should be guaranteed to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>maximum extent of available resources, taking into account the best interests of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>child and of future generations as a primary consideration;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Prioritize children in all budget and fiscal decision-making; where 
</b></p>
<p>resources are limited, children&#8217;s rights should be given precedence, with <b>special funds 
</b></p>
<p><b>directed towards the most marginalized and vulnerable groups of children and 
</b></p>
<p><b>families;

<p><b>(d) Strengthen public finance management systems and ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability for resources, including through both internal and external audit 
</b></p>
<p><b>processes. Financial oversight and accountability mechanisms should include 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance and enforcement mechanisms, remedies, sanction and redress; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensure budget transparency by making key budget documents public 
</b></p>
<p><b>during the annual budget cycle in a timely manner. To facilitate understanding of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>budget by the public, including children, the Government should produce a child-
</b></p>
<p>friendly citizen&#8217;s budget<b>; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Ensure a clear and transparent demarcation of budget lines for spending 
</b></p>
<p><b>on children. Information should be sufficiently disaggregated to enable children and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other stakeholders to identify, extract and track budget line items intended to benefit 
</b></p>
<p><b>children; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Gather comprehensive disaggregated data on children from civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>registration and vital statistics and other relevant sources that inform planning and 
</b></p>
<p><b>improve budget and public accounting systems, by making information on vulnerable 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups visible, accessible, identifiable and extractable in all budget plans and 
</b></p>
<p><b>expenditures; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Ensure meaningful and inclusive participation of all children </b>&#8211;<b> in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular those belonging to vulnerable and marginalized groups </b>&#8211;<b> according to their 
</b></p>
<p><b>evolving capacities, throughout the entire budget cycle, in an open, transparent, 
</b></p>
<p><b>collaborative and easily accessible way;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Ensure that the public, including children, can engage in fiscal processes, 
</b></p>
<p><b>by guaranteeing the right to participation throughout the budget process. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Appropriate forums should be used for public engagement. States should ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>child-friendly, age-appropriate and safe processes and mechanisms where children 
</b></p>
<p><b>can articulate their views and recommendations; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Establish an adequate enabling environment by improving legal 
</b></p>
<p>protection of children&#8217;s participation and their rights to expression, association and 
</p>
<p><b>peaceful assembly at all levels;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) Implement ex-ante and ex-post child rights impact assessments and 
</b></p>
<p><b>evaluations of economic policies, budgets and fiscal processes to monitor the impact of 
</b></p>
<p>decisions on children&#8217;s rights. Such evaluation must be continuous and 
</p>
<p><b>comprehensive, and contribute meaningfully to fiscal planning and budget 
</b></p>
<p><b>formulation across budget cycles;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(l) Recognize that global economic structures have an impact on </b>a State&#8217;s 
</p>
<p><b>fiscal space, and that the international community must therefore ensure that global 
</b></p>
<p><b>governance is transparent and accountable. Global partnerships and cooperation are 
</b></p>
<p><b>also needed to tackle illicit financial flows and tax avoidance;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(m) </b>Recognize that the realization of children&#8217;s rights is a shared 
</p>
<p><b>responsibility of developed and developing countries. In this light, States must honour 
</b></p>
<p><b>their commitment to allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to aid, and to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that it is transparently delivered.
