<p><b>  Report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention 
</b><i>Chair-Rapporteur</i>: Mads Andenas 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 During 2013, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, under its regular 
procedure, adopted 60 opinions concerning the detention of 431 persons in 39 countries 
(see A/HRC/27/48/Add.1). It also transmitted a total of 110 urgent appeals to 37 States 
concerning 680 individuals. States informed the Working Group that they had taken 
measures to remedy the situation of detainees: in some cases, detainees had been released; 
in other cases, the Working Group was assured that the detainees concerned would be 
guaranteed a fair trial. The Working Group is grateful to those Governments that heeded its 
appeals and took steps to provide it with the requested information on the situation of 
detainees. The Working Group engaged in continuous dialogue with countries that it 
visited, particularly concerning its recommendations. Information regarding the 
implementation of recommendations made by the Working Group was received from the 
Governments of Georgia and Senegal. During 2013, the Working Group visited Brazil, 
Greece, Hungary and Morocco. The reports on those visits are contained in addenda 2, 3, 4 
and 5 to the present report. 
</p>
<p> Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 20/16 adopted on 6 July 2012, the 
Working Group has initiated the preparations concerning the draft basic principles and 
guidelines on remedies and procedures on the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty 
by arrest or detention to bring proceedings before court, in order that the court may decide 
without delay on the lawfulness of his or her detention and order his or her release if the 
detention is not lawful. The draft basic principles and guidelines are intended to assist 
Member States in fulfilling their obligation to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty. The 
Working Group has prepared a specific report on national, regional and international laws, 
regulations and practices relating to the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention 
before a court (A/HRC/27/47). A report comprising the draft basic principles and 
guidelines will be submitted to the Human Rights Council in 2015. 
</p>

<p> In its recommendations, the Working Group requests States to enforce the protection 
of every person&#8217;s right to liberty under customary international law; to ensure that the 
required guarantees and safeguards are extended to all forms of deprivation of liberty; and 
to ensure that persons are not held in pretrial detention for periods longer than those 
prescribed by law, as well as ensuring that such persons are promptly brought before a 
judge. With respect to the thematic issues addressed in this report, the Working Group 
recommends that the practice of protective custody should be eliminated and replaced with 
alternative measures that ensure the protection of women and girls without jeopardizing 
their liberty. It also calls on States to ensure that preventive detention is proportionate and 
justified by compelling reasons and that detention of asylum seekers and irregular migrants 
is used a last resort only for the shortest period of time. The detention should be subject to 
regular periodic reviews by an independent judicial body and the legality of detention must 
be open to challenge before a court. The Working Group also requests the Human Rights 
Council to study the adoption of a set of principles to be applied to military courts.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention was established by the former 
Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1991/42 and entrusted with the 
investigation of instances of alleged arbitrary deprivation of liberty, according to standards 
set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and relevant international 
instruments accepted by the States concerned. The mandate of the Working Group was 
clarified and extended by the Commission in its resolution 1997/50 to cover the issue of 
administrative custody of asylum seekers and immigrants. At its sixth session, the Human 
Rights Council assessed the mandate of the Working Group and in resolution 6/4 confirmed 
its scope. On 26 September 2013, in its resolution 24/7, the Council extended the Working 
Group&#8217;s mandate for a further three-year period. 
</p>
<p>2. During 2013, the Working Group was composed of Shaheen Sardar Ali (Pakistan), 
Mads Andenas (Norway), Roberto Garret&#243;n (Chile), El Hadji Malick Sow (Senegal) and 
Vladimir Tochilovsky (Ukraine). 
</p><p>3. Between 1 January 2013 and 12 November 2013, El Hadji Malick Sow was the 
Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group and Shaheen Sardar Ali its Vice-Chair. On 13 
November 2013, Mads Andenas was elected Chair-Rapporteur of the Working Group and 
Vladimir Tochilovsky was elected Vice-Chair.   
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Working Group in 2013 
</b>4. During the period from 1 January to 31 December 2013, the Working Group held its 
sixty-sixth, sixty-seventh and sixty-eighth sessions. It undertook official missions to Greece 
(21&#8211;31 January 2013), Brazil (18&#8211;28 March 2013), Hungary (23 September&#8211;2 October 
2013) and Morocco (9&#8211;18 December 2013). See addenda 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, for the 
country visit reports. 
</p>
<p>5. In November 2011, the Working Group launched a database, accessible at 
www.unwgaddatabase.org, which is a freely and publicly available compilation of its 
opinions on individual cases of detention. The database provides over 600 opinions in 
English, French and Spanish that have been adopted since the establishment of the Working 
Group in 1991. During 2013, the database was consulted by some 3,000 visitors in different 
regions of the world. The database provides a practical research tool for victims, lawyers, 
academics and others who would like to prepare and submit cases of alleged arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>6. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 20/16, the Working Group initiated 
preparations concerning the draft basic principles and guidelines on remedies and 
procedures on the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or detention to 
bring proceedings before court in order that the court may decide without delay on the 
lawfulness of his or her detention and order his or her release if the detention is not lawful.  
</p>
<p>7. The Working Group, by means of a questionnaire, sought the views of States, 
relevant United Nations agencies, intergovernmental organizations, United Nations treaty 
bodies, in particular the Human Rights Committee, other special procedures, national 
human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations and other relevant stakeholders. 
The Working Group has so far received replies to its questionnaire from 44 States, 20 
national human rights institutions, 3 regional entities, 8 non-governmental organizations, 5 
special procedures mandate holders and the Human Rights Committee.  </p>


<p>8. In addition to the present report, the Working Group is submitting to the Human 
Rights Council a specific report on national, regional and international laws, regulations 
and practices relating to the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before court. That 
report is based on information obtained from stakeholders and on the Working Group&#8217;s 
additional review of relevant regional and international legal frameworks (A/HRC/27/47). 
</p><p>9. On 1 and 2 September 2014, the Working Group will hold a consultation with 
stakeholders in relation to the preparation of the first draft of basic principles and guidelines 
on remedies and procedures on the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before 
court. A final report comprising the outcome of the stakeholders&#8217; consultation and the draft 
basic principles and guidelines will be submitted to the Human Rights Council in 2015. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Handling of communications addressed to the Working Group during 
2013

</b></p>
<p>12. Pursuant to its methods of work (A/HRC/16/47, annex, and Corr.1), the Working 
Group, in addressing its opinions to Governments, drew their attention to resolutions 
1997/50 and 2003/31 of the former Commission on Human Rights and resolutions 6/4 and 
24/7 of the Human Rights Council, in which they were requested to take account of the 
Working Group&#8217;s opinions and, where necessary, to take appropriate steps to remedy the 
situation of persons arbitrarily deprived of their liberty and to inform the Working Group of 
the steps they had taken. On the expiry of a two-week deadline, the opinions were 
transmitted to the relevant sources.

<p><b> 3. Reactions from Governments concerning previous opinions 
</b></p>
<p>13. By note verbale dated 1 February 2013, the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the 
United Nations Office at Geneva reported that Gunasundaram Jayasundaram, who was the 
subject of opinion No. 38/2012 (Sri Lanka), was indicted in November 2012 under section 
5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act before the High Court of Vavuniya (case No. 
HC/2424/12). The Sri Lankan law enforcement authorities are investigating more serious 
charges against him. They are in touch with the Singaporean authorities in relation to 
mutual legal assistance matters. Mr. Jayasundaram pleaded guilty to the charge against him 
and was convicted pursuant to his pleas. The High Court of Vavuniya sentenced him to one 
month&#8217;s simple imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>14. With respect to opinion No. 26/2012, the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the 
United Nations Office at Geneva reported that Pathmanathan Balasingam had admitted his </p>


<p>participation in attacks against security forces as a member of the Liberation Tigers of 
Tamil Eelam (LTTE). He was indicted before the Anuradhapura High Court under the 
Prevention of Terrorism Act (case No. HC.185/2011). Concerning Vijiyanthan 
Seevaratnam, the Government reported that he had joined LTTE, undergone military 
training at Wattakachch base and used anti-aircraft missile guns. The Attorney General has 
offered him rehabilitation as an alternative to criminal prosecution.  
</p>
<p>15. The Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations Office at Geneva, in 
relation to opinion No. 49/2011 (Sri Lanka), reported that Jegasothy Thamotharampillai and 
Sutharsini Thamotharampillai had been detained under Emergency Regulation 19, 
paragraph 1. They were indicted before the Colombo High Court and pleaded guilty. On 20 
October 2011, they were sentenced to one year and to three months&#8217; imprisonment, 
respectively.  
</p>
<p>16. By note verbale dated 14 February 2013, the Permanent Mission of Togo to the 
United Nations Office at Geneva submitted its Government&#8217;s observations to opinion No. 
41/2012 (Togo) concerning Sow Bertin Agba.  
</p><p>17.  The Permanent Mission of Iraq to the United Nations Office at Geneva submitted 
brief information on 18 persons mentioned in opinion No. 43/2012 (Iraq). 
18. The Permanent Mission of Saudi Arabia to the United Nations Office at Geneva 
submitted information concerning Khaled Abdulrahman Al-Twijri and Abdulaziz Nasser 
Abdallah Al Barahim, who were the subjects of opinion No. 8/2012 (Saudi Arabia). It 
reported that all the allegations concerning Mr. Al-Twijri were inaccurate. He was arrested 
on charges of harbouring; failing to report and providing services for wanted persons; 
leaving Saudi Arabia illegally using forged documents; and adopting the ideology and 
policy of the Al-Qaida organization. Mr. Al Barahim was duly informed of the charges 
brought against him and was allowed to contact his family and receive visits in accordance 
with article 116 of the Criminal Procedure Code. He did not request the appointment of 
legal counsel.  
</p>
<p>19. By letter dated 11 July 2013, the Acting Deputy Permanent Representative of the 
United States of America to the United Nations Office at Geneva reported that Mr. 
Obaidullah, an Afghan national detained at the United States Naval Station at Guant&#225;namo 
Bay and the subject of opinion No. 10/2013 (United States of America), was being detained 
pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force (public law 107-40, sect. 2 (a)), as 
informed by the law of war, in the ongoing armed conflict with Al-Qaida, the Taliban and 
associated forces. According to the Government, Mr. Obaidullah&#8217;s detention is not penal in 
nature; he is being detained under the law of war to prevent his return to hostilities against 
the United States for the duration of those hostilities. Mr. Obaidullah has availed himself of 
the opportunity to challenge his military detention in the United States federal court system. 
He petitioned the Supreme Court to review his case but that petition was denied on 24 June 
</p><p>2013. On 7 March 2011, the President of the United States issued Executive Order 13567 
establishing a new process of periodic review for the detainees at Guant&#225;namo Bay who are 
designated for continued detention under the law of war or referred for prosecution but not 
yet charged or convicted. Mr. Obaidullah is eligible to receive a periodic review under that 
process. Each detainee, aided by his representative, is permitted to participate in the review 
process by presenting a written or oral statement, introducing relevant information and 
answering any question. Additionally, the detainee may call reasonably available witnesses. 
</p>
<p>20. By note verbale dated 3 December 2012, the Permanent Mission of Belarus to the 
United Nations Office at Geneva stated that opinion No. 39/2012 (Belarus) on the detention 
of Aleksandr Viktorovich Bialatski was biased, non-authoritative and politically motivated 
(see A/HRC/22/G/2). According to the Government, Mr. Bialatski has been condemned for 
committing a serious punishable offence involving tax evasion on a particularly large scale </p>


<p>and not for his fundraising activities for the organization Viasna. The sentence imposed on 
him cannot be seen as a violation of article 20, paragraph 1, of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights or of article 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
</p>
<p>21. By note verbale dated 25 October 2013, the Permanent Mission of Argentina to the 
United Nations Office at Geneva reported, with respect to the detention of Guillermo Luis 
Lucas, that domestic remedies had not been exhausted. The intervention of an international 
body would thus be premature. 
</p>
<p>22. By note verbale dated 24 September 2013, the Permanent Mission of Morocco to the 
United Nations Office at Geneva reported that Ali Aarrass was sentenced in the first 
instance, on 24 November 2011, to 15 years&#8217; imprisonment. In October 2012, that sentence 
was commuted to 12 years&#8217; imprisonment. He was sentenced on the basis of articles 293, 
294 and 295 of the Penal Code (criminal association and assistance to criminals) and of 
article 218-1, paragraph 9 (participation in an association formed or in an agreement 
oriented to the preparation of the commission of an act of terrorism). The court has not yet 
ruled upon Mr. Aarrass&#8217;s appeal. The Government assures the Working Group that all 
measures will be taken to give Mr. Aarrass the benefit of medical examinations. 
Instructions will be given to ensure that his fundamental rights as a detainee are respected.  
</p>
<p><i>  Release of subjects of the Working Group&#8217;s opinions 
</i>23. The Working Group received information from Governments and sources on the 
release of the following subjects of its opinions:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Nasrin Sotudeh, an Iranian human rights lawyer who was the subject of opinion No. 
21/2011 (Islamic Republic of Iran), was released on 18 September 2013 along with 
10 other political prisoners   
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Government of Saudi Arabia reported that Salman Mohamed Al Fouzan was 
currently at liberty (opinion No. 8/2012 (Saudi Arabia)) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; It also reported that Saeed Muhammad Eid Al Khamissi, whose detention was also 
considered arbitrary by opinion No. 8/2012 (Saudi Arabia), was sentenced by the 
court of first instance to a term of five years&#8217; imprisonment, confiscation of the 
items seized and a travel ban for the same period. The Public Prosecutor filed an 
objection to that judgement, which is being reviewed by the Appeal Court. In the 
meantime, the person is at liberty  
</p>
<p>&#8226; On 17 March 2014, a source reported that Guillermo Luis Lucas had been released 
(opinion No. 20/2013 (Argentina)) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Israel Arzate Mel&#233;ndez, who was the subject of opinion No. 67/2011 (Mexico), was 
released on 6 November 2013, pursuant to the judgement of the First Chamber of the 
Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation   
</p>
<p>&#8226; Michel Thierry Atangana Abega, who was the subject of opinion No. 38/2013 
(Cameroon), was released pursuant to a presidential decree on 24 February 2014. On 
29 April 2014, Mr. Atangana and his representatives travelled to Geneva and met 
with the members of the Working Group during its sixty-ninth session. They 
expressed their gratitude for the Working Group&#8217;s opinion and indicated that the 
Government of Cameroon had not yet implemented the two remaining 
recommendations of the Working Group, on investigation and compensation. They 
further stressed the effectiveness of the Working Group&#8217;s opinions in ending the 
practice of arbitrary detention 
</p>
<p>24. The Working Group expresses its gratitude to those Governments that took positive 
action and released detainees who were subjects of its opinions. </p>


<p><b> 4. Requests for review of opinions adopted 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Working Group considered the concerned Governments&#8217; requests for review of 
the following opinions: opinion No. 46/2012 (Guatemala), opinion No. 62/2012 (Ethiopia) 
and opinion No. 37/2012 (Spain). After carefully and closely examining the requests for 
review, the Working Group rejected the requests for review, in accordance with paragraph 
21 of its methods of work (A/HRC/16/47, annex, and Corr.1). 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Reprisal against a subject of an opinion of the Working Group 
</b>26. The Working Group expresses its concern regarding the continued detention under 
house arrest of Mar&#236;a Lourdes Afiuni Mora, the subject of its opinion No. 20/2010 
(Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela), who was arrested in 2009 for ordering the conditional 
release of Eligio Cede&#241;o, the subject of the Working Group&#8217;s opinion No. 10/2009 
(Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela). The Working Group considers the action against Ms. 
Afiuni as a measure of reprisal. It calls on the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela to immediately release Ms. Afiuni and to provide her with effective reparations. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Communications (urgent appeals and other letters) 
</b>27. During the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013, the Working Group 
sent 110 urgent appeals to 37 countries concerning 680 individuals. Urgent appeals were 
sent to the following countries: 
</p>
<p> Angola (1); Azerbaijan (2); Bahrain (4); Bangladesh (4); Belarus (1); Cambodia (1); 
China (10); Colombia (1); Egypt (7); Equatorial Guinea (3); India (2); Iran (Islamic 
Republic of) (13); Iraq (5); Israel (2); Italy (1); Kazakhstan (1); Mexico (1); 
Morocco (1); Myanmar (9); Nigeria (3); Oman (1); Panama (1); Saudi Arabia (6); 
Somalia (1); State of Palestine (1); the Sudan (5); Syrian Arab Republic (1); 
Tajikistan (1); Tunisia (1); Turkey (3); Ukraine (1); United Arab Emirates (3); 
United States of America (1); Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) (2); Viet Nam (5); 
Yemen (3) and Zimbabwe (1).  
</p>
<p>The full text of the urgent appeals can be consulted in the joint reports on communications.1 
</p><p>28. In conformity with paragraphs 22 to 24 of its methods of work (A/HRC/16/47, 
annex, and Corr.1), the Working Group, without prejudging whether a detention was 
arbitrary, drew the attention of each of the Governments concerned to the specific case as 
reported, and appealed to them to take the necessary measures to ensure that the detained 
persons&#8217; rights to life and to physical integrity were respected. 
</p>
<p>29. When the appeal made a reference to the critical state of health of certain persons or 
to particular circumstances, such as failure to execute a court order for release, the Working 
Group requested the Government concerned to take all necessary measures to have the 
person concerned released. In accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/2, the 
Working Group integrated into its methods of work the prescriptions of the Code of 
Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council relating to 
urgent appeals and has since applied them. 
</p>
<p>30. During the period under review, the Working Group also sent two letters of 
allegation to Nigeria and Sudan, pursuant to the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures 
Mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council.   
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 For urgent appeals sent from 1 December 2012 to 28 February 2014, see A/HRC/23/51, 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/24/21, A/HRC/25/74, A/HRC/26/21. </p>


<p>31. The Working Group wishes to thank those Governments that heeded its appeals and 
took steps to provide it with information on the situation of the persons concerned, 
especially the Governments that released those persons. In other cases, the Working Group 
was assured that the detainees concerned would receive fair trial guarantees. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Requests for visits 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Working Group has been invited to visit Argentina (a follow-up visit), 
Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Germany (a follow-up visit), India, Italy (a follow-up visit), 
Japan, Libya, Malta (a follow-up visit), Nauru, Spain and the United States of America. 
With respect to Nauru, the Working Group was invited by the Government to visit the 
country from 14 to 19 April 2014 and regrets that the Government cancelled the visit on 24 
March 2014 owing to unforeseen circumstances. The alternative dates for the visit in 2014 
are under discussion and the Working Group looks forward to closely working with the 
Government of Nauru in organizing the visit.       
</p>
<p>33. The Working Group has also asked to visit Algeria, Bahrain (a follow-up visit), 
Egypt, Ethiopia, Fiji, Guinea-Bissau, Nicaragua (a follow-up visit limited to Bluefields), 
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, the Syrian Arab 
Republic, Thailand, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Follow-up to country visits of the Working Group 
</b></p>
<p>34. In accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group decided in 1998 to 
address a follow-up letter to the Governments of countries it had visited, requesting 
information on initiatives the authorities might have taken to give effect to 
recommendations adopted by the Working Group contained in the reports on its country 
visits (E/CN.4/1999/63, para. 36). 
</p><p>35. In 2013, the Working Group requested information from Georgia and Germany, 
countries it had visited in 2011. It had previously also requested information from Armenia, 
Italy, Malaysia and Senegal. It received information from the Governments of Georgia, 
Italy and Senegal.  
</p>
<p><i>  Georgia 
</i></p>
<p>36. The Government of Georgia informed the Working Group of the measures taken in 
compliance with the recommendations issued in the Working Group&#8217;s report on its official 
mission to Georgia in 2011 (A/HRC/13/30/Add.2). 
</p><p>37. The Government of Georgia referred to the recommendation concerning the right of 
the detainee to be immediately informed of all his or her rights at the moment of the arrest. 
It reported that defendants must be released immediately if they were not informed upon 
arrest of their rights provided for in article 174 of the Criminal Procedure Code and were 
not given a copy of an arrest record. Statistical data provided by the Supreme Court of 
Justice shows that first instance courts had been using deprivation of liberty extensively up 
until 2013. However, that trend seems to be changing and alternative measures have started 
to prevail. The percentage of measures taken that order deprivation of liberty has fallen 
from 50.2 per cent in 2011, to 44.4 per cent in 2012 and 26.4 per cent during the first nine 
months of 2013. The percentage of cases heard in which bail was ordered increased to 37 
per cent. The use of bail has now outstripped the use of deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p>38. The Public Defender of Georgia and representatives of his Office, as well as 
representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, have the right to freely </p>


<p>enter temporary detention isolators without any authorization. The 2013 Development 
Strategy for the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia acknowledges the importance of 
monitoring those isolators, inter alia, through independent oversight bodies. A ministerial 
order of 17 May 2013 approved a new Police Code of Ethics and a directive for staff at 
those isolators. At the beginning of 2013, the duration of the basic training courses for 
police officers was doubled from three to six months and those courses include human 
rights subjects in their curricula. New methods for testing and interviewing candidates have 
been introduced. Riot, patrol, border and criminal police officers must be retrained 
periodically in order to improve their qualifications, particularly in the human rights area.  
</p>
<p>39. During the period 2012&#8211;2013, 146 investigations were launched into cases of ill-
treatment cases; 48 persons were prosecuted, including the former head of the Penitentiary 
Department and several directors of prisons; 21 persons have been convicted. During the 
first nine months of 2013, 74 meetings with prisoners were held in various penitentiary 
facilities. Nine investigations for bodily injury were launched following prisoners&#8217; 
applications. A variety of mechanisms for raising concerns and the transmission of 
complaints are available to detainees. The Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of Georgia, the Public 
Defender&#8217;s Office and the General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs can be 
contacted at any moment.  
</p>
<p>40. The Government further reported that the duration of basic training courses for 
officers of the Patrol Police Department and the Border Police have been extended from 12 
to 20 weeks and from 6 to 14 weeks, respectively. The courses are aimed at ensuring proper 
protection of the human rights of asylum seekers and other persons in need.  
</p>
<p>41. The first set of procedural law amendments aimed at enhancing the principle of 
adversariality were drafted in 2012. In accordance with the Working Group&#8217;s 
recommendation, the amendments are aimed at ensuring equality of arms between the 
defence and the prosecution in criminal proceedings. The amendments to the Criminal 
Procedure Code were submitted to the Parliament of Georgia in June 2013. A new code on 
administrative offences is being drafted.  
</p>
<p><i>  Senegal 
</i></p>
<p>42. The Government of Senegal reported that the rule of habeas corpus is well present in 
the criminal legislation of Senegal. Article 91 of the Constitution makes the judiciary the 
guardian of rights and freedoms. The principle of the independence of the judiciary is 
established in its article 88. The assistance of a lawyer is mandatory only in criminal 
matters. A legal aid fund is available. 
</p>
<p>43. Following a judgement in a criminal matter, a detainee may be sentenced to 
alternative prison measures (<i>contrainte par corps</i>), in addition to the award of damages and 
interest to the civil party, or fines. That applies in criminal matters exclusively, however, 
and never in civil cases. Alternative prison measures (<i>contrainte par corps</i>) are carefully 
regulated by the Criminal Procedure Code in its articles 7.9 and following. 
</p>
<p>44. The Organic Law of 2008 on the Supreme Court provides in its article 4 for the 
establishment of a commission to compensate persons who have spent several years in 
preventive detention. However, no regime has been formulated to regulate the application 
of the law. 
</p>
<p>45. The decree regulating prisons provides for disciplinary cells reserved for recalcitrant 
inmates and disruptive prisoners. In Senegal, detainees are subjected to disciplinary 
measures only exceptionally, however. The police misconduct which marked the 2012 
presidential election campaign is currently the subject of judicial proceedings. A dozen 
gendarmes and police officers are being held in places of detention. </p>


<p>46. In total, there are 331 licensed lawyers and 33 interns. The Ministry of Justice 
reported that it was soon to undertake consultations with the Bar Association on how to 
guarantee broad access to the legal profession and to promote the presence of lawyers in the 
most remote regions of the country. The Ministry of Justice plans to increase the number of 
judges in the regional and district courts.   
</p><p>47. In criminal matters, the length of preventive detention is not yet limited. For 
ordinary offences, it is limited to six months, except in cases of the misappropriation of 
public funds. With regard to migrants, the time limit for administrative detention is between 
15 and 30 days.   
</p>
<p>48. Like judges responsible for the execution of sentences, investigating judges must 
visit the detainees whom they have placed in detention. 
</p>
<p>49. The Government further reported that the prison administration had plans to build 
homes for women accused of infanticide, a detention centre with 1,500 places in 
S&#233;bikotane, 40 kilometres from Dakar, and six regional facilities with 500 places each. 
</p>
<p><i>  Italy 
</i></p>
<p>50. The Government of Italy informed the Working Group of the measures taken to 
implement the recommendations issued in the Working Group&#8217;s report on its official visit 
to Italy in November 2008 (A/HRC/10/21/Add.5). 
</p><p>51. The Government of Italy referred to the recommendation concerning the need to 
shorten the duration of criminal trials with a view to ensuring better protection of the right 
to be tried without undue delay. It provided information on the enactment of a number of 
new laws and the introduction of regulatory changes designed to limit the use of remand in 
custody.  
</p>
<p>52. With regard to the recommendation to thoroughly investigate incidents of police 
brutality and to hold those responsible accountable, the Government reported that a strong 
normative framework had been designed in order to ensure provisions adequate to the 
service performed by the police forces. Each and every case/incident is duly and promptly 
investigated. More generally, training activities, including human rights-related courses, 
have been introduced for all law enforcement agencies, and prison staff are provided with 
relevant training and given frequent refresher courses. Reference is made to article 582 of 
the Criminal Code on the ill-treatment of persons deprived of their liberty, under which 
proceedings are often brought for the misconduct of law enforcement officials, even in 
cases of minor injuries. A system monitoring all critical events, including any injuries 
suffered by inmates, has been instituted. The Prison Administration Department provides 
information to all prison facilities on the Manual on Effective Investigation and 
Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (the Istanbul Protocol). In addition, the establishment of a national 
ombudsman/guarantor of the rights of detainees and prisoners is currently pending approval 
by the Senate.  
</p>
<p>53. According to the Government, article 41 bis of Act No. 354 of 1975 (Penitentiary 
Act) provides for a regime of restrictions for prisoners from the upper echelons of mafia, 
terrorist or subversive criminal organizations. A total of 716 persons are currently subject to 
that regime, which has been strengthened by Act No. 94 of 2009. The Minister of Justice 
adopts a provision applying the regime, which lasts for four years and can be extended for 
an additional period of two years. The restrictions under the regime cannot be modified 
either by the administrative authority or the judicial authority, since they are established by 
the law.   </p>


<p>54. With regard to measures for asylum seekers and persons entitled to international 
protection, Italy has adopted a strategy consisting of a number of initiatives aimed at, inter 
alia, ensuring their integration locally and strengthening the existing system. In that context, 
various measures to receive asylum seekers and refugees have been adopted, including 
reception centres and local-based projects for their protection system.  
55. As regards the administrative detention of foreigners for the purpose of establishing 
their identity, article 14 of Legislative Decree No. 286/1998 provides for the adoption of a 
reasoned decree, of which the person concerned is to be notified and regarding which he or 
she can be heard, in person or through a legal counsel, before the judicial authority. The 
above measure is reported within 48 hours to the competent magistrate to be validated. A 
hearing is held in the presence of a legal counsel and the result thereof shall be promptly 
communicated to the person concerned. The foreign national enjoys the right to a defence, 
including free legal aid, and, if necessary, an interpreter. The court shall rule within 48 
hours. The validation by the court entails the identification of the person concerned and a 
mandatory stay for that person in a reception centre for a period of 30 days, extendable by 
reasoned request for up to a maximum of 18 months, pursuant to Act No. 129/2011 which 
extended the maximum term of detention in a reception centre from 6 to 18 months. In that 
regard, the Vice-Minister of the Interior declared very recently that the Government 
intended to drastically reduce that term. More specifically, the Constitutional Court has 
never objected to the Italian system of detention in reception centres: the Italian legislation 
is in line with European Union directive 2008/115/EC on common standards and 
procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Government reported that the complaints against Italy for violations related to 
expulsions of foreign citizens were numerous and that there had been an increase in the 
number of expulsions made on a preventive basis. Indeed, complaints related to judicial 
expulsions, including expulsions carried out as a security measure, constitute one third of 
those enforcing an administrative measure. The European Court of Human Rights has 
handed down several judgments on the subject, 14 of which found a violation, 4 of which 
concerned an alleged violation of article 3 of the Convention for the Protection of Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms for expulsions enforcing a judicial decision and 10 
concerned administrative expulsions. In its response, the Government provided a 
comprehensive legal analysis of the matter. 
</p>
<p>57. With regard to the juvenile justice system, the Government reported that the changes 
to the Italian legal framework begun in 1988 had led to a new organizational structure and 
new management of the juvenile justice administrative services. The Department of 
Juvenile Justice, consisting of central and local administration offices, ensures the 
execution of the penal provisions of the juvenile court with a view to the social and 
occupational reintegration of children in conflict with the law, as provided for in article 27 
of the Italian Constitution. The Government reported on a number of measures taken to 
improve the system and the various types of facilities for juvenile offenders. 
</p><p>58. The Government also reported that the process of closing the judicial psychiatric 
hospitals had started on 1 April 2008 with the Decree of the President of the Council of 
Ministers that transferred the responsibility for the penitentiary health-care service to the 
regions. In accordance with legislative decree No. 24 of 25 March 2013, the deadline for 
the closure of the judicial psychiatric hospitals had been postponed until 1 April 2014, in 
order to allow the regions to establish substantive health-care facilities and to arrange 
individual treatment and rehabilitation paths.   
</p>
<p><b> 3. Terms of reference for country visits by the Working Group  
</b></p>
<p>59. At its sixty-ninth session, held from 22 April to 1 May 2014, the Working Group 
reviewed terms of reference for country visits which are designed to clarify the Working </p>


<p>Group&#8217;s methods of work pertaining to the preparation and organization of, and follow-up 
to, its country visits. The Working Group intends to share the terms of reference with the 
Coordination Committee of Special Procedures for its consideration and to make them 
publicly available on the Working Group&#8217;s web page. It is hoped that the terms of reference 
will enhance the transparency, visibility and understanding of the Working Group&#8217;s country 
visits.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Follow-up to the joint study on secret detention 
</b>60. The Working Group has considered how it can contribute to the follow-up of the 
joint study on secret detention (A/HRC/13/42) within its mandate and will continue that 
consideration in 2014. It has discussed that with the current holders of other special 
mandates taking part in the joint study or otherwise having an interest in it or the follow-up. 
The Working Group will also address the follow-up to its own previous reports and 
opinions on detention and antiterrorism measures, taking account of subsequent 
developments, including the length of detention of individuals subject to indeterminate 
detention regimes. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Prevention of imminent arbitrary deprivation of liberty 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Working Group has continued its deliberations in situations where an individual 
is at risk of being arrested on an arrest warrant or detention order being issued against him 
or her and where the resulting deprivation of liberty is likely to be arbitrary in nature. 
</p>
<p>62. Under the Working Group&#8217;s current methods of work, there is no mechanism 
addressing situations where there is sufficiently reliable information that the execution of 
an order of arrest will result in arbitrary depravation of liberty. In effect, the Working 
Group currently has to wait until the arrest warrant is executed and the person is arbitrarily 
detained.  
</p>
<p>63. A mechanism might be applicable in situations when an individual is to be arrested 
solely because he or she has exercised the fundamental rights or freedoms guaranteed by 
international human rights law. Similarly, it could apply in situations where an imminent 
arrest would constitute a violation of international law prohibiting discrimination based on 
national or ethnic origin, religion, political or other opinion, gender, sexual orientation or 
other status, and which might result in the equality of human rights being ignored. 
</p>
<p>64. If such a preventive mechanism was available to the Working Group, then section V 
of its methods of work (urgent action procedure) would apply mutatis mutandis to the 
consideration of communications on imminent arbitrary deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p>65. As to action on communications in that category, two options can be considered: (a) 
if the Working Group considered that the imminent detention was not of an arbitrary nature, 
it would render an opinion to that effect, such an opinion not prejudging any further 
consideration by the Working Group of a communication in the case on other grounds 
provided for in its methods of work; (b) if the Working Group considered that the arbitrary 
nature of the imminent detention had been established, it would render an opinion to that 
effect and make recommendations to the Government.   </p>


<p><b> III. Thematic issues 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Military justice 
</b>66. Once again, the Working Group notes the irregularity of judges who are under 
military command trying civilians.2 The experience of the Working Group is that military 
tribunals are often used to deal with political opposition groups, journalists and human 
rights defenders The trial of civilians or decisions placing civilians in preventive detention 
by military courts are in violation of the International Covenant and customary international 
law as confirmed by the constant jurisprudence of the Working Group. 
67. In the Working Group&#8217;s view, there is an irreconcilable contradiction of values in 
the make-up of military courts, the main effect of which is not the denial of justice, but 
rather a direct injustice. One of the core values of a civilian judge is his or her 
independence, while the most appreciated value in a military official is exactly the 
opposite: his or her obedience to his or her superiors. 
</p>
<p>68. Therefore, as has been said by the Working Group, the intervention of a military 
judge who is neither professionally nor culturally independent is likely to produce an effect 
contrary to the enjoyment of the human rights and to a fair trial with due guarantees. The 
Working Group wishes to reiterate the human rights of accused persons, particularly their 
rights to be brought promptly before an independent and impartial judge; to be brought to 
trial in the shortest possible time; to be tried without undue delay; to challenge the 
lawfulness of their detention; to the presumption of innocence; to a public trial; to equality 
of arms between prosecution and defence; to access to evidence submitted by the 
prosecution; and other fundamental judicial guarantees of a fair trial. Supporters of military 
tribunals often insist on the urgency of swift justice and the need to maintain patriotic 
values. However, the Working Group notes that a court composed of a low-ranking soldier 
or other military personnel cannot be considered &#8220;a competent, independent and impartial 
tribunal&#8221;, as defined under international human rights law 
</p>
<p>69. The Working Group has set out below certain minimum guarantees that military 
justice must not fail to respect: 
</p>
<p>(a) Military tribunals should only be competent to try military personnel for 
military offences; 
</p>
<p>(b)  If civilians have also been indicted in a case, military tribunals should not try 
military personnel; 
</p>
<p>(c) Military courts should not try military personnel if any of the victims are 
civilians; 
</p>
<p>(d) Military tribunals should not be competent to consider cases of rebellion, the 
sedition or attacks against a democratic regime, since in those cases the victims are all 
citizens of the country concerned;  
</p>
<p>(e) Military tribunals should never be competent to impose the death penalty. 
  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

9/2010 (Israel); No. 5/2010 (Israel). </p>


<p>70. The Working Group has found that justice done by the military in many instances 
falls into the five categories of arbitrariness identified in its methods of work. 
</p>
<p>(a) Category I: Military forces often stop and detain persons for a long time and 
military judges often order continuing detention in the absence of any legal basis; 
</p>
<p>(b) Category II: Many detainees brought before military courts have been 
detained simply for exercising a fundamental freedom, such as the freedom of opinion and 
expression, freedom of association, freedom of assembly or freedom of religion; 
</p>
<p>(c) Category III: Military judges and military prosecutors often do not meet the 
fundamental requirements of independence and impartiality; military procedures applied by 
military courts often do not respect the basic guarantees for a fair trial; 
</p>
<p>(d) Category IV: Individuals brought before military courts are often migrants in 
an irregular situation, asylum seekers and refugees captured by military forces at borders, at 
sea and in airports; 
</p>
<p>(e) Category V: Many people brought before military courts are foreign nationals 
coming from a country considered hostile to the country. 
</p>
<p>71. The Working Group recalls the draft principles on the administration of justice 
through military courts prepared by the Special Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission on the 
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (E/CN.4/2006/58) and requests the Human 
Rights Council to proceed to their consideration with a view to adopting a set of principles 
to be applied to military courts.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Over-incarceration 
</b></p>
<p>72. While recognizing that States enjoy a wide margin of discretion in the choice of 
their penal policies, the right to liberty of persons in article 9 of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights requires that States should have recourse to deprivation of 
liberty only insofar as it is necessary to meet a pressing societal need, and in a manner 
proportionate to that need (E/CN.4/2006/7, para. 63). In a previous report (E/CN.4/2006/7) 
in 2006, the Working Group noted with concern the practice of over-incarceration in the 
context of pretrial detention, as well as the factors that lead to over-incarceration, including 
detainees&#8217; ethnic or social origin, poverty and social marginalization. During its country 
visits and communications, the Working Group has criticized the persistent pattern of 
overuse of detention in a number of countries, as well as the emergence of varying regimes 
in which over-incarceration occurs, such as preventive detention and the detention of 
asylum seekers and migrants in an irregular situation.   
</p>
<p>73. Many countries have seen an increasingly rapid rate of legislative response to 
criminal acts, and are now beginning to experience the combined effects of habitual 
offender laws, generally increased minimum sentences with less discretion available to 
judges in each individual case, and post-conviction preventive detention. In addition, 
hastily drafted legislation on detention for the purposes of extradition or immigration 
control and security detention has often not taken account of basic international law 
obligations. Regimes allowing indeterminate detention are on the increase. Domestic courts 
may provide constitutional review, and regional mechanisms such as the Inter-American 
and European human rights courts provide supervision. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Working Group&#8217;s country visits and communications clearly demonstrate that 
international supervisory mechanisms such as the Human Rights Committee and the 
relevant special procedures have an important task in the years ahead in reviewing the 
proportionality of detention in domestic legislation and practice. The Working Group has 
also identified best practice in complying with the proportionality requirement. The </p>


<p>universal periodic review process of the Human Rights Council and other State-to-State 
peer review and dialogue-based mechanisms are providing increasing assistance to States in 
their compliance with international law obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Preventive detention 
</b></p>
<p>75. In a number of countries, the Working Group has observed the use of preventive 
detention. Convicted persons who have served their sentence may continue to be deprived 
of their liberty on the basis that their release would pose a danger to society (see, for 
example, A/HRC/7/4/Add.2 and A/HRC/19/57/Add.3). When a criminal sentence includes 
a punitive period followed by a preventive period, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and customary international law, as confirmed by the reports and constant 
jurisprudence of the Working Group, require that once the punitive term of imprisonment 
has been served, the preventive detention must be proportionate and justified by compelling 
reasons. It must be subject to regular periodic review by a court or by an independent body 
subject to judicial review that must be able to determine the continued justification for the 
detention. Strong procedural guarantees must be provided for the evaluation of future 
danger, and the proportionality review is no less strict at that stage and demands stronger 
reasoning as time passes. Post-conviction preventive detention must be a measure of last 
resort. The conditions in preventive detention must be distinct from the conditions for 
convicted prisoners serving a punitive sentence and be aimed at rehabilitation and 
reintegration into society. If a prisoner has served the sentence imposed at the time of 
conviction, articles 9 and 15 of the Covenant and customary international law forbid a 
retroactive increase in sentence. Detention equivalent to penal imprisonment cannot be 
imposed as civil preventive detention or under any other label. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Detention of asylum seekers and irregular migrants 
</b></p>
<p>76. Some States have resorted to administrative detention of asylum seekers and 
irregular migrants (see, for example, A/HRC/13/30/Add.2 and A/HRC/10/21/Add.5). Law 
and policy vary from State to State, and asylum seekers and irregular migrants are at risk of 
arbitrary detention. They may be detained for several months or years, or even indefinitely, 
particularly in countries which have a policy of mandatory detention or do not prescribe a 
maximum period of detention. The imprisonment of a migrant or an asylum seeker for a 
prolonged period of time, in conditions that are sometimes found to be even worse than in 
the regular prisons, constitutes a punishment on a person who has not committed any crime 
(A/HRC/27/48/Add.2, para. 75).  
</p><p>77. Other international human rights mechanisms have similarly raised concerns about 
the excessive length of detention of migrants, the harsh conditions of their detention and the 
lack of procedural safeguards to ensure that detention is an appropriate and proportionate 
measure (A/68/261, para. 46). The Working Group reiterates that the detention of asylum 
seekers and irregular migrants should be a last resort and permissible only for the shortest 
period of time. Any necessary detention should take place in appropriate, sanitary, non-
punitive facilities, and should not take place in prisons. The inability of the authorities to 
carry out the expulsion of an individual can never justify indefinite detention. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Protective custody 
</b></p>
<p>78. The present section addresses the practice of keeping girls and women in detention 
for the purpose of protecting them from risks of serious violence. The Working Group has 
previously addressed in its annual report protective custody of women and girls who may 
be detained for life. That form of deprivation of liberty is highly gendered in its reach, remit 
and application. In some countries, women and girls are placed in custody due to the risk of </p>


<p>gender-based violence, such as honour crimes, and their release may be conditional upon 
the consent of a male relative and/or a guarantor (see A/HRC/20/16/Add.1).  
</p><p>79. There will typically be no legal basis for the detention, procedural guarantees will 
not be observed, and the detention will constitute discrimination. The Working Group 
recalls the views of the United Nations treaty bodies and the Special Rapporteur on 
violence against women, its causes and consequences, that the practice of protective 
custody should be eliminated and replaced with alternative measures ensuring the 
protection of women without jeopardizing their liberty.3 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b>80. <b>The Working Group, in the fulfilment of its mandate, welcomes the cooperation 
it has received from States with regard to the responses by the Governments 
concerned concerning cases brought to their attention under its regular procedure. In 
2013, the Working Group adopted 60 opinions concerning 431 persons in 39 countries. 
It also sent 110 urgent appeals to 37 countries concerning 680 persons. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Working Group welcomes the invitations extended to it to pay official visits 
to countries. The Working Group conducted official visits in 2013 to Brazil, Greece, 
Hungary and Morocco. In response to its requests to visit countries, the Working 
Group has received invitations from the Governments of Argentina (for a follow-up 
visit), Azerbaijan, Burkina Faso, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Libya, Malta, Nauru, 
Spain and the United States of America. It has also requested to be invited to an 
additional 16 countries. The Working Group reiterates its belief that its country visits 
are essential for the fulfilment of its mandate. For Governments, the visits provide an 
excellent opportunity to show developments and progress in ensuring respect for 
human rights, including the crucial right not to be arbitrarily deprived of liberty. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Working Group reiterates that timely responses to its letters of allegations 
under its regular procedure with full disclosure from Member States furthers the 
cause of objectivity in the rendering of the Working Group&#8217;s opinions. The Working 
Group regrets that, in some cases, Governments do not provide responses, or limit 
their replies to general information or merely affirm the non-existence of arbitrary 
detention in the country or refer to the constitutional norms preventing arbitrary 
detention from occurring, without making direct reference to the specific allegations 
transmitted. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>In its deliberation No. 9 concerning the definition and scope of arbitrary 
deprivation of liberty under customary international law (A/HRC/22/44, sect. III), the 
Working Group restated its constant jurisprudence on the prohibition of all forms of 
arbitrary deprivation of liberty, and demonstrated that it is general practice accepted 
as law, constituting customary international law and a peremptory norm (<i>jus cogens</i>). 
The prohibition of arbitrariness in the deprivation of liberty requires a strict review 
of the lawfulness, necessity and proportionality of any measure depriving anyone of 
their liberty, which can arise at any stage of legal proceedings. The prohibition of 
arbitrary deprivation of liberty applies without territorial limitations, both with

<p><b>respect to the duties on States where they have effective control and to acts by their 
agents abroad. International law does not accept &#8220;act of state&#8221; limitations on human 
rights obligations. In the interactive dialogue at the twenty-second session of the 
Human Rights Council, States gave general support for the conclusions of the 
deliberation. In its resolution 20/16, the Council encouraged all States to respect and 
promote the right of anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or detention to 
bring proceedings before court, in order that the court may decide without delay on 
the lawfulness of his or her detention and order his or her release if the detention is 
not lawful, in accordance with their international obligations, and requested the 
Working Group to prepare and present to it before the end of 2015 draft basic 
principles and guidelines on remedies and procedures relating to that right, with the 
aim of assisting Member States in complying therewith. Deliberation No. 9 has been 
cited as one source on the approach to identification of customary international law 
by Sir Michael Wood in his first (A/CN.4/663, para. 53) and second reports 
(A/CN.4/672, paras 41.8 and 76.6) on formation and evidence of customary 
international law submitted to the International Law Commission. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Working Group has prepared a specific report on national, regional and 
international laws, regulations and practices on the right to challenge the lawfulness 
of detention before a court (A/HRC/27/47) and will hold a consultation with 
stakeholders on 1 and 2 September 2014 to solicit input on the draft basic principles 
and guidelines, with a view to presenting them to the Human Rights Council in 2015. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Judges should always be independent and impartial. In contrast, two of the 
core values of a military officer are obedience and loyalty to her or his supervisors. 
Under international law, military tribunals can only be competent to try military 
personnel for military offences. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Military courts should not try military officers if civilians have also been 
indicted in the case and if civilians are among the victims. All sentences issued by 
military courts should be reviewed by a civil court, even if they have not been 
appealed. Military courts should never be competent to impose the death penalty. 
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Working Group recommends that States:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Enforce and protect the right to liberty of every human being under 
customary international law; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Ensure that the guarantees available against arbitrary arrest and 
detention are extended to all forms of deprivation of liberty, including house arrest; 
re-education through labour; prolonged periods of curfew; detention of migrants and 
asylum seekers; protective custody; detention for rehabilitation or treatment; 
detention in transit areas; and border control checkpoints; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Ensure that persons are not held in pretrial detention for periods longer 
than those prescribed by law or proportionate, and that they are promptly brought 
before a judge; 
 (d)  Remedy arbitrary detention, mainly by immediate release and 
compensation as required by international human rights conventions and customary 
international law, and assist the Working Group in the follow-up to its opinions in 
individual cases. </b></p>


<p>88. <b>All measures of detention should be justified, adequate, necessary and 
proportional to the aim sought.</b> 
</p>
<p>89. <b>All persons subjected to a measure of detention should benefit at all stages from 
access to a lawyer of her or his choice and to effective legal assistance and 
representation. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>All detainees should benefit from all minimum procedural guarantees, 
including the principle of equality of arms; the provision of adequate time and 
facilities for the preparation of the defence; proper access to evidence; and guarantees 
against self-incrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The practice of protective custody should be eliminated and replaced with 
alternative measures that ensure the protection of women and girls without 
jeopardizing their liberty. As part of efforts to achieve that end, awareness should be 
raised regarding the practice of protective custody. The Working Group encourages 
States, civil society organizations and other stakeholders to submit to the Working 
Group information on how frequently that practice occurs. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Working Group requests the Human Rights Council to consider the 
adoption of a set of principles to be applied to military courts. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Working Group recommends that States ensure that preventive detention 
must comply with international law and be proportionate and justified by compelling 
reasons, and is subject to regular periodic review by an independent judicial body.   
</b>94. <b>Detention of asylum seekers and irregular migrants shall be a last resort and 
permissible only for the shortest period of time. Alternatives to detention should be 
sought whenever possible and the legality of detention must be open to challenge 
before a court and subject to regular review within fixed time limits.
