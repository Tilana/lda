of the law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> <i>further</i> that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
provides, inter alia, that everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and

choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or 
private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> the positive role that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and

</p>
<p> <i>Concerned</i> about actions that wilfully exploit tensions or target individuals on the 
basis of their religion or belief, 
</p>

<p><i> Noting with deep concern </i>the instances of intolerance, discrimination and acts of 
violence in many parts of the world, including cases motivated by discrimination against 
persons belonging to<b> </b>religious minorities, in addition to the negative projection of the 
followers of religions and the enforcement of measures that specifically discriminate 
against persons on<b> </b>the basis of religion or belief, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the valuable contribution of people of all religions or beliefs to 
humanity and the contribution that dialogue among religious groups can make towards 
improved awareness and understanding of the common values shared by all humankind, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> that working together to enhance implementation of existing legal 
regimes that protect individuals against discrimination and hate crimes, increase interfaith 
and intercultural efforts, and to expand human rights education are important first steps in 
combating incidents of intolerance, discrimination and violence against individuals on the 
basis of religion or belief,

when condoned by Governments; </p>

these issues can help overcome existing misperceptions;
