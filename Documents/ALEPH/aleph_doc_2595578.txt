ANNUAL UPDATE - MINERAL RESOURCE & ORE RESERVES AS AT 30 JUNE 2016 20
PRESS RELEASE
JORC 2012 TABLE 1 – GOLD DIVISION
SECTION 1 SAMPLING TECHNIQUES AND DATA
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.)
Criteria
Sampling techniques
Drilling techniques
Drill sample recovery
JORC Code Explanation
•
Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised 
industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such 
as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should 
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate 
calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report.
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be relatively simple 
(eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was

Diamond Drilling
The bulk of the data used in resource calculations at Trident has been gathered from 
diamond core. Four types of diamond core sample have been historically collected. The 
predominant sample method is half-core NQ2 diamond with half-core LTK60 diamond, 
Whole core LTK48 diamond and whole core BQ also used. This core is logged and sampled to 
geologically relevant intervals.
The bulk of the data used in resource calculations at Chalice has been gathered from 
diamond core. The predominant drilling and sample type is half core NQ2 diamond. 
Occasionally whole core has been sampled to streamline the core handling process. 
Historically half and whole core LTK60 and half core HQ diamond have been used. This core 
is logged and sampled to geologically relevant intervals.
Face Sampling
Each development face / round is chip sampled at both Trident and Chalice. One or two 
channels are taken per face perpendicular to the mineralisation. The sampling intervals are 
domained by geological constraints (e.g. rock type, veining and alteration / sulphidation 
etc.) with an effort made to ensure each 3kg sample is representative of the interval being 
extracted. Samples are taken in a range from 0.1 m up to 1.2 m in waste / mullock. All 
exposures within the orebody are sampled.
Sludge Drilling
Sludge drilling at Chalice and Trident is performed with an underground production drill rig. It 
is an open hole drilling method using water as the flushing medium, with a 64mm or 89mm 
hole diameter. Samples are taken twice per drill steel (1.9m steel, 0.8m sample). Holes are 
drilled at sufficient angles to allow flushing of the hole with water following each interval to 
prevent contamination.
RC Drilling
For Fairplay, Vine, Lake Cowan, Two Boys, Mousehollow, Pioneer and Eundynie the bulk of the 
data used in the resource estimate is sourced from RC drilling. Minor RC drilling is also utilised 
at Trident, Musket, Chalice and the Palaeochannels (Wills, Pluto, Mitchell 3 and 4).
Drill  cuttings  are  extracted  from  the  RC  return  via  cyclone.  The  underflow  from  each  1  m 
interval is transferred via bucket to a four tiered riffle splitter, delivering approximately three 
kilograms  of  the  recovered  material  into  calico  bags  for  analysis.  The  residual  material  is 
retained on the ground near the hole. Samples too wet to be split through the riffle splitter are 
taken as grabs and are recorded as such.

RAB / Air Core Drilling
Drill cuttings are extracted from the RAB and Aircore return via cyclone. 4m Composite 
samples are obtained by spear sampling from the individual 1m drill return piles; the 
residue material is retained on the ground near the hole. In the Palaeochannels 1m samples 
are riffle split for analysis.
There is no RAB or Aircore drilling used in the estimation of Trident, Chalice, Corona, Fairplay, 
Vine, Lake Cowan and Two Boys.
SKO
SKO is a long-term producing operation with a long history of drilling and sampling to support 
exploration and resource development.
Chips from the RC drilling face-sampling hammer are collected for assaying. Sample return 
lines  are  cleaned  with  compressed  air  each  metre  and  the  cyclone  sample  collector  is 
cleaned following each rod. Samples are riffle split through a three-tier splitter with a split 
~3kg sample (generally at 1m intervals) pulverised to produce a 30g charge analysed via 
fire assay.
Diamond drill-core is geologically logged and then sampled according to geology (minimum 
sample length of 0.4 m to maximum sample length of 1.5 m) – where consistent geology is 
sampled, a 1m length is used for sampling the core. The core is sawn half-core with one half 
sent off for analysis.
Samples have been collected from numerous other styles of drilling at SKO, including but not 
limited to RAB, aircore, blast-hole, sludge drilling and face samples.
Historical data includes DD, RC, RAB and aircore holes drilled between 1984 and 2010. Not 
all  the  historical  drilling  programmes  at  SKO  are  documented  and  many  historical  holes 
are assigned a drill type of ‘unknown’. Over 4,000 km of drilling has been completed on the 
tenure.
Drilling  by  the  most  recent  previous  owners  (Alacer  Gold  Corporation)  has  predominantly 
been RC, with minor DD and aircore drilling.
RC  drilling  is  used  predominantly  for  defining  and  testing  for  near-surface  mineralisation 
and utilises a face sampling hammer with the sample being collected on the inside of the 
drill-tube. RC drillholes utilise downhole single or multi shot cameras. Drillhole collars were 
surveyed by onsite mine surveyors.
Diamond drilling is used for either testing / targeting deeper mineralised systems or to define 
the orientation of the host geology. Many of these holes had RC pre-collars generally to a 
depth of between 60 – 120m, followed by a diamond tail. The majority of these holes have 
been drilled at NQ2 size with minor HQ sized core. All diamond holes were surveyed during 
drilling with downhole cameras, and then at end of hole using a Gyro Inclinometer at 5 or 10 
m intervals. Drillhole collars were surveyed by onsite mine surveyors.
Sample Recovery
Sample  recovery  is  generally  good,  and  there  is  no  indication  that  sampling  presents  a 
material risk for the quality of the evaluation of any deposit at SKO.

Diamond Drilling
A significant portion of the data used in resource calculations at the CMGP has been 
gathered from diamond core. Multiple sizes have been used historically. This core is 
geologically logged and subsequently halved for sampling. Grade control holes may be 
whole-cored to streamline the core handling process if required.
Face Sampling
At each of the major past and current underground producers at the CMGP, each 
development face / round is horizontally chip sampled. The sampling intervals are domained 
by geological constraints (e.g. rock type, veining and alteration / sulphidation etc.). The 
majority of exposures within the orebody are sampled.
Sludge Drilling
Sludge drilling at the CMGP was / is performed with an underground production drill rig. It is 
an open hole drilling method using water as the flushing medium, with a 64mm (nominal) 
hole diameter. Sample intervals are ostensibly the length of the drill steel. Holes are drilled 
at sufficient angles to allow flushing of the hole with water following each interval to prevent 
contamination. Sludge drilling is not used to inform resource models.
RC Drilling
Drill cuttings are extracted from the RC return via cyclone. The underflow from each interval 
is transferred via bucket to a four tiered riffle splitter, delivering approximately three 
kilograms of the recovered material into calico bags for analysis. The residual material is 
retained on the ground near the hole. Composite samples are obtained from the residue 
material for initial analysis, with the split samples remaining with the individual residual 
piles until required for re-split analysis or eventual disposal.
RAB / Aircore Drilling
Combined scoops from bucket dumps from cyclone for composite. Split samples taken from 
individual bucket dumps via scoop. RAB holes are not included in the resource estimate.
Blast Hole Drilling
Cuttings sampled via splitter tray per individual drill rod. Blast holes not included in the 
resource estimate.
All geology input is logged and validated by the relevant area geologists, incorporated into 
this is assessment of sample recovery. No defined relationship exists between sample 
recovery and grade. Nor has sample bias due to preferential loss or gain of fine or coarse 
material been noted.

At the Intertek on-site facility, analysis is performed using a 500g PAL method. The 
accurately weighed sub-sample is further processed utilising a PAL1000B to grind the 
sample to a nominal 90% passing 75µm particle size, whilst simultaneously extracting any 
cyanide amenable gold liberated into a Leachwell liquor. The resulting liquor is then analysed 
for gold content by organic extraction with flame AAS finish, with an overall method 
detection limit of 0.01ppm Au content in the original sample. This method is appropriate for 
the type and magnitude of mineralisation at Higginsville.
Quality control procedures include the use of standards, blanks and duplicates. Standards 
and duplicates are used to test both the accuracy and precision of the analytical process, 
while blanks are employed to test for contamination during the sample preparation stage. 
The analyses have confirmed the analytical process employed at Higginsville is adequately 
precise and accurate for use as part of the mineral resource estimation.
SKO
Only nationally accredited laboratories are used for the analysis of the samples collected at

The laboratory dry and if necessary (if the sample is >3kg) riffle split the sample, which 
is then jaw crushed and pulverised (the entire 3kg sample) in a ring mill to a nominal 90% 
passing 75 microns.  All recent RC and Diamond core samples are analysed via Fire Assay, 
which involves a 30g charge (sub-sampled after the pulverisation) of the analytical pulp 
being fused at 1050°C for 45 minutes with litharge. The resultant metal pill is digested in
aqua regia and the gold content determined by atomic adsorption spectrometry – detection 
limit is 0.01 ppm Au.
Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) samples are routinely submitted by SKO 
staff and comprise standards, blanks, assay pills, field duplicates, lab duplicates and repeat 
analyses. The results for these QA/QC samples are routinely analysed by Senior Geologists 
with any discrepancies dealt with in conjunction with the laboratory prior to the analytical 
data being imported into the database.
There is limited information available on historic QA/QC procedures. SKO has generally 
accepted the available data at face value and carry out data validation procedures as each 
deposit is re-evaluated.
The analytical techniques used are considered appropriate for the style of mineralisation 
being tested for – this technique is industry standard across the Eastern Goldfields.
Ongoing production data generally confirms the validity of prior sampling and assaying of 
the mined deposits to within acceptable limits of accuracy.

interpretation of the area is well understood, and is supported by the knowledge from open pit

on a combination of drill density and the number of samples used to estimate the resource 
blocks.
Mount Marion:
Drill-spacing ranges from 20m x 20m to no greater than 60m x 60m for the reported resource 
Given that the geological and mineralisation understanding is well established via mining

Compositing is carried out based upon the modal sample length of each individual domain.
FGP
Drillhole spacing is a nominal 40m x 40m that has been in-filled to a nominal 20m x 20m 
in the main zone of mineralisation at Yarlarweelor, Callie’s and Eldorado with 10m x10m RC 
grade control within the limits of the open pits.
The  spacing  is  considered  sufficient  to  establish  geological  and  grade  continuity  for 
appropriate Mineral Resource classification.
During the historic exploration phase, samples were composited to 4m by spearing 1m bulk 
samples. Where the assays returned results greater than 0.15ppm Au, the original 1m bulk 
samples were split using a 3-tier riffle splitter and analysed as described above.
Drilling intersections are nominally designed to be normal to the orebody as far as

Trident is hosted primarily within a thick, weakly differentiated gabbro with subordinate mafic 
and  ultramafic  lithologies  and  comprises  a  series  of  north-northeast  trending,  shallowly 
north-plunging  mineralised  zones.  The  deposit  comprises  two  main  mineralisation  styles; 
large  wallrock-hosted  ore-zones  comprising  sigmoidal  quartz  tensional  vein  arrays  and 
associated metasomatic wall rock alteration hosted exclusively within the gabbro, and thin, 
lode-style,  nuggetty  laminated  quartz  veins  that  formed  primarily  at  sheared  lithological 
contacts between the various mafic and ultramafic lithologies.
Lake Cowan mineralisation can be separated into two types. Structurally controlled primary 
mineralisation in ultramafics, basalts and felsics host (e.g. Louis, Josephine and Napoleon), 
and saprolite / palaeochannel hosted supergene hydromorphic deposits, including Sophia, 
Brigitte and Atreides.

HBJ:
The HBJ lodes form part of a gold mineralised system along the Boulder-Lefroy shear zone 
that is over 5km long and includes the Celebration, Mutooroo, HBJ and Golden Hope open-
pit and underground mines. The lodes are hosted within a steeply-dipping, north-northwest 
striking  package  of  mafic,  ultramafic  and  sedimentary  rocks  and  schists  that  have  been 
intruded by felsic to intermediate porphyries. Gold mineralisation is structurally controlled 
and is focused along lithological contacts, within stockwork and tensional vein arrays and 
within  shear  zones.  The  main  mineralised  zone  has  a  length  in  excess  of  1.9  km  and  an 
average width of 40 m in the Jubilee workings but is generally narrower to the north in the 
Hampton -Boulder workings.
Mount Marion:
The Mount Marion deposit is located on the eastern side of the Coolgardie Domain within a 
flexure in the Karramindie Shear Zone. It is hosted within a sub-vertical sequence of meta- 
komatiites intercalated with metasediments that have been metamorphosed to amphibolite 
facies.  Gold  mineralisation  occurs  in  a  footwall  and  hangingwall  lode,  each  ranging  in 
thickness from 2 to 15m. The mineralisation plunges steeply to the west and is open at depth.
Mount Martin:
The Mount Martin Tribute Area, is located within a regional scale north-northwest trending 
Archean  Greenstone  Belt.  Within  the  Mount  Martin  -  Carnilya  area,  the  greenstone  belt 
comprises  a  mixed  sequence  of  ultramafic  (predominantly  komatiitic)  and  fine-grained, 
variably  sulphidic  sedimentary  lithologies  with  subsidiary  mafic  units.  Known  gold  and 
nickel  mineralisation  at  the  Mount  Martin  Mine  is  associated  with  a  series  of  stacked, 
westerly  dipping,  sulphide  and  quartz-carbonate  bearing  lodes  which  are  mainly  hosted 
within intensely deformed and altered chloritic schists sandwiched between talc-carbonate 
ultramafic lithologies.
Pernatty:
The Pernatty deposit is hosted within a granophyric phase of a gabbro and is controlled by 
a structurally complex interaction of a number of major shear zones. Shearing has altered 
the  original  granophyric  quartz  dolerite  to  a  biotite-carbonate-plagioclase-pyrite  schist. 
The sequence has also been intruded by mafic and felsic porphyritic dykes, which are also 
mineralised.

CMGP
The CMGP is located in the Achaean Murchison Province, a granite-greenstone terrane in the 
northwest of the Yilgarn Craton. Greenstone belts trending north-northeast are separated by 
granite-gneiss domes, with smaller granite plutons also present within or on the margins of 
the belts.
Mineralisation  at  Big  Bell  is  hosted  in  the  shear  zone  (Mine  Sequence)  and  is  associated 
with  the  post-peak  metamorphic  retrograde  assemblages.  Stibnite,  native  antimony  and 
trace  arsenopyrite  are  disseminated  through  the  K-feldspar-rich  lode  schist.  These  are 
intergrown with pyrite and pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite. Mineralisation outside the typical Big 
Bell host rocks (KPSH), for example 1,600N and Shocker, also display a very strong W-As-Sb 
geochemical halo.
Numerous gold deposits occur within the Cuddingwarra Project area, the majority of which 
are hosted within the central mafic-ultramafic ± felsic porphyry sequence. Within this broad 
framework,  mineralisation  is  shown  to  be  spatially  controlled  by  competency  contrasts 
across, and flexures along, layer-parallel D2 shear zones, and is maximised when transected 
by corridors of northeast striking D3 faults and fractures.
The  Great  Fingall  Dolerite  hosts  the  majority  gold  mineralisation  within  the  portion  of  the 
greenstone belt proximal to Cue (The Day Dawn Project Area). Unit AGF3 is the most brittle 
of all the five units and this characteristic is responsible for its role as the most favourable 
lithological host to gold mineralisation in the Greenstone Belt.
FGP
The Fortnum deposits are Paleoproterozoic shear-hosted gold deposits within the Fortnum 
Wedge, a localised thrust duplex of Narracoota Formation within the overlying Ravelstone 
Formation. Both stratigraphic formations comprise part of the Bryah Basin in the Capricorn 
Orogen, Western Australia.
The Horseshoe Cassidy deposits are hosted within the Ravelstone Formation (siltstone and 
argillite) and Narracoota Formation (highly-altered, moderate to strongly deformed mafic to 
ultramafic rocks). The main zone of mineralisation is developed within a horizon of highly 
altered magnesian basalt. Gold mineralisation is associated with strong vein stock works that 
are confined to the altered mafic. Alteration consists of two types; stockwork proximal silica-
carbonate-fuchsite-haematite-pyrite and distal silica-haematite-carbonate+/- chlorite.
The  Peak  Hill  district  represents  remnants  of  a  Proterozoic  fold  belt  comprising  highly 
deformed trough and shelf sediments and mafic / ultramafic volcanics, which are generally 
moderately metamorphosed (except for the Peak Hill Metamorphic Suite).

Current and historical mining activities across the Higginsville region provide significant 
confidence in the geological interpretation of all projects.
No alternative interpretations are currently considered viable.
In all cases the local lithological and structural geology has been used to inform the 
interpretive process. All available information from drilling, underground mapping and pit 
mapping has been considered during interpretation.
The Trident, Corona, Fairplay, Vine and Two boys deposits are all hosted within a suite of 
east over west thrust repeated mafic, ultramafic and sedimentary rocks. In all cases the 
most favourable host is of mafic composition, generally gabbro and to a lesser extent basalt. 
Together the deposits form what is locally referred to as the Higginsville Line of Lode, a 5km 
long, north-northeast striking mineralised corridor of historic and current mining operations. 
Steep west and shallow east have been identified as the most favourable structural 
orientations for mineralisation.
At Chalice, multiple generations of unmineralised felsic intrusive cross cut the host 
amphibolite and influence both the volume and the grade, through contact remobilisation, 
of the mineralisation. The Resource Estimate is sensitive to the volume of unmineralised 
felsics within the mineralised horizon.
At both Chalice and Lake Cowan there is a lack of consistent visual proxies for 
mineralisation, making accurate ore delineation difficult.
High-grade zones within the palaeochannels are the result of a more preferential 
depositional environment due to changes in strike of the palaeochannel.

SKO
HBJ:
The mineralisation has been modelled focussing on the structural (shear zone) and 
lithological (porphyry mainly) controls. The large scale (1.9km long and ~40m wide) 
provides significant confidence in the geological and grade continuity within the deposit. 
The interpretation has used predominantly RC drilling with some DD used for the deeper 
parts of the resource.
There is an alternative interpretation that could be applied to this deposit, which focuses 
on defining and sub-domaining higher grade mineralisation that is evident at lithological 
contacts.
Mount Marion:
The lithological and structural model for the Mount Marion deposit is well understood as it is 
supported by the knowledge gained from open-pit and underground operations.
The mineralisation is hosted along a dilational flexure within the lode gneiss with clearly 
defined contact mineralisation with the surrounding ultramafic lithologies. The lithological 
model is used as the basis for the mineralisation interpretation and has been derived from 
predominantly RC and Diamond drill-holes. The confidence of the geological controls on 
mineralisation is consistent with the resource classification applied to the deposit. No 
alternative interpretations have been devised for this deposit.
Mount Martin:
Gold mineralisation at Mount Martin is associated with chlorite schists (shear zones) 
hosted within talc-carbonate ultramafic lithologies. Within these controlling shear zones are 
a series of stacked, westerly-dipping, sulphide and quartz carbonate bearing lodes which 
host the majority of the gold mineralisation. The geological and mineralisation interpretation 
used in this resource is consistent with that mined historically in the open pit. Although 
other interpretations have been proposed they tend to be variations on the steep westerly-
dipping lodes theme adopted for this resource and as such would not represent a significant 
change in the contained metal.
Pernatty:
Mineralisation at Pernatty is controlled by a complex arrangement of very well-defined shear 
zones with the highest grade mineralisation associated with structural intersections and 
flexures along the three main shears. Given the consistency in orientation of the three main 
controlling shears, the confidence in the geological and mineralisation interpretation is 
deemed adequate.

Mining has occurred since 1800’s providing significant confidence in the currently geological 
interpretation across all projects.
No alternative interpretations are currently considered viable.
Geological interpretation of the deposit was carried out using a systematic approach to ensure 
that the resultant estimated Mineral Resource figure was both sufficiently constrained, and 
representative of the expected sub-surface conditions. In all aspects of resource estimation 
the factual and interpreted geology was used to guide the development of the interpretation.
The structural regime is the dominant control on geological and grade continuity at the CMGP. 
Lithological factors such as rheology contrast are secondary controls on grade distribution.
FGP
Low-grade stockpiles are derived from previous mining of the mineralisation styles outlined 
above.
Geological matrixes were established to assist with interpretation and construction of the 
estimation domains.
Confidence in the interpretation is high as the geometry, geology, alteration and tenor of the 
mineralised zones was observed to be consistent along strike and down dip
The interpretations was based on 10m and 20m north-south spaced sections.
The  information  used  in  the  construction  and  estimation  of  the  respective  resources 
mineralisation is based on Air Core (AC), Reverse Circulation (RC) and Diamond Drill (DDH) 
hole information. The AC was included in the poorly information estimation domains and this 
was considered during the classification of these domains.

HGO
For Trident, Chalice, Two Boys, Vine and Lake Cowan the modelling and estimation work was 
undertaken by Alacer Gold and carried out in Vulcan 3D mining software. For Alacer Gold 
estimates the drill hole data to be used in the process was first validated.
The initial interpretation was then completed on 1:250 scale hardcopy cross sections, 
long sections and level plans, this interpretation was then validated by either the senior 
geologists or the Chief Geologist before then being digitised into the Vulcan 3D modelling 
package. The digitised polygons form the basis of the three dimensional orebody wireframe. 
Wireframing is then carried out using a combination of automated stitching algorithms and 
manual triangulation to create an accurate three dimensional representation of the sub-
surface mineralised body.
Drillhole intersections within the mineralised body are defined, these intersections are 
then used to flag the appropriate sections of the drillhole database tables for compositing 
purposes. Drillholes are subsequently composited to allow for grade estimation. In all 
aspects of resource estimation the factual and interpreted geology was used to guide the 
development of the interpretation.
Once the sample data has been composited, a statistical analysis is undertaken to assist 
with determining estimation search parameters, top-cuts etc., this is carried out using 
Supervisor. Top cut analysis was carried out by assessing normal and log-histograms 
for extreme values and using a combination of mean variance plots and population 
disintegration techniques. Variographic analysis of individual domains is undertaken to 
assist with determining appropriate search parameters. In all cases knowledge of the 
geology was used to guide the analysis of the variogram fans in determining the orientation 
of maximum continuity.
An empty block model is then created for the area of interest; with each ore wireframe 
used to assign block domain codes which match the flag used for the composites. This 
model contains attributes set at background values for gold as well as density, and various 
estimation parameters that are subsequently used to assist in resource categorisation. The 
block sizes used in the model will vary depending on orebody geometry, minimum mining 
units, estimation parameters and levels of informing data available.
Grade estimation is then undertaken, with ordinary kriging estimation as standard, although 
in some circumstances where sample populations are small, or domains are unable to 
be accurately defined, inverse distance weighting estimation techniques will be used. At 
Trident a grade assignment method has been employed for the Athena orebody. This uses 
face sampling/mapping on each level to identify runs of vein with similar width and grade 
profiles. For each run, the length of the run and average vein width is calculated as well 
as a width weighted average vein grade. Two or more grade runs are then joined up across 
levels to form a grade block, a long section is used to validate the plunge of each grade block 
against the diamond drilling. The length and width of each run is used to calculate a length 
weighted average grade and an average vein width for the block. A wireframe for each grade 
block is created at the specified average vein width for the block. This wireframe is then 
assigned the previously calculated block grade using a post process script.

The HBJ mineral resource estimate was undertaken in December 2011 by Widenbar and 
Associates Pty Ltd. The grade interpolation method used was Ordinary Kriging (OK) in the 
Datamine ESTIMA process – a method that is appropriate for the style of mineralisation 
being estimated. A simple unfolding process has been applied to the data and model blocks 
in order to simplify the setup of search ellipses and allow searches to follow the varying dip 
and strike of the various domains.
Geological, mining as-built and mineralisation domains and a valid drillhole database were 
supplied by SKO personnel. The geological and mineralisation domains were used to control 
the interpolation as hard boundaries (mineralisation domains) and for the application of 
bulk density data (geological boundaries).
The Mineral Resource estimates for Mount Marion, Mount Martin and Pernatty were 
undertaken by Alacer Gold in September 2011. The geological and mineralisation wireframes 
as well as the grade interpolation was undertaken in Vulcan 8.04 3-D modelling software 
with statistical analysis undertaken using Snowden Supervisor software. The interpolation 
method used was Ordinary Kriging (OK) – a method that is appropriate for the styles of 
mineralisation being estimated.
Statistical analysis was undertaken to determine the composite length (1m) and for the 
application of top-cuts.
The search ellipses applied were based on a combination of drillhole spacing and 
variographic analysis. Various minimum and maximum samples were used in the first 
search with a maximum of four samples per drill-hole allowed. Several passes were used 
each with increasing search ellipse sizes, all the blocks in the mineralised domains were 
informed in the first pass.
The block model was depleted using surfaces / domains generated by the SKO Survey. 
Validation of the models was completed by visual inspection, statistical comparisons and 
comparison with reconciliation data, with the final model achieving a satisfactory validation.
No deleterious elements were estimated as they are considered not material.

All modelling and estimation work undertaken by Metals X is carried out in three dimensions 
via Surpac Vision.
After validating the drillhole data to be used in the estimation, interpretation of the orebody 
is undertaken in sectional and / or plan view to create the outline strings which form the 
basis of the three dimensional orebody wireframe. Wireframing is then carried out using 
a combination of automated stitching algorithms and manual triangulation to create an 
accurate three dimensional representation of the sub-surface mineralised body.
Drillhole intersections within the mineralised body are defined, these intersections are 
then used to flag the appropriate sections of the drillhole database tables for compositing 
purposes. Drillholes are subsequently composited to allow for grade estimation. In all 
aspects of resource estimation the factual and interpreted geology was used to guide the 
development of the interpretation.
Once the sample data has been composited, a statistical analysis is undertaken to assist 
with determining estimation search parameters, top-cuts etc. Variographic analysis of 
individual domains is undertaken to assist with determining appropriate search parameters. 
Which are then incorporated with observed geological and geometrical features to 
determine the most appropriate search parameters.
An empty block model is then created for the area of interest. This model contains attributes 
set at background values for the various elements of interest as well as density, and various 
estimation parameters that are subsequently used to assist in resource categorisation. The 
block sizes used in the model will vary depending on orebody geometry, minimum mining 
units, estimation parameters and levels of informing data available.
Grade estimation is then undertaken, with ordinary kriging estimation method is considered 
as standard, although in some circumstances where sample populations are small, or 
domains are unable to be accurately defined, inverse distance weighting estimation 
techniques will be used. Both by-product and deleterious elements are estimated at the 
time of primary grade estimation if required. It is assumed that by-products correlate well 
with gold. There are no assumptions made about the recovery of by-products.
The resource is then depleted for mining voids and subsequently classified in line with JORC 
guidelines utilising a combination of various estimation derived parameters and geological / 
mining knowledge.
This approach has proven to be applicable to Metals X’s gold assets.
Estimation results are routinely validated against primary input data, previous estimates 
and mining output.
Good reconciliation between mine claimed figures and milled figures was routinely achieved 
during past production history.

All modelling and estimation work undertaken by Metals X is carried out in three dimensions 
with Surpac Vision, Snowden’s Supervisor v8.3 and or Isatis 2015.
Ordinary kriging (OK) and Localised Indicator Kriging (LIK) has been used. LIK was used 
for the estimation of all Jasperoid related estimation domains due to mosaic mineralisation 
style. Length weighting of assay values related to surveyed volumes was undertaken for 
low-grade stockpiles.
All estimates were validated where possible against historical production records and 
previous estimates.
After validating the drillhole data to be used in the estimation, interpretation of the orebody 
is undertaken in sectional and / or plan view to create the outline strings which form the 
basis of the three dimensional orebody wireframe. Wireframing was carried out using 
a combination of automated stitching algorithms and manual triangulation to create an 
accurate three dimensional representation of the sub-surface mineralised body. Domaining 
was constructed on 20m and 10m spaced sections and was based on logged lithologies, 
quartz percentage and gold value.
Drillhole intersections within the mineralised body are defined; these intersections are 
then used to flag the appropriate sections of the drillhole database tables for compositing 
purposes. Assay data was composited to 1m downhole using Surpac “best fit” algorithm. 
The “best fit” algorithm eliminates residual composites and the estimation domains 
boundaries defined the start and end position of the compositing routine. In all aspects of 
resource estimation; the factual and interpreted geology was used to guide the development 
of the interpretation.
Support analysis of the difference drill types (Air Core (AC), Reverse Circulation (RC) and 
Diamond Drill holes (DDH)) was performed and the mixing these deemed acceptable. The AC 
drill holes were used in the estimation of the poorly informed estimation domains.
Statistical analysis was carried out on the composited data to assist with determining 
estimation search parameters, top-cuts and spatial continuity. Data for some of the 
domains exhibit an increased degree of skewness and top-cuts were applied to reduce 
the skewness of distribution. The appropriateness of the top-cuts was assessed for each 
domain utilising log-probability plots, mean and variance plots, histograms and univariate 
statistics for the composite Au variable.
Variogram modelling was undertaken using Isatis™ software and defined the spatial 
continuity of gold within all domains and these parameters were used for the interpolation 
process. Indicator variograms were generated within the Jasperoid related estimation 
domains to the used in the LIK estimation process.
Volume models were generated in Surpac using topographic surfaces, oxidation surfaces 
and mineralised zone wireframes as constraints.

Quantitative Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis was used optimise the search parameters.
Search ellipses were aligned parallel to the maximum continuity defined during the 
variographic analysis. The search dimensions, generally, approximated the ranges of the 
interpreted variograms and ranged from 50 to 100m. The minimum and maximum number 
of samples range from 7 to 11 and 18 to 30, respectively. Second and third pass searches 
were implement to fill the un-estimated cells / blocks if they were not estimated during the 
first search pass and these search parameters involved increasing in the search distances 
and reducing in the minimum number of samples used in the estimation process.
The extrapolation was control through the interpreted estimation domains, which was 
limited to half the drill hole spacing within section and half the section spacing between 
sections.
Block estimation for gold was undertaken using Isatis™ and hard boundaries were used 
between domains for estimation of gold grade.
No assumptions were made about recovery during the OK and LIK estimation processes.
Grade estimation was undertaken, with the ordinary kriging (OK) estimation method for all 
non-jasperoid related estimation domains.
Check estimates were run using Localised Uniform Conditioning (LUC) for the LIK estimation 
domains, which produces a similar form of result to LIK. The LIK and LUC models were 
compared, with reasonable agreement at lower cut-offs and differences at higher cut-offs 
reflecting higher estimated gold variability in the LIK model. The LIK is believed to be better 
suited to the style of mineralisation for the Jasperoid related estimation domains.
The estimation is validated using the following: a visual interrogation, a comparison of 
the mean composite grade to the mean block grade for each domain, a comparison of the 
wireframe volume to the block volume for each domain, grade trend plots (moving window 
statistics), comparison to the previous resource estimate. 
The only element of economic interest modelled is gold.
The Isatis™ block models were transferred and imported to Surpac Mining Software. The 
transfer and importing process was validated against the Isatis™ block model. The resource 
was then depleted for mining voids and subsequently classified in line with JORC guidelines 
utilising a combination of various estimation derived parameters and geological / mining 
knowledge.
Tonnage estimates are dry tonnes.
The cut off grades used for the reporting of the Mineral Resources have been selected 
based on the style of mineralisation, depth from surface of the mineralisation and the most 
probable extraction technique.

The Fortnum Gold Mine Operation ceased production in May 2007 when owned by Gleneagle 
Gold. Previous to this the operation was operated by Perilya and Homestake, and first began 
commercial mining operations in the late 1980’s. Extensive mining and processing records 
are therefore available in each of the deposits. 
Various open pit styles and host domains have been mined since discovery of the area by 
Homestake in 1980’s. Mining during this time has ranged from open pit cut backs, virgin 
surface excavations to extensional underground developments. 
The Fortnum Gold Mine Open Pit and Underground inventory had a Pre-feasibility study 
completed by MLX in early 2016. Additional cost details, operational constraints and a 
revision of the Resources (with classification) have continued since this initial financial 
evaluation. A Feasibility Study was completed on these revisions and therefore forms

mine designs rather than Resource conversion factors or Whittle optimisations.
HGO
Mining methodologies for underground Reserves centre on long hole open stoping. However, 
there are areas which are designed as narrow vein up hole or flat bench stoping. All methods 
described in the Reserve have either been trialled successfully and/or implemented 
historically. The stope design parameters take into account the different mining shapes and 
are based on specific geology and geotechnical domains associated with those areas. Stope 
shapes, level layouts and extraction sequences are designed cognisant of local and regional 
ground conditions. Where deteriorating ground conditions are expected or where significant 
fault planes run adjacent to mineralisation, stope shapes are altered to encompass these 
conditions and sequenced early to ensure recovery is possible.
Dilution factors vary pending the orebody style and host rock conditions as well as from 
mining sequence and development layouts.
Each mining method applied has a minimum width, which corresponds to sub level 
distances, blast hole drill accuracy constraints, nature of the mineralisation and/or fleet 
flexibility.
•  With the implementation of paste filling at Trident and the utilisation of remote loaders with
telecabins, a 100% mining recovery factor is applied to the stope physicals.

Open Pit Methodology.
Following consideration of the various modifying factors the following rules were applied to 
the reserve estimation process for the conversion of measured and indicated resource to 
reserve for suitable evaluation.
The mining shape in the reserve estimation is generated by a wireframe (geology 
interpretation of the ore zone) which overlays the block model. Where the wire frame cuts 
the primary block, sub blocks fill out the remaining space to the wire frame boundary 
(effectively the mining shape). It is reasonable to assume that the mining method can 
selectively mine to the wire frame boundary with the additional dilution provision stated in 
point 4 below.
Ore Reserves are based on Pit shape designs – with appropriate modifications to the original 
Whittle Shell outlines to ensure compliance with practical mining parameters. 
Geotechnical parameters allied to the Open Pit Reserves are either based on observed 
existing pit shape specifics or domain specific expectations / assumptions. Various 
geotechnical reports and retrospective reconciliations were considered in the 2016 design 
parameters. A majority of the open pits have a final design wall angle of 38-420, which is 
seen as conservative.   
Dilution of the ore through the mining process has been accounted for within the Reserve 
quoted inventory. Various dilution ratios are used to represent the style of mineralization. 
Where continuous, consistent ore boundaries and grade represent the mineralised 
system the following factors are applied: oxide 15%, transitional 17% and fresh 19%. In 
circumstances where the orebody is less homogenous above the COG then the following 
dilution factors are applied in order to model correctly the inherent variability of extracting 
discrete sections of the pit floor: oxide 17%, transitional 19% and fresh 21%.  To ensure clarity, 
the following percentages are additional ore mined in relation to excavating the wire frame 
boundary as identified in point 1 above, albeit at a grade of 0.0 g/t. The amount of dilution is 
considered appropriate based on orebody geometry, historical mining performance and the 
size of mining equipment to be used to extract ore.
Expected mining recovery of the ore has been set at 93%.
Minimum Mining widths have been accounted for in the designs, with the utilization of 90T 
trucking parameters.

No specific ground support requirements are needed outside of suitable pit slope design 
criteria based on specific geotechnical domains.
Mining sequence is included in the mine scheduling process for determining the economic 
evaluation and takes into account available operating time and mining equipment size and 
performance.
No Inferred material is included within the open pit statement, though in various pit shapes 
inferred material is present. In these situations this inferred material is classified as waste.
Underground Methodology.
All Underground Reserves are based on 3D design strings and polygon derived stope shapes 
following the Measured and Indicated Resource (in areas above the COG). A complete mine 
schedule is then derived from this design to create a LOM plan and financial analysis.  
Mining methodology is based on previous mining experience. All mining systems within the 
Reserve statement are standardized, mechanized Western Australian methods.
In large disseminated orebodies a sub level open stoping or single level bench stoping 
production methodology is used. 
In narrow vein laminated quartz hosted domains a conservative narrow bench style mining 
method is used. 
In narrow flat dipping deposits a Flat Long Hole process is adopted (with fillets in the 
footwall for rill angle) and or Jumbo stoping. 
Stope shape parameters have been based on historical data (where possible) or expected 
stable hydraulic radius dimensions.
Stope inventories have been determined by cutting the geological wireframe at above 
the area specific COG and applying mining dilution and ore loss factors. The ore loss 
ratio accounts for pillar locations between the stopes (not operational ore loss) whilst 
dilution allows for conversion of the geological wireframe into a minable shape as well as 
hangingwall relaxation.  A 20% dilution factor and 10% loss ratio has been subsequently 
applied to the Starlight Reserve statement.
Minimum mining widths have been applied in the various mining methods. The only 
production style relevant to this constraint is ‘narrow stoping’ – where the minimum width 
is set at 1.5m in an 18.5m sub level interval. 
Mining operational recovery for the underground mines is set at 100% due to the use of 
remote loading units as well as paste filling activities. 
Stope shape dimensions vary between the various methods. Default hydraulic radii are 
applied to each method, and are derived either from historical production or geotechnical 
reports / recommendations. Where no data or exposure is available conservative HR values 
are used based on the contact domain type.  
Mining sequence is included in the mine scheduling process for determining the economic 
evaluation and takes into account available operating time and mining equipment size and 
performance.

Commentary
HGO
Gold extraction is achieved using staged crushing, ball milling with gravity concentration 
and Carbon in Leach. The Higginsville plant has operated since 2008 and historical 
recoveries on Trident ore average 97% 
Treatment of ore is via conventional gravity recovery / intensive cyanidation and CIL is 
applied as industry standard technology.
Additional test-work is instigated where notable changes to geology and mineralogy 
are identified. Small scale batch leach tests on primary Louis ore have indicated lower 
recoveries (80%) associated with finer gold and sulphide mineralisation.
There have been no major examples of deleterious elements affecting gold extraction 
levels or bullion quality. Some minor variations in sulphide mineralogy have had short-term 
impacts on reagent consumptions.
No bulk sample testing is required whilst geology/mineralogy is consistent based on 
treatment plant performance.
SKO
A long history of processing through the existing facility demonstrates the appropriateness 
of the process to the styles of mineralisation considered.
No deleterious elements are considered, as a long history of processing has shown this to 
be not a material concern.
CMGP
A long history of processing through the existing facility demonstrates the appropriateness 
of the process to the styles of mineralisation considered.
No deleterious elements are considered, as a long history of processing has shown this to 
be not a material concern.
FGP
Fortnum Gold Mine has an existing conventional CIL processing plant – which has been 
operational in various periods since the late 1980’s. The plant has a nameplate capacity of 
1.0Mtpa though this can be varied between 0.8-1.2Mtpa pending rosters and material type.
Grind size for the sulphide material has historically been 130 µm.
An extensive database of historical CIL recoveries as well as detailed metallurgical test work 
is available for the various deposits and these have been incorporated into the COG analysis 
and financial models. 
For the 2016 Reserve, Plant recoveries of 93-95% have been utilised.

Resources (if any).
Audits or reviews
•
The results of any audits or reviews of Ore Reserve estimates.
•
•
• 
•
The basis for classification of the resource into different categories is made on a subjective 
basis. Measured Resources have a high level of confidence and are generally defined in 
three dimensions and have been accurately defined or capitally and normally developed. 
Indicated resources have a slightly lower level of confidence but contain substantial drilling 
and are in most instances capitally developed or well defined from a mining perspective. 
Inferred resources always contain significant geological evidence of existence and are 
drilled, but not to the same density. There is no classification of any resource that isn’t 
drilled or defined by substantial physical sampling works.
Some Measured Resources have been classified as Proven and some are defined as 
Probable Reserves based on internal judgements.
The result appropriately reflects the Competent Person’s view of the deposit.
Site generated reserves and the parent data and economic evaluation data is routinely 
reviewed by the Metals X Corporate technical team.

JORC Code Explanation
•  Where appropriate a statement of the relative accuracy and confidence level in the Ore
Reserve estimate using an approach or procedure deemed appropriate by the Competent 
Person. For example, the application of statistical or geostatistical procedures to quantify 
the relative accuracy of the reserve within stated confidence limits, or, if such an approach 
is not deemed appropriate, a qualitative discussion of the factors which could affect the 
relative accuracy and confidence of the estimate.
The statement should specify whether it relates to global or local estimates, and, if local, 
state the relevant tonnages, which should be relevant to technical and economic evaluation. 
Documentation should include assumptions made and the procedures used.
Accuracy and confidence discussions should extend to specific discussions of any applied 
Modifying Factors that may have a material impact on Ore Reserve viability, or for which 
there are remaining areas of uncertainty at the current study stage.
It is recognised that this may not be possible or appropriate in all circumstances. These

HGO
Trident reserves are reflective of current operating practices and mine planning processes. 
All currently reported reserve calculations are considered representative on a local scale. 
Regular mine reconciliations occur to validate and test the accuracy of the estimates at 
Trident. A comprehensive production history confirms the validity of the Trident reserve.
Reserve calculations for open pits are cognisant of the historical geological, geotechnical 
and mining data. Confidence in the Reserve is further achieved with the validation of 
historical production data and observation of structural orientations on the existing pit 
walls.
SKO
All currently reported reserve calculations are considered representative on a local scale. 
Regular mine reconciliations occur to validate and test the accuracy of the estimates at SKO.
CMGP
The ore reserve has been completed to a DFS standard and benchmarked against local site 
historical production and experience, hence confidence in the estimates is high.
FGP
Various sensitivity analyses have been undertaken on the 2016 Reserve models in order to 
understand and subsequently control risk.

SECTION 1 SAMPLING TECHNIQUES AND DATA
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.)
Criteria
Sampling techniques
Drilling techniques
Drill sample recovery
JORC Code Explanation
•
Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised 
industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such 
as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should 
not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate 
calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report.
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be relatively simple 
(eg ‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was 
pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation may be 
required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual 
commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of 
detailed information.
Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, 
sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, 
face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc).
Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed.
Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the 
samples.
•
• 
•
•
• 
•
•  Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias
may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material.
Commentary
•
Diamond Drilling
The bulk of the data used in resource calculations at Renison has been gathered from 
diamond core. Three sizes have been used historically NQ2 (45.1mm nominal core 
diameter), LTK60 (45.2mm nominal core diameter) and LTK48 (36.1mm nominal core 
diameter), with NQ2 currently in use. This core is geologically logged and subsequently 
halved for sampling. Grade control holes may be whole-cored to streamline the core 
handling process if required.
NQ and HQ core sizes have been recorded as being used at Mount Bischoff. This core is 
geologically logged and subsequently halved for sampling.
There is no diamond drilling for the Rentails Project.
Face Sampling
Each development face / round is horizontally chip sampled at Renison. The sampling 
intervals are domained by geological constraints (e.g. rock type, veining and alteration 
/ sulphidation etc.). Samples are taken in a range from 0.3m up to 1.2m in waste. All 
exposures within the orebody are sampled. A similar process would have been followed for 
historical Mount Bischoff face sampling.
There is no face sampling for the Rentails Project.
Sludge Drilling
Sludge drilling at Renison is performed with an underground production drill rig. It is an 
open hole drilling method using water as the flushing medium, with a 64mm (nominal) hole 
diameter. Sample intervals are ostensibly the length of the drill steel. Holes are drilled at 
sufficient angles to allow flushing of the hole with water following each interval to prevent 
contamination.
There is no sludge drilling for the Mount Bischoff Project.
There is no sludge drilling for the Rentails Project.
RC Drilling
RC drilling has been utilised at Mount Bischoff.
Drill cuttings are extracted from the RC return via cyclone. The underflow from each interval 
is transferred via bucket to a four tiered riffle splitter, delivering approximately three 
kilograms of the recovered material into calico bags for analysis. The residual material is 
retained on the ground near the hole. Composite samples are obtained from the residue 
material for initial analysis, with the split samples remaining with the individual residual 
piles until required for re-split analysis or eventual disposal.
There is no RC drilling for the Renison Project.
There is no RC drilling for the Rentails Project.

Percussion Drilling
This drilling method was used for the Rentails project and uses a rotary tubular drilling cutter 
which was driven percussively into the tailings. The head of the cutting tube consisted of a 
50mm diameter hard tipped cutting head inside which were fitted 4 spring steel fingers which 
allowed the core sample to enter and then prevented it from falling out as the drill tube was 
withdrawn from the drill hole.
There is no percussion drilling for the Renison Project.
There is no percussion drilling for the Mount Bischoff Project.
All geology input is logged and validated by the relevant area geologists, incorporated into 
this  is  assessment  of  sample  recovery.  No  defined  relationship  exists  between  sample 
recovery and grade. Nor has sample bias due to preferential loss or gain of fine or coarse 
material been noted.
Diamond core is logged geologically and geotechnically.
RC chips are logged geologically.
Development faces are mapped geologically.
Logging is qualitative in nature.
All holes are logged completely, all faces are mapped completely.
Drill core is halved for sampling. Grade control holes may be whole-cored to streamline the 
core handling process if required.
Samples are dried at 90°C, then crushed to <3mm. Samples are then riffle split to obtain a 
sub-sample of approximately 100g which is then pulverized to 90% passing 75um. 2g of the 
pulp sample is then weighed with 12g of reagents including a binding agent, the weighed 
sample is then pulverised again for one minute. The sample is then compressed into a 
pressed powder tablet for introduction to the XRF. This preparation has been proven to be 
appropriate for the style of mineralisation being considered.
QA/QC is ensured during the sub-sampling stages process via the use of the systems of an 
independent NATA / ISO accredited laboratory contractor.
The sample size is considered appropriate for the grain size of the material being sampled.
The un-sampled half of diamond core is retained for check sampling if required.
For RC chips regular field duplicates are collected and analysed for significant variance to 
primary results.

Commentary
•
Assaying is undertaken via the pressed powder XRF technique. Sn, As and Cu have a 
detection limit 0.01%, Fe and S detection limits are 0.1%. These assay methodologies are 
appropriate for the resource in question.
All assay data has built in quality control checks. Each XRF batch of twenty consists of one 
blank, one internal standard, one duplicate and a replicate, anomalies are re-assayed to 
ensure quality control.
Specific gravity / density values for individual areas are routinely sampled during all 
diamond drilling where material is competent enough to do so.
Anomalous intervals as well as random intervals are routinely checked assayed as part of 
the internal QA/QC process.
Virtual twinned holes have been drilled in several instances across all sites with no 
significant issues highlighted. Drillhole data is also routinely confirmed by development 
assay data in the operating environment.
Primary data is loaded into the drillhole database system and then archived for reference.
All data used in the calculation of resources and reserves are compiled in databases 
(underground and open pit) which are overseen and validated by senior geologists.
No primary assays data is modified in any way.
All data is spatially oriented by survey controls via direct pickups by the survey department. 
Drillholes are all surveyed downhole, currently with a GyroSmart tool in the underground 
environment at Renison, and a multishot camera for the typically short surface diamond 
holes.
All drilling and resource estimation is undertaken in local mine grid at the various sites.
Topographic control is generated from remote sensing methods in general, with ground 
based surveys undertaken where additional detail is required. This methodology is 
adequate for the resource in question.
Drilling in the underground environment at Renison is nominally carried-out on 40m x 
40m spacing in the south of the mine and 25m, x 25m spacing in the north of the mine 
prior to mining occurring. A lengthy history of mining has shown that this data spacing is 
appropriate for the Mineral Resource estimation process and to allow for classification of the 
resource as it stands.
Drilling at Mount Bischoff is variably spaced. A lengthy history of mining has shown that 
this data spacing is appropriate for the Mineral resource estimation process and to allow for

Drilling at Rentails is usually carried out on a 100m centres. This is appropriate for the 
Mineral resource estimation process and to allow for classification of the resource as it

All Tasmania resources are hosted within 12M1995 and 12M2006. Both tenements are 
standard Tasmanian mining leases.
No native title interests are recorded against the Tasmanian tenements.
Tasmanian tenements are held by the Bluestone Mines Tasmania Joint Venture of which 
Metals X has 50% ownership.
No royalties above legislated state royalties apply for the Tasmanian tenements.
Bluestone Mines Tasmania Joint Venture operates in accordance with all environmental 
conditions set down as conditions for grant of the mining leases.
There are no known issues regarding security of tenure.
The Renison and Mount Bischoff areas have an exploration and production history in excess 
of 100 years.
Bluestone Mines Tasmania Joint Venture work has generally confirmed the veracity of 
historic exploration data.
Renison is one of the world’s largest operating underground tin mines and Australia’s largest 
primary tin producer. Renison is the largest of three major Skarn, carbonate replacement, 
pyrrhotite-cassiterite deposits within western Tasmania. The Renison Mine area is situated 
in the Dundas Trough, a province underlain by a thick sequence of Neoproterozoic-Cambrian 
siliciclastic and volcaniclastic rocks. At Renison there are three shallow-dipping dolomite 
horizons which host replacement mineralisation.
Mount Bischoff is the second of three major Skarn, carbonate replacement, pyrrhotite- 
cassiterite deposits within western Tasmania. The Mount Bischoff Mine area is situated 
within the Dundas Trough, a province underlain by a thick sequence of Neoproterozoic- 
Cambrian siliciclastic and volcaniclastic rocks. At Mount Bischoff folded and faulted 
shallow-dipping dolomite horizons host replacement mineralisation with fluid interpreted 
to be sourced from the forceful emplacement of a granite ridge and associated porphyry 
intrusions associated with the Devonian Meredith Granite, which resulted in the complex 
brittle / ductile deformation of the host rocks. Lithologies outside the current mining 
area are almost exclusively metamorphosed siltstones. Major porphyry dykes and faults 
such as the Giblin and Queen provided the major focus for ascending hydrothermal 
fluids from a buried ridge of the Meredith Granite. Mineralisation has resulted in tin-rich 
sulphide replacement in the dolomite lodes, greisen and sulphide lodes in the porphyry 
and fault / vein lodes in the major faults. All lodes contain tin as cassiterite within sulphide 
mineralisation with some coarse cassiterite as veins throughout the lodes.
The Rentails resource is contained within three Tailing Storage Facilities (TSF’s) that have 
been built up from the processing of tin ore at the Renison Bell mine over the period 1968 to 
2013.

Commentary
•
Drillhole data is stored in a Maxwell’s DataShed system based on the Sequel Server platform 
which is currently considered “industry standard”.
As new data is acquired it passes through a validation approval system designed to pick-
up any significant errors before the information is loaded into the master database. The 
information is uploaded by a series of Sequel routines and is performed as required. The 
database contains diamond drilling (including geotechnical and specific gravity data), face 
chip and sludge drilling data and some associated metadata. By its nature this database is 
large in size, and therefore exports from the main database are undertaken (with or without 
the application of spatial and various other filters) to create a database of workable size, 
preserve a snapshot of the database at the time of orebody modelling and interpretation 
and preserve the integrity of the master database.
Mr. Russell visits Metals X Gold Operations regularly.
Mining has occurred since 1800’s providing significant confidence in the currently 
geological interpretation across all projects.
No alternative interpretations are currently considered viable.
Geological interpretation of the deposit was carried out using a systematic approach 
to ensure that the resultant estimated Mineral Resource figure was both sufficiently 
constrained, and representative of the expected sub-surface conditions. In all aspects of 
resource estimation the factual and interpreted geology was used to guide the development 
of the interpretation.
The architecture of the Renison horst / graben system is the dominant control on geological 
and grade continuity.
Similarly at Mount Bischoff the extent of intrusive felsic dykes in proximity to carbonate 
horizons control the continuity of grade within the system.
The depositional history of Rentails is well documented.
Renison has currently been mined over a strike length of >1,950m, a lateral extent of 
>1,250m and a depth of over 1,100m.
Mount Bischoff mineralisation has currently been defined over a strike length of >600m, a 
lateral extent of >250m and a depth of >250m.
Rentails is deposited in three adjacent TSFs which have and aggregate length of 
approximately 1.8km and a width at the widest point of circa 1km. Maximum depth is in 
excess of 20m.

Commentary

All modelling and estimation work undertaken by BMTJV is carried out in three dimensions 
via Surpac Vision.
After validating the drillhole data to be used in the estimation, interpretation of the orebody 
is undertaken in sectional and / or plan view to create the outline strings which form the 
basis of the three dimensional orebody wireframe. Wireframing is then carried out using 
a combination of automated stitching algorithms and manual triangulation to create an 
accurate three dimensional representation of the sub-surface mineralised body.
Drillhole intersections within the mineralised body are defined, these intersections are 
then used to flag the appropriate sections of the drillhole database tables for compositing 
purposes. Drillholes are subsequently composited to allow for grade estimation. In all 
aspects of resource estimation the factual and interpreted geology was used to guide the 
development of the interpretation.
Once the sample data has been composited, a statistical analysis is undertaken to assist 
with determining estimation search parameters, top-cuts etc. Variographic analysis of 
individual domains is undertaken to assist with determining appropriate search parameters, 
which are then incorporated with observed geological and geometrical features to 
determine the most appropriate search parameters.
An empty block model is then created for the area of interest. This model contains attributes 
set at background values for the various elements of interest as well as density, and various 
estimation parameters that are subsequently used to assist in resource categorisation. The 
block sizes used in the model will vary depending on orebody geometry, minimum mining 
units, estimation parameters and levels of informing data available.
Grade estimation is then undertaken, with ordinary kriging estimation method is considered 
as standard, although in some circumstances where sample populations are small, or 
domains are unable to be accurately defined, inverse distance weighting estimation 
techniques will be used. Both by-product and deleterious elements are estimated at the 
time of primary grade estimation. It is assumed that by-products correlate well with tin. 
There are no assumptions made about the recovery of by-products.
The resource is then depleted for mining voids and subsequently classified in line with JORC 
guidelines utilising a combination of various estimation derived parameters and geological / 
mining knowledge.
This approach has proven to be applicable to Metals X’s tin assets.
Estimation results are routinely validated against primary input data, previous estimates 
and mining output.
Good reconciliation between mine claimed figures and milled figures is routinely achieved.
Tonnage estimates are dry tonnes.
The resource reporting cut-off grade is 0.7% Sn at Renison.
The resource reporting cut-off grade is 0.5% Sn at Mount Bischoff.
There is no lower reporting cut-off grade for Rentails.

Bulk density of the mineralisation at Renison and Mount Bischoff is variable. Bulk density 
sampling is undertaken via assessments of drill core (BMTJV practice is to undertake bulk 
density determinations on a representative selection of drill core sent for assay), and are 
reviewed constantly (BMTJV practice is to collect check SG samples as a regular part of the 
mining cycle). Where no drill core or other direct measurements are available, SG factors 
have been assumed based on similarities to other zones of mineralisation.
Given the volume of the TSF’s are known, and the tonnage of tailings material deposited into 
the dams was recorded, the insitu bulk density of the Rentails resource has been back-
calculated.
Resources are classified in line with JORC guidelines utilising a combination of various

over the past decade with small tweaks and geotechnical considerations progressively 
applied.
Mining dilution for the Mining Reserve is generally 25% at zero grade.
A minimum mining width of underground development is 3.5m and for underground stoping 
a minimum width of 1.5m and resource models are diluted to these limits before dilution 
applied.

The Renison mine produces a tin concentrate of grade varying between 50- 60 % Sn with 
internal process designed to reduce penalty metals such as iron, sulphur, tungsten and 
copper.
The metallurgical process is complex and applies several stages of gravity-type 
concentration as well as sulphide and oxide flotation, regrinding and acid leach methods.

No reserve is stated for Mount Bischoff.
Detailed economic studies of the tin market and future price estimates are considered by 
Metals X and applied in the estimation of revenue, cut-off grade analysis and future mine 
planning decisions.
There remains strong demand and no apparent risk to the long term demand for the tin 
products and / or copper products generated from the project.

Any identified material naturally occurring risks.
The status of material legal agreements and marketing arrangements.
The status of governmental agreements and approvals critical to the viability of the project,

be reasonable grounds to expect that all necessary Government approvals will be received 
within the timeframes anticipated in the Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility study. Highlight and 
discuss the materiality of any unresolved matter that is dependent on a third party on which 
extraction of the reserve is contingent.
Classification
• 
The basis for the classification of the Ore Reserves into varying confidence categories.
•  Whether the result appropriately reflects the Competent Person’s view of the deposit.
•
The proportion of Probable Ore Reserves that have been derived from Measured Mineral 
Resources (if any).

Commentary
•
As an operating mine, internal cash flow estimates and impairment models apply an implied 
8% real discount rate for NPV analysis and only economically viable ores are considered for 
mining. The mine is operated in a JV and carries no external debt.
For the Rentails Project, which is yet to be funded, an 8% real discount rate is applied to NPV 
analysis.
Sensitivity analysis of key financial and physical parameters is applied to future 
development project considerations and mine.
No reserve is stated for Mount Bischoff.
The Renison mine is fully permitted and a major contributor to the local and regional 
economy. It has no external pressures that impact its operation or which could potentially 
jeopardise its continuous operation.
The Rentails Project is yet to start and will require environmental and other regulatory 
permitting.
The Mount Bischoff Project is currently closed and the site is under care and maintenance 
whilst addition drilling and economic evaluation or remaining resources is considered.
Renison is an active mining project.
The basis for classification of the resource into different categories is made on a subjective 
basis. Measured Resources have a high level of confidence and are generally defined in 
three dimensions and have been accurately defined or capitally and normally developed. 
Indicated resources have a slightly lower level of confidence but contain substantial drilling 
and are in most instances capitally developed or well defined from a mining perspective. 
Inferred resources always contain significant geological evidence of existence and are 
drilled, but not to the same density. There is no classification of any resource that isn’t 
drilled or defined by substantial physical sampling works.
Some Measured Resources have been classified as Proven and some are defined as 
Probable Reserves based on subjective internal judgements, but generally based upon the 
intensity of capital and normal development they have been subjected to.
The result appropriately reflects the Competent Person’s view of the deposit.

JORC Code Explanation
•
The results of any audits or reviews of Ore Reserve estimates.
Commentary
•
Site generated reserves and the parent data and economic evaluation data is routinely 
reviewed by the Metals X Corporate technical team. Resources and Reserves have in the 
past been subjected to external expert reviews, which have ratified them with no issues. 
There is no regular external consultant review process in place.
All currently reported reserve calculations are considered representative on a local scale. 
Regular mine reconciliations occur to validate and test the accuracy of the estimates at 
Renison. A comprehensive production history confirms the validity of the Rentails reserve.
No reserve is stated for Mount Bischoff.
Discussion of relative 
accuracy/ confidence
•
•
•  Where appropriate a statement of the relative accuracy and confidence level in the Ore
Reserve estimate using an approach or procedure deemed appropriate by the Competent 
Person. For example, the application of statistical or geostatistical procedures to quantify 
the relative accuracy of the reserve within stated confidence limits, or, if such an approach 
is not deemed appropriate, a qualitative discussion of the factors which could affect the 
relative accuracy and confidence of the estimate.
The statement should specify whether it relates to global or local estimates, and, if local, 
state the relevant tonnages, which should be relevant to technical and economic evaluation. 
Documentation should include assumptions made and the procedures used.
Accuracy and confidence discussions should extend to specific discussions of any applied 
Modifying Factors that may have a material impact on Ore Reserve viability, or for which 
there are remaining areas of uncertainty at the current study stage.
It is recognised that this may not be possible or appropriate in all circumstances. These 
statements of relative accuracy and confidence of the estimate should be compared with 
production data, where available.

produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation may be required, such 
as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or

Commentary
Diamond Drilling
A small portion of the data used in resource calculations at the Central Musgrave Project (CMP) has 
been gathered from diamond core. This core is geologically logged prior to sampling.
RC Drilling
RC drilling has been utilised extensively at the CMP.
Drill  cuttings  are  extracted  from  the  RC  return  via  cyclone.  The  underflow  from  each  interval  is 
transferred via bucket to a four tiered riffle splitter, delivering approximately three kilograms of the 
recovered material into calico bags for analysis. The residual material is retained on the ground near 
the hole. Composite samples are obtained from the residue material for initial analysis, with the split 
samples  remaining  with  the  individual  residual  piles  until  required  for  re-split  analysis  or  eventual 
disposal.
Historical
A variety of drilling methods were employed by INCO, including churn drilling (102 holes) DDH (19 
holes) RAB Drilling (2,643 holes) Vacuum (77 holes) Becker Drilling (102 holes).
Sample recovery from early drilling by INCO is not known. Sample recovery from RC drilling carried out 
from RC drilling after 2001 was generally very good, except where the drill encountered strong water 
flow from the hole.
All  geology  input  is  logged  and  validated  by  the  relevant  area  geologists,  incorporated  into  this  is 
assessment of sample recovery. No defined relationship exists between sample recovery and grade. 
Nor has sample bias due to preferential loss or gain of fine or coarse material been noted.
Diamond core is logged geologically and geotechnically.
RC hole chips are logged geologically.
Logging is qualitative in nature.
All holes are logged completely.

Commentary
•
A sample of each 5ft of drilling from INCO drilling were quartered and forwarded for assay, either to 
AMDEL in Adelaide, or to INCO’s in-house laboratory at Blackstone.
Samples  of  RC  drilling  taken  prior  to  2006  were  composited  on  3  or  4m  basis,  and  the  composite 
assayed. A 1m riffle-split sample was also taken for each metre drilled, and was submitted for analysis 
if the composite assayed >0.4%Ni.
Sub-sampling for the 2006 and later RC drilling were riffle split each 2m sample drilled.
Chips / core chips undergo total preparation.
QA/QC is currently ensured during the sub-sampling stages process via the use of the systems of an 
independent NATA / ISO accredited laboratory contractor. A portion of the historical informing data has 
been processed by in-house laboratories.
The sample size is considered appropriate for the grain size of the material being sampled.
The un-sampled half of diamond core is retained for check sampling if required.
For RC chips regular field duplicates are collected and analysed for significant variance to primary 
results.
Samples of INCO’s drilling were dried and assayed by AAS either at AMDEL in Adelaide, or at INCO’s in-
house laboratory at Blackstone. The digest method was not specified. Samples were assayed for Ni, Co 
and Fe. Analytical quality control was maintained by the by the insertion of standard samples and re-
analysis of duplicates at separate laboratories at a frequency of two check analyses for every twenty 
samples.
Composite samples of RC drilling completed in 2001 were submitted to AMDEL, dried and pulverised, 
and assayed for Ni, Co, Ag, As, Bi, Cu, Cr, Fe, Mg, Mn, Pb, S, Sb, Ti, V, Zr, Ca and Al by HF-multi-acid digest / 
ICP-OES. The 1m riffle-splits for any composite sample assaying
>0.4%Ni were retrieved, and re-assayed using the same method.
Composite samples from 2002-2004 were assayed for Al, Ca, Cr, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Si, Ti by borate fusion 
ICP-OES, and for Ag, As, Bi, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, S, Sb, V, Zr by HF-multi-acid digest / ICP-OES.
During 2005 two metre composite riffle-split (or spear-sampled for wet samples) samples were sent 
to SGS Laboratories in Perth. Each 2m composite sample was dried and pulverised to a nominal 90 per 
cent passing 75 microns and analysed for: As, Bi, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, S and Zn by ICP-OES. Samples returning 
>0.4%Ni were re-assayed for Ni, Co, Al2O3, CaO, K2O, Fe2O3, MgO, MnO, Na2O, SiO2, V2O5, TiO2, Cr, SO3, Cu, 
Zn by fused disc XRF.
After 2005 two metre composite riffle-split (or spear-sampled) samples were sent to SGS Laboratories 
in Perth. Each sample was pulverised to nominal 90 per cent passing 75 micron for analysis for assay 
for Ni, Co, Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2, Fe2O3, MnO, CaO, K2O, MgO, SO3, Na2O, V2O5, Cr, Cu and Zn by fused disc XRF.
Duplicate  samples  were  taken  by  spearing  the  sample  pile  on  the  ground  approximately  every  20 
samples, and an in-house standard was inserted into the sample run every alternate 20 samples.
No significant QA/QC issues have arisen in recent drilling results.
These assay methodologies are appropriate for the resource in question.

Anomalous intervals as well as random intervals are routinely checked assayed as part of the internal 
QA/QC process.
Virtual twinned holes have been drilled in several instances across all sites with no significant issues 
highlighted.
Primary data is loaded into the drillhole database system and then archived for reference.
All data used in the calculation of resources and reserves are compiled in databases which are overseen 
and validated by senior geologists.
No primary assays data is modified in any way.
All hole collar locations for RC holes drilled after 2000 were surveyed by using a Real Time Kinematic 
GPS. This measured X, Y and Z to sub-centimetre accuracy in terms of the MGA 94, Zone 52 metric grid.
Hole collars for almost all INCO drill holes were re-located, and survey in using the RTK GPS. Several 
INCO collars could not be located, and their MGA positions are estimated from their drilled location on 
the original INCO Imperial local grid.
Topographic control is generated from a combination of remote sensing methods and ground-based 
surveys. This methodology is adequate for the resource in question.
Drill hole spacing at CMP is generally on a 120m x 50m spacing. This has been filled-in to 60 x 50 and 
30m x 25m spacing in some areas. The data spacing is sufficient for both the estimation procedure and 
resource classification applied.
Compositing of drill assay data to 1.5m was used in the estimate.
Drilling intersections are nominally designed to be sub-normal to the orebody.
It is not considered that drilling orientation has introduced an appreciable sampling bias.
Samples are delivered to a third party transport service, who in turn relay them to the independent 
laboratory contractor. Samples are stored securely until they leave site.
Site generated resources and reserves and the parent geological data is routinely reviewed by the 
Metals X Corporate technical team.

The CMP comprises 5 granted exploration leases and 1 granted miscellaneous lease.
Native title interests are recorded against the CMP tenements.
The CMP tenements are held by the Austral Nickel Pty. Ltd. (South Australia) and Hinckley Range Pty. 
Ltd. (Western Australia). Metals X has 100% ownership of both companies.
One  third  party  royalty  agreement  applies  to  the  tenements  at  CMP,  over  and  above  the  state 
government royalty.
Hinckley Range and Austral Nickel operate in accordance with all environmental conditions set down as 
conditions for grant of the leases.
There are no known issues regarding security of tenure.
There are no known impediments to continued operation.
The CMP area has an exploration history which extends to the 1960’s, with significant contributors 
being INCO, Acclaim and Metex Nickel.
On balance, MLX work has generally confirmed the veracity of historic exploration data.
The  Musgrave  Block  is  an  east-west  trending,  structurally  bounded  mid-Proterozoic  terrane  some 
130,000km2  in  area,  straddling  the  common  borders  of  Western  Australia,  South  Australia  and  the 
Northern Territory.
Deep  weathering  of  olivine-rich  ultramafic  units  has  resulted  in  the  concentration  of  nickel 
mineralisation. The olivines in the ultramafic units have background values of about 0.15% Ni to 0.3% Ni. 
The almost complete removal of MgO and SiO2 to ground waters during the weathering of olivines in the 
ultramafic units resulted in extreme volume reductions and consequent significant upgrading of other 
rock forming oxides (Fe2O3, Al2O3) and metal element concentrations in the weathered profile.

Commentary
•
Drillhole data is stored in a Maxwell’s DataShed system based on the Sequel Server platform which is 
currently considered “industry standard”.
As  new  data  is  acquired  it  passes  through  a  validation  approval  system  designed  to  pick  up  any 
significant  errors  before  the  information  is  loaded  into  the  master  database.  The  information  is 
uploaded by a series of Sequel routines and is performed as required. The database contains diamond 
drilling  (including  geotechnical  and  specific  gravity  data),  and  some  associated  metadata.  By  its 
nature this database is large in size, and therefore exports from the main database are undertaken 
(with or without the application of spatial and various other filters) to create a database of workable 
size, preserve a snapshot of the database at the time of orebody modelling and interpretation and 
preserve the integrity of the master database.
The site is manned continually by Senior Geological personnel.
As no material update to the data supporting the resource has been undertaken since early 2008 no 
recent site visits by the Competent Person have been undertaken.
Confidence in the geological model used to constrain the Wingellina estimate is high, with the genetic 
model for lateritic nickel development well understood. Logged geology has been used to drive the 
mineralisation interpretation, with the base of laterite defined with drill holes, or its level on a given 
section interpreted from surrounding drill sections. Continuity of the interpretation across and along 
the Wingellina deposit is for the most part good, with intersections of hard rock in drill holes, and well 
mapped outcropping basement the primary causes of breaks within the mineralised horizon.
No alternative interpretations are currently considered viable.
Geological interpretation of the deposit was carried out using a systematic approach to ensure that the 
resultant estimated Mineral Resource figure was both sufficiently constrained, and representative of 
the expected sub-surface conditions. In all aspects of resource estimation the factual and interpreted 
geology was used to guide the development of the interpretation.
The protolithology is the dominant control on grade continuity at the CMP. Structural controls which 
influence depth of weathering are secondary controls on grade distribution.
Individual deposit scales vary across the CMP.
The Wingellina deposits are mineralised over a strike length of >9km, a lateral extent of up to 2.5km 
and a depth of up to 200m.

All modelling and estimation work undertaken was carried out in three dimensions via Surpac Vision.
After  validating  the  drillhole  data  to  be  used  in  the  estimation,  interpretation  of  the  orebody  is 
undertaken in sectional and / or plan view to create the outline strings which form the basis of the three 
dimensional orebody wireframe. Wireframing is then carried out using a combination of automated 
stitching algorithms and manual triangulation to create an accurate three dimensional representation 
of the sub-surface mineralised body.
Drillhole  intersections  within  the  mineralised  body  are  defined,  these  intersections  are  then  used 
to flag the appropriate sections of the drillhole database tables for compositing purposes. Drillholes 
are subsequently composited to allow for grade estimation. In all aspects of resource estimation the 
factual and interpreted geology was used to guide the development of the interpretation.
Once  the  sample  data  has  been  composited,  a  statistical  analysis  is  undertaken  to  assist  with 
determining estimation search parameters, top-cuts etc. Variographic analysis of individual domains 
is undertaken to assist with determining appropriate search parameters. Which are then incorporated 
with  observed  geological  and  geometrical  features  to  determine  the  most  appropriate  search 
parameters.
An empty block model is then created for the area of interest. This model contains attributes set at 
background values for the various elements of interest as well as density, and various estimation 
parameters that are subsequently used to assist in resource categorisation. The block sizes used in 
the model will vary depending on orebody geometry, minimum mining units, estimation parameters 
and levels of informing data available.
Grade  estimation  is  then  undertaken,  with  ordinary  kriging  estimation  method  is  considered  as 
standard,  although  in  some  circumstances  where  sample  populations  are  small,  or  domains  are 
unable  to  be  accurately  defined,  inverse  distance  weighting  estimation  techniques  will  be  used. 
Both by-product and deleterious elements are estimated at the time of primary grade estimation if 
required. It is assumed that by-products correlate well with gold. There are no assumptions made 
about the recovery of by-products.
The resource is then depleted for mining voids and subsequently classified in line with JORC guidelines 
utilising a combination of various estimation derived parameters and geological / mining knowledge.
This approach has proven to be applicable to Metals X’s nickel assets.

To the extent relevant, the impact of the following on the project and/or on the estimation and 
classification of the Ore Reserves:
Any identified material naturally occurring risks.
The status of material legal agreements and marketing arrangements.
The status of governmental agreements and approvals critical to the viability of the project, 
such as mineral tenement status, and government and statutory approvals. There must be 
reasonable grounds to expect that all necessary Government approvals will be received within 
the timeframes anticipated in the Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility study. Highlight and discuss the 
materiality of any unresolved matter that is dependent on a third party on which extraction of 
the reserve is contingent.
The basis for the classification of the Ore Reserves into varying confidence categories.
• 
•  Whether the result appropriately reflects the Competent Person’s view of the deposit.
•
The  proportion  of  Probable  Ore  Reserves  that  have  been  derived  from  Measured  Mineral 
Resources (if any).
Audits or reviews
•
The results of any audits or reviews of Ore Reserve estimates.
Discussion of relative 
accuracy / confidence
•
•  Where appropriate a statement of the relative accuracy and confidence level in the Ore Reserve 
estimate using an approach or procedure deemed appropriate by the Competent Person. For 
example,  the  application  of  statistical  or  geostatistical  procedures  to  quantify  the  relative 
accuracy of the reserve within stated confidence limits, or, if such an approach is not deemed 
appropriate, a qualitative discussion of the factors which could affect the relative accuracy and 
confidence of the estimate.
The  statement  should  specify  whether  it  relates  to  global  or  local  estimates,  and,  if  local, 
state the relevant tonnages, which should be relevant to technical and economic evaluation. 
Documentation should include assumptions made and the procedures used.
Accuracy  and  confidence  discussions  should  extend  to  specific  discussions  of  any  applied 
Modifying Factors that may have a material impact on Ore Reserve viability, or for which there 
are remaining areas of uncertainty at the current study stage.
It  is  recognised  that  this  may  not  be  possible  or  appropriate  in  all  circumstances.  These 
statements  of  relative  accuracy  and  confidence  of  the  estimate  should  be  compared  with 
production data, where available.

Commentary

A Native Title agreement has been reached.

•
•
The basis for classification of the resource into different categories is made on a subjective basis. 
Measured Resources have a high level of confidence and are generally defined in three dimensions 
and have been accurately defined or capitally and normally developed. Indicated resources have 
a  slightly  lower  level  of  confidence  but  contain  substantial  drilling  and  are  in  most  instances 
capitally developed or well defined from a mining perspective. Inferred resources always contain 
significant geological evidence of existence and are drilled, but not to the same density. There 
is no classification of any resource that isn’t drilled or defined by substantial physical sampling 
works.
Some Measured Resources have been classified as Proven and some are defined as Probable 
Reserves  based  on  subjective  internal  judgements,  but  generally  based  upon  the  intensity  of 
capital and normal development they have been subjected to.
The result appropriately reflects the Competent Person’s view of the deposit.
Site generated reserves and the parent data and economic evaluation data is routinely reviewed 
by  the  Metals  X  Corporate  technical  team.  Resources  and  Reserves  have  in  the  past  been 
subjected to external expert reviews, which have ratified them with no issues. There is no regular 
external consultant review process in place.
All currently reported reserve calculations are considered representative on a global scale.
Only material considered as part of the Pre-Feasibility study has been included as part of the 
reserve statement.
Limited modifying factors have been applied due to the massive nature of the deposit and the 
closeness to the surface.

Diamond Drilling - Half-core niche samples, sub-set via geological features as appropriate.
Core undergoes total preparation.
The sample preparation process consists of;
Crushing using a vibrating jaw crusher to achieve a maximum sample size of 4mm.
The sample is then weighed, and if the sample weight is greater than 3.2kg, the sample is split into two 
using a Jones-type Riffle splitter.
The crushed sample is then pulverised in a Labtech LM5 Ring Mill for 6 minutes. For samples weighing 
greater  than  3.2kg  the  first  portion  is  removed  and  second  portion  is  homogenised  in  the  same 
machine. Once complete the first portion is put back in the LM5 and both portions are homogenised.
From the pulverised sample, approximately 200g is taken as a master sample which stays in Alice 
Springs, while a second sample of approximately 150g taken and sent to for assaying. These samples 
are collected via a scoop inserted to the bottom of the bowl. The remaining sample is transferred to a 
calico bag for storage.
For  every  20th  sample,  an  approximately  25g  sample  is  screened  to  75  microns  to  check  that 
homogenising has achieved 80% passing 75 microns.
QA/QC is ensured during sampling via the use of sample ledgers, blanks, standards and repeats.
QA/QC is ensured during the assays process via the use of blanks, standards and repeats at a NATA / 
ISO accredited laboratory.
The sample sizes are considered appropriate to the grainsize of the material being sampled.
The un-sampled half of diamond core is retained for check sampling if required.
Analysis of drill core for Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn was carried out in Perth in the following manner;
Gold (Au-AA25 scheme – lower detection limit = 0.01ppm, upper detection limit = 100ppm). A 30g 
charge of prepared sample is fused with a mixture of lead oxide, sodium carbonate, borax, silica and 
other reagents and then cupelled to yield a precious metal bead.
The bead is then dissolved in acid and analysed by atomic absorption spectroscopy against matrix-
matched standards.
Samples returning assay values in excess of 100g/t Au were repeated using the Au- AA26 method.
Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn (ME-OG62) - A prepared sample is digested using a 4 acid digest.
The subsequent solution is analysed by inductively coupled plasma - atomic emission spectroscopy or 
by atomic absorption spectrometry.
No significant QA/QC issues have arisen in recent drilling results.
These assay methodologies are appropriate for the resource in question.

Anomalous intervals as well as random intervals are routinely checked assayed as part of the internal 
QA/QC process.
Virtual twinned holes have been drilled in several instances with no significant issues highlighted.
Primary data is loaded into the drillhole database system and then archived for reference.
All  data  used  in  the  calculation  of  resources  are  compiled  in  databases  which  are  overseen  and 
validated by senior geologists.
No primary assays data is modified in any way.
All data is spatially oriented by survey controls via direct pickups by the survey department. Drillholes 
are all surveyed downhole, deeper holes with a Gyro tool if required.
All drilling and resource estimation is undertaken in MGA grid.
Topographic control is generated from a combination of remote sensing methods and ground-based 
surveys. This methodology is adequate for the resource in question.
Data spacing is variable dependent upon the individual orebody under consideration. This approach is 
appropriate for the Mineral Resource estimation process and to allow for classification of the resource 
as it stands.
Compositing is carried out based upon the modal sample length of each individual domain.
Drilling intersections are nominally designed to be normal to the orebody as far topography / economics 
allows.
It is not considered that drilling orientation has introduced an appreciable sampling bias.
Samples are delivered to a third party transport service, who in turn relay them to the independent 
laboratory contractor. Samples are stored securely until they leave site.
Site generated resources and reserves and the parent geological data is routinely reviewed by the 
Metals X Corporate technical team.

The Tennant Creek Project comprises 5 granted exploration leases.
Native title interests are recorded against the Tennant Creek tenements.
The Tennant Creek tenements are held by Castile with is 100% Metals X owned.
Several  third  party  royalties  exist  across  various  tenements  at  Tennant  Creek,  over  and  above  the 
Northern Territory government royalty.
Castile operates in accordance with all environmental conditions set down as conditions for grant of 
the leases.
There are no known issues regarding security of tenure.
There are no known impediments to continued operation.
The Tennant Creek area has an exploration and production history in excess of 100 years. The Rover 
area in particular has an intensive exploration history stretching from the 1970’s.
On balance, Castile work has generally confirmed the veracity of historic exploration data.
The  Tennant  Creek  Project  is  located  in  the  1,860-1,850Ma  Warramunga  Province  is  approximately 
centred on the township of Tennant Creek, and contains the Palaeoproterozoic Warramunga Formation. 
This is a weakly metamorphosed turbiditic succession of partly tuffaceous sandstones and siltstones 
which includes argillaceous banded ironstones locally referred to as ‘haematite shale’.
Copper in the form of chalcopyrite occurs around the upper margins of the quartz magnetite ironstones 
and in the silicified BIF or haematitic shales that often form an alteration transition to the adjacent 
chlorite  alteration  envelope.  Although  copper  levels  in  the  upper  quartz  magnetite  portion  of  the 
ironstones  is  usually  very  low,  pervasive  sub-economic  copper  levels  can  persist  throughout  this 
zone.  Economic  levels  of  copper  are  dominantly  contained  in  the  lower  massive  magnetite  portion 
or  in  massive  magnetite  “veins”  identified  in  the  magnetite  quartz  zones.  The  massive  magnetite 
zones  grade  laterally  and  at  depth  into  magnetite  chlorite  stringer  zones.  Gold  content  increases 
where  the  content  of  magnetite  veining  and  chlorite  alteration  decreases  and  there  is  an  increase 
in early haematite dusted quartz veins and indurated sediments and fine chlorite veining related to 
the mineralisation phase. The transition from massive magnetite copper mineralisation to magnetite 
quartz chlorite stringer gold mineralisation is also the zone of increased bismuthinite mineralisation.
Lead and zinc mineralisation at Explorer 108 is associated with a brecciated dolomitised sediment unit, 
consisting of irregular, generally narrow, domains or veins of semi-massive sulphides (sphalerite and 
galena). A basal “high-grade” zone is present at the contact of the dolomite and lower felsic units.

down hole length and interception depth
hole length.
If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material 
and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person 
should clearly explain why this is the case.
In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum 
grade  truncations  (e.g.  cutting  of  high  grades)  and  cut-off  grades  are  usually  Material  and 
should be stated.

•  Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade results and longer lengths 
of  low  grade  results,  the  procedure  used  for  such  aggregation  should  be  stated  and  some 
typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail.
The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated.
These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results.
If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature 
should be reported.
If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement 
to this effect (e.g. ‘down hole length, true width not known’).
Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included 
for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan 
view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.

•  Where  comprehensive  reporting  of  all  Exploration  Results  is  not  practicable,  representative 
reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading 
reporting of Exploration Results.
Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited

Commentary
•
Drillhole data is stored in a Maxwell’s DataShed system based on the Microsoft SQL Server platform 
which is currently considered “industry standard”.
As  new  data  is  acquired  it  passes  through  a  validation  approval  system  designed  to  pick-up  any 
significant  errors  before  the  information  is  loaded  into  the  master  database.  The  information  is 
uploaded by a series of Sequel routines and is performed as required. The database contains diamond 
drilling  (including  geotechnical  and  specific  gravity  data)  and  some  associated  metadata.  By  its 
nature this database is large in size, and therefore exports from the main database are undertaken 
(with or without the application of spatial and various other filters) to create a database of workable 
size, preserve a snapshot of the database at the time of orebody modelling and interpretation and 
preserve the integrity of the master database.
Mr Russell visits site on a regular basis.
Mining of similar deposits in the region provides confidence in the current geological interpretation.
No alternative interpretations are currently considered viable.
Geological interpretation of the deposit was carried out using a systematic approach to ensure that the 
resultant estimated Mineral Resource figure was both sufficiently constrained, and representative of 
the expected sub-surface conditions. In all aspects of resource estimation the factual and interpreted 
geology was used to guide the development of the interpretation.
The  structural  regime  and  the  presence  of  intrusive  source  bodies  are  the  dominant  controls  on 
geological and grade continuity at the Tennant Creek Project.
Individual deposit scales vary across the Tennant Creek Project.
The Rover 1 deposit is mineralised over a strike length of >540m, a lateral extent of up +70m and a 
depth of over 650m.
The Explorer 108 deposit is mineralised over a strike length of >400m, with a thickness of up to 60m.
The Explorer 142 deposit is mineralised over a strike length of >200m, with a thickness of up to 8m.

All  modelling  and  estimation  work  undertaken  by  Metals  X  is  carried  out  in  three  dimensions  via 
Surpac Vision.
After  validating  the  drillhole  data  to  be  used  in  the  estimation,  interpretation  of  the  orebody  is 
undertaken in sectional and / or plan view to create the outline strings which form the basis of the three 
dimensional orebody wireframe. Wireframing is then carried out using a combination of automated 
stitching algorithms and manual triangulation to create an accurate three dimensional representation 
of the sub-surface mineralised body.
Drillhole  intersections  within  the  mineralised  body  are  defined,  these  intersections  are  then  used 
to flag the appropriate sections of the drillhole database tables for compositing purposes. Drillholes 
are subsequently composited to allow for grade estimation. In all aspects of resource estimation the 
factual and interpreted geology was used to guide the development of the interpretation.
Once  the  sample  data  has  been  composited,  a  statistical  analysis  is  undertaken  to  assist  with 
determining estimation search parameters, top-cuts etc. Variographic analysis of individual domains 
is undertaken to assist with determining appropriate search parameters. Which are then incorporated 
with  observed  geological  and  geometrical  features  to  determine  the  most  appropriate  search 
parameters.
An empty block model is then created for the area of interest. This model contains attributes set at 
background values for the various elements of interest as well as density, and various estimation 
parameters that are subsequently used to assist in resource categorisation. The block sizes used in 
the model will vary depending on orebody geometry, minimum mining units, estimation parameters 
and levels of informing data available.
Grade  estimation  is  then  undertaken,  with  ordinary  kriging  estimation  method  is  considered  as 
standard,  although  in  some  circumstances  where  sample  populations  are  small,  or  domains  are 
unable  to  be  accurately  defined,  inverse  distance  weighting  estimation  techniques  will  be  used. 
Both by-product and deleterious elements are estimated at the time of primary grade estimation if 
required. It is assumed that by-products correlate well with gold. There are no assumptions made 
about the recovery of by-products.
The resource is then depleted for mining voids and subsequently classified in line with JORC guidelines 
utilising a combination of various estimation derived parameters and geological / mining knowledge.
This approach has proven to be applicable to Metals X’s gold assets.
Estimation results are routinely validated against primary input data, previous estimates and mining 
output.
Good reconciliation between mine claimed figures and milled figures was routinely achieved during 
past production history.
Tonnage estimates are dry tonnes.

Bulk density of the mineralisation at the Tennant Creek Project is variable and is for the both lithology 
and alteration / mineralisation dependent.
For  modern  drilling,  field  technicians  perform  density  test-work  on  core  samples  on  a  campaign 
basis every three months. All density measurements have been determined using the simple water 
immersion technique. The samples from all holes were well below the base of oxidation and were in 
generally competent, non-porous rock.
Resources are classified in line with JORC guidelines utilising a combination of various estimation 
derived parameters, the input data and geological / mining knowledge.

JORC Code explanation
•
Nature  and  quality  of  sampling  (e.g.  cut  channels,  random  chips,  or  specific  specialised 
industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as 
down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc.). These examples should not be 
taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
Include  reference  to  measures  taken  to  ensure  sample  representivity  and  the  appropriate 
calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.
Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report.
In cases where ‘industry standard’ work has been done this would be relatively simple (e.g. 
‘reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to 
produce a 30 g charge for fire assay’). In other cases more explanation may be required, such 
as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or 
mineralisation types (e.g. submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.
Drill  type  (e.g.  core,  reverse  circulation,  open-hole  hammer,  rotary  air  blast,  auger,  Bangka, 
sonic, etc.) and details (e.g. core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-
sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc.).
Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed.
Measures  taken  to  maximise  sample  recovery  and  ensure  representative  nature  of  the 
samples.

may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material.
Commentary
•
The deposit has been drilled and sampled using various techniques with diamond and reverse circulation 
drilling utilised for mineral estimation. This information comes from surface and underground and is on 
variable spacing along and across strike. The total metres within the immediate vicinity of the Deposit 
are 143,497m. The holes are drilled on most occasions to intersect as near as possible perpendicularly 
the synclinal east plunge mineralisation.
The drilling programs have been ongoing since initial discovery to both expand the mineralisation and 
provided control for mining. The hole collars were surveyed by Company employees / contractors with 
the orientation recorded. Down holes survey is recorded using appropriate equipment. The diamond 
core was logged for lithology and other geological features.
The diamond core varied from HQ to NQ in diameter and mineralised intervals and adjacent locations 
were  sampled  by  cutting  the  core  in  1/2  based  on  observation  from  the  core  photographs.  The  RC 
samples were collected from the cyclone of the rig and spilt at site to approximate 2 to 3kg weight. The 
preparation and analysis was undertaken at an accredited commercial laboratory with the core dried, 
pulverised and split to produce a 30gm sample for assay by fire assay with either atomic absorption 
finish or gravimetric determination.
The drilling was completed using a combination of surface and underground drilling. In general the 
orientation of the drilling is appropriate given the given the strike and dip of the mineralisation.
The core recovery is recorded in the database and in most instances was in excess of 95%. This was 
assessed by measuring core length against core run. There is no record of the quantity (weight) of RC 
chips collected per sample length.
The ground condition in the mineralised zone is very competent. In areas of less competent material 
core  return  is  maximised  by  controlling  drill  speed.  RC  samples  from  less  competent  material  are 
identified in the log.

Commentary
•
The  routine  logging  of  core  and  chips  describes  the  general  geology  features  including  lithology, 
mineralisation, alteration etc. For the majority of holes this information is sufficient and appropriate 
to apply mineralisation constraints. Some core drilling is orientated and structural measurements of 
bedding, joints, veins etc. has been undertaken as well as facture densities.
Geological  logging  has  recorded  both  summary  and  detailed  lithology,  mineralisation  content, 
alteration, some angle to core axis information, vein type, incidence and frequency, magnetic content
The entire length of all holes, apart from surface casing, was logged.
All core to be sampled was halved using a mechanical saw.
RC  chip  samples  are  collected  via  a  cyclone  which  is  cleaned  with  air  blast  between  samples.  The 
samples is riffled to collect between 2 and 3kg. Most samples are dry with any moisture noted on the 
logs.
Field sub-sampling for chip samples appears appropriate as is the method of generating halved core. 
Procedures adopted in the laboratories are industry standard practises including that in the mine site 
facility.
In field riffles are cleaned between sampling using compressed air. The diamond cutting equipment is 
cleaned during the process using water. All laboratories adopt appropriate industry practises to reduce 
sample size homogeneously to the required size.
No field duplicate information was observed.
The style of mineralisation and high sulphide content does not rely on grain size as being influential 
on grade. Thus there is confidence in the overall grade of the deposit being fairly represented by the 
sampling.
The assay techniques are appropriate for the determination of the level of mineralisation in the sample. 
The technique was 4 acid digest with ICP finish.
No geophysical tools were utilised to ascertain grade
Standard and Blanks are included with all samples sent for analysis in the rate of between 1 in 20 and 
1 in 30. The most recent reporting covering the majority of holes used in the estimate provide support 
for the quality of the Cu assays.
The extensive data set has been review by various parties including Maxwell Geoscience and DataGeo 
and the intersections within the mineralisation have been confirmed.
None observed but there is a significant amount of closely spaced supportive drilling results.
Field  data  is  captured  electronically,  validated  by  responsible  geologist  and  stored  on  corporate

The  collar  positions  were  resurveyed  by  the  Company  surveyor  or  their  contractors  from  a  known 
datum. The survey is on a known local grid with demonstrated control. The orientation and dip at the 
collars is checked (aligned) by the geologist and down hole recording of azimuth and dip are taken at 
30m intervals on most occasion using appropriate equipment.
The regional grid is GDA 94 Zone 50 and the drilling is laid out on a local grid.
Topographic control is from surface survey.
The  majority  of  drilling  utilised  is  on  40m  x  20m  grid  specifically  targeting  lithological  and  hence 
mineralisation sequence definition.
The geological sequence is well understood from the mining which supports the current drill spacing as 
adequate for both grade continuity assessment and lithological modelling.
The  sampling  reflects  the  geological  conditions.  For  mineral  resource  estimation  a  1m  composite 
length was chosen given that this is the dominant sample length in dataset.
Given the shape of the sequence the drilling as best as practically possible orientated to intersect the 
sequence perpendicularly. This is limited to drill sites from underground and surface.
No sampling bias is considered to have been introduced.
The samples once collected and numbered are stored in the lockable site core yard chain. Batches of 
samples with each sample bag security tied and with sample number on the bag and inside on metal 
tags transported by commercial contractors to Perth. Upon receipt at the laboratory the samples are 
checked against the dispatch sheets to ensure all samples are present.

Commentary

The Nifty deposit is hosted within the folded late-Proterozoic Broadhurst Formation which is part of 
the Yeneena Group. The Broadhurst Formation is between 1,000m to 2,000m thick and consists of a 
stacked series of carbonaceous shales, turbiditic sandstones, dolomite and limestones. The Broadhurst 
Formation hosts all known significant base metal occurrences including the Nifty copper mine and the 
Maroochydore, Rainbow and Warrabarty prospects.
The Broadhurst Formation deposit is unconformably overlain by the Isdell Formation which consists 
of an approximately 1000 m thick sequence of carbonate rocks, siltstones and shales. The sequence 
below  the  Broadhurst  Formation  consists  of  the  Coolbro  Sandstone,  a  4,000  m  thick  sequence  of 
sandstones with minor siltstones, volcanics, conglomerates and shales.
The Nifty copper deposit is a structurally and lithologically controlled, stratabound body of massive, 
disseminated and vein-style chalcopyrite. Structurally, the dominant feature at the Nifty copper mine 
is  the  Nifty  Syncline  which  strikes  approximately  southeast-northwest  and  plunges  at  about  6-12 
degrees to the southeast. The copper mineralisation occurs as a structurally controlled, chalcopyrite-
quartz-dolomite replacement of carbonaceous and dolomitic shale within the folded sequence. The 
copper mineralisation is largely confined to the keel of the syncline and the northern limb.

The confidence in the geological interpretation comes from the history of underground mining and the 
closely spacing drill and other sample information.
Only physical data obtained from the drilling and underground workings was utilised.
The application of hard boundaries to reflect the position of the mineralised sequence was supported 
by the underground and drilling observations. No other assessment style is thought appropriate at 
this time. The hard boundaries are important to the physical constraining of the mineralisation given 
that each sequence member has different mineralisation characteristics.
The sequence units are subject to vertical and horizontal dimension changes along and across strike 
and in thickness. The mineralisation occurs as either disseminated or massive within the sequence 
and thus influences the grade continuity.
The deposit occurs over a 1,200m down plunge distance and units vary individually between from 
0m to 30m in true thickness. The limbs of the sequence are variously mineralised and to 400m in 
vertical extent.

The  grade  is  estimated  using  ordinary  kriging  by  individual  sequence  member.  The  geo-statistical 
assessment of the controlling variograms and the grade estimation was carried out by unfolding the 
sequence. Unfolding and estimation was carried out using Datamine software.
The orientation for variogram calculation was changed from the previous variography to be aligned 
with the general mineralisation control in the unfolded space.
Density was assigned by lithological and grade range. The composites were created within each unit 
and input to the grade estimation was restricted to those composites which were within the unit being 
estimated. No top-cuts were applied to the composites.
Estimated blocks were informed by a three step strategy. The initial (primary) search was relatively 
short and governed by the unit geo-statistics. This search range was expanded by double the length 
for blocks that were not informed in the primary search. This strategy informed over 80% of the blocks 
within the deposit except for the bottom unit.
Previous estimates have occurred which in both tonnage and grades are supportive of the mineral 
estimate. Production is ongoing and supportive of the modelled outcome.
There are no by-products
There are no deleterious elements
The  block  model  was  constructed  using  blocks  which  were  20mE  (along  strike)  x  10mN  (across 
strike) by 5m in the vertical plane. Sub-celling to ½ the block size in each direction was adopted to 
ensure accurate volume representation. Estimation was to the parent block size.
Hard boundaries were applied to the units. Grade was estimated within these boundaries.
Statistical analysis indicated that top-cutting of the lessor mineralised zones did not normalise the 
population statistics hence the strategy adopted was to restrict the influence of outlier grades using 
by imposing search restrictions. No top-cuts were applied.
Volume validation was carried out by comparison of the surfaces representing the mineralisation to 
the block model. Grade validation was carried by both global comparison of the average estimated 
grade to the average input grade and spatially by comparison of the estimated grades to the input 
grades by position. Visual comparison was also undertaken

AMC estimated the cut-off grade to be 1.65% copper using FY2017 parameters. However the Nifty 
Ore Reserve estimate is based on a design cut-off grade of 1.5% copper, which has been used for 
stope design.

mining method.
Long hole open stoping has been the applied mining method at Nifty since production started.
Geotechnical assessment is undertaken at Nifty on an ongoing basis as it is an operating mine. 
The life of mine plan has been prepared considering current geotechnical conditions of access 
development, stopes and backfill.
The Mineral Resource model used to estimate Ore Reserves was “sulmod0316depv1.1.dm”.
Mining  dilution  is  estimated  for  each  stope.  Waste  dilution  varies  up  to  a  maximum  of  30%, 
depending  on  the  stopes  place  in  the  sequence  and  the  anticipated  condition  of  surrounding

that the project is economic.
The NPV of the Project is estimated using a post-tax discount rate of 9.5%.pa. Achieving a positive 
NPV is not sensitive to discount rate or capital costs, when considering +20% sensitivities.
The Project is sensitive to copper price and operating costs, and requires only a 5% deterioration 
in either to exhibit a negative NPV.
Nifty is an ongoing mining operation in northern Western Australia, and maintains a social license 
to operate.
No naturally occurring hazards have been identified
Nifty is on ongoing mining operation, and is in possession of necessary approvals.
Mining  areas  have  been  classified  into  Ore  Reserves  categories  based  on  Mineral  Resource 
classification. In the main Checkerboard mining area the majority of Measured Mineral Resources 
are  classified  as  Proved  Ore  Reserves.  Area  that  consist  of  a  majority  of  Indicated  Mineral 
Resources are classified as Probable Ore Reserves.
In the North Limb and West Limb mining areas, which have not been accessed for mining yet, 
have been classified as Probable Ore Reserves to reflect that risk.
The Ore Reserve estimate has not been audited or reviewed.

PRESS RELEASE
Criteria
Discussion of relative 
accuracy/ confidence
•
JORC Code explanation
•  Where appropriate a statement of the relative accuracy and confidence level in the Ore Reserve 
estimate using an approach or procedure deemed appropriate by the Competent Person. For 
example,  the  application  of  statistical  or  geostatistical  procedures  to  quantify  the  relative 
accuracy of the reserve within stated confidence limits, or, if such an approach is not deemed 
appropriate, a qualitative discussion of the factors which could affect the relative accuracy and 
confidence of the estimate.
The  statement  should  specify  whether  it  relates  to  global  or  local  estimates,  and,  if  local, 
state the relevant tonnages, which should be relevant to technical and economic evaluation. 
Documentation should include assumptions made and the procedures used.
Accuracy  and  confidence  discussions  should  extend  to  specific  discussions  of  any  applied 
Modifying Factors that may have a material impact on Ore Reserve viability, or for which there 
are remaining areas of uncertainty at the current study stage.
It  is  recognised  that  this  may  not  be  possible  or  appropriate  in  all  circumstances.  These 
statements  of  relative  accuracy  and  confidence  of  the  estimate  should  be  compared  with 
production data, where available.

Commentary
•
Factors  that  affect  the  global  relative  accuracy  and  confidence  of  the  Ore  Reserve  estimate 
include:
All currently reported reserve calculations are considered representative on a local scale. Regular 
mine reconciliations occur to validate and test the accuracy of the estimates at NCO.
