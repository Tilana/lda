<p><b>General Assembly 
 
</b></p>
<p>Distr.: General 
28 January 2010</p>
<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 10/5, requested the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;submit a comprehensive and updated report to 
the Council at its thirteenth session, in accordance with its annual programme of work, 
following the structure and scope of her report and with a special focus on further measures 
to correct the imbalance in geographical composition of the staff of the Office&#8221;. The present 
report addresses the composition of the staff of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in 2009. 
</p>
<p>2. In chapter I of the present report, information is provided on the composition of 
OHCHR as at 31 December 2009. It includes data on staff members in regular budget posts 
subject to geographical distribution, as well as data on staff in temporary posts funded from 
general temporary assistance and extrabudgetary resources, or in technical cooperation 
project posts, neither of which are included in the definition of posts subject to geographical 
distribution. 
</p>
<p>3. Chapter II contains a description of the measures for improvement taken by the High 
Commissioner aimed at addressing the geographical composition issues identified by the 
Human Rights Council in resolution 10/5, while fully observing United Nations Secretariat 
human resources policies, in particular, its recruitment and contractual policies. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Composition of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>4. The recruitment of staff members to posts subject to geographical distribution is 
governed by the system of desirable ranges at the Secretariat level. For that purpose, 
Member States are grouped into four categories: unrepresented, underrepresented, within 
range, and overrepresented. A Member State is considered unrepresented when none of its 
nationals, throughout the entire Secretariat, is serving in a post subject to geographical 
distribution and filled in accordance with the established selection process. It is 
underrepresented when the number of its nationals appointed to such posts throughout the 
entire Secretariat is below the lower limit of the desirable range. It is within range when the 
number of its nationals appointed to such posts is between the upper and lower limits of the 
desirable range, and it is overrepresented when the number of its nationals appointed to 
such posts within the entire Secretariat exceeds the upper limit of the desirable range. The 
representation status of Member States is affected by many factors, notably turnover of 
staff and changes in the scale of assessments. 
</p>
<p>5. The official report on the composition of the Secretariat is submitted annually by the 
Secretary-General to the General Assembly in accordance with a number of resolutions, the 
most recent of which are resolutions 57/305, 59/266, 60/238, 61/244 and 63/250. 
</p>
<p>6. The latest report of the Secretary-General on the composition of the Secretariat was 
issued in 2009 (A/64/352) and covers the period 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009. OHCHR is 
part of the Secretariat and the breakdown of its geographical composition has to be seen 
against the breakdown of the overall distribution within the Secretariat. 
</p>
<p>7. Table A1 (annex I) provides a breakdown of all OHCHR staff members in the 
Professional category and above who have been selected through the established 
recruitment process (&#8220;regular&#8221; staff) against both regular budget posts subject to 
geographical distribution and extrabudgetary posts, by nationality, grade and sex as at 31 
December 2009. </p>


<p>8. Table A2 (annex II) provides a breakdown of the following categories of additional 
OHCHR staff in the Professional category and above not included in table A1 by 
nationality, grade and sex as at 31 December 2009: 
</p>
<p> (a) Staff holding appointments of less than one year; 
</p>
<p> (b) Staff charged to general temporary assistance funds; 
</p>
<p> (c) Staff employed as technical cooperation project personnel. 
</p>
<p>9. Paragraph 14 of section IX of General Assembly resolution 63/250 re-emphasizes 
that the system of geographical ranges is designed to apply to countries rather than to 
regions or groups. Therefore, the data in this report are provided by country, listed in 
alphabetical order. 
</p>
<p>10. As at 31 December 2009, OHCHR had a total of 471 staff in the Professional 
category and above, of which 347 are considered regular staff. Of the professional staff 
members, 338 work in Geneva, 14 work in the New York office, while 119 work in 40 
different countries in the field.1 
</p>
<p>11. Nationals from 107 countries are represented in the Professional and above 
workforce. Of these 107 nationalities, 16 are underrepresented in the Secretariat,2 73 are 
considered within range (48 below mid-point3 and 25 above mid-point4), while 18 
nationalities are overrepresented5 in the Secretariat. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Results of efforts undertaken to achieve equitable 
geographical representation 
</b></p>
<p>12. Despite the decision of the General Assembly referenced above not to include 
references to regions in reporting on staff representation, the Commission on Human 
Rights, the Human Rights Council and the Joint Inspection Unit have made use of the 
</p>

<p>concept of geographical diversity by regional grouping when assessing the composition of 
the staff of OHCHR.<b>6</b> This difference in approach, terminology and methodology from the 
report of the Secretary-General on the composition of the Secretariat (A/64/352) has made 
comparison of data problematic. While being bound by the resolution of the General 
Assembly on this matter, the High Commissioner has, in order to facilitate a consistent and 
coherent discussion in the present report, continued to make occasional reference to the 
regional methodology used by the Human Rights Council and the Joint Inspection Unit in 
the analysis of the geographical diversity of OHCHR.  
</p>
<p>13. Improving geographical diversity in OHCHR staff remains one of the High 
Commissioner&#8217;s priorities. In line with that objective, OHCHR has continued to vigorously 
implement the High Commissioner&#8217;s procedures and framework for improving 
geographical diversity, in full compliance with Secretariat human resources policies, which 
were explained in detail to the Commission on Human Rights in February 2006 
(E/CN.4/2006/103). 
</p>
<p>14. The impact of the implementation of the above procedures can be seen clearly in the 
overall geographical diversity of OHCHR. An analysis of the data contained in the table 
below, using the methodology employed by the Joint Inspection Unit, shows a steady, 
continuous and significant increase in the percentage of OHCHR staff from regions 
identified as requiring better representation within OHCHR over the past three years.

<p>15. The progress of OHCHR in this matter was highlighted in the latest report of the 
Joint Inspection Unit entitled &#8220;Second follow-up to the management review of the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights&#8221; (JIU/REP/2009/2), which 
indicates that &#8220;the efforts made by the current High Commissioner and OHCHR should be 
recognized by the Council as complying with the JIU recommendations on improving 
geographical diversity.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>16. Among the special measures initiated as a result of General Assembly resolution 
62/236, the human rights national competitive examination held in February 2008 focused 
exclusively on participation from un- and underrepresented countries in regions deemed to 
require improved representation in OHCHR. Of the 49 Member States invited to 
participate, 41 responded with applications and a total of 236 candidates sat the 
</p>
<p>  
 6 A/59/65-E/2004/48; A/59/65/Add.1-E/2004/48/Add.1, A/61/115, A/61/115/Add.1, A/62/845, 
</p>
<p>A/62/845/Add.1, A/64/94, A/64/94/Add.1. </p>


<p>examination. Of that number, a final total of twenty candidates were successful, all of 
whom are nationals of un- or underrepresented countries in regions deemed to require 
improved representation in OHCHR.  Between the release of the list by the Office of 
Human Resources Management (OHRM) on 27 May 2009 and 31 December 2009, 
OHCHR recruited eight of the successful candidates. OHCHR will continue to recruit from 
this roster to fill vacant P-2 posts as they arise.  
</p>
<p>17. OHCHR remains committed to implementing the High Commissioner&#8217;s procedures 
and framework for improving geographical diversity (E/CN.4/2006/103), which has proven 
effective to date. It is anticipated that the positive geographical trends will continue during 
the current biennium, as OHCHR will endeavour to maximize the opportunity afforded by 
its continued growth to further increase geographical diversity. 
</p>
<p>18. While seeking to further improve its geographical distribution, OHCHR will 
continue to pay special attention to the issue of balance between female and male staff 
members at all levels, an area in which determination and concerted effort have already 
brought success. As at 31 December 2009, women represented 52.2 per cent of regular 
OHCHR staff and 52.4 per cent of temporary staff at the Professional level, equivalent to an 
overall percentage of 52.2 per cent. 
</p>
<p>19. Similarly, OHCHR will continue in its commitment to meeting the goals and 
obligations placed upon it under the system of desirable ranges mandated by the General 
Assembly.  This is reflected in the departmental target relating to the recruitment of 
nationals from un- and underrepresented Member States established in the Secretariat 
Human Resources Action Plan.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> III. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p><b>20. The implementation and results to date of the High Commissioner&#8217;s procedures 
and framework to improve geographical diversity reflect the priority that the High 
Commissioner continues to give to this issue.  Noticeable and sustained progress has 
been achieved towards increasing the geographical diversity of the staff through these 
measures. OHCHR remains attentive to the need to maintain the emphasis on the 
broadest possible geographical diversity of its staff, and will continue its efforts in this 
regard. </b></p>
