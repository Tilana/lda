1 Under Listing Rule 4.7.3, an entity must lodge with ASX a completed Appendix 4G at the same time as it lodges its annual report with ASX.
Listing Rule 4.10.3 requires an entity that is included in the official list as an ASX Listing to include in its annual report either a corporate 
governance statement that meets the requirements of that rule or the URL of the page on its website where such a statement is located. The 
corporate governance statement must disclose the extent to which the entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate 
Governance Council during the reporting period. If the entity has not followed a recommendation for any part of the reporting period, its corporate 
governance statement must separately identify that recommendation and the period during which it was not followed and state its reasons for not 
following the recommendation and what (if any) alternative governance practices it adopted in lieu of the recommendation during that period.
Under Listing Rule 4.7.4, if an entity chooses to include its corporate governance statement on its website rather than in its annual report, it must 
lodge a copy of the corporate governance statement with ASX at the same time as it lodges its annual report with ASX. The corporate governance 
statement must be current as at the effective date specified in that statement for the purposes of rule 4.10.3.
2 “Corporate governance statement” is defined in Listing Rule 19.12 to mean the statement referred to in Listing Rule 4.10.3 which discloses the 
extent to which an entity has followed the recommendations set by the ASX Corporate Governance Council during a particular reporting period.
3 Mark whichever option is correct and then complete the page number(s) of the annual report, or the URL of the web page, where the entity’s 
corporate governance statement can be found. You can, if you wish, delete the option which is not applicable.
Throughout this form, where you are given two or more options to select, you can, if you wish, delete any option which is not applicable and just 
retain the option that is applicable. If you select an option that includes “OR” at the end of the selection and you delete the other options, you can

The Company has a Diversity Policy.  However, the Diversity Policy does not include requirements for 
the Board to set measurable objectives for achieving gender diversity and to assess annually both the 
objectives  and  the  Company’s  progress  in  achieving  them.  The  Diversity  Policy  however,  does 
provide that the Board may choose to set such measurable objectives.  
 
Given  the  Company’s  current  circumstances  including  its  total  number  of  staff,  the  Board  does  not 
consider,  at this  time, that  it  is  appropriate  to set  measurable  benchmarks  nor  to have  a  Policy  that 
requires  it  to  do  so.  Instead,  the  Board  has  adopted  the  following  objectives  in  relation  to  gender 
diversity: 
 
Mentoring 
The  Board  encourages  its  directors  to  participate  in  external  mentoring  programs.  Such  programs 
should be aimed at achieving a greater representation of women on boards. 
 
Training / Succession Planning 
The  Board  encourages  and  supports  its  female  executives  to  undertake  external  studies.  Such 
studies  should  be  aimed  at  developing  skills  and  experience  relevant  to  senior  positions  within  the 
Company. 
 
HR Practices 
The  Board  aspires  to  ensuring  that  for  every  executive  position,  at  least  one  appropriately  qualified 
female candidate is considered. 
 
The  current  Policy  is  aimed  at  encouraging  an  inclusive  culture  where  diversity  is  promoted  and  an 
appropriate mix of skills and talent is achieved within the Company.  
 
As  the  circumstances  of  the  Company  change,  it  is  the  intention  of  the  Board  to  review  its  current 
Policy and to determine when it becomes appropriate to set benchmarks that are able to be measured 
and monitored for effectiveness in addressing any gender imbalance issues in the organisation.
The respective proportions of men and women on the Board, in senior executive positions and across 
the whole organisation are set out in the following table.  “Senior executive” for these purposes means 
those persons  having authority  and responsibility  for  planning,  directing  and  controlling the  activities 
of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise) of that entity:

Recommendation 1.6
Proportion of women

0 out of 3 (0%)
The  Chair  is  responsible  for  evaluation  of  the  Board  and,  when  deemed  appropriate,  Board 
committees and individual directors.   
 
Given  the  size  of  the  Board  (and  its  committees)  the  Board  has  determined  to  undertake  frequent 
informal  discussions  in  relation  to  its  performance  and  composition  throughout  year.    The  Board 
intends to restart its formal processes during the next reporting period. 
 
Recommendation 1.7 
 
The  Managing  Director  is  responsible  for  evaluating  the  performance  of  senior  executives.  This 
process usually includes a questionnaire followed by an interview.   
 
The  Nomination  Committee  (or  its  equivalent)  is  responsible  for  evaluating  the  Managing  Director.  
This process usually includes a questionnaire followed by an interview.   
 
During the Reporting Period performance evaluations took place for the Managing Director and other 
senior  executives  by  way  of  informal  discussions  on  a  regular  basis.  Given  the  size  of  the 
management team, this was deemed appropriate at this time.
Principle 2 – Structure the board to add value 
 
Recommendation 2.1 
 
The  Board  has  not  established  a  separate  Nomination  Committee.    Given  the  current  size  and 
composition  of  the  Board,  the  Board  believes  that  there  would  be  no  efficiencies  gained  by 
establishing  a  separate  Nomination  Committee.    Accordingly,  the  Board  performs  the  role  of  the 
Nomination Committee.  Items that are usually required to be discussed by a Nomination Committee 
are marked as separate agenda items at Board meetings when required.  Although the Board has not 
established  a  separate  Nomination  Committee,  it  has  adopted  a  Nomination  Committee  Charter, 
which describes the role, composition, functions and responsibilities of the full Board in its capacity as 
the  Nomination  Committee.   When  the  Board  convenes  as  the  Nomination  Committee  it  carries  out 
those  functions  which  are  delegated  to  it  in  the  Company’s  Nomination  Committee  Charter.    The 
Board  deals  with  any  conflicts  of  interest  that  may  occur  when  convening  in  the  capacity  of  the 
Nomination  Committee  by  ensuring  that  the  director  with  conflicting  interests  is  not  party  to  the 
relevant discussions.
Details  of  director  attendance  at  meetings  of  the  full  Board,  in  its  capacity  as  the  Nomination 
Committee,  during  the  Reporting  Period,  are  set  out  at  the  end  of  this  document  under  “Additional 
Information”.
Recommendation 2.2
Skill  sets  represented  at  Board  level  include  managerial,  technical,  financial,  corporate,  legal  and 
commercial.  In  particular,  Board  members  have  a  high  level  of  experience  and  expertise  in  the 
resource industry.  
 
The Board has developed a skills matrix and identified a range of skills, other than the more general 
business and corporate related skills, in the following key areas:
Page | 3
60429v3
resource industry knowledge;
strategic planning;
 
  exploration; 
 
  mergers and acquisitions; 
 
 
 

legal; 
international markets; and 
corporate finance; and 
risk management.
The Board considers that its current mix of skills is appropriate for its circumstances. As the Company 
moves  towards  its  strategic  objectives,  the Board will  consider  its  composition  and  effectiveness,  as 
appropriate. 
 
Recommendation 2.3
The Board considers the independence of directors having regard to the relationships listed in Box 2.3 
of the Principles & Recommendations. 
 
The independent directors of the Company are Rick Crabb and Glenister Lamont.  
 
The length of service of each current director is as follows:

Recommendation 2.5 
 
The independent Chair of the Board is Rick Crabb.
Recommendation 2.6 
 
The Company has an induction program that it uses to when new directors join the Board and when 
new senior executives are appointed.  The goal or the program is to assist new directors to participate 
fully and actively in Board decision-making at the earliest opportunity and to assist senior executives 
to  participate  fully  and  actively  in  management  decision-making  at  the  earliest  opportunity.    The 
Company’s Induction Program is disclosed on the Company’s website. 
 
Using  its  skills  matrix,  the  Board  regularly  reviews  whether  the  directors  as  a  group  have  the  skills, 
knowledge and familiarity with the Company and its operating environment required to fulfil their role 
on  the  Board  and  the  Board  committees  effectively.    Where  any  gaps  are  identified,  the  Board 
considers what training or development should be undertaken to fill those gaps.
Principle 3 – Act ethically and responsibly 
 
Recommendation 3.1 
 
The Company has established a Code of Conduct for its directors, senior executives and employees, 
which is disclosed on the Company’s website.
Page | 4
60429v3
The  Company  has  also  adopted  a Whistleblower  Policy  to  encourage  the  reporting  of  violations  (or 
suspected  violations)  of  the  Company’s  Code  of  Conduct  and  provide  effective  protection  from 
victimisation  or  dismissal  to  those  reporting  by  implementing  systems  for  confidentiality  and  report 
handling.
Principle 4 – Safeguard integrity in corporate reporting 
 
Recommendation 4.1 
 
The  Board  has  established  an  Audit  Committee.    The  members  of  the  Audit  Committee  are  the 
Company’s  two  non-executive  directors,  Glenister  Lamont  (Chair)  and  Rick  Crabb.    The  Audit 
Committee  is  not  structured  in  compliance  with  Recommendation  4.1  as  it  comprises  only  two 
members.    The  Board  is  unable  to  establish  an  Audit  Committee  that  meets  the  compositional 
requirements  of  Recommendation  4.1.    However,  the  Board  considers  it  appropriate  that  the  Audit 
Committee  comprise  the  Company’s  two  independent  non-executive  directors  and  the  committee  is 
chaired by an independent director who is not also Chair of the Board.   
 
Both members of the Audit Committee consider themselves to be financially literate and have industry 
knowledge.   
 
Glenister  Lamont  has  an  Honours  degree  in  Mining  Engineering  and  a  Masters  of  Business 
Administration  from  IMD,  Switzerland.  Mr  Lamont  is  a  Fellow  of  the  Financial  Services  Institute  of 
Australasia, a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Company Directors and a Member of the Australian 
Institute of  Mining and Metallurgy.  He  has  worked  as  an  engineer  and  manager  in gold,  base metal 
and coal mines. Previously as General Manager for Ashton Mining Ltd, he led strategic planning and 
commercial implementation of business development. Before that, as an Executive Director at UBS, 
he  undertook  financial,  technical  and  strategic  evaluation  of  companies  and  participated  in  many 
corporate transactions. Mr Lamont is a professional non executive director and consultant on investor 
relations.  
 
Rick  Crabb holds  degrees  of  Bachelor  of  Jurisprudence (Honours),  Bachelor  of  Laws  and  Master  of 
Business  Administration  from  the  University  of  Western  Australia.  He  practiced  as  a  solicitor  from 
1980  to  2004  specialising  in  mining,  corporate  and  commercial  law.  He  has  advised  on  all  legal 
aspects including financing, marketing, government agreements and construction contracts for many 
resource development projects in Australia and Africa. Mr Crabb now focuses on his public company 
directorships  and  investments.  He  has  been  involved  as  a  director  and  strategic  shareholder  in  a 
number of successful public companies.  Mr Crabb is a Councillor on the Western Australian Division 
of the Australian Institute of Company Directors.

The  Board  has  adopted  an  Audit  Committee  Charter  which  describes  the  Audit  Committee’s  role, 
composition, functions and responsibilities.  
 
Recommendation 4.2 
 
The Board received from the Managing Director and the  Company Accountant, a declaration that, in 
their opinion, the financial records of the Company for the relevant financial period have been properly 
maintained and that the financial statements for the financial period ended 31 December 2016 comply 
with the appropriate accounting standards  and give a true  and fair view of the financial  position and 
performance of the Company and the consolidated entity and that the opinion has been formed on the 
basis of a sound system of risk management and internal control which is operating effectively.   
 
Recommendation 4.3 
 
Under  section  250RA  of  the  Corporations  Act,  the  Company’s  auditor  is  required  to  attend  the

Page | 5
60429v3
represented by a person who is a suitably qualified member of the audit team that conducted the audit 
and  who  is  in  a position  to  answer  questions  about  the  audit.   Each  year,  the  Company  notifies  the 
Company’s auditor of the date of the Company’s annual general meeting.  In accordance with section 
250S  of  the  Corporations  Act,  at  the  Company’s  annual  general  meeting  where  the  Company’s 
auditor  or  their  representative  is  at  the  meeting,  the  Chair  allows  a  reasonable  opportunity  for  the 
members as a whole at the meeting to ask the auditor (or its representative) questions relevant to the 
conduct  of  the  audit;  the  preparation  and  content  of  the  auditor’s  report;  the  accounting  policies 
adopted  by  the  Company  in  relation  to  the  preparation  of  the  financial  statements;  and  the 
independence of the auditor in relation to the conduct of the audit. The Chair also allows a reasonable 
opportunity  for  the  auditor  (or  their  representative)  to  answer  written  questions  submitted  to  the 
auditor under section 250PA of the Corporations Act.   
 
A representative of the Company’s auditor, John Sibenaler (Deloitte), attended the Company’s annual 
general meeting held on 26 November 2015.

receive Company information on its website.
Principle 7 – Recognise and manage risk 
 
Recommendation 7.1 
 
The Board has not established a separate Risk Committee. Given the current size and composition of 
the  Board, the  Board believes  that  there  would be  no  efficiencies  gained  by  establishing  a separate 
Risk Committee.  Accordingly, the Board performs the role of Risk Committee.  Items that are usually 
required  to  be  discussed  by  a  Risk  Committee  are  marked  as  separate  agenda  items  at  Board 
meetings when required.  Although the Board has not established a separate Risk Committee, it has
Page | 6
60429v3
adopted a Risk Committee Charter.  When the Board convenes as the Risk Committee it carries out 
those functions which are delegated to it in the Company’s Risk Committee Charter.  The Board deals 
with any conflicts of interest that may occur when convening in the capacity of the Risk Committee by 
ensuring that the director with conflicting interests is not party to the relevant discussions.
The  full  Board did  not  officially  convene as  a Risk  Committee during  the Reporting  Period,  however 
risk-related discussions occurred from time to time during the year as required.
Recommendation 7.2 
 
The  Board  reviews  the  Company’s  risk  management  framework  bi-annually  to  satisfy  itself  that  it 
continues to be sound, to determine whether there have been any changes in the material business 
risks the Company faces and to ensure that the Company is operating within the risk appetite set by 
the Board.  The Board carried out these reviews during the Reporting Period. 
 
Recommendation 7.3 
 
The  Company  does  not  have  an  internal  audit  function.    To  evaluate  and  continually  improve  the 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal control processes, the Board relies on 
ongoing  reporting  and  discussion  of  the  management  of  material  business  risks  as  outlined  in  the 
Company’s Risk Management Policy. 
 
Recommendation 7.4 
 
As the Company is not in production nor has any major operations, in its present circumstances, the 
Company has not identified any material exposure to economic sustainability and limited exposure to 
environmental sustainability or social sustainability risks associated with its project in Chile.  
 
As the Company’s operations in Chile are recent, the Company is in the process of implementing its 
risk  management  practices  with  respect  to  its  sustainability  risks.  As  part  of  its  mitigating  practices, 
the  Company  will  use  its  local  knowledge  and  expertise  to  ensure  such  risks  are  managed 
appropriately.  
 
Utilising its Risk Management Framework, the Company has identified the following risk categories:

