<p><i>Summary 
</i>The Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international 
</p>
<p>financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly 
economic, social and cultural rights, visited Japan from 16 to 19 July 2013 to assess, inter 
alia, the contribution of its official development assistance to the realization of economic, 
social and cultural rights and the right to development, as well as the attainment of the 
Millennium Development Goals. He also considered the extent to which human rights 
standards are reflected in Japanese international development cooperation and transactions 
backed by Japanese export credits. 
</p>
<p>Japan has a commendable international development cooperation programme, which 
focuses on enhancing the capacity of its partner countries to be self-reliant and ensuring 
that individuals and communities are free from fear and want. However, the programme 
could be strengthened by integrating a human rights-based approach. This would require an 
explicit commitment to incorporating human rights into the formulation, implementation 
and monitoring of Japanese development assistance policies and programmes, as well as a 
focus on addressing the root causes of poverty, insecurity and underdevelopment.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Independent Expert conducted an official visit to Japan from 16 to 19 July 2013 
to assess the impact of its international development cooperation on the realization of 
human rights, as well as the extent to which human rights are reflected in its development 
cooperation policy. He also examined concerns related to the human rights and social 
impacts of investment projects backed by Japanese export credits and how they have been 
addressed by the country&#8217;s export credit agencies.  
</p>
<p>2. The Independent Expert met with a broad range of stakeholders, including 
representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs; Finance; Economy, Trade and Industry; 
and representatives of Japan International Cooperation Agency, Nippon Export and 
Investment Insurance, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation. At the invitation of 
the Government, he observed a policy dialogue meeting between the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Japanese non-governmental organizations (NGOs). He also met with civil 
society organizations, United Nations agencies and local experts on issues within his 
mandate.  
</p>
<p>3. He wishes to express his gratitude to all of his interlocutors for sharing their 
perspectives. In particular, he is grateful to the Government of Japan for its invitation and 
willingness to engage in constructive dialogue.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Analytical context: The obligation of international assistance 
and cooperation  
</b></p>
<p>4. Japan has ratified key international human rights treaties1 such as the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, both of which enshrine a fundamental principle of human rights law, international 
assistance and cooperation.2 This provides the context for the assessment of Japanese 
international development cooperation policy undertaken in the present report. 
</p>
<p>5. In its general comment No. 3 (1990) on the nature of States parties&#8217; obligations, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights affirmed that &#8220;international 
cooperation for development and thus for the realization of economic, social and cultural 
rights is an obligation of all States&#8221; which is &#8220;particularly incumbent upon those States 
which are in a position to assist others in this regard&#8221; (para. 14). Similarly, in its general 
comment No. 5 (2003) on general measures of implementation of the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child, the Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that assistance 
provided by States should be rights-based (para. 61). 
</p><p>6. The obligations of international assistance and cooperation require States to conduct 
their activities with due regard for the human rights of the peoples of other States.3 In that 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 Japan is a party to all the core international human rights treaties except the International Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 See the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, arts. 2 (1) and 23, and the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child, art. 4. The principle is also reflected in arts. 1 (3) and 56 of the 
Charter of the United Nations and art. 3 (3) of the Declaration on the Right to Development. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3
 See Maastricht Principles on Extraterritorial Obligations of States in the area of Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights, principles 3, 8 and 28&#8211;35, and Olivier De Schutter and others, &#8220;Commentary to the 
Maastricht Principles on Extraterritorial Obligations of States in the area of Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/50/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b>  
</p>
<p>regard, States must &#8220;scrupulously avoid involvement in projects which, for example &#8230; 
promote or reinforce discrimination against individuals or groups contrary to the provisions 
of the Covenant, or involve large-scale evictions or displacement of persons without the 
provision of all appropriate protection and compensation&#8221; and must &#8220;act as advocates of 
projects and approaches which contribute not only to economic growth or other broadly 
defined objectives, but also to enhanced enjoyment of the full range of human rights&#8221;.4 This 
implies that economic, social and cultural rights should be afforded due attention in all 
international agreements, whether bilateral or multilateral. 
</p>
<p>7. In implementing their development cooperation policies and programmes, including 
the provision of official development assistance (ODA), States must ensure that such 
policies and programmes are consistent with human rights standards and principles, 
including the principles of non-discrimination, participation, transparency and 
accountability.  
</p>
<p>8. In particular, as the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stated, 
any development assistance States provide should help partner countries to comply with 
their own human rights obligations (E/C.12/2001/10, paras. 16&#8211;17). States have an 
obligation to ensure that third parties involved in the delivery and implementation of their 
development assistance, such as private contractors and technical advisers, do not interfere 
with the enjoyment and realization of human rights in partner countries.5 
</p>
<p><b> III. International development cooperation programme 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Development cooperation policy  
</b></p>
<p>9. The international development cooperation policy of Japan is guided by its Official 
Development Assistance Charter of August 2003,6 which is underpinned by five basic 
principles: supporting the self-help efforts of developing countries, focusing on human 
security, assurance of fairness, utilization of Japanese experience and expertise, and 
partnership and collaboration with the international community. The overarching objective 
of Japanese development cooperation is to contribute to the peace and development of the 
international community, and thereby help ensure the security and prosperity of Japan. 
</p>
<p>10. The Charter identifies four priority issues: poverty reduction, sustainable growth, 
addressing global issues and peacebuilding.7 In order to reduce the vulnerabilities faced by

 According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the key priorities of development cooperation are 
</p>
<p>identified annually. In 2013, they were to: (a) realize a prosperous and stable international community 
with freedom; (b) support emerging/developing economies to grow together with Japan; and (c) 
promote human security and strengthen trust in Japan. Specific efforts to realize those priorities 
included providing assistance to countries which shared universal values and strategic interests with 
Japan, developing in partner countries infrastructure systems designed by Japan, addressing 
environmental and climate change issues and contributing to achieving the Millennium Development 
Goals and the post-2015 development agenda. See 
www.mofa.go.jp/policy/oda/oda_policy/pdfs/priority_policy_13.pdf. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/50/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>people, communities and countries, Japan addresses the priority issues identified in the 
Charter bearing in mind the notion of human security, which is a defining feature of its 
official development assistance programme. 
</p>
<p>11. Promoting human security entails focusing on individuals and building societies in 
which everyone can live with dignity by protecting and empowering individuals and 
communities that face actual or potential threats. In practice, that means: (a) protecting 
individuals from fears, such as conflict, terrorism, crime, human rights violations, 
displacement, disease epidemics, environmental destruction, economic crises and natural 
disasters, and from wants, such as poverty, hunger, and lack of educational and health 
services; and (b) establishing mechanisms that empower people so that they can address 
those threats.8  
</p>
<p>12. The concept of human security resonates with the three pillars of the United Nations, 
namely, peace and security, development, and respect for human rights. The Independent 
Expert considers that the concept requires further elaboration if it is to contribute to the 
effectiveness and sustainability of Japanese development assistance. In addition, the 
concept has an accountability deficit in that it is not underpinned by any legally binding or 
enforceable standards.  
</p>
<p>13. The Japanese ODA Charter is supplemented by the Japanese medium-term policy on 
ODA and its Country Assistance Programmes, which are formulated and implemented in 
accordance with the Charter. There are also sector-specific development policies and 
initiatives which, in 2011, focused on several issues including gender, education, health 
care, water and sanitation, environment, trade and investment and disaster risk reduction. 
</p>
<p>14. The bulk of Japanese ODA is provided in the form of bilateral aid, reflecting its 
importance as a foreign policy instrument. Japan utilizes three main channels for its 
bilateral development assistance: (a) loans with concessional conditions for interest and 
repayment; (b) grants, typically for projects, emergencies and food aid; and (c) technical 
cooperation involving training courses and despatch of Japanese experts and technical 
advisors. In 2012, its gross bilateral ODA disbursements amounted to US$ 14.46 billion. Of 
that amount, US$ 7.7 billion (53.3 per cent) was provided in the form of loans, US$ 3.92 
billion (27.1 per cent) as grant aid and US$ 2.84 billion (19.7 per cent) in the form of 
technical cooperation.  
</p>
<p>15. The relatively high use of loans reflects the belief of Japan that the requirement to 
repay encourages recipients to be fiscally responsible and to allocate resources more 
efficiently. This links with its emphasis on promoting self-reliance among its partner 
countries.  
</p>
<p>16. In 2011&#8211;2012, the grant element of Japanese ODA was, at 88.8 per cent, lower than 
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average (95.2 per 
cent).9 For development loans, the grant element was 75.5 per cent, but reached 98.4 per 
cent for ODA to least developed countries. In 2012, 71 per cent of all Japanese ODA was 
untied, 11.6 per cent was tied and for 17.4 per cent of its ODA, the tying status was not 
reported.10 While Japan meets the 2001 OECD-Development Assistance Committee (DAC)

<p>recommendations to untie aid, its loan assistance is overwhelmingly directed to 
infrastructure projects in partner countries where there are Japanese business interests.11 
The use of ODA to build international friendships and alliances and to promote Japanese 
interests and business overseas may, as OECD has cautioned, sometimes &#8220;override its 
primary development objective&#8221;.12 
</p><p>17. About one third of Japanese ODA is provided to multilateral organizations. The 
largest recipients are the World Bank (US$ 1.55 billion) and regional development banks 
(US$ 969 million), followed by United Nations agencies (US$ 679 million).  
18. In recent years, Japanese ODA has been declining.13 It fell from US$ 11.06 billion in 
2010 to US$ 10.83 billion in 2011 and US$ 10.60 billion in 2012. Its net ODA 
disbursements in 2012 represented 0.17 per cent of its gross national income (GNI), which 
is well below the OECD average of 0.32 per cent of GNI and significantly below the United 
Nations target of 0.7 per cent.  
</p>
<p>19. The Independent Expert acknowledges the economic and fiscal challenges Japan has 
been facing as a consequence of the global economic crisis and recent natural disasters 
which the country has suffered, such as the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011. He 
commends the Government for continuing to accord priority to ODA despite those 
setbacks. He urges the Government to set out a road map for progress towards the United 
Nations ODA/GNI target of 0.7 per cent as its economic and fiscal situation improves.14 
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>20. The main implementing agency of Japanese ODA is the Japan International 
Cooperation Agency (JICA), the world&#8217;s largest bilateral aid agency. JICA works in over 
150 countries and has some 100 offices around the world. It provides bilateral aid in the 
form of technical cooperation, loan aid and grant aid.15 In October 2008, ODA loans, which 
were formerly administered by Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and grant aid, 
which was formerly under the supervision of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were 
integrated into the portfolio of JICA. In the fiscal year 2011, technical cooperation 
implemented by JICA amounted to &#165;188.9 billion, grant aid to &#165;107.6 billion, and loan aid 
disbursements of &#165;609.7 billion were provided to 51 countries. JICA also administers Japan 
Oversees Cooperation Volunteers programmes and dispatches disaster relief teams in 
response to requests from governments of affected countries. 
</p>
<p>21. Other government departments, including the Ministries of Finance; Education, 
Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; and Economy, Trade and Industry also provide 
development assistance. For example, contributions to the World Bank and multilateral 
development banks are provided through the Ministry of Finance, while support to United 
Nations agencies and programmes falls under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry 
of Education mainly provides scholarship support to students from developing countries to 
study in Japan, while most funds channelled through the Ministry of Economy, Trade and

</p>
<p>14
 In 2002, at the International Conference on Financing for Development, Japan committed to make 
</p>
<p>concrete efforts towards the 0.7 per cent ODA/GNI target, but did not set a timeline for reaching it.

<p>Industry are used to dispatch experts to developing countries to improve the environment 
for trade and investment and to disseminate successful Japanese technologies.16  
</p>
<p><b> C. The role of civil society 
</b></p>
<p>22. The Government of Japan has a robust policy of engagement with local civil society 
organizations in relation to its international development cooperation programme. Since 
1996, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has hosted regular meetings with NGOs which are 
aimed at promoting a stronger partnership and dialogue on ODA policies and funding 
assistance for NGOs.17 The Independent Expert thanks the Government for extending an 
invitation to him to observe one such meeting during his visit. 
</p>
<p>23. Beginning in 2002, meetings involving staff of Japanese embassies, other 
development assistance organizations and Japanese NGOs that work in developing 
countries have been held with a view to exchanging ideas concerning the efficient and 
effective implementation of Japanese ODA.18 In addition, JICA holds meetings with civil 
society organizations in Japan and in partner countries in order to promote their 
participation in the Japanese development cooperation programme.19  
</p>
<p>24. Those initiatives are commendable. Nevertheless, dialogue and support for local 
civil society organizations in partner countries should be strengthened so as to empower 
them to undertake more effectively their critical role in fostering the accountability of their 
governments for development assistance received. 
</p>
<p>25. The Government of Japan recognizes that partnerships with NGOs in partner 
countries contribute not only to the socioeconomic development of those countries, but also 
to strengthening their civil societies. To that end, it provides Grant Assistance for Grass-
Roots Human Security Projects.20 Nevertheless, from the information available on the 
website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it does not appear that local or international 
human rights organizations have received much support.21 While there were several 
projects with a focus on women, children or persons with disabilities, it is unclear whether 
those projects focus specifically on the protection of the rights of those or other 
marginalized groups. It is critical that support is provided to the projects of local civil 
society actors representing vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in order to enable them to 
engage in dialogue with policymakers and enhance their capacity to assert their rights 
through existing judicial and other procedures at national or international level.

 Ibid., p. 143. In 2011, government financial support to NGOs was US$ 369 million. Nonetheless, the 
</p>
<p>percentage of Japanese ODA provided to NGOs remains low in comparison to other OECD-DAC 
countries. During 2010&#8211;2011, only 1.9 per cent of its ODA went to NGOs compared with an average 
of around 12.1 per cent for other OECD-DAC members. Around half of Japanese support for NGOs 
is provided or channelled through civil society organizations in Japan, while around 20 per cent of the 
ODA budget goes to international NGOs, and NGOs located in developing countries receive around 
35 per cent. See OECD, <i>Aid for CSOs</i>, October 2013, pp. 6&#8211;7. Available from

</p>
<p><b> D. Private sector involvement 
</b></p>
<p>26. A key priority of Japanese international cooperation policies is the promotion of 
private sector-led growth. According to the ODA White Paper 2011, &#8220;Japanese private 
companies&#8217; activities in developing countries make a significant contribution beyond ODA 
projects, by creating opportunities for local employment, augmenting tax revenue, 
expanding trade and investment, contributing to the acquisition of foreign currency, and 
transferring Japan&#8217;s superior technology&#8221;.22 In April 2008, Japan announced a policy to 
strengthen partnership between ODA and private investment, and to promote private sector 
business activities in developing countries. In addition, the Independent Expert notes that 
the Tokyo International Conference on African Development held in June 2013 also 
emphasized the role of foreign direct investment in contributing to development, which is 
laudable. However, it is equally important that attention is paid to enhancing the capacities 
of local businesses in partner countries to be internationally competitive. 
</p>
<p>27. The Independent Expert is of the view that efforts designed to boost Japanese 
foreign investments, including economic partnership agreements, should be consistent with 
relevant international human rights standards including the guiding principles on foreign 
debt and human rights (A/HRC/20/23, annex), the Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights (A/HRC/17/31, annex) and relevant international labour standards.  
</p><p>28. Consideration should also be given to ensuring more comprehensive regulation of 
Japanese foreign business activities to address issues such as tax evasion and other forms of 
capital flight which undermine the capacity of countries to mobilize sufficient domestic 
resources for their development. Such an approach would be consistent with the principle 
of self-help, which is a key element of Japanese ODA policy, and would also contribute to 
international efforts to tackle illicit financial flows. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Debt relief 
</b></p>
<p>29. Although initially reluctant to support the idea of debt cancellation for highly 
indebted countries, Japan has provided significant bilateral debt relief and contributed to 
multilateral debt relief efforts.23 Since 2003, it has cancelled ODA and non-ODA related 
debts amounting to US$ 18.37 billion.24  
</p><p>30. The Independent Expert commends the Government of Japan for its debt relief 
efforts, including those at the multilateral level. He would, however, like to draw the 
attention of the Government of Japan to the fact that existing multilateral debt relief 
initiatives show a mixed record, and have not been able to fully address the underlying 
causes of the debt crisis. Thus, in his report to the twenty-third session of the Human Rights 
Council (A/HRC/23/37), the Independent Expert called upon the international community 
to consider solutions that could help deliver an equitable and durable solution to the debt 
crisis. He urges the Government to use its influence in multilateral institutions, such as the

</p>
<p>23
 The Government was concerned that debt cancellation would reduce the credibility of developing 
</p>
<p>countries and limit their ability to borrow from international financial markets. In addition, article 8 of 
the Japanese Finance Act prohibited cancelling a part or all of any country&#8217;s debt unless new 
legislation was passed requiring parliamentary approval for any debt cancellation. See Junichi 
Hasegawa, &#8220;International debt management: Japan&#8217;s policy towards Africa&#8221;, in <i>Japan and Africa.

<p>World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank, to ensure 
that the provision of loans or debt relief is not conditional on the implementation of unduly 
onerous policies that may undermine the sustainability and ownership of recipient 
countries&#8217; development efforts. In that regard, he encourages the Government to promote 
the use by the international financial institutions of the guiding principles on foreign debt 
and human rights, which were endorsed by the Human Rights Council in June 2012, to 
inform the design and implementation of their policies and programmes on lending and 
debt relief.  
</p>
<p>31. Additionally, in order to safeguard the gains from multilateral debt initiatives and to 
prevent inequitable burden sharing among creditors, it is important that all States enact 
legislation to curb the predatory activities of vulture funds.25 There is currently no evidence 
of vulture fund litigation against States before the Japanese courts. Nonetheless, the 
Independent Expert urges the Government to take pre-emptive measures against such a 
possibility by enacting legislation that would limit the ability of vulture funds to use the 
Japanese courts to recover extortionate amounts from poor countries, in the process eroding 
the gains from international debt relief efforts to which Japanese taxpayers have 
contributed. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Export credits and human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Export credit agencies 
</b></p>
<p>32. As is the case with most OECD member countries, Japan seeks to promote overseas 
investments and exports, as well as to maintain the international competitiveness of its 
industries through export credits.26 It has two official export credit agencies: Japan Bank for 
International Cooperation (JBIC) and Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI), 
both of which are wholly owned by the State.  
</p>
<p>33. JBIC is a policy-based financial institution established under the Japan Bank for 
International Cooperation Act (Act No. 39 of 2011). It mainly provides various types of 
loans27 for projects aiming at overseas development and securing of resources such as oil, 
liquefied natural gas, iron and copper, which are important for Japan, and maintaining and 
improving the international competitiveness of Japanese industries.28 It also aims to support 
projects undertaken outside Japan that have a favourable impact on the preservation of the 
global environment or are aimed at preventing global warming. It is supervised by the 
Minister of Finance.  
</p>
<p>34. NEXI mainly provides various types of insurance to cover political and commercial 
risks involved in business or overseas transactions, such as export, import, investment and 
financing, which private insurance cannot cover.29 In 2011, NEXI underwrote &#165;7.1 trillion 
in export credit insurance.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>25
 See the report of the Independent Expert to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/14/21). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>26
 Export credits are government-backed loans which support companies doing business abroad, 
</p>
<p>particularly for high-risk projects. Collectively, they are one of the world&#8217;s largest sources of public 
financing for private sector projects. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>27
 Such loans include overseas investment loans (60 per cent of its commitments); guarantees to 
</p>
<p>supplement or encourage financing for private financial institutions (14 per cent); export loans (13 per 
cent); and import loans (11 per cent). Their total value was &#165;1,595 billion in 2011.

<p><b> B. Human rights issues 
</b></p>
<p>35. While export credit agencies serve an important function in international trade and 
investment, they also raise important concerns, including the exacerbation of poor 
countries&#8217; debt problems and negative impacts on human rights and the environment, as 
explained in the 2011 report of the Independent Expert to the General Assembly 
(A/66/271). In addition, export credit agencies tend to be secretive and often lack 
transparency and accountability in their funding decisions and operations.  
</p>
<p>36. JBIC and NEXI have been involved in projects such as the Coral Bay Nickel 
Processing Plant Project, the Taganito Processing Plant Project and the San Roque 
Multipurpose Dam Project30 in the Philippines; the Baku-T&#8217;bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline (BTC 
pipeline);31 and the Papua New Guinea Liquefied Natural Gas Project,32 all of which have 
generated a great deal of controversy. For example, it has been alleged that the BTC 
pipeline posed a number of environmental and human rights risks, and violated the 
safeguard policies of the World Bank.33 In a similar vein, several environmental and human 
rights concerns have been raised in relation to the Coral Bay Nickel Project, including the 
lack of prior and informed consent from indigenous peoples, the impact on coral reefs and 
the leakage of hazardous waste from the tailing dams.34 
</p>
<p><b> C. Measures to address human rights and other concerns 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Independent Expert notes that NEXI and JBIC both have guidelines on 
environmental and social considerations.35 The guidelines, which largely correspond to the 
safeguard policies of the World Bank, are based on the OECD Recommendation of the 
Council on Common Approaches for Officially Supported Export Credits and

www.jica.go.jp/english/our_work/social_environmental/guideline/index.html. The term 
&#8220;environmental and social considerations&#8221; refers not only to the natural environment, but also to 
social issues such as involuntary resettlement and respect for the human rights of indigenous people 
(JBIC Guidelines, p. 1). </p>

</b></p>
<p>Environmental and Social Due Diligence (&#8220;the Common Approaches&#8221;). They are designed 
to prevent or mitigate the negative environmental and social impacts of development 
projects supported by NEXI and JBIC. According to the guidelines, partner countries, 
borrowers or other project proponents bear ultimate responsibility for environmental and 
social considerations of projects, but both agencies encourage their partners to take 
remedial measures to address the social and environmental impacts of the projects that they 
support.  
</p>
<p>38. It is notable, however, that neither set of guidelines offers an effective accountability 
mechanism. Although the guidelines provide for a procedure allowing affected persons to 
raise their concerns with an independent panel, the panel can only make non-binding 
recommendations.36 Moreover, under the NEXI Guidelines, the examiner works under the 
direct control of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NEXI.37 It is also notable that 
the objections procedures have rarely been used,38 suggesting that they are not well known 
by the affected groups or communities. 
</p>
<p>39. Those omissions should be addressed as a matter of priority. While the Independent 
Expert is of the view that that the existing guidelines offer some degree of protection, he 
believes that they could be significantly enhanced through explicit references to the 
international human rights obligations of Japan as well as international labour standards.  
</p>
<p>40. As a member of OECD, Japan subscribes to the Common Approaches. However, the 
Common Approaches are not legally binding and fail to explicitly require export credit 
agencies and their clients to commit clearly and unambiguously to respect human rights and 
establish adequate human rights due diligence processes. Moreover, the Common 
Approaches have failed to prevent export credit agencies from supporting a range of 
egregious projects. 
</p><p>41. States where an export credit agency-supported project is implemented have the 
primary responsibility to ensure that the project activities comply with their international 
human rights obligations. However, it is important to note that the agency&#8217;s home State is 
also responsible for the regulation and supervision of the activities carried out by the 
national export credit agency that have a negative impact on the enjoyment of the human 
rights of the population of the host State. As noted by the Special Representative of the 
Secretary General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other 
business enterprises, &#8220;States should take steps to protect against human rights abuses by 
business enterprises that are owned or controlled by the State, or that receive substantial 
support and services from State agencies such as export credit agencies &#8230; including, where 
appropriate, by requiring human rights due diligence&#8221; (A/HRC/17/31, annex, principle 4). 
42. As State-owned entities, NEXI and JBIC are bound by the international human 
rights obligations of Japan. Ensuring compliance with human rights standards is therefore 
not a voluntary undertaking in support of a partner country, but a legal obligation derived 
from the human rights obligations binding on Japan and its public institutions, including its 
State-owned agencies.

<p>43. The Independent Expert urges the Government of Japan to take steps to strengthen 
the JBIC and NEXI guidelines by, inter alia, including requirements for comprehensive 
human rights impact assessments, in addition to the environmental and social impact 
assessments already required, and ensuring the free, active and meaningful participation, 
rather than mere consultation, of the affected communities.  
</p>
<p>44. Another aspect requiring attention is the lack of transparency concerning the 
contracts between those agencies and their clients. Non-disclosure of such contracts has 
been justified by reference to commercial confidentiality. In the Independent Expert&#8217;s 
estimation, however, since the agencies are public entities, there is a duty to account to the 
Japanese public and to the citizens of the countries where the projects they support are 
located. Transparency would increase the accountability of the agencies to both the 
Japanese public and the citizens of the host countries and would ultimately assist Japan in 
complying with its extraterritorial human rights obligations, as well as the obligations of 
international assistance and cooperation.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Japanese official development assistance: Its impact on the 
realization of human rights and the Millennium Development 
Goals 
</b></p>
<p><b>  A. Development assistance policy and human rights  
</b></p>
<p>45. The Japanese ODA Charter explicitly refers to the importance of working with 
countries that respect, protect and fulfil human rights. It underlines that &#8220;Japan will give 
priority to assisting developing countries that make active efforts to pursue peace, 
democratization, and the protection of human rights, as well as structural reform in the 
economic and social spheres&#8221;.39 It also places emphasis on the protection of individuals, 
their empowerment, attention to the condition of the socially vulnerable and closing the gap 
between the rich and the poor. Furthermore, it stresses the importance of gender equality 
and improving the status of women and their active participation in development.  
</p>
<p>46. The Japanese Initiative on Gender and Development, adopted in March 2005, 
outlines the current approach to gender mainstreaming.40 The document stresses that &#8220;Japan 
will seek to promote gender mainstreaming broadly in its ODA and throughout the process 
of needs assessment, policy formulation, project formulation, implementation, monitoring 
and evaluation&#8221;.41 The policy indicates that that a gender equality perspective will be fully 
taken into account when country assistance programmes or sector or issue specific policies 
are formulated and that gender issues will be shared with recipient countries in policy 
dialogues. It underlines the need for gender analysis and promoting women&#8217;s as well as 
men&#8217;s participation in decision-making at the stages of planning, implementing and 
evaluating ODA policies and projects affecting their lives. The Initiative also incorporates 
assistance for policies and institutions that promote gender equality at the international and 
national level. This includes support in the &#8220;formulation of national policy on the 
advancement of women; institutional strengthening of national machinery; establishing

<p>legal and institutional frameworks from a gender perspective; upgrading gender statistics; 
gender awareness-raising of government officials through gender training.&#8221;42  
</p>
<p>47. Poverty reduction is another priority issue identified in the Charter and in the 
Medium-Term Policy on Official Development Assistance. The Charter stresses that &#8220;Japan 
will give high priority to providing assistance to such sectors as education, health care and 
welfare, water and sanitation and agriculture&#8221;.43 The Medium-Term Policy identifies direct 
assistance to the poor as one avenue for poverty reduction. This includes &#8220;strengthening the 
capabilities of the poor and of communities so as to enable the poor to participate in the 
formulation of aid policies, in project planning and in the implementation process&#8221;.44 The 
Policy mentions that &#8220;it is important to establish institutions and policies that protect the 
rights of the poor based on the principle of equality under the law, and to enable the poor to 
participate in political activities and to exercise their capabilities. Assistance will therefore 
be provided to contribute to the protection of human rights, the rule of law, and the 
promotion of democratization&#8221;.45 
</p>
<p><b> B. Impact on the realization of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>48. It has been asserted that Japan lacks a comprehensive and coherent strategy to 
contribute to the promotion, protection and fulfilment of human rights in its official 
development cooperation. According to one observer, Japanese human rights diplomacy 
differs from that of other developed countries, such as the United States and the member 
States of the European Union, in that it is based on a &#8220;non-intrusive and accommodative 
approach, which is largely compatible with ASEAN&#8217;s [Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations] diplomatic style&#8221; and that &#8220;at least in relative terms, Japan makes little effort to 
promote human rights in Southeast Asia&#8221;.46 In a similar vein, Human Rights Watch points 
to the cautious approach to human rights diplomacy adopted by Japanese officials, arguing 
that it is motivated by a desire to avoid jeopardizing &#8220;friendly relations with other countries, 
harming Japan&#8217;s economic interests or risking criticism of Japan&#8217;s war record&#8221;.47  
</p>
<p>49. It is difficult, in the absence of comprehensive information from the countries 
receiving Japanese ODA, to assess the extent to which Japanese official development 
assistance impacts on the realization of human rights in such countries. It can be argued, 
however, that Japanese development assistance does contribute to the realization of 
economic, social and cultural rights in its partner countries. Projects implemented to reduce 
poverty through the establishment of social security schemes, promoting education, 
strengthening health care or providing access to clean drinking water contribute to the 
realization of the rights to social security, education, health or safe drinking water and 
sanitation, respectively. In 2009, Japanese human rights-related bilateral ODA 
disbursements were allocated to: health and welfare (US$ 354.45 million), gender equality 
(US$ 1,870.75 million) and measures relating to persons with disabilities (US$ 1,687.46 
million).

</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>50. It can also be argued that the particular efforts of Japan in disaster risk reduction 
protect human rights, since the ultimate aim of disaster risk reduction is not only to protect 
social and economic infrastructure from earthquakes, floods or other natural disasters, but 
to prevent loss of life and other harm to individuals. Such assistance may therefore 
contribute to the protection of the right to life and to physical integrity in the event of a 
natural disaster. 
</p>
<p>51. Nevertheless, a review of Japanese development cooperation at project level does 
not lead to clear conclusions concerning the human rights impacts of the country&#8217;s 
development assistance.48 While it can be argued that the overall aim of Japanese 
development cooperation is to support partner countries in one way or the other in their 
efforts to realize economic, social and cultural rights, human rights do not feature as 
prominently in bilateral development cooperation, either at policy or at project level. Very 
few projects can be identified as having the explicit aim to strengthen human rights, the rule 
of law or transitional justice, to train public officials on human rights issues or empower 
rights holders to claim their rights through justice mechanisms at local, national or 
international level. Thus, for instance, while it should be noted that Japan has contributed 
substantial funds to the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia and supported 
that country&#8217;s efforts in rebuilding its own legal system, efforts appear to be mainly focused 
on drafting basic civil and economic laws in Cambodia and several other partner countries; in 
that context, human rights appear not to be a major focus of Japanese assistance in the legal 
field. 
</p>
<p>52. While equality, human rights, the participation of the poor in political activities and 
the protection of the rights of the poor form part of the Japanese official poverty reduction 
strategy, those principles do not appear to receive much attention at project level. 
Furthermore, the emphasis given to poverty reduction, education, health care and welfare in 
policy documents is less discernible when considering which sectors receive the largest 
share of Japanese ODA. Nearly half of all ODA funds are devoted to economic 
infrastructure including transport, communications and energy or for projects related to 
industry, mining and construction. While those funds are also spent on small-scale 
infrastructure projects, most of the assistance relates to large-scale infrastructure projects. 
In 2011, education and health care, to which Japan devotes high priority according to its 
Medium-Term Policy, received a combined total of 8.4 per cent of all ODA funds.49 Even 
in the education sector, approximately 70 to 90 per cent is reported to be spent on teachers&#8217; 
salaries,50 while assistance devoted to basic education is limited to 0.5 per cent of all 
bilateral aid.51 
</p>
<p>53. Japan attaches a great deal of importance to the promotion of human rights through 
dialogue and cooperation based on mutual understanding and respect.52 In that regard, it has 
held regular bilateral dialogue and consultations on human rights with the governments of 
more than 10 countries. In situations of concern, Japan deals cautiously with implementing

<p>development assistance and conveys its deep concern to the recipient country regarding the 
status of democratization and human rights.53 
</p>
<p>54. In line with its Initiative on Gender and Development, Japan endeavours to ensure 
that a gender perspective is integrated into all aspects of its development assistance. 
According to an OECD-DAC assessment of support for gender equality and women&#8217;s 
empowerment, in 2011, Japan allocated US$ 160 million of its ODA to activities that aim 
primarily to support gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment, while an additional US$ 
1,851 million was allocated for activities in which gender equality was an important, but 
secondary, objective.54 Although Japanese gender equality-focused aid increased 
significantly from around 6 per cent of all sector-allocable aid in 2002 to 19 per cent in 
2011, it still remained below the OECD-DAC average of 32 per cent.55 Japanese efforts in 
the area of gender mainstreaming include cooperation with international aid organizations, 
NGOs, research institutions and raising awareness on gender related issues among Japanese 
development practitioners, including training of staff in ODA related ministries and 
agencies. 
</p>
<p>55. Japan also promotes human rights through financial support for the human rights 
activities undertaken by several United Nations entities, such as the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF) and UN-Women. In 2010, for example, it contributed about US$ 5 million to 
UN-Women, while in 2012, it contributed significantly less &#8212; US$ 946,809.56 In addition, 
its voluntary contributions to OHCHR (US$ 577,226 in 2012) have fallen. The Independent 
Expert urges the Government of Japan to scale up its financial support to United Nations 
agencies so as to enhance their effectiveness and efficiency.  
</p>
<p>56. While to a large extent development cooperation aims to assist in realizing 
economic, social and cultural rights, development projects may also have negative human 
rights impacts. In particular, large-scale infrastructure projects, such as dams, mining, oil 
and gas exploitation, industry, energy plants, highways or airports, can have a negative 
impact on communities and individuals living in the project area or region.

<p><b> C. Attainment of the Millennium Development Goals 
</b></p>
<p>57. Japan has been a leading actor in promoting the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) at the international level. In recent years, it has made particular efforts to support 
the attainment of Goals related to education and health care. At the High-level Plenary 
Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals in September 
2010, Japan pledged US$ 5 billion in assistance to the health sector and US$ 3.5 billion to 
the education sector to contribute to efforts for the realization of the MDGs.57 In June 2011, 
it hosted an MDG follow-up meeting jointly with the United Nations.

<p>58. Japan is also active in the discussions concerning the post-2015 development 
framework. The Independent Expert welcomes the fact that, in the context of the post-
development framework, Japan aims to promote universal access to basic health-care 
services, to close the gap in access to health services between wealthy and poor people, to 
shift health care from a disease-oriented to a people-centred approach, and therefore to 
promote universal health coverage in order to satisfy broader health and medical needs.58  
</p>
<p>59. In the context of the discussions on the post-2015 framework, Japan has proposed a 
new development framework guided by the principle of human security. Although that 
principle recognizes the interlinkages between peace, development and human rights, its 
precise meaning remains unclear. This poses a problem in terms of operationalizing the 
principle. Furthermore, the Independent Expert considers that a human security approach 
may not, in itself, be sufficient to guarantee accountability for delivery on commitments in 
the new development framework.  
</p>
<p>60. It should be noted that the lack of an accountability mechanism for ensuring delivery 
on the declaratory, non-binding political commitments made by the international 
community in relation to the MDGs has been cited as a key reason for the inadequate 
progress on the Goals. Thus, it has been suggested that a post-2015 development agenda 
should be underpinned by human rights as a universal normative and legally binding 
framework embodying the minimum requirements of a life in dignity. The Independent 
Expert agrees. In his report to the 2013 General Assembly (A/68/542), he underscored the 
fact that a major shortcoming of the existing development goals is that they largely failed to 
integrate existing human rights obligations. He also noted that the accountability 
framework for the Goals, which consists of voluntary monitoring and reporting at the 
national level and United Nations reports on regional and global progress, is largely 
detached from national and international human rights accountability mechanisms. 
Consequently, States can report on their progress without reference to their human rights 
obligations and without taking into consideration the outcomes of the scrutiny of their 
human rights performance as undertaken by the treaty monitoring bodies.  
</p>
<p>61. The Independent Expert therefore encourages the Government of Japan to give due 
consideration, in the discussions concerning the post-2015 development framework, to the 
need for accountability mechanisms anchored to the international human rights framework 
which promote the active and meaningful participation of those most affected by poverty 
and deprivation and increase the responsiveness of the State or those in authority.  
</p>
<p>62. It is notable that accountability is a key feature of the human rights-based approach 
to development. From the human rights viewpoint, accountability refers to the relationship 
between duty bearers and the rights holders who are affected by their decisions, actions and 
omissions. It requires the Government and other duty bearers to take responsibility for their 
decisions, actions and omissions, to answer for them by explaining or justifying them to the 
public or those affected, and to be subject to some kind of enforceable sanction if their 
conduct has resulted in human rights violations.59 Accountability also enables rights holders 
to access fair and transparent mechanisms to enforce their claims against duty bearers, and 
to obtain appropriate redress when their rights have been infringed. In that way, 
accountability enhances policymaking and delivery of services.

<p><b> D. The need for a human rights-based approach 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Independent Expert considers that human rights could occupy a more prominent 
place in Japanese international development cooperation policy. In particular, the 
Government should make a more explicit commitment to incorporating human rights 
principles into the design, implementation and monitoring of its ODA policies by adopting 
a policy statement on human rights and development cooperation. Other leading providers 
of ODA, such as the Canadian International Development Agency, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of Finland, Germany (BMZ/GIZ), the Swedish International Development 
Cooperation Agency, the Department for International Development of the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States Agency for 
International Development have done so.60 Such a policy statement should be 
complemented by operational and implementation guidelines, related manuals and practical 
tools, as well as human rights training for Japanese officials working in the area of 
development cooperation.  
</p>
<p>64. A human rights-based approach guiding development cooperation policies and 
programmes promotes equality and non-discrimination, participation and empowerment, as 
well as transparency and accountability. It views the people as agents of their own 
development and brings about a shift in perspective: those in need and target groups are 
seen as bearers of rights and State partners as bearers of duties. A human rights-approach to 
development includes both support to State institutions as duty bearers, to enable them to 
meet their obligations, and assistance and empowerment of rights holders and civil society 
to ensure that they can claim their rights.  
</p>
<p>65. In the context of Japanese international development cooperation, a rights-based 
approach would require that human rights principles of equality and non-discrimination, 
participation, empowerment, transparency and accountability are reflected at all stages of 
formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of all development cooperation 
policies. A rights-based approach would also prioritize support to those social groups that 
are most affected by discrimination: women, children, persons with disabilities, indigenous 
peoples and minorities. It is oriented at eliminating the structural causes of poverty, social 
exclusion and violent conflicts, and is compatible with the Japanese human security agenda. 
Meaningful participation can ensure that the interests of affected individuals are reflected in 
decision-making and that clashes of interest can be solved in a peaceful manner. 
Strengthening justice mechanisms, including non-judicial mechanisms, and ensuring that all 
people have access to them, also helps to resolve disputes peacefully. By ensuring non-
discrimination, equity, participation and effective access to remedies and by focusing on the 
root causes of poverty and underdevelopment, a rights-based approach would improve the 
sustainability and effectiveness of Japanese development cooperation. 
</p>
<p>66. Finally, by adopting a human rights-based approach, Japan would be aligning its 
development cooperation policies and programmes with its international human rights 
obligations and other relevant international policy statements on human rights and 
development, such as the 2007 OECD-DAC action-oriented policy paper on human rights 
and development.

<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>67. <b>Japan has a commendable international development cooperation programme. 
Despite the fiscal challenges it has faced in recent years as a consequence of the global 
economic crisis and the natural disasters it has suffered, it continues to accord 
importance to development cooperation. However, its development cooperation policy 
could be further enhanced through, inter alia, an explicit commitment to integrating a 
human rights-based approach into the formulation, implementation and monitoring 
of the programme.</b> 
</p>
<p>68. <b>In view of the above, the Independent Expert recommends that the 
Government of Japan should:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Put human rights at the core of its development cooperation programme 
by adopting a human rights-based approach. This would require, inter alia, making a 
more explicit commitment to incorporating human rights principles into the design, 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of its ODA policies and programmes, as 
well as the development of operational and implementation guidelines, related 
manuals and practical tools and human rights training for Japanese officials working 
in the area of development cooperation.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Enhance its financial support to civil society organizations involved in 
the promotion and protection of human rights, particularly economic, social and 
cultural rights, in the countries receiving Japanese development assistance. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Take measures to ensure that efforts aimed at promoting Japanese 
investments abroad are consistent with relevant international human rights 
standards, including the guiding principles on foreign debt and human rights, the 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and relevant international labour 
standards.  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Take measures to ensure more comprehensive regulation of Japanese 
foreign business activities in order to address issues such as tax evasion and other 
forms of capital flight which undermine the capacity of countries to mobilize sufficient 
domestic resources for their development. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Continue to support multilateral and bilateral debt relief initiatives and 
consider measures that can deliver an equitable and durable solution to the debt 
crisis. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Consider enacting legislation to limit the ability of vulture funds to use 
Japanese courts to recover extortionate amounts from poor countries. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Use its influence in international financial institutions, such as the World 
Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank, to ensure 
that the provision of loans or debt relief is not conditional on the implementation of 
onerous policies that may undermine the sustainability and ownership of the 
development efforts of recipient countries. This would be consistent with the principle 
of ownership underscored in Japanese ODA policies and the Accra Agenda for 
Action. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Strengthen the accountability mechanisms and safeguard policies of 
JICA, NEXI and JBIC by, inter alia, requiring comprehensive human rights impact 
assessments, in addition to environmental and social impact assessments, as well as the 
free, active and meaningful participation of affected individuals and communities. In 
particular, the safeguard policies should be clearly aligned with the Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/50/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Adopt a clear road map for achieving the United Nations ODA/GNI 
target of 0.7 per cent as the economic situation in Japan improves. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Work towards ensuring that the post-2015 development framework of 
the United Nations includes a robust framework to ensure accountability for the 
delivery of commitments.
