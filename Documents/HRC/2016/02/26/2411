<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the situation of human rights in Guinea</b>* 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 In resolution 19/30, the Human Rights Council invited the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to report at its twenty-second 
session on the situation of human rights in Guinea and OHCHR activities there. 
</p>
<p> The report describes changes in the human rights situation given the contextual and 
structural challenges identified in the previous report and describes the action taken by the 
Government on the High Commissioner&#8217;s recommendations and in fulfilment of the human 
rights obligations it has voluntarily assumed. 
</p>
<p> The human rights situation remains worrisome and is characterized by violations 
arising from structural problems such as impunity, on the one hand, and political tension, 
on the other. The legislative elections marking the end of the transition period did not take 
place owing to a lack of consensus. This delay has hindered the adoption of reforms needed 
to address the root causes of the violations. The main areas of concern are: political 
violence, especially the breaking up of public demonstrations; cases of bodily harm and 
acts of torture; and ongoing impunity, in particular for the security forces. Furthermore, the 
report finds that little progress has been made in implementing the Government&#8217;s priority 
actions, thereby impeding the re-establishment of the rule of law. The main issues are the 
delay in launching the national reconciliation process through national consultations, the 
slow pace of proceedings against perpetrators of serious human rights violations and the 
lack of progress on setting up an independent national human rights institution. 
</p>
<p> In 2012, the Government took measures to strengthen the institutional human rights 
framework, including the establishment of the Ministry of Human Rights and Public

<p> The Office of the High Commissioner in Guinea has continued to collaborate with

<p>GE.<footnote name="1">6. These interventions by the forces of law and order have been labelled as excessive 
use of force owing to their frequency, their scale and the methods used, in particular the use 
of lethal weapons to control public demonstrations. The disproportionate use of force, often 
not justified by the circumstances, has in some cases led to death or serious injury, 
including from gunfire. The student protest held in Kindia on 26 February following the 
death of one of their peers, for example, was violently put down by the gendarmerie and 
two people were injured by gunfire. On 10 May, a banned opposition protest in Conakry 
was violently broken up by security forces using live ammunition; according to medical 
sources at least 22 were wounded, including several by gunfire. At least six people were 
shot dead and several more injured in a clash between security forces and local people in 
Zoghota on 4 August. On 7 August in Siguiri, one person died of injuries from a lethal 
weapon, incurred during a protest against rising crime. On 21 September, one demonstrator 
was killed and two others seriously wounded when security forces opened fire on an 
opposition protest in the Ratoma district of Conakry.

unfettered exercise of the right to peaceful assembly during elections. Banned

</footnote>3-10258 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 19/30, 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights assesses the human rights 
situation in Guinea in 2012 and the actions taken by the Government to implement the 
recommendations of international human rights mechanisms, including those made at the 
universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council and the recommendations made in 
the previous report of the High Commissioner (A/HRC/19/49). In the report, she also 
reviews the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) in Guinea and 
makes a number of recommendations for the Government and the international community. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Main political, economic and social developments affecting 
human rights 
</b></p>
<p>2. In 2012, the social and political situation in Guinea was characterized by ongoing 
dissent within the political class and growing social unrest. This social and political 
instability undermined the Government&#8217;s efforts to improve the human rights situation and 
hindered the roll out of scheduled institutional reforms. 
</p>
<p>3. The political transition phase that began with the death of President Lansana Conte 
on 22 December 2008 should have ended in 2010 with presidential and legislative elections 
to re-establish the rule of law. While presidential elections were held in 2010, legislative 
elections have been held up by persisting conflicts between the various political groups. 
The main points of contention relate to the electoral process, and more specifically the 
institutional framework and technical conditions for organizing elections. Advances such as 
the rebalancing of the Independent National Electoral Commission in September 2012 and 
the formulation of the Commission&#8217;s strategic operational plan on 17 November 2012 give 
cause for hope that legislative elections may be held without delay in 2013. 
</p>
<p>4. As in 2011, demonstrations by the opposition to express their disagreement with 
how elections are organized continued until September 2012. The Government&#8217;s 
announcement in February, confirmed by the Independent National Electoral Commission 
in March, that elections would be held in July sparked a series of opposition marches and 
general strikes. On 24 and 31 March 2012, militants of the coalition parties belonging to the 
Alliance pour la d&#233;mocratie et le progress (ADP) and the Collectif des partis politiques 
pour la finalisation de la transition (the Collectif) demonstrated to demand greater electoral 
transparency. The protest movement grew fiercer with the organization on 10 May 2012 of 
a protest march in Conakry to demand a more open political dialogue; several people were 
injured when security forces broke up the crowd. This march was followed by general 
strikes on 11 and 14 May 2012 during which violent clashes broke out between youths who 
had erected barricades, and security forces, resulting in at least 28 arrests and a number of 
injured. 
5. On 17 August 2012, as part of an attempt at mediation, the State institutions1 
submitted three proposals for the restructuring of the institutional framework for elections 
to the President, who opted for a partial reconstitution of the Independent National 
Electoral Commission. In response, the opposition coalitions, ADP and the Collectif, 
organized a protest march in Conakry on 27 August, despite the ban by the authorities, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 The State institutions consist of the National Transition Council (legislative body), the Economic and 
</p>
<p>Social Council and the National Communications Council. </p>


<p>GE.<footnote name="1">2. Guinean law permits peaceful public gatherings on prior notification of municipal 
authorities. They can be banned only for reasons of public order and security owing to their 
effects on the enjoyment of other fundamental freedoms, especially during elections. 
13. On 31 May 2012, by a decision of the Minister of Territorial Administration and 
Decentralization, the Government prohibited marches of a political nature until further 
notice. The decision, although justifiable given the possibility of unrest arising from the 
opposition party marches, in fact amounted to a breach of the right to peaceful assembly as 
it was general, non-specific and not time-bound. The prohibition was lifted on 12 
September following talks between the Government and the various parties, in response to 
the President&#8217;s plea to observe freedoms during protests, and the right to demonstrate. 
</footnote>3-10258 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>claiming that the President&#8217;s solution did not guarantee them equal representation in the 
Commission. 
</p>
<p>6. As a result of the ban on the march of 27 August, the opposition coalitions 
suspended the political dialogue by announcing the resignation of their representatives in 
the transition entities and the Government on 28 August 2012. However, early signs of 
compromise began to appear among the political class in September. Progress was made, 
thanks to the parties involved and the support of various international actors,2 by way of 
legislative reform and the reorganization of the Electoral Commission to ensure more equal 
representation of the political groups. The reconstituted National Electoral Commission was 
established on 29 October 2012 and began work on a strategic operational plan. There are 
still differences of opinion, however, especially regarding the choice of contractor to revise 
the electoral register and the vote of Guineans living abroad. 
</p>
<p>7. In addition to the political tensions, the situation in Guinea was characterized by 
social unrest. The main demands were for better living conditions and improvements to an 
environment damaged by mining operations. The Government has adopted measures to 
combat economic crimes and improve economic governance. As a result, inflation has 
fallen and the national currency has stabilized, enabling the country to reach completion 
point in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Heavily Indebted Poor 
Countries Initiative (HIPC), with two thirds of the country&#8217;s multilateral debt or US$ 2.<footnote name="1">1. Despite greater freedom to engage in political and trade union activities and join 
associations, restrictions on the right of peaceful assembly are a cause for concern. The 
tense political situation led to a resurgence of demonstrations which were at times put down 
by security forces. 
</footnote> 
billion forgiven on 26 September 2012. Moreover, the Paris Club of Industrial Country 
Creditors forgave 99.2 per cent of Guinea&#8217;s debt, or US$ 655.9 million, on 25 October 
2012. Nevertheless, these economic measures have had a limited impact on the 
population&#8217;s enjoyment of economic and social rights. To that extent, progress on the 
Millennium Development Goals remains insufficient, particularly in terms of reducing 
extreme poverty, fighting unemployment and providing access to education and basic social 
services.  
</p>
<p>8. All this led to demonstrations in Guin&#233;e Foresti&#232;re to demand employment for 
locals, denounce deteriorating living conditions and call for environmental protection, 
especially in mining areas. Other sporadic actions occurred in other cities, such as Fria, 
over the closure of the alumina plant, and in some neighbourhoods of Conakry in January 
and August to protest the inadequate electricity supply. The Government agreed to use the 
additional resources freed up by debt forgiveness to finance the priority goals contained in 
the poverty reduction strategy, such as guaranteeing the right to health and education and 
improving basic infrastructure. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Situation of human rights 
</b>9. Some noteworthy progress was made in 2012 regarding the observance of certain 
civil and political liberties, including freedom of opinion, expression and association. 
Furthermore, security sector reform has made law enforcement more professional. 
However, challenges of an institutional, legal and structural nature remain: the fight against 
impunity, the administration of justice and the protection of economic, social and cultural 
rights.  
</p>
<p>10. The Government&#8217;s policy on impunity has had limited impact on the re-
establishment of the rule of law whether in terms of prosecuting offences committed by

<p>security forces or of reacting to serious human rights violations, including those committed 
on 28 September 2009. In addition, excessive use of force and the large number of arbitrary 
arrests during public demonstrations remain a major concern. Regarding economic and 
social rights, Government efforts to fight financial crime and foster good economic 
governance have had little effect on the population&#8217;s standard of living in terms of access to 
basic social services and essential products, such as water, electricity and food. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to peaceful assembly, freedom of association, and excessive use of 
force by security forces 
</b></p>

<p>GE.13-10258 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>the need to further strengthen the capacity of the security forces in that connection remains. 
Excessive use of force during demonstrations continues, despite measures taken to put 
regulations in place and reduce the number of officers carrying lethal weapons while 
controlling public demonstrations. In addition to technical capacity, these shortcomings are 
also due to the inadequacy of logistical resources. For example, investigations into the 
incidents in Siguiri3 revealed that the departmental gendarmerie did not have the human or 
logistical resources to ensure the safety of a population of over 200,000. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Unlawful and arbitrary arrests, torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p>18. Arbitrary arrests and detentions remain a major concern. At least 200 arrests by 
security forces were recorded during the demonstrations that punctuated 2012. The 
circumstances of some of the arrests, their scale and the indiscriminateness with which 
some were carried out amount to unlawful or arbitrary arrest. For example, the political 
rallies of 10 May and 27 August 2012 gave rise to at least 140 arrests and convictions. 
Some of those arrested stated that they had not taken part in the rallies, while others 
claimed to have been arrested in private homes. On 29 June 2012, following a general strike 
called by opposition leaders, 12 retailers were arrested and held in police custody by the 
Gueck&#233;dou gendarmerie for having shut their shops. They had to pay the equivalent of US$ 
8 for their release and to have their shops unsealed. 
</p>
<p>19. In addition, OHCHR found that the practice of arbitrary arrest was on the rise for 
certain types of offences;4 people may be &#8220;remanded&#8221;, as it is called, following an 
extrajudicial arrest made without a warrant or charge by some senior member of the 
gendarmerie, and detained in police cells for upwards of five months. 
</p>
<p>20. Arbitrary arrests are often compounded by physical abuse, beatings and torture, 
which continue unabated and are sometimes inflicted in the course of arrest or during police 
custody. The main incidents recorded are beatings with rifle butts, clubs or batons and 
sexual violence, in police custody, including against minors. On 15 February, a person who 
had been arrested and held incommunicado at No. 2 platoon of the Hamdallaye 
gendarmerie in Conakry was found dead. Marks found on his body would indicate that he 
suffered beatings and torture. Other cases of ill-treatment at the gendarmeries in 
Hamdallaye and Kindia have been reported. 
</p>
<p>21. Impunity persists in cases of bodily harm despite Government efforts, as 
demonstrated by the low number of proceedings against alleged perpetrators of such acts. 
The reasons are legislative and institutional. For example, although Guinea is a party to the 
Convention against Torture, the Convention has yet to be incorporated into national law 
and a law criminalizing torture is still being drafted. Moreover, the lack of a torture 
prevention mechanism, combined with the drawn-out nature of judicial procedures, 
constitutes a barrier to the protection of victims. Establishing an independent national 
human rights institution and ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture would help ensure more effective protection.

 People&#8217;s protest of 7 August in response to rising crime. The menacing crowd was eventually broken 
</p>
<p>up by military personnel who came as backup from Kour&#233;mal&#233;. 
 
</p>

<p><b>8</b> GE.13-10258 
</p>
<p><b> C. Administration of justice and detention conditions 
</b>22. The administration of justice faces many challenges in terms of compliance with the 
State&#8217;s national and international human rights obligations &#8211; for example, the independence 
and effectiveness of the judiciary, access to justice and improvements to the physical and 
legal conditions of detention. In her previous reports, the High Commissioner 
recommended speeding up the judicial reform launched in 2011. In that connection, the 
Government has taken measures to reorganize judicial districting, by recruiting 50 trainee 
judges, strengthen the criminal justice system, tighten prosecutorial oversight of the police, 
by training 729 investigative police officers, and build capacity among justice officials 
regarding human rights, with the support of OHCHR. In addition, the Government intends 
to give priority to the judicial aspect of the reform of the security sector, especially as 
regards strengthening the independence of the judiciary, by revising the Act on the 
Supreme Council of Justice and applying the regulations governing the judiciary. 
23. Nevertheless, the shortage of courts, the uneven distribution of justice officials and 
the lack of financial resources hamper public access to justice. Some are discouraged by the 
distance to court: there are only two appellate courts countrywide. Others blame the 
financial cost, which is prohibitive as there is no budget for legal aid. These barriers, in 
combination with the uneven distribution of lawyers, perpetuate the public&#8217;s lack of 
confidence in the justice system to solve their legal problems. 
24. The length of pretrial detention and physical detention conditions are also a cause 
for concern. In 2012, an average of 65 per cent of the inmates of Nz&#233;r&#233;kor&#233; prison were in 
pretrial detention, and 75 per cent in Conakry. Moreover, the lengthy nature of judicial 
proceedings creates situations of arbitrary detention insofar as statutory time limits, set at 
four months for minor offences and six months for serious offences, are not observed. 
OHCHR also came across instances of unlawful detention of people who have served their 
sentence, or as a means of making someone pay a fine, although efforts have been made in 
practice to ensure that the legal limits on custody in police and gendarmerie cells are 
observed. In 2012, OHCHR observed that suspects are no longer held in police custody for 
several months before being brought before a judge. This is the result of regular visits by 
OHCHR to places of detention and its training programmes for investigative police officers 
and judges responsible for compliance with limits on police custody. 
25. Physical detention conditions need to be improved to meet the Standard Minimum 
Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. For example, inadequate infrastructure in certain 
places of detention, such as Yomou prison in Guin&#233;e Foresti&#232;re and some gendarmerie and 
police cells, means that men are not separated from women or minors from adults. As a 
result, some places of detention are at 200 per cent of real capacity. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Combating impunity  
</b></p>

<p>GE.13-10258 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>commission of inquiry having found reasonable grounds for the presumption of individual 
criminal responsibility. On 13 September 2012, the judges indicted Colonel Abdoulaye 
Ch&#233;rif Diaby, Minister of Health at the time of the events, whose possible direct criminal 
responsibility was mentioned in the report of the international commission of inquiry. 
</p>
<p>28. Thus, six individuals have been indicted in relation to this case since 2010; in 
addition, a request for judicial assistance has been issued for a hearing of Captain Moussa 
Dadis Camara (president of Guinea at the time of the events) and an international arrest 
warrant issued for Lieutenant Aboubacar Sidiki Diakite (aide-de-camp and head of the 
presidential guard at the time of the events). The judges also continued to hear statements 
from victims, some 250 people since the start of the proceedings. 
</p>
<p>29. However, the investigations launched in 2010 have been relatively slow. The courts 
have faced various challenges in the form of a lack of financial, logistical and even security 
resources, difficulties in making proper investigations and the need to provide a response to 
victims within a reasonable period. 
</p>
<p>30. Since 1 December 2012, the courts have had the services of an expert legal 
consultant to advise them primarily on the protection of victims and witnesses, the 
establishment of appropriate relations with civil society, judicial cooperation and the 
preparation of a communication strategy. The expert was brought in thanks to technical 
assistance from the Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict,5 
and works in cooperation with OHCHR. Moreover, the prosecutor of the International 
Criminal Court made his third visit to Guinea in April 2012. The Court stated that, although 
the national investigation into the human rights violations committed on 28 September 
2009 had produced some results, it needed to be completed. Accordingly, the preliminary 
examination of Guinea begun by the Court on 14 October 2009 remains open and Guinea 
continues to monitor the progress of investigations. 
</p>
<p>31. In addition to these investigations, on 29 May 2012, the Conakry prosecuting 
authority filed two applications to investigate human rights violations committed in 2007 
and 2010,6 after two actions for damages were brought by 65 victims, the Guinean 
Organization for Human Rights and the International Federation for Human Rights. These 
applications should shed light on the events, establish responsibility and provide reparation 
to victims. 
</p>
<p>32. The slowness of decision-making in these cases underscores the difficulties the 
justice system faces in combating impunity, especially with respect to human rights 
violations committed by members of the security forces in the course of their duties. 
Although a few judicial investigations have been launched,7 impunity persists, not only 
owing to a dysfunctional justice system but also because some members of the security 
forces are refusing to obey a summons by the investigating judge.8 Accordingly, OHCHR 
continues its technical cooperation programme and recommends that the high command of

<p>the gendarmerie and the judicial authorities take measures to correct the situation and 
guarantee reparation to victims. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Transitional justice and national reconciliation process 
</b>33. In the light of the violence marring the history of Guinea, the international 
commission of inquiry had recommended a truth process to help move reconciliation 
forward. President Alpha Cond&#233; made that process a pivotal part of his term of office and 
accordingly, in June 2011, established the Provisional Commission on National 
Reconciliation with, as joint chairs, the imam of the Fay&#231;al Grand Mosque in Conakry and 
the Archbishop of Conakry, and with a mandate to stimulate discussion of reconciliation 
and propose ways of achieving it. 
</p>
<p>34. Reconciliation is largely dependent on the situation in the country. In 2012 this was 
characterized by political and social circumstances whose main effect was to slow the 
national reconciliation process. On the political level, the commitment of State actors was 
tepid mainly because of the failure to grant the logistical and financial means for the 
Provisional Commission to operate. On the social level, the persistence of inter-community 
tensions and the complexity of the episodes of violence in Guinean history mean that an 
enormous amount of sensitization is needed before the country as a whole can take 
ownership of the reconciliation process. 
</p>
<p>35. Accordingly, the Provisional Commission did some groundwork in preparation for 
the national consultations, helped in part by an international expert seconded from the 
United Nations and paid for by the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund. Preparations 
included: (a) holding prayer and forgiveness meetings; (b) consulting with the political 
parties; (c) holding an information exchange with technical and financial partners; and (d) 
drafting a national consultation plan. 
</p>
<p>36. OHCHR continued to rally national and international actors round the national 
reconciliation process. Throughout the year, it provided technical and financial support to 
the Provisional Commission &#8212; in the form of advice, information and training sessions and 
missions abroad to share the experience of other countries that have gone through similar 
processes &#8212; in order to strengthen the Provisional Commission&#8217;s ability to conduct 
participatory and inclusive national consultations. It also continued its capacity-building 
work among relevant actors to ensure greater understanding of the principles and 
challenges of national reconciliation and transitional justice and to bring the highest 
authorities and non-State actors into a participatory process. Thus two national seminars 
were held in June and November 2012 involving key State and non-State actors, the 
Commission&#8217;s co-chairs and their support team. Moreover, decision makers were 
continually urged to provide effective support to the national actors and keep all parties 
focused on national reconciliation.

<p><b> F. Integration of human rights into security sector reform 
</b></p>
<p>39. Guinea has undertaken institutional, legal and regulatory reforms to strengthen the 
legal framework ensuring that defence and security forces uphold human rights. The 
purpose of these measures is to remedy deficiencies in security sector institutions, in 
particular by improving discipline and professionalism, increasing respect for the rule of 
law and the criminal justice system and placing the sector under judicial authority. 
40. Accordingly, human rights considerations have been incorporated into the 
regulations and laws governing the defence and security forces, namely, the code of 
conduct of the defence forces, the Armed Forces regulations, the Code of Military Justice 
and the national strategy for the security sector. The inclusion of human rights results in 
part from the training programmes set up by OHCHR &#8212; human rights modules were 
introduced in the curricula of police and gendarmerie academies and military training 
centres, for example &#8212; education centres, and in part from its technical advice input to the 
drafting of legal documents.  
</p>
<p>41. OHCHR also carried out capacity-building activities for officials responsible for 
enforcing human rights laws. For example, as part of its support for security sector reform, 
and notably the strengthening of the criminal justice system, it ran training programmes for 
at least 200 investigative police officers in Conakry, Kankan, Kindia, Lab&#233; and Nz&#233;r&#233;kor&#233;. 
</p>
<p>42. Observer missions have been one of the primary means of educating security forces 
about human rights. Through its offices in Conakry and Nz&#233;r&#233;kor&#233;, OHCHR deployed its 
teams countrywide and in 2012, was thus able to carry out several dozen missions across 
the country, either routine monitoring missions or investigations, when warranted by 
violations, such as in Beyla, Boffa, Boke, Dubreka, Gu&#233;ck&#233;dou, Kamsar, Kankan, Kindia, 
Kissoudougou, Faranah, Labe, Siguiri and Zoghota. Moreover, OHCHR has been visible in 
places where there was a high risk of violations, especially at demonstrations, and in 
regular visits to places of detention, and also at high-profile trials, such as the one following 
the attack on the presidential residence. After every such observer mission or investigation, 
OHCHR prepared a confidential report containing recommendations for the authorities, to 
encourage them to take corrective measures and put an end to violations. 
</p>
<p>43. Efforts are still needed at the institutional level regarding cooperation with the 
justice system and public relations. In that connection, the launch on 5 December 2012 of 
the programme on democratic and civil oversight of the defence and security forces in 
Guinea is a promising start. Its goal is to increase transparency and good governance in the 
defence and security forces by building oversight capacity, establishing communication 
mechanisms and drafting and disseminating legal texts. 
</p>
<p>44. The comments made above regarding the impunity of the security forces, especially 
in relation to the events of 28 September 2009, will be taken into consideration in the 
implementation of the human rights due diligence policy on United Nations support to non-
United Nations security forces9 in conjunction with other types of support provided to the 
national security forces by the United Nations system, including assistance financed by the 
United Nations Peacebuilding Fund. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9
 This policy stipulates that the United Nations cannot provide support to national security forces when 
</p>
<p>there is a real risk that beneficiaries might commit serious violations of international humanitarian 
law, international human rights law or international refugee law or when the relevant authorities are 
not taking the necessary measures to correct or mitigate the risk.  </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.13-10258 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Cooperation on promoting and protecting human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Role of civil society in promoting the defence of human rights  
</b></p>
<p>45. In her previous report, the High Commissioner encouraged the Government to 
establish close cooperation with civil society organizations. In follow-up to that 
recommendation, the Government made room for civil society to express its views and do 
its work. Structures have gradually been put in place and an active network of associations 
for the promotion and defence of human rights has taken shape. One result has been the 
broad social mobilization for the national reconciliation process, achieved through 
information meetings and by recording the population&#8217;s expectations for transitional justice 
in Guinea. Civil society was also prominent in the provision of psychological and medical 
support to victims of the events of 28 September 2009,10 while other civil society 
organizations sued for damages in the criminal proceedings relating to the events of 2007, 
2009 and 2010,11 as part of efforts to combat impunity and obtain reparation for victims. 
</p>
<p>46. Civil society actors are also involved in building the legal framework for the 
protection of human rights in Guinea, drafting, for example, a law on an independent 
national human rights institution and a bill criminalizing torture. It should be noted that 
human rights defenders were able to carry out their activities in 2012 without being 
intimidated or threatened. 
</p>
<p>47. OHCHR played a significant role in driving and developing the capacity of civil 
society. It held four training sessions on techniques of human rights research and report-
writing in the various administrative regions. It also lends technical support to a civil 
society training programme on transitional justice, designed by Open Societies for West 
Africa, an NGO.12 Regarding education and human rights awareness, OHCHR worked in 
cooperation with the Government to organize events for the International Day in Support of 
Victims of Torture and Human Rights Day. It also helped set up at least seven human rights 
clubs in schools in Conakry and Nz&#233;r&#233;kor&#233;. On 28 May 2012, OHCHR opened a 
multimedia documentation centre at its Nz&#233;r&#233;kor&#233; office. The centre has documentation on 
human rights and gives free access to online resources for academia, civil society and 
students at all levels. 
</p>
<p>48. The challenges human rights defence organizations continue to face include: (a) 
ongoing political and ethnic divides, which limit the multiplier effect of their work; (b) the 
need to improve methods of cooperation with human rights protection mechanisms; and (c) 
the need to strengthen dialogue with State bodies. In that connection, the Government, as 
represented by the Ministry of Justice, undertook to increase their protective capacity by 
holding a forum with the intention of setting up a joint committee to monitor and report 
cases of human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Cooperation with international human rights mechanisms  
</b></p>
<p>49. During the universal periodic review, Guinea accepted the recommendation to 
improve further its cooperation with international human rights mechanisms. The

<p>Government was urged to set, in cooperation with OHCHR, a timeline for submitting 
overdue initial and periodic reports to the treaty bodies and to cooperate with Human 
Rights Council special procedures mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>50. Despite Government initiatives taken in 2011, the backlog persists and as of 31 
December 2012 15 reports, 5 initial and 10 periodic, remain overdue. However, a draft 
decree to establish an interministerial committee responsible for preparing and submitting 
State party reports to the treaty bodies is awaiting adoption and promulgation. In addition, a 
national action plan for the implementation of the recommendations of the universal 
periodic review was completed in August 2012, with the support of OHCHR. The plan&#8217;s 
priority actions include aligning national legislation with international texts, submitting 
reports to the treaty bodies and establishing an independent national human rights 
institution. 
</p>
<p>51. Regarding cooperation with the special procedures, the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence is awaiting a reply 
from the Government to the visit request made on 24 July 2012. OHCHR will continue to 
lobby for the visit and support the Government in meaningfully improving its cooperation 
with the international human rights protection mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>52. <b>Despite the measures taken by the Government regarding human rights, the re-
establishment of the rule of law and the strengthening of national cohesion continue to 
face hurdles &#8211; the main challenge being the holding of the legislative elections that are 
required in order to complete the transition. The political impasse has made it 
impossible to speed up the reforms planned for the security and justice sectors and 
has hampered the holding of the national consultations that are meant to set in motion 
the national reconciliation process. Moreover, the situation has also made it 
impossible to act on most of the recommendations contained in the previous report. 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>Accordingly, the High Commissioner reiterates her recommendations and calls 
on the international community to increase its support to the Government of the 
Republic of Guinea.</b>
