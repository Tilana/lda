<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 25 March 2011, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 16/21 on the 
review of the work and functioning of the Council, in which it adopted the outcome 
document of the review process in Geneva, as annexed to the resolution. In paragraphs 54 
and 55 of the outcome document, it was decided that, in line with the procedural and 
organizational roles of the President, the Office of the President of the Council should be 
established, within existing resources, in order to support the President in the fulfilment of 
his or her tasks and enhance efficiency, continuity and institutional memory in this regard. 
It was also stated that the Office of the President should be provided with adequate 
resources drawn from the regular budget, including staff, office space and necessary 
equipment required for the fulfilment of their tasks. The appointment of the staff of the 
Office should promote equitable geographic distribution and gender balance, and that staff 
should be accountable to the President. According to paragraph 56, the composition, 
modalities and financial implications of the Office of the President should be considered by 
the Council on the basis of the report of the secretariat, at its seventeenth session. The 
present report is submitted pursuant to that request and is intended to provide the Council 
with information relevant to its consideration of this matter. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Existing arrangements 
</b></p>
<p>2. Since the inception of the Human Rights Council, the elected President has been 
supported by the staff of his own mission, in addition to a few staff members provided by 
individual Governments on loan arrangements and/or financed by a foundation or a 
regional organization. With a few exceptions, Presidents have not been entrusted with the 
selection of junior officers. Office space has been allocated on an ad hoc basis by the 
United Nations Office at Geneva, and other material support has been provided by the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Given the 
ad hoc nature of these arrangements, there was no predictability of the number of staff 
members seconded to support the President, their experience or level. Accordingly, the 
working arrangements and modalities varied from one President to another. Successive 
Presidents have, however, promoted the idea of establishing an Office of the President, 
funded by the regular budget of the Organization, which would provide support to his/her 
activities as President.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Legislative mandates  
</b></p>
<p>3. At its ninth session, the Human Rights Council adopted decision 9/103 on 
strengthening the Council, in which it recommended that the General Assembly should 
ensure the establishment of an office of the President of the Council, with adequate staffing 
resources, including the provision of necessary equipment. In its decision, the Council also 
requested the United Nations Office at Geneva to ensure that the facilities for the President 
are in the immediate vicinity of the conference room used by the Council. The General 
Assembly took note of the annual report of the Council (A/HRC/63/53 and Add.1) and 
acknowledged the recommendations contained therein. In the absence of a specific decision 
by the Assembly to endorse the recommendations contained in decision 9/103, no further 
action was taken during the sixty-third session to consider the financial implications of 
establishing an office of the President of the Council. </p>


<p>4. In December 2010, the General Assembly adopted resolution 64/144 entitled &#8220;Office 
of the President of the Human Rights Council&#8221;. Recalling Council decision 9/103 and 
underlining the crucial importance of appropriate resources to support the work of the 
Council and its numerous mechanisms, bearing in mind that the Council met regularly 
throughout the year in no fewer than three sessions per year for a total duration of no less 
than 10 weeks, the Assembly acknowledged the recommendation of the Council to 
establish an office of the President and requested the Council to address the question of the 
establishment and the modalities of an office in the context of the review of its work and 
functioning five years after its establishment, in accordance with Assembly resolution 
60/251. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Review of the work and functioning of the Human Rights 
Council 
</b></p>
<p>5. During the process of the above-mentioned review in 2010 and 2011 through the 
intergovernmental open-ended working group established by the Human Rights Council, a 
group of States proposed that urgent measures should be taken towards the establishment of 
an office of the President of the Council. One Member State also proposed that the existing 
office of the President be institutionalized and reinforced on the example of the President of 
the General Assembly, to enable the Council President to have the necessary support to 
perform his or her mandate. A few Member States also proposed specific positions to be 
created within the office of the President, such as a legal adviser and a public 
relations/communications adviser.  
</p>
<p>6. Views in favour of the establishment of an office of the President highlighted the 
need to preserve the institutional memory and to enhance the continuity between 
presidencies rotating every Human Rights Council year, and to ensure a predictable and 
reliable support structure. In this context, a concern was noted that each of the past 
Presidents had been dependent upon variable support from his permanent mission, if 
available, and the staff provided by other Member States or regional organizations, 
whereby Presidents had no say in the selection of the staff concerned. The ad hoc 
arrangements were thus insufficient and did not guarantee stable, professional and quality 
support to Council Presidents. These shortcomings, combined with the heavy nature of 
assignments entrusted to the President, have made it difficult for a country not supported by 
a large permanent mission in Geneva to present its candidacy for the presidency. 
</p>
<p>7. Different views were expressed by several other Member States. It was noted that it 
was necessary to clarify the objectives of the establishment of an office of the President and 
to avoid overlap with the current functions performed by the secretariat. A view was 
expressed that the institutional memory function was satisfactorily carried out by the 
secretariat. Reference was also made to a potential contradiction between the objective to 
ensure institutional memory and the selection of staff on a yearly basis. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. President of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>8. A discussion on an office of the President of the Human Rights Council, including 
its structure, staff composition and budget, would benefit from a brief description of the 
main functions and activities of the President, based upon the experience gained over recent 
years. The Council was established as a quasi-standing organ that performs its activities 
throughout the year, with the activities of the Council President being a full-time function. 
In chairing meetings of the Council throughout the year, including its regular and special 
sessions, organizational meetings, informal consultations and the Working Group on the </p>


<p>Universal Periodic Review, the President directs discussions and ensures observance of the 
rules and procedures. In addition, the President is often called upon to make use of his 
authority and impartiality to facilitate consultations on any politically sensitive issues 
arising during Council sessions or inter-sessional periods. The President carries out specific 
mandates envisaged in the institution-building package , such as the consideration of 
recommendations made by the consultative group on the selection of special procedures 
mandate holders and related consultations. Pursuant to specific Council resolutions, the 
President is also increasingly requested to appoint members of fact-finding missions and 
commissions of inquiry following consultations with relevant groups and States. The 
President holds regular meetings with non-governmental organizations, holds press 
conferences and responds to requests for interviews from the media. The President receives 
a number of letters from permanent representatives, regional or other groups of States, 
national human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations and academic 
institutions on a variety of issues relating to the work of the Council, most of which require 
considered responses. The President travels to Headquarters to present the annual report of 
the Council to the General Assembly and hold consultations on issues relevant to the work 
of the Council. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Office of the President of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>9. To date, all Presidents have been supported by the staff of their own Governments 
serving as special assistant and the main focal point for interactions with the Human Rights 
Council secretariat. The tasks of the special assistants have typically included providing 
policy and political advice on all issues relating to the functions of the President during the 
sessions and beyond; drafting or clearing draft statements and other documents to be 
presented by the President to the Council; assisting in convening meetings of the Council 
Bureau, preparing talking points for the President and drafting minutes; and finalizing draft 
correspondence for the President.  
</p>
<p>10. The Presidents have also been supported by a few additional staff members provided 
by other individual Governments on the basis of a loan arrangement and/or financed by a 
foundation or a regional organization. Their tasks include organizing, under the supervision 
of the President&#8217;s special assistant, the agenda of the President; setting up and preparing for 
bilateral meetings of the President; and drafting standard letters of reply from the President 
to incoming correspondence. They undertake other ad hoc tasks requested by the President, 
and respond to other queries on the work of the President in general.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Secretariat of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>11. The secretariat of the Human Rights Council is a small team located within the 
Human Rights Council Branch of OHCHR. As such, it is institutionally separate from the 
Council and its President and, as an organizational unit of OHCHR, operates under the 
authority of the High Commissioner and the Secretary-General. Throughout the year, the 
Council secretariat, inter alia<i>,</i> provides substantive support for the organization, servicing 
and follow-up to meetings of the Council and its subsidiary bodies. In the implementation 
of these tasks, the secretariat undertakes consultations with other parts of OHCHR, the 
United Nations Office at Geneva, which provides conference servicing support for the 
meetings of the Council, and other Departments at Headquarters, as needed. 
</p>
<p>12. Within the framework of the above-mentioned support for the Council, the Council 
secretariat provides the President with substantive and parliamentary advice and support in 
relation to formal and informal meetings of the Council; for instance, the secretariat 
prepares speaking points for the President in chairing meetings and provides advice on the </p>


<p>conduct of those meetings. At the request of the President, it also provides information 
relevant to the agenda items of meetings of the Bureau. The support provided by the 
secretariat does not, however, extend to the President&#8217;s activities outside the meetings of 
the Council, such as his or her bilateral meetings and informal consultations, or to personal 
and logistic assistance functions.  
</p>
<p>13. With the establishment of the Human Rights Council and the adoption of the 
institution-building package, a few Professional posts for the Council secretariat were 
approved by the General Assembly in anticipation of an increased workload resulting from 
the number of meetings of the Council as compared with the Commission on Human 
Rights; the actual workload and new demands over the past few years, however, have 
outstripped the existing capacity of the Council secretariat. Consequently, for each session, 
the Council secretariat is forced to take ad hoc measures to fill capacity gaps, including 
through the full involvement of interns in certain conference-servicing and administrative 
tasks.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Office of the President of the General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>14. In the United Nations system, the General Assembly is the only intergovernmental 
organ originating from the Charter of the United Nations whose President is supported by a 
formal office structure. Despite the considerable differences between the Assembly and the 
Human Rights Council as its subsidiary organ in all aspects of their work and mandates, it 
may be worthwhile reviewing the role, functions and composition of the Office of the 
President of the General Assembly, as well as related financial arrangements.  
</p>
<p>15. The President of the General Assembly oversees, manages and guides the ongoing 
work of the Assembly throughout the year of the rotating presidency. In addition to 
presiding over meetings, the President plays a critical role in organizing and facilitating 
informal consultations on major high-level plenary meetings, their follow-up and thematic 
debates and in coordinating the work among the Main Committees and the principal organs, 
including the Security Council. The President also has official, ceremonial and protocol 
functions to perform, including representing the body to the outside world. She or he 
receives an average of 60 official visits per month and is invited to attend, preside over and 
participate in international conferences, summits, forums and regional and subregional 
meetings. The President also visits many countries in different regions.  
</p>
<p>16. As the workload of the General Assembly has evolved, the role of the Office has 
also changed over time to become more substantive and expert in nature. The Office 
provides substantive backstopping support to the work of the President mentioned above 
and also to the facilitators appointed to support informal consultations on a wide range of 
issues. A group of experts in the Office provides informed analysis and expert advice. The 
Office undertakes daily coordinating functions, including liaising with Member States, 
committee chairpersons and co-chairs and facilitators of various processes, as well as with 
the Executive Office of the Secretary-General, the departments and offices of the 
Secretariat and the funds, programmes and agencies of the United Nations system. The 
Office also interacts with civil society, non-governmental organizations and the media.  
</p>
<p>17. The day-to-day administrative work of the Office of the President is supported by 
the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management, which provides 
meeting planning, conference management and servicing, as well as translation and 
interpretation functions. As part of the Department, the General Assembly and Economic 
and Social Council Affairs Division provides technical assistance and administrative and 
procedural advice on the orderly and effective conduct of the deliberations and follow-up 
actions of the Assembly, among other issues. The Division also supports the President and </p>


<p>his or her Office by preparing the President's notes for each meeting, drafting the 
Assembly&#8217;s agenda and processing draft resolutions, and by providing support during 
meetings, including advice on the application of the relevant rules of procedure.  
</p>
<p>18. In terms of resources provided to the Office of the President of the General 
Assembly, four regular budget posts, including one D-2 (Chef de Cabinet), one D-2 
(Deputy Chef de Cabinet), one D-1 (Adviser), one P-5 (Adviser) as well as one General 
Service staff member, are provided from within the regular budget on an annual basis. 
Additional support comes from staff members seconded by Member States. Recent 
Presidents have also appointed a number of senior advisers on specific issues. 
</p>
<p>19. The President&#8217;s security is ensured by a detail of two security officers on a routine 
basis provided by the Department of Security and Safety. In its resolution 65/107, the 
General Assembly requested the Department of Public Information to continue to enhance 
its working relationship with the Office of the President, while in resolution 60/286 and 
subsequent resolutions it encouraged the Secretary-General to continue the practice of 
providing a spokesperson for the President and an assistant to the spokesperson.  
</p>
<p>20. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 52/221, a budget of approximately 
$290,000 is allocated annually to the Office of the President to cover expenses relating to 
travel, hospitality and incidentals required for him or her to undertake official 
responsibilities. In resolution 59/313 and subsequent resolutions on the revitalization of the 
work of the General Assembly, the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to make 
available to the President adequate office and conference space, as well as proper protocol 
services, with a view to enabling the President to carry out his or her functions in a manner 
commensurate with the dignity and stature of the Office.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Composition of staff of the office of the President of the 
Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Consolidation of current ad hoc arrangements  
</b></p>
<p>21. Since the inception of the Human Rights Council, the Presidents of the Council have 
been supported by a staff member of his permanent mission serving as a special 
assistant/adviser to the President, as well as a few professional officers provided or 
financed by Member States on an ad hoc basis (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above). On the 
basis of the long-standing requests from past Presidents and the past practice, it would be 
considered appropriate to ensure that these functions are performed through consistent and 
institutionalized rather than ad hoc arrangements. The following positions currently funded 
in an ad hoc manner outside the secretariat could henceforth be funded through regular 
budget resources: 
</p>
<p> (a) A special assistant/adviser, to serve as the focal point for the overall support 
to the President and direct the work of the Office, in particular on all policy issues. For 
instance, she or he will assist in convening meetings of the Bureau, in consultation with the 
Council secretariat, draft or review draft statements for the President, assist the President in 
all his or her political consultations and organize the daily activities of the President;  
</p>
<p> (b) A liaison and administrative officer, responsible for the organization and 
preparation of minutes of various meetings of the President, including bilateral meetings, 
handling of correspondence and queries, as well as for all administrative matters relating to 
the President and the Office.  </p>


<p><b> B. Possible new functions to be performed by the office of the President 
and formerly performed by the secretariat 
</b></p>
<p>22. Apart from these existing functions, it should be emphasized that the President 
needs to be supported by a public information officer/speech writer. It should be recalled 
that, in December 2007, the General Assembly approved a post at the P-3 level for a 
Human Rights Officer to respond to an increasing number of media requests for 
information on the work of the Human Rights Council and interviews with the President 
and other members of the Council. Such media interest has continued to increase, requiring 
the position to be a full-time Public Information Officer undertaking critical public 
information functions, which include producing public information material about Council 
meetings in liaison and coordination with the Department of Public Information, the 
OHCHR Communications Section and other relevant parts of OHCHR; developing 
communication and media strategies; and writing, editing and updating information on the 
Council Internet and Extranet sites. It could be envisaged that this position be located 
within the Office of the President.  
</p>
<p>23. Furthermore, consideration could be given to a way in which legal advice on the 
application of the rules of procedure and related practice, currently provided by the 
secretariat of the Human Rights Council, could be provided to the President, including 
through the presence of a Legal Officer from the Office of Legal Affairs during Council 
sessions.  
</p>
<p><b> IX. Modalities for staffing the office of the President  
</b></p>
<p>24. According to the outcome document of the review process in Geneva, the 
appointment of the staff of the office of the President should promote equitable geographic 
distribution and gender balance, and the staff of the office should be accountable to the 
President. It is anticipated that, as United Nations staff members, the staff of the Office will 
be selected and recruited in accordance with applicable Staff Regulations and Rules of the 
United Nations Secretariat, thereby broadening the pool of candidates for respective 
positions and facilitating the composition of a geographically diverse staff. It is also 
anticipated that the staff of the Office will be expected to respect the Staff Regulations and 
Rules, including those relating to performance evaluation and confidentiality. 
</p>
<p>25. It is relevant to note, however, that experience of the Office of the President of the 
General Assembly seems to indicate that, even with the establishment of a certain number 
of positions, the high turnover of its staff has made it challenging for the Office to maintain 
its institutional memory. In order to ensure the institutional memory and the continuity of 
the rotating presidency of the Human Rights Council, therefore, consideration could be 
given to making arrangements to ensure that some of the staff members of the Office of the 
President continue to serve for successive Presidents. Such arrangements would not 
preclude the possibility for an incoming President to select staff, particularly his or her 
Special Assistant/Adviser against an established position or on secondment.1  
</p>
<p>  
 1 In resolutions 58/126 and 59/313, in which the General Assembly decided to provide additional posts 
</p>
<p>for the Office of the President of the General Assembly, the Assembly also decided that those posts 
were to be filled on an annual basis following consultations with the incoming President.  </p>


<p><b> X. Financial implications 
</b></p>
<p>26. As recalled in paragraph 1 above, the office of the President should be provided with 
adequate resources drawn from the regular budget, including staff, office space and 
necessary equipment required for the fulfilment of their tasks. 
</p>
<p>27. According to the statement of programme budget implications prepared with respect 
to Human Rights Council decision 9/103 (A/C.3/63/L.77),2 an independent office of the 
President of the Human Rights Council would require two professional and one General 
Service posts. These additional resources were estimated at approximately $785,400 for the 
biennium. The requirements for public information or legal advice functions were not 
envisaged in the budget implications.  
</p>
<p>28. In considering the financial implications of the composition of the office of the 
President, it would be important to bear in mind that, given the different nature of the tasks 
performed by the Human Rights Council secretariat and by the office of the President, 
additional resources would be necessary to consolidate the current ad hoc arrangements 
(two posts) that could not be absorbed within existing regular budget resources.  
</p>
<p>29. In addition to staffing, the President should continue to be provided with resources 
for his or her travels, including for the presentation of the annual report of the Human 
Rights Council to the General Assembly. As far as other expenditures are concerned, the 
United Nations Office at Geneva has been providing, as a matter of courtesy, the President 
and the staff supporting him with two offices at the Palais des Nations. The offices are 
located in proximity to the room in which the sessions of the Human Rights Council are 
held and are equipped with basic office furniture, computers and other office equipment; 
office supplies and basic logistical support are also provided. It would be necessary in 
future for these requirements to be met through resources allocated specifically to the office 
of the President.  
</p>
<p>    
</p>

</p>
<p>Committee decision on the annual report of the Human Rights Council (see paragraph 3). </p>
