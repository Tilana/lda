--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CALGARY, December 19, 2005 - Precision Drilling Trust ("PRECISION") announces
today that the cash distribution for the month of December 2005 will be Cdn$
0.27 per trust unit of Precision. The distribution will be payable on January
17, 2006 to unitholders of record on December 31, 2005. The ex-distribution date
is December 28, 2005. A payment of Cdn$ 0.27 per unit will also be made to
holders of Class B limited partnership units of Precision Drilling Limited
Partnership using the same record date and payment date.
Precision also announces that a special year end distribution of Cdn$ 0.022 per
trust unit will be paid on January 17, 2006 to unitholders of record on December
31, 2005. The special distribution is being paid with the intent that
Precision's 2005 distributions will at least be equal to Precision's taxable

ex-distribution date for the special distribution will be December 28, 2005. A
special payment of Cdn$ 0.022 per unit, as required under the Limited
Partnership Agreement, will also be made to holders of Class B limited
partnership units of Precision Drilling Limited Partnership using the same
record date and payment date.
2006 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAM
Management is pleased to announce that a capital expenditure program for 2006
totaling Cdn$ 285 million has been approved. The capital expenditure program is
being directed towards spending of Cdn$ 120 million in the upgrade of existing
fixed assets and Cdn$ 165 million in the growth and expansion to Precision's
existing asset base. Approximately 90% of the expansion capital will involve the
construction of 19 new drilling rigs which are scheduled to be delivered over
the next 12 to 15 months. These new drilling rigs are of a "fit-for-purpose"
design pursuant to long term customer contracts. Ten of the new rigs will be
Precision's versatile shallow to medium depth rated Super Single(R) rigs. The
remaining 9 new rigs are planned to be diesel electric powered light triples
rated to an approximate depth of 4,000 metres. The net number of new rigs in
2006 is expected to be 17 with the retirement of two cantilever double rigs.
Precision's drilling rig fleet will exit 2005 at a count of 230 with the
addition of two new Super Single(R) rigs in the current fourth quarter. This
gives Precision a Canadian industry market share of approximately 31%.
