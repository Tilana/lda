</b> 
 
 
</p>
<p><i> Summary 
</i> The present report provides a review of the activities of the United Nations 
Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence against Women, an inter-
agency grant-making mechanism, as well as a review of programming by the United 
Nations Development Fund for Women, now part of UN Women, on ending violence 
against women 
</p>
<p> 
 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>1. The United Nations Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence 
against Women is a leading multilateral grant-making mechanism devoted 
exclusively to supporting country- and local-level action to address violence against 
women and girls in all its forms. Established in 1996 by the General Assembly in its 
resolution 50/166, the United Nations Trust Fund is governed by an inter-agency 
Programme Appraisal Committee and administered by the United Nations 
Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM, part of UN Women) on behalf of the 
United Nations system. To date, the United Nations Trust Fund has supported 317 
programmes in 124 countries and territories with more than $60 million. 
</p>
<p>2. In the present report to the 55th session of the Commission on the Status of 
Women and the sixteenth session of the Human Rights Council, paragraphs 3 
through 41 describe the Fund&#8217;s progress and achievements in 2010, while 
paragraphs 42 through 67 highlight UNIFEM programming with regard to ending 
violence against women and girls. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background and context 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>3. Over the course of the past decade, the international community has reached 
consensus that ending violence against women and girls is critical in order to 
advance international agendas for human rights, peace and security, poverty 
reduction and development. The intensification of political will to address violence 
against women and girls is reflected at the national level in the proliferation and 
strengthening of laws, policies and action plans to eliminate violence against 
women, and internationally at the highest levels in General Assembly and Security 
Council resolutions1 calling for decisive action and increased resources to address 
this global pandemic.  
</p>

<p> 1  General Assembly resolutions 61/143, 62/133, 63/155, and 64/137 and A/C.3/65/L.17/Rev.2 on 
intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women; Security Council 
resolutions 1325 (2000), 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009) and 1889 (2009) on women, peace and 
security. </p>

<b> 
</b></p>
<p>4. The United Nations Trust Fund is well positioned to capitalize on the current 
global momentum to end violence against women and girls. Recent General 
Assembly resolutions explicitly refer to the importance of continuing to enhance the 
effectiveness of the Trust Fund as a systems-wide funding mechanism and reiterate 
the target set by the Secretary-General&#8217;s campaign &#8220;UNiTE to End Violence against 
Women&#8221; to raise $100 million annually in grant-making for the Fund by 2015. In 
2010, the General Assembly urged States to significantly increase their contributions 
to the Fund2 to help it to bridge the gap between a growing demand for programmes 
to end violence against women and girls and the resources required to do so 
effectively. 
</p>
<p>5. Guided by a new strategic plan for 2010-2015 entitled &#8220;Vision 2015&#8221;, the 
United Nations Trust Fund is focusing on three priorities: turning policy pledges 
into reality for women and girls; generating knowledge on &#8220;what works&#8221; to end the 
pandemic of violence against women and girls; and building new partnerships, 
ownership and expanded commitment to the Fund throughout the United Nations 
system and beyond. Paragraphs 6 to 29 below summarize the Fund&#8217;s progress in 
2010 towards meeting those priorities. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> III. Translating promise into practice 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>6. The overarching focus of the United Nations Trust Fund is to support the 
implementation of laws, polices and action plans designed to end violence against 
women and girls. Initiatives that engage multiple sectors and encourage partnerships 
among key stakeholders are prioritized. As described below, grantees are promoting 
primary prevention and expanding services to survivors of violence. They are also 
strengthening the legal and political framework by improving access to justice and 
transforming pledges to end violence against women into concrete budgetary and 
policy commitments. An emphasis is placed on projects that strive to meet the needs 
of particularly marginalized or neglected groups, including youth, women living in 
conflict, and indigenous women. The Fund prioritizes interventions that address 
violence against women and girls holistically, as demonstrated by the special 
funding window to address the intersections of violence against women and HIV 
and AIDS. 
</p>
<p>7. Investments of the United Nations Trust Fund are yielding promising results 
towards ending violence against women and girls. Recognizing the success of the 
initiatives of the Fund, Governments and United Nations system agencies are 
increasingly scaling up grantees&#8217; projects to maximize their impact, while civil 
society organizations across the globe are replicating the practices and strategies of 
grantees. The scaling up and replication of projects supported by the Fund 
demonstrates grantees&#8217; success in designing effective interventions targeted at social 
and State institutions, as can be seen in budgetary allocations and other measures to 
support these interventions. Grantees are also fostering change at the community 
level as indicated by the decisions of many traditional and religious leaders to ban 
harmful traditional practices in their communities and advocate against other forms 
of violence against women. Finally, the number of men and boys publicly 
denouncing violence against women, as well as the women and girls coming

<p>forward to break their silence, reveal that the initiatives of the Fund are changing 
the individual attitudes and behaviours that give rise to violence against women.  
</p>
<p>8. The United Nations Trust Fund has a current portfolio of 83 active grants 
across 72 countries and territories with a total value of nearly $47 million. Africa 
has the largest portfolio (29 per cent), followed closely by Asia and the Pacific 
(26 per cent). Latin America and the Caribbean account for 20 per cent of grants. 
Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States comprise 
14 per cent, followed by Arab States and cross-regional programmes with a grants 
portfolio of 6 and 5 per cent, respectively.  
 
</p>
<p><b>  Primary prevention 
</b> 
</p>
<p>9. Preventing violence against women and girls requires sustained, long-term 
initiatives that target the root causes of violence. Approximately one third of the 
United Nations Trust Fund&#8217;s active grants are focused on primary prevention and 
employ multiple interventions designed to change both institutional practices and 
individual attitudes and behaviour that lead to violence. These interventions include 
empowering women and girls to identify, articulate and claim their rights; raising 
awareness about violence against women through public outreach and mass 
communications; and mobilizing communities to advocate for long-term policy 
changes or more rigorous implementation of existing laws and policies. In addition, 
at least 45 per cent of current grantees engage men and boys as partners in ending 
violence against women, while 25 per cent enlist religious and traditional leaders as 
allies in changing community views on violence against women. 
</p>
<p>10. Grantees of the United Nations Trust Fund use strategies to empower women 
facing multiple forms of discrimination, such as those working with indigenous 
populations and ethnic minority groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Chile, 
Guatemala, India, Mexico, Nepal and the Philippines. In Jamaica, the Sistren 
Theatre Collective uses the performing arts to empower women and girls in poor, 
urban and highly volatile areas of Kingston. Through street theatre productions that 
have reached over 5,000 people, Sistren opens opportunities for women to share 
their personal stories in a safe environment and prompts individuals, and even 
whole communities, to consider non-violent methods for dispute resolution. Now 
recognized nationally and regionally3 for its success in using the creative arts to 
address gender-based violence, Sistren has partnered with several Government 
ministries and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to share its 
model in schools and communities nationwide. 
</p>
<p>11. The United Nations Trust Fund supports programmes in all regions focused on 
engaging men and boys in efforts to address violence against women, including the 
first large-scale initiative of this kind in the Middle East. Oxfam Great Britain and 
Kafa, its partner in Lebanon, have developed a model for women&#8217;s organizations to 
engage men by incorporating men&#8217;s perspectives into campaigns to end violence. 
Women&#8217;s organizations have built partnerships with diverse actors, including male 
university students who help to craft outreach messages for dissemination in the 
media, universities and other sites of public discourse in Lebanon. A public 
sensitization campaign about the impact of violence against women on society as a

<p>whole garnered the support of 128 members of Parliament for an intrafamily 
violence bill prior to national legislative debates. A cross-regional initiative of 
Instituto Promundo in Brazil, Chile, India and Rwanda has sensitized 7,000 men and 
boys to the causes and consequences of violence against women, prompting them to 
change violent behaviour in their daily lives. The results are groundbreaking; 
participants in Brazil and Rwanda credit the trainings with leading to their personal 
decisions to stop committing violence against their partners, while trained 
participants in India meet regularly to hold each other accountable to individual 
action plans. Promundo&#8217;s programme in Brazil was honoured as a regional prize 
winner in the 2010 Nike/Changemakers &#8220;Changing lives through football&#8221; global 
competition for sponsoring a four-month championship football tournament that 
engaged men and boys in a campaign to end violence against women and girls (see 
http://www.changemakers.com/football). 
</p>
<p>12. Grantees in Ethiopia, the Gambia, Guinea, Mali and Senegal are achieving 
impressive results by enlisting community, religious and traditional leaders as 
agents of change in preventing and condemning violence against women. Action 
Aid&#8217;s training programme for traditional and religious leaders across five states in 
Ethiopia has prompted 16 leaders who previously supported harmful traditional 
practices such as early and forced marriage or female genital mutilation to ban them 
in their communities. Grantees in the Middle East also have found that involving 
religious leaders in violence prevention and response efforts catalyses the shifting of 
attitudes and behaviours among religious community members. The International 
Rescue Committee and its local partners in Jordan are successfully leveraging the 
cooperation of the Ministry of Islamic Affairs to engage local Imams in promoting 
understanding of violence against women in religious communities and helping 
survivors to access services.  
</p>
<p>13. United Nations Trust Fund grantees in South Asia and Central America 
combine popular education strategies with new media and communication tools to 
raise awareness of violence against women and engage new partners in prevention 
efforts. In 2010, Equal Access Nepal won the Special Award at the One World 
Media Awards for outstanding media coverage from the developing world (see 
http://oneworldmedia.org.uk/awards/shortlist-winners/special_award/). The Equal 
Access weekly radio show, <i>Samajhdari</i> (&#8220;Mutual understanding&#8221;) was honoured for 
educating 1 million listeners about the interconnection of violence against women 
and HIV and AIDS. Some 60 groups met weekly to listen to the show and discuss 
themes raised by the episode&#8217;s guest, a real person living with HIV. The group&#8217;s 
facilitators, all trained in legal issues addressing violence against women and HIV 
and AIDS, built bridges to service providers and helped to double the number of 
women seeking assistance and treatment. In Nicaragua, Puntos de Encuentro uses 
mass communication outlets combined with public outreach and community 
mobilization strategies to affect social norms and attitudes at the root of violence 
against women. Capitalizing on the success of its award-winning and internationally 
recognized television series <i>Sexto Sentido</i>, also funded by the United Nations Trust 
Fund, Puntos de Encuentro is currently producing a new &#8220;social soap&#8221; series to 
examine the commercial sexual exploitation of adolescents. The show will be 
broadcast in Nicaragua, as well as other parts of Central America and the Dominican 
Republic in July 2011.

<p><b>  Expanding survivor access to support services 
</b> 
</p>
<p>14. The United Nations Trust Fund supports coordinated, holistic and 
multisectoral responses that address the interrelated needs of survivors of violence, 
including safety and protection, access to health, legal, property and inheritance 
rights, and economic security and rights. One third of the Fund&#8217;s active grants 
employ strategies to provide care, treatment and rehabilitation to victims and 
survivors of violence. A programme of Movimiento Manuela Ramos has contributed 
to a 14 per cent rise in the reporting rate of domestic violence in an isolated and 
conflict-prone region of Peru with a majority indigenous population. In that 
challenging context for reaching and assisting survivors, the initiative has greatly 
improved cross-sectoral coordination for referrals by convening a task force of 
government officials, civil society organizations and service providers to develop an 
inter-agency protocol for responding to survivors&#8217; needs. Social Services of 
Cambodia has developed the first community-based response model in Cambodia 
for survivors of sexual assault, designed to meet the needs of 80 per cent of women 
and girls who prefer to receive support services directly from the community as 
opposed to in a shelter. As the rate of women receiving community-based services 
has grown by 25 per cent, communities have become more informed about the 
causes and consequences of sexual assault and local authorities have improved their 
capacity to support survivors and refer them to legal and medical services, 
appropriate counselling, and safety assessment and planning. 
</p>
<p>15. United Nations Trust Fund grantees provide coordinated care to women living 
with HIV and AIDS who are at risk of violence, or survivors of violence who may 
require HIV-related services. The grantee Doctors to Children developed a highly 
successful model of integrated care in St. Petersburg, Russian Federation, to reach 
HIV-positive women who are pregnant or have children. Government and 
non-governmental institutions joined together to develop an inter-agency protocol 
for reaching this high-risk yet underserved population. After a successful pilot 
programme in the Kalininsky district, the city government expanded the scope of the 
programme to apply to service providers city-wide. To date, nearly 600 women have 
received assistance in the form of social and psychological support, advice on legal 
issues, temporary housing and material support.  
</p>
<p>16. Service delivery to survivors of violence living in conflict, post-conflict and 
unstable situations poses a complex set of challenges, requiring creative 
interventions for the 17 per cent of grantees working in those settings. International 
Medical Corps United Kingdom has developed a mobile care model to provide 
comprehensive treatment to survivors of sexual violence from the Central African 
Republic now living in northern Cameroon. In only one year of implementation, the 
rate of sexual violence survivors receiving medical care and counselling has 
increased fourfold. Previously unavailable testing for HIV, as well as access to 
antiretroviral treatment for the 50 per cent of survivors who test positive, are now 
standard practice. The national reparations programme of Sierra Leone has received 
the first grant of its kind from the United Nations Trust Fund to ensure that 
reparations programmes are tailored to the needs of women survivors of sexual 
violence. Through a strong collaboration with local women&#8217;s organizations, the 
programme registered 3,600 victims of sexual violence and prioritized 600 of the 
most vulnerable victims to receive reparations. After only one year of 
implementation, 300 women are participating in skills-training programmes across </p>

</b></p>
<p>14 districts of the country, moving towards sustainable livelihoods and a life free 
from violence. 
 
</p>
<p><b>  Securing budgetary and policy commitments for implementation 
</b> 
</p>
<p>17. The United Nations Trust Fund supports projects that fill critical gaps in 
implementation of laws and policies addressing violence against women, ranging 
from standardized data collection to political advocacy to developing capacities of 
government officials and other stakeholders charged with implementation or 
enforcement of laws. 
</p>
<p>18. Nearly 60 per cent of grantees collect and analyse data that can be used to 
build the evidence base necessary for formulating policy and monitoring progress 
towards the implementation of national commitments to end violence against 
women. A cross-regional initiative of Women in Cities International collects data to 
support policies aimed at eliminating daily harassment and sexual violence in urban 
spaces. In four cities on four continents (Delhi; Dar es Salaam; Petrozavodsk, 
Russian Federation; and Rosario, Argentina) the initiative engages women in 
participatory research activities such as street surveys, neighbourhood safety audits, 
and group discussions to gather their knowledge on key safety concerns in their 
communities. In all cities, the data has convinced policymakers and other 
stakeholders to improve the safety of public spaces. The local partner in Delhi was 
invited by the city&#8217;s Municipal Corporation to provide inputs into a road redesign 
project, marking the first time that women&#8217;s safety concerns have been included in 
an urban design project in India. In Petrozavodsk, data from the surveys on women&#8217;s 
safety convinced local police chiefs to produce the nation&#8217;s first set of gender-
disaggregated municipal crime statistics. 
</p>
<p>19. Grantees of the United Nations Trust Fund are almost universally working to 
strengthen institutional and professional capacities of those tasked with the 
implementation of laws, policies and action plans to end violence against women. 
The non-governmental organization Refleksione successfully piloted a cross-
sectoral referral system to implement Albania&#8217;s newly adopted Law on Domestic 
Violence at the local level. In each of the five targeted municipalities, the 
programme trained over 300 public sector professionals and established two 
institutions at the local level: a decision-making council comprised of government 
agencies working on domestic violence and a technical working group of service 
providers to implement the council&#8217;s decisions. Now with budgetary commitments 
from four cities and with renewed support from the United Nations Trust Fund, 
Refleksione is doubling the scope of the programme to serve 10 municipalities. 
Another grantee develops the capacity of local women&#8217;s organizations in six Pacific 
Island countries (Samoa, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Tonga, the Cook Islands and Solomon 
Islands) to advocate for fixing gaps in national legislative frameworks addressing 
violence against women. In Nauru, after women&#8217;s organizations urged members of 
Parliament to incorporate model legislation on violence against women into 
revisions of the penal code, the draft legislation was amended to include an 
expanded definition of rape and the criminalization of domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>20. Other grantees of the United Nations Trust Fund focus on enforcement of laws 
that address violence against women through strengthening judicial systems and 
improving access to justice for survivors of violence. Solidarite f&#233;minine pour la 
paix et le d&#233;veloppement int&#233;gral (SOFEPADI), a women&#8217;s rights organization </p>

<p>based in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, receives support from the Fund 
to address impunity for sexual violence emerging from the country&#8217;s decades-long 
conflict. Through a mobile courts system that holds trials for sexual violence cases 
in rural communities, SOFEPADI has successfully reduced the backlog of cases and 
encouraged more victims to file complaints. Over 150 cases have been filed to date, 
of which 70 resulted in convictions. In recognition of the achievements of 
SOFEPADI in bringing justice to victims and restoring public confidence in the rule 
of law in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Government of France is 
sustaining the project with funding for three mobile courts.  
 
 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Building new partnerships, ownership and  
expanded commitment 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>21. Violence against women cuts across all sectors, population groups and public 
and private spaces, requiring the engagement of multiple stakeholders. Securing the 
involvement of traditional and new actors is thus a hallmark of the United Nations 
Trust Fund&#8217;s strategy, centred on mobilizing broad-based partnerships and garnering 
support from an ever-growing range of actors including Member States, private and 
individual donors, non-governmental organizations and United Nations sister 
agencies.  
</p>
<p>22. The United Nations Trust Fund is founded on United Nations partnerships and 
working to increase ownership of the Fund across the United Nations system. A key 
platform to enhance these synergies is the Inter-Agency Programme Appraisal 
Committee comprised of United Nations system agencies at the global and 
subregional levels. This entity advises the Fund on strategic decisions and grant-
making issues. The Inter-Agency Programme Appraisal Committees at the 
subregional level in particular enables links to existing United Nations efforts and 
national priorities. This decentralized and broadly participatory structure ensures 
that funding allocations conform closely to the capacities and needs of diverse 
countries and regions, thereby promoting the overall relevance of the Fund to 
national priorities and context.  
</p>
<p>23. In 2010, the 13 Inter-Agency Programme Appraisal Committee members at the 
global and subregional levels included United Nations system agencies, 
representatives of other inter-agency mechanisms, and a leading civil society 
organization. Participating United Nations system agencies at the global and 
subregional levels in 2010 were: Division for the Advancement of Women; 
Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean; International Labour 
Organization (ILO); Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights; the Regional Commissions New York Office; UNIFEM; the United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF); UNDP; the World Health Organization (WHO); and the 
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The Programme Appraisal Committee 
met a total of four times at the global and subregional levels to provide critical 
expertise and guidance in shaping the United Nations Trust Fund&#8217;s Strategic Plan for 
2010-2015.  
</p>
<p>24. As part of &#8220;delivering as one&#8221;, grants to United Nations country teams since 
2008 have established direct synergies with United Nations programmes at the 
country and subregional levels. To date, the United Nations Trust Fund has disbursed 
$10.6 million to country teams in 11 countries. The Fund also collaborates with other </p>

<p>United Nations initiatives to address violence against women. The &#8220;Say NO &#8212; 
UNiTE to End Violence against Women&#8221; online advocacy platform of UNIFEM 
(http://www.saynotoviolence.org/) encourages donations for the Fund and showcases 
the achievements and impact of its grantees. In 2011, the Fund will join with the 
Secretary-General&#8217;s UNiTE campaign to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of 
the Fund and the fifth anniversary of the Secretary-General&#8217;s ground-breaking 
in-depth study on all forms of violence against women (A/61/122/Add.1 and Corr.1). 
</p>
<p>25. The United Nations Trust Fund has built partnerships with leading research 
and expert institutions, including the International Center for Research on Women, 
PATH, and the USAID MEASURE project. The Fund is brokering new partnerships 
with philanthropists, high-profile spokespersons, and other individuals capable of 
raising the Fund&#8217;s visibility while expanding engagement with the private sector. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> V. Generating knowledge and developing capacities 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>26. Although the number and breadth of interventions addressing violence against 
women and girls has increased in the last decade, there is a dearth of rigorous 
evaluation assessing their impact on women&#8217;s lives. Consequently, it remains 
difficult to identify &#8220;what works&#8221; in preventing and redressing such violence. In 
2010, the United Nations Trust Fund implemented the recommendations made by 
the 2009 external evaluation, which urged the Fund to develop the capacities of 
grantees to conduct effective monitoring and evaluation and to improve the Fund&#8217;s 
processes for capturing and disseminating knowledge. 
</p>
<p>27. The United Nations Trust Fund strengthened its processes for monitoring and 
evaluation by providing technical feedback to grantees starting in the proposal 
development phase and continuing with assistance in developing and implementing 
grantees&#8217; monitoring and evaluation plans. As in previous years, the 2010 Call for 
Proposals for the fifteenth grant-making cycle recommended that applicants 
dedicate 10 per cent of grants requested to evaluation, and an additional 2 to 5 per 
cent to monitoring. The United Nations Trust Fund secretariat grew its own capacity 
to monitor grantee programmes by visiting twice as many grantees in 2010 as the 
previous year, totalling 7 monitoring visits to 18 grantees in 14 countries, in 
addition to the regular monitoring by focal points for the Fund at UNIFEM 
subregional offices.  
</p>
<p>28. Closing the gaps in grantees&#8217; capacity to design and implement programmes 
and knowledge about &#8220;what works&#8221; in ending violence against women is central to 
the mandate of the United Nations Trust Fund as described in the Monitoring, 
Evaluation and Knowledge Management Framework 2008-2011. In 2010, the Fund 
institutionalized capacity-development training for all new and recently funded 
grantees on evidence-based programme design, monitoring and evaluation. The 
Fund held four regional skills-building workshops in three languages, reaching a 
total of 43 organizations.4 The workshops were modelled after two successful pilot 
workshops convened in 2009 in partnership with the International Center for 
Research on Women. Grantees responded enthusiastically to the Fund&#8217;s capacity-

<p>development training and have begun to integrate evidence-based research, 
monitoring and evaluation tools into their existing programmes. At least three 
grantees have initiated cross-learning activities to consider the possibilities for 
adapting strategies and practices to other contexts.  
</p>
<p>29. In 2010, the United Nations Trust Fund made significant investments in a 
system for global monitoring, evaluation and knowledge management. As the Fund 
invests in a sophisticated database to capture results, the secretariat has begun to 
map the outcomes of initiatives, focusing on certain indicators of success such as 
measures taken to sustain and replicate projects. Beginning with its fifteenth call for 
proposals issued on 23 November 2010, the Fund launched an online application 
process that will allow the secretariat to better assist applicants and improve 
efficiencies with respect to management and collection of applicant data. The 
appraisal process will also be conducted online, contributing to the accuracy and 
transparency of the assessment and selection process. These tools are essential to the 
development of an integrated system that will facilitate results-based reporting and 
help the Fund track and analyse trends across the entire grant-making portfolio. In 
collaboration with UNIFEM subregional offices, the United Nations Trust Fund 
completed several case studies of lessons learned and good practices generated by 
grantees. Finally, grantees&#8217; evaluation reports, training manuals, and outreach and 
communications tools were gathered to feed the UNIFEM global virtual knowledge 
centre (http://www.endvawnow.org/). 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Grant-making cycle 2010 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>30. United Nations Trust Fund grants are awarded annually through an open, 
competitive, and transparent process that ensures quality programming and rigour in 
the selection of grantees. The call for proposals invites holistic initiatives that focus 
on reaching particularly excluded or disadvantaged groups through approaches 
tailored to diverse needs. Priority is placed on applications that highlight 
multisectoral approaches and collaboration between various stakeholders; evidence 
of what works to optimize the use of resources; and investment in systematic and 
comprehensive documentation and evaluation aiming at generating and sharing 
knowledge. Through its grant-making process, the Fund channels global expertise 
and resources to the local level, where they are needed most. It also underscores the 
potential for scaling up successful initiatives, while emphasizing development of 
national capacities to foster sustainability.  
</p>
<p>31. In 2010, despite a severe global economic crisis, the United Nations Trust 
Fund supported the implementation of national laws, policies and programmes to 
end violence against women at the same funding level as 2009. Over $10 million 
was awarded to 13 initiatives in 18 countries and territories for programmes 
expected to reach 280,000 beneficiaries. The grants awarded in 2010 complete the 
Fund&#8217;s fourteenth grant-making cycle, delivering a total of $20.5 million for 26 
initiatives in 33 countries and territories.5  
</p>

<p> 5  The United Nations Trust Fund&#8217;s fourteenth grant-making cycle was awarded in two batches. 
The first round of grants administered in 2009 was based on contributions received by the end of 
the third quarter of that year, which totalled $10.5 million.  Additional contributions of 
$10 million received in the fourth quarter of 2009 allowed the Fund to award a second group of 
grants in the first quarter of 2010 as part of the fourteenth cycle. </p>

<b> 
</b></p>
<p>32. Since 2008, as the resource base of the United Nations Trust Fund has 
increased, a shift to larger and longer-term grants has allowed for larger-scale 
interventions that can achieve higher-level results and better sustainability efforts. 
In 2010, the Fund has again offered grants of up to $1 million, and the majority 
received three-year grants. In 2010, Asia and the Pacific received the largest amount 
of funds (35 per cent), followed by Africa (28 per cent); Central and Eastern Europe 
and the Commonwealth of Independent States (13 per cent); Latin America and the 
Caribbean (10 per cent) and Arab States (10 per cent); and cross-regional grants 
(4 per cent). Belarus, the Marshall Islands and Sri Lanka are first-time grant 
recipients. The majority of new grantees include women&#8217;s organizations (31 per 
cent); followed by United Nations country teams (23 per cent); development 
organizations and youth organizations (15 per cent each); and governmental 
organizations and human rights organizations (8 per cent each).  
</p>
<p>33. Grants awarded in 2010 focus on initiatives working with youth, including two 
that will address the needs of rural girls. In China, the Beijing Cultural Development 
Centre for Rural Women will develop protection mechanisms for rural girls left 
behind by parents working in cities, while in Peru the Asociaci&#243;n de Comunicadores 
Sociales Calandria will empower rural adolescent youth to become leaders in the 
movement to end violence against women and girls. The Trust Fund&#8217;s emphasis on 
engaging men and boys continues with a grant to the Mother Child Education 
Foundation in Turkey, which will model a highly innovative programme engaging 
fathers in the prevention of gender-based violence within the family, and with 
support for the Zambia Young Women&#8217;s Christian Association to establish 200 
men&#8217;s networks to advocate against violence.  
</p>
<p>34. Other grantees will work with particularly marginalized populations. The 
Jordanian Women&#8217;s Union will establish the first regional network in Egypt, Jordan 
and Morocco to address trafficking and protect women migrant workers&#8217; rights, and 
the Acid Survivors Trust International will pilot groundbreaking strategies for 
ending acid burning against women in Cambodia, Nepal and Uganda. Pathfinder 
Mozambique will leverage sexual and reproductive health services as a means of 
reaching violence survivors such as adolescents and women living with HIV. In 
India, Nepal and the Philippines, the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact Foundation will 
support local indigenous leaders to engage in advocacy and community mobilization 
towards the reform of customary laws that tolerate violence against women. 
</p>
<p>35. Other grantees will focus on closing gaps in legislation and strengthening national 
capacities to implement policies and enforce laws addressing violence against women 
and girls. Women United Together Marshall Islands, in partnership with government 
agencies, will increase public awareness and strengthen national legislation and 
protocols around domestic violence. In Burundi, the ministry of Human Rights and 
Gender will undertake a comprehensive multisectoral initiative to implement the 
National Strategy against Gender-based Violence. United Nations country teams in 
Belarus, Indonesia and Sri Lanka and will support multisectoral interventions to enforce 
national laws addressing violence against women and girls. A summary of all new 
grantees can be found on the United Nations Trust Fund website (http://www.unifem.org/ 
gender_issues/violence_against_women/trust_fund_grantees.php).

<p><b> VII. Mobilizing resources 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>36. The United Nations Trust Fund&#8217;s ability to pursue a strategic vision in support 
of country-level implementation of commitments to end violence against women 
and girls depends on its ability to mobilize adequate resources. Appeals made by the 
General Assembly for increased resources to the Fund in resolutions 61/143, 62/133, 
63/155 and 64/137 have enhanced the Fund&#8217;s capacity in that regard. The Fund&#8217;s 
new Strategic Plan emphasizes outreach across public and private sectors in order to 
leverage resources and partnerships for the long-term sustainability of the Fund. 
</p>
<p>37. For grants awarded in 2010 to complete the fourteenth grant-making cycle, the 
United Nations Trust Fund benefited from the support of the Netherlands, Denmark, 
Norway, Switzerland, and Antigua and Barbuda. For pledges received in 2010 for 
the fifteenth grant-making cycle, the Government of Spain continues as the leading 
supporter of the Fund,6 followed by the Netherlands, the United States of America, 
Australia, Finland, Germany, Austria, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The Governments 
of Finland and the Republic of Korea also supported two Junior Professional Officer 
positions for the United Nations Trust Fund secretariat. 
</p>
<p>38. The private sector has an important role to play in ending violence against 
women and girls. In 2010, Avon Products Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson were lead 
private sector partners of the United Nations Trust Fund. The latter has supported 
the Fund&#8217;s special window on links between violence against women and HIV and 
AIDS since 2005. The non-profit organization Zonta International generously 
contributed to the Fund for the fifth consecutive year. The Fund was also supported 
by UNIFEM National Committees in Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland.7  
</p>
<p>39. In 2010, the United Nations Trust Fund developed and began to implement a 
fund-raising strategy to meet the Secretary-General&#8217;s challenge as part of the 
UNiTE campaign to raise $100 million to distribute in grant-making in 2015. To 
execute this strategy, the Fund focused on integrating its communications and 
outreach activities. In collaboration with the UNiTE campaign, the Fund hosted a 
high-level event to encourage private sector involvement in efforts to end violence 
against women and girls. At a public event on the International Day to Eliminate 
Violence against Women, the Secretary-General announced the fifteenth call for 
proposals and launched a mobile giving promotion to heighten the Fund&#8217;s visibility 
and encourage individual donations. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. The way forward 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>40. Moving into its fifteenth year, the United Nations Trust Fund will continue to 
support high-quality, evidence-based programmes that achieve targeted results with 
maximum impact. In accordance with the strategic direction set forth in Vision 
2015, and building on the recommendations of the external evaluation in 2009, the 
Fund will grow its processes for collecting and disseminating knowledge about what 
works in ending violence against women. In 2010, the Fund built a strong

<p>foundation to develop a knowledge management system, as described in section V 
above. Next steps include the completion of a sophisticated global monitoring 
system in order to capture and track grantees&#8217; results more efficiently and make 
them more accessible to a global audience. In 2011, with a view towards facilitating 
cross-learning, the Fund will create multiple global platforms for connecting 
grantees using similar strategies or interventions.  
</p>
<p>41. The establishment of UN Women by the General Assembly in 2010 provides a 
welcome institutional framework to strengthen collaboration and capture global 
expertise on approaches to end violence against women. Although the United 
Nations Trust Fund faces the continuous challenge of meeting extraordinary global 
demand for programmes to end violence against women, it will seek opportunities 
for leveraging existing resources as it intensifies its resource mobilization to engage 
new and diverse strategic partners. 
 
 
</p>
<p><b> IX. UNIFEM (part of UN Women) programming on ending 
violence against women  
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>42. UNIFEM (part of UN Women) currently supports programmes to address 
gender-based violence in some 90 countries of the world. Guided by its strategy, &#8220;A 
life free of violence: unleashing the power of women&#8217;s empowerment and gender 
equality&#8221;, in the course of 2010, UNIFEM advocacy, programming, partnerships, 
outreach and inter-agency collaboration continued to expand at global, regional and 
national levels, highlights of which are provided below. 
 
</p>
<p><b>  Furthering policies, laws and their implementation 
</b> 
</p>
<p>43. The ongoing policy of UNIFEM and its technical advisory services to national 
Governments, advocates and other stakeholders included support to women&#8217;s 
machineries in eight Caribbean countries for evidence-based development of 
national action plans to end violence against women; as well as in the Seychelles, 
with the Ministry of Health and Social Development, and in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, with the Ministry of Women&#8217;s Affairs on the development of 
the national strategy &#8212; a first of its kind in the Arab region.  
</p>
<p>44. Through its ongoing work with parliamentarians, women&#8217;s machineries and the 
women&#8217;s movement, UNIFEM continues to support efforts for legislative reforms to 
end impunity and improve women&#8217;s access to justice. At the global level, this 
included expanded collaboration with the Inter-Parliamentary Union at the regional 
level, to strengthen legislators&#8217; learning and exchange opportunities on good 
practice for strengthened enforcement and monitoring, and gender-responsive 
budgeting; as well as completion of an inter-institutional memorandum of 
understanding. At the country level, UNIFEM provided support for legal reforms, 
with the passage of the law on domestic violence in Timor-Leste, and amendments 
to Albanian laws related to family violence in order to improve confidentiality 
measures, sustainable shelters, and coordinated community response systems by 
local government. 
 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/34 
E/CN.6/2011/9 </b>

<p>10-67259 <b>14 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Improving access for survivors, developing the capacities of key policy and 
service delivery institutions  
</b> 
</p>
<p>45. A major focus of UNIFEM work has centred on access to justice for survivors. 
Highlights include the continued support of UNIFEM in Argentina, along with 
UNDP and UNICEF, to the newly created Office of Domestic Violence of the 
Supreme Court &#8212; the first of its kind at the national level. The Office assists 
women survivors of violence with services, including referrals to civil or penal 
courts and health and social services. The court is responsible for tracking and 
assessing the cases, to provide data in order to analyse patterns of impunity and the 
judiciary&#8217;s response to gender-based violence cases. In Thailand, training of judicial 
staff is aiming to strengthen enforcement of the Domestic Violence Act; the 
rearrangement of courtrooms using partitions and cameras now also protects 
survivors from directly encountering their perpetrators. Support to the legal system 
of Nigeria has resulted in a handbook entitled &#8220;Access to justice for trafficked 
persons&#8221;, which serves as a guide for taking cases through the legal system, from 
the identification of a potentially trafficked person until the case is closed. 
</p>
<p>46. UNIFEM also contributed to improved policies and service delivery for 
women survivors of violence in various countries, such as through its work with 
national women&#8217;s machineries in Ghana, Liberia and Peru; to increased access to 
legal assistance in Ethiopia, Fiji and the Occupied Palestinian Territories; and to a 
strengthened police response in Nigeria. UNIFEM also partnered with excluded 
groups of women to hold policymakers accountable to eliminate violence, including 
indigenous women, HIV-positive women&#8217;s networks; young women and migrant 
women workers from Africa, Asia, the Commonwealth of Independent States and 
Latin America and the Caribbean. The Stop Violence against Women in the 
Economic Community of West African States Subregion initiative engages women&#8217;s 
national machineries, religious leaders, the Association of Women Lawyers and 
rural women&#8217;s platforms, thus contributing to the implementation of the Africa 
component of the Secretary-General&#8217;s UNiTE campaign.  
</p>
<p>47. Also in line with the UNiTE campaign, UNIFEM provided technical and 
financial assistance to the high-level International Conference on the Role of 
Security Organs in Ending Violence against Women and Girls, held in Kigali in 
October 2010 and hosted by the Rwanda National Police and Rwanda Defence 
Forces Gender Desk in partnership with &#8220;One United Nations&#8221;. The Conference was 
attended by police chiefs, senior police and military officers responsible for gender 
and community policing affairs, as well as members of civil society organizations, 
the United Nations system, and academia involved from different countries both 
within and outside Africa. The Kigali Declaration on Ending Violence against 
Women and Girls, adopted at the event, reaffirmed the commitments for action and 
the efforts to continue building on best practice to expand justice and services for 
survivors in the continent.  
</p>
<p>48. In terms of support for capacity development at the global level, during the 
Commission on the Status of Women in March 2010, UNIFEM launched a unique 
online resource for service providers, programmers, policymakers and advocates 
that provides ready access to the state-of-the-art on &#8220;what works best&#8221; to address 
gender-based violence: the Virtual Knowledge Centre to End Violence against 
Women and Girls (see http://www.endvawnow.org). Developed with leading experts 
and organizations from around the world, the site offers high-quality guidance in </p>

<p>multiple languages on &#8220;how to&#8221; design, implement, monitor and evaluate 
programmes, as well as over 700 recommended tools in more than 50 languages, 
with a fully searchable database. It draws on good practices, lessons learned and 
evaluations generated by Governments, civil society organizations, researchers and 
United Nations system agencies. To date, comprehensive programming modules 
have been made available (each on average 200-300 pages), covering: programming 
basics, monitoring and evaluation, safe cities, working with men and boys, and 
formulating legislation &#8212; with more advanced for launch in 2011, including on 
prevention, the health sector, the education sector and campaigns.  
 
</p>
<p><b>  Expanding data collection, analysis and tracking systems 
</b> 
</p>
<p>49. Data collection and analysis is another area of UNIFEM-supported efforts, 
including to inform the development of effective public policies (e.g., in 
Guinea-Bissau and the Republic of Moldova) and to support the efforts of women&#8217;s 
networks in tracking progress (e.g., in Ecuador). Related to the launch of the Global 
Safe Cities Free of Violence against Women Programme (see para. 56 below), a 
joint research initiative in India was undertaken by the Department of Women and 
Child Development, Government of Delhi, Jagori, the UNIFEM South Asia Office 
and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), to bring 
policy and public attention to the levels of sexual harassment and violence faced by 
women in public spaces in the city of New Delhi. Another study was commissioned 
on data- collection practices among selected agencies in South-East Europe, with a 
focus on domestic violence, with a view to developing a set of indicators to track 
the prevalence of violence against women and to monitor the institutional responses 
to violent crimes against women. 
 
</p>
<p><b>  Addressing sexual violence as a tactic of warfare  
</b> 
</p>
<p>50. In 2010, UNIFEM began the second phase of a multi-country programme on 
community-based peacebuilding and prevention of sexual and gender-based 
violence, consisting of activities at the global level as well as in Haiti, Liberia, 
Timor-Leste, and Uganda. These included, for example, technical capacity-building 
of the police in those four countries &#8212; for example, trainings, the revision of 
curricula, the provision of material inputs such as vehicles and communication 
equipment so as to respond more effectively to violence against women, and 
brokering regular interaction and trust-building activities with women&#8217;s 
organizations, continued support for local community safety committees in Haiti, 
the development of a monitoring and tracking system for gender-based violence 
cases in Timor-Leste, and trainings of the judiciary on national jurisprudence on 
gender-based violence in Liberia, as well as projected expansion of the &#8220;peace hut 
model&#8221; as a good example of a women-led local protection strategy.  
</p>
<p>51. Under the umbrella of United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in 
Conflict, now chaired by the new Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
on Sexual Violence in Conflict, UNIFEM has taken the lead on several activities: 
mainly (a) advocacy, via the 200,000 &#8220;Get crossed&#8221; campaign, a petition to &#8220;Say no 
to sexual violence in conflict&#8221;, and 26 Open Days on Women and Peace and 
Security, co-organized with UNDP, the Department of Political Affairs and the 
Department of Peacekeeping Operations, which culminated in a Global Open Day in 
which women activists had a chance to present their demands, priorities and 
recommendations to the United Nations leadership in their countries; (b) the launch </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/34 
E/CN.6/2011/9 </b> 
 
</p>
<p>10-67259 <b>16 
 
</b></p>
<p>of the publication &#8220;Addressing conflict-related sexual violence: an analytical 
inventory of peacekeeping practice&#8221;, which compiles examples of prevention and 
protection strategies, and their translation into scenario-based training materials for 
predeployment and in-mission training of military peacekeepers; and (c) the 
continued collaboration of UNIFEM with the Department of Political Affairs on 
mediation, and the launch of a three-year joint strategy that includes, inter alia, the 
development and use of practical guidance for mediators on how to deal with 
conflict-related sexual violence in peace processes. 
</p>
<p>52. Two main reports on women, peace and security were submitted to the 
Security Council on the tenth anniversary of its resolution 1325 (2000) (S/2010/173 
and S/2010/498), with implications for violence against women in general. 
UNIFEM supported the technical development of a comprehensive list of indicators 
to track the implementation of resolution 1325 (2000). Some of the indicators will 
be used to strengthen information on prevalence and patterns of sexual violence in 
conflict, police and judicial follow-up of cases of sexual exploitation and abuse 
perpetrated by peacekeepers or humanitarians, as well as cases of violence against 
women in general, and an index on women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; physical security that would 
take into account perception and other proxy variables. A separate report on 
women&#8217;s participation in peacebuilding contains an action plan identifying concrete 
initiatives in seven key peacebuilding areas that, at least indirectly, have a bearing 
on the prevention of and protection from violence against women in conflict and 
post-conflict settings, including mediation, post-conflict planning and financing, the 
deployment of international civilian capacity, governance, economic recovery and 
rule of law, for example, recommendations on immediate legal assistance for women 
and minimum standards of gender-responsiveness for transitional justice 
institutions.  
 
</p>
<p><b>  Forging partnerships and expanding outreach, communications and partnering 
with the media 
</b> 
</p>
<p>53. The outreach of UNIFEM with the mass media, public awareness-raising and 
social mobilization efforts continue to expand and intensify at all levels, as a key to 
sustaining and mobilizing commitments and &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221;, including in the 
framework of the Secretary-General&#8217;s UNiTE campaign.  
</p>
<p>54. A major UNIFEM contribution in that regard was as coordinator, in close 
collaboration with various other United Nations sister agencies, of the regional 
components of the Secretary-General&#8217;s UNiTE campaign. In 2010, the campaigns 
were launched in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and the Caribbean; while the Latin 
America campaign continued to progress since its launch in November 2009. The 
UNIFEM Say NO &#8212; UNiTE initiative, which has emerged as a valuable tool for 
engagement and awareness-raising globally, has documented over 1 million actions 
over the course of the past year. Among the many innovative and original initiatives 
at the national and regional levels, was a photo exhibition presented by the African 
Union, in partnership with UNIFEM, the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees, UNICEF, the Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs and Isis-Women&#8217;s International Cross-Cultural Exchange, 
during the African Union Summit held in Uganda in July 2010, under the theme 
&#8220;Make peace happen: prevent violence against women and girls&#8221;.  </p>


<p><b>E/CN.6/2011/9
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>17 </b>10-67259 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>55. Another example of public and media outreach, seizing the opportunity of the 
2010 World Cup Soccer in South Africa, UNIFEM joined the Red Light 2010 
campaign, a regional civil society effort to counteract the trafficking of women and 
girls ahead of and during the games; and also organized a soccer tournament in 
Johannesburg in April, with the message, &#8220;Say no to trafficking in women, say yes 
to women&#8217;s rights&#8221;. This formed part of UNIFEM collaboration as a member of the 
United Nations Task Force that works in support of the Government of South Africa 
to prevent human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>56. Also in line with the focus on raising awareness and advancing prevention 
strategies, the launch, in November 2010, of the UNIFEM innovative Global 
Programme on Safe Cities Free of Violence against Women and Girls provided 
additional opportunities for media coverage and dialogue on the neglected but 
universal phenomenon of sexual harassment and violence in public spaces. With a 
focus on the poorest areas and slums in five cities from different regions of the 
world &#8212; Quito, Cairo, New Delhi, Port Moresby and Kigali &#8212; the Programme is 
being developed in collaboration with UN-Habitat, other United Nations system 
agencies (including UNFPA, UNDP and UNICEF) and leading women&#8217;s networks, 
among other partners. This is the first cross-regional initiative dedicated to 
developing a proven model for making cities safer for women and girls, by reducing 
sexual harassment and violence in public spaces, while improving the quality of life 
for all city dwellers. The model will be offered for adaptation by local authorities 
and stakeholders in cities around the world.  
</p>
<p>57. Engaging non-traditional and influential partners, including the private sector, 
in the struggle to end gender-based violence and advance women&#8217;s empowerment is 
key. In that regard, and in order to offer practical guidance to businesses on how to 
empower women in the workplace, marketplace and community, UNIFEM 
developed the Women&#8217;s Empowerment Principles through a partnership with the 
United Nations Global Compact. The Principles are designed to support companies 
in reviewing existing policies and practices &#8212; or establishing new ones &#8212; to realize 
women&#8217;s empowerment. With the subtitle &#8220;Equality means business&#8221;, the Principles 
emphasize the business case for corporate action to promote gender equality and 
women&#8217;s empowerment and are informed by real-life business practices, the 
interests of Governments and civil society. The Principles acknowledge the 
importance of addressing violence in women&#8217;s lives through, inter alia, workplace 
protection from sexual harassment and exploitation and access to services related to 
domestic violence. 
</p>
<p>58. Working with religious leaders is also strategic if social norms that accept 
gender-based violence and discrimination are to be transformed. In the Sudan, 
UNIFEM is partnering with a local non-governmental organization to mentor 
Islamic and traditional leaders to become advocates and champions of women&#8217;s 
human rights protections within the legal framework in Darfur, and to facilitate 
radio discussions on women&#8217;s rights under Islam. Similarly, collaboration with faith-
based organizations, from global to local levels, permeates various UNIFEM-
supported efforts. 
</p>
<p>59. UNIFEM membership since 2009 in the Clinton Global Initiative network 
continued, including as a partner announced at two related launches during the 
annual event in September 2010 (Together for Girls (see para. 62 below); and the 
&#8220;going global&#8221; of the cutting-edge Ring the Bell Campaign led by the </p>

<p>non-governmental organization Breakthrough); and as a member of the Affinity 
Groups organized on violence and gender issues in the lead-up to the event, with a 
range of private and public sector counterparts to foster new partnerships.  
 
</p>
<p><b>  Engaging groups of strategic importance: adolescents and youth, men and boys 
</b>

<p>60. The evidence is building that the prevention of violence against women and 
girls must start at younger ages, and that engaging adolescents and youth, and men 
of all ages, is a critical component to future success.  
</p>
<p>61. UNIFEM places strategic emphasis on advancing the rights and needs of 
adolescent girls, and on the role that young people of both sexes can play in 
prevention. It is one among more than 20 partners of the Man Up Campaign &#8212; the 
first global initiative focused exclusively on youth leadership and mobilization to 
address ending violence against women and girls. UNIFEM is also a member of the 
Inter-Agency Task Force on Adolescent Girls, a global initiative focused on the 
needs and rights of marginalized adolescent girls in the context of the Millennium 
Development Goals and efforts aimed at poverty reduction and development. 
UNIFEM plays a key advisory and technical role on engendering the programme 
frameworks overall and more specifically on the pillar on gender-based violence, in 
collaboration with UNFPA and UNICEF (as co-chairs), and ILO, UNESCO and 
WHO. The Task Force will provide technical support and guidance to United 
Nations country teams in developing holistic programmes, with initiatives starting 
up in Ethiopia, Guatemala, Liberia and Malawi, with support from the United 
Nations Foundation.  
</p>
<p>62. UNIFEM also continued to support the Together for Girls initiative, a 
partnership spearheaded by a private sector individual, co-led with UNICEF and the 
United States-based Centers for Disease Control, involving other United Nations 
system agencies (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), 
UNFPA, WHO). It is focused on expanding the country data collection (via surveys) 
on sexual abuse against girls, in order to spur action and policy and service delivery 
responses. 
</p>
<p>63. UNIFEM also contributed to include a gender perspective in the agenda of the 
World Youth Conference held in Mexico in 2010 and in the joint statement signed 
by 27 heads of United Nations system agencies in New York at the global launch of 
the International Year of Youth: Dialogue and Mutual Understanding. It also 
organized the Young Women&#8217;s Forum during the Conference, an open space of 
discussion about innovative solutions to empower young women as agents of peace, 
development and justice.  
</p>
<p>64. Collaboration with pro-equality men&#8217;s groups and the MenEngage Alliance, on 
which UNIFEM serves along other United Nations sister agencies on the 
International Advisory Committee, is ongoing at the advocacy and technical levels. 
This included UNIFEM collaboration with the partner organization&#8217;s expert on 
masculinities issues to develop the programming module on engaging men and boys 
in violence prevention; convening a Commission on the Status of Women panel for 
the release of the findings of a new international survey reflecting male attitudes 
about gender and violence; and continued collaboration with men&#8217;s networks at the 
country level (e.g., Colombia and Nepal, among others).

<p>65. Most of the efforts and programmes highlighted above are rooted in partnerships 
with a range of stakeholders from government, civil society, the women&#8217;s movement, 
experts and researchers, and include United Nations inter-agency collaboration.  
</p>
<p>66. UNIFEM continues to play a key role in United Nations country team joint 
efforts and programmes to address violence against women in many countries, 
including in its role as chair and co-chair of gender theme groups; and as partner or 
lead agency of United Nations country team programmes (including those dedicated 
to addressing violence against women under the Millennium Development Goals 
Achievement Fund in Bangladesh, Colombia and Morocco).  
</p>
<p>67. At the Headquarters level, UNIFEM continues to serve as founding and active 
member of United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict; the 
Inter-Agency Standing Committee Sub-Working Group on Gender and 
Humanitarian Response; the Task Force on Violence against Women, established 
within the Inter-Agency Network on Gender Equality (including as an implementing 
partner of the United Nations country team pilot programmes at the country levels); 
and as a member of the Working Group of the Secretary-General&#8217;s UNiTE campaign 
and the High-Level Steering Committee, chaired by the Deputy Secretary-General. 
At the regional level, for example, in addition to its key role in the roll-out of the 
Secretary-General&#8217;s UNiTE campaign, it also collaborates with UNDP, UNFPA and 
United Nations Volunteers in the Asia-Pacific Regional Joint Programme entitled 
&#8220;Partners for prevention: working with boys and men to prevent gender-based 
violence&#8221;.
