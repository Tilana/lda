<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report, submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 18/25, 
describes the activities of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in Cambodia from July 2011 to June 2012.  
</p>
<p>2. The OHCHR presence in Cambodia, mandated by the Commission on Human 
Rights in its resolution 1993/6, continued to provide assistance to the Government and to 
the people of Cambodia in promoting and respecting human rights. During the period under 
review, the OHCHR programme of cooperation with the Government, civil society and the 
development community continued to focus on five areas: support for prison reform; the 
protection of fundamental freedoms and the development of civil society; the protection of 
rights relating to land and housing; support for legal and judicial reform; and promoting the 
legacy of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia.  
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with its mandate, OHCHR continued to work with Government 
partners in a spirit of constructive dialogue and mutual respect. As the activities reflected in 
the present report demonstrate, OHCHR has proven to be a sound source of technical 
expertise on human rights issues that continue to pose some of the most difficult challenges 
faced by Cambodia. As much was further evidenced by the Government&#8217;s decision to 
</p>
<p>renew for two years, from 1 January 2012, its memorandum of understanding governing the 
provision of technical assistance by OHCHR. While the Office has favoured bilateral 
discussions with Government counterparts when raising difficult human right issues, in 
particular individual cases of human rights violations, on occasion it has raised concern 
publicly in accordance with the global mandate given to the High Commissioner. 
</p>
<p>4. The reporting period was notable for a number of reasons, one being the fact that 
cooperation between the Government and OHCHR has improved in a number of areas since 
the previous reporting period. This development is welcomed by OHCHR. Much of the 
cooperation outlined in the present report focuses on bridging the human rights knowledge 
and capacity gaps in government. The effectiveness of cooperation must, as ever, be judged 
in terms of its impact on the enjoyment of human rights by all in Cambodia.  
</p>
<p>5. The Office increased its individual case work during the reporting period, 
undertaking over 150 individual visits to investigate allegations of human rights violations 
in all provinces of the country. This work confirmed a number worrying trends, including:  
</p>
<p>(a) The persistence of a large number of disputes linked to land, and increasing 
violence on the part of communities protecting their land; 
</p>
<p>(b) Continuing impunity for serious human rights violations, and rapid arbitrary 
convictions of human rights defenders;  
</p>
<p>(c) A marked increase in the use of live ammunition by security forces against 
people seeking to claim their rights (in the first five months of 2012, OHCHR investigated 
five instances of injuries caused by live ammunition, two of which resulted in deaths: Chut 
Wutty, an environmentalist activist, in Koh Kong Province; and Heng Chantha, a 14-year 
old girl, in Kratie province). 
</p>
<p>6. Cambodia assumed the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) on 1 January 2012 and, with it, the responsibility for guiding the elaboration of 
an ASEAN human rights declaration. This resulted in increased national and international 
attention to human rights issues in the country, particularly during major ASEAN meetings 
held in Cambodia. Cambodia entered a two-year election period, with commune elections 
held in June 2012 and national elections scheduled for mid-2013. Although the commune 
elections were largely free of violence, credible allegations of irregularities were raised. </p>


<p>OHCHR focuses on the broader context in which elections are held, including freedom of 
expression and access to information. Such concerns are described in the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Prison reform 
</b></p>
<p>7. OHCHR continued to implement its programme of support for the prison reform 
efforts made by the Government. One important development was the promulgation of a 
new law on prisons in December 2011. OHCHR conducted a legal analysis of successive 
drafts of the law based on human rights standards, and shared it with the authorities. In 
October 2011, the Office also provided comments to parliamentarians as the draft law was 
tabled in the National Assembly. The promulgated law is a central piece of the reformed 
and strengthened prison system, and embeds in policy the approach taken by the 
Government towards prison reform over recent years. OHCHR provided similar technical 
assistance to the Ministry of the Interior on secondary legislation to be reviewed 
following the promulgation of the new law (for example, decrees on the status of prison 
staff, sentence reduction and pardon, and regulations on minimum design standards for 
prison construction). At the request of the General Department of Prisons, OHCHR 
prepared a standard presentation aimed at raising awareness among prison management 
of the provisions of the new law and its human rights implications.  
</p>
<p>8. OHCHR also updated, in close consultation with the International Labour 
Organization (ILO), a background paper on labour in prisons in Cambodia. The paper 
presents the relevant international legal framework, identifies gaps in the domestic legal 
framework and suggests possible ways forward. It was widely distributed at an inter-
ministerial consultation on prison labour jointly organized by OHCHR, ILO and the 
ministries of the Interior, Commerce, and Labour and Vocational Training, in March 2012. 
Following the consultation, the three ministries issued an inter-ministerial instruction 
banning all prison production for export. Past incidents of production for export in prisons 
had raised concerns that some of the country&#8217;s trade partners might prohibit the import of 
</p>
<p>products partly or wholly manufactured in prison. OHCHR, ILO and the Government were 
concerned that the right to work of thousands of Cambodian workers, in particular those 
engaged in the garment sector, was at risk. This clear ban is therefore an important step and 
OHCHR continues its dialogue with the authorities to seek opportunities for prisoners to 
work and learn new skills.  
</p>
<p>9. Throughout the year, the Office extended its support to the development of 
professional training for prison staff members by means of comprehensive capacity-
building efforts. It pursued its dialogue with the Ministry of the Interior and the General 
Department of Prisons to ensure an enabling environment, seeking in particular to ensure 
that the future revised royal decree on the separate status for prison staff includes clear 
provisions on prison staff training with regard to recruitment, appointment and promotion. 
Through a partnership with the training institute VBNK, OHCHR started a one-year 
training of trainers programme for a joint training team from the General Department of 
Prisons and the Centre for the Professional Training of Prison Guards of the Royal 
Academy of Police. Three one-week training of trainers workshops were held between 
October 2011 and May 2012, alternating with individual or group coaching sessions, 
organized for all participants to build on learning from the workshops. This programme 
focused on training skills and methodologies, including session planning, material 
preparation and training delivery and facilitation. In their evaluations, participants were 
very positive on their learning from the overall process. 
</p>
<p>10. In parallel, OHCHR continued its work to support the development of curriculum 
content for the future mandatory pre-service training for prison staff. It secured specialized 
expertise for the preparation of technical modules, including on health in prison (inclusive </p>


<p>of HIV and tuberculosis), in partnership with the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime, and in relation to mental health, stress management and conflict resolution in prison. 
In June 2012, OHCHR organized a further week-long session of training of trainers by an 
international expert on prison staff training engaged by the Office. The aim of the training 
was to help the trainers to clarify training objectives on the basis of the needs identified in 
the Cambodian prison system, and to develop by themselves training content for prison 
staff, in accordance with the domestic framework. As part of the preparation of training and 
reference material, the Office also conducted a review of its Khmer language version of the 
United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, and finalized for 
distribution a Khmer translation of the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women 
Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders.  
</p>
<p>11. OHCHR continued to have access to prison authorities, regular access to prisons and 
the ability to hold confidential interviews with prisoners. It remains one of only two in-
country organizations to be granted unfettered access to prisons to monitor general 
conditions and treatment or to follow up on individual requests, complaints or allegations of 
abuses or ill-treatment. OHCHR monitoring led to a number of follow-up activities to help 
to address the issues identified, including the enjoyment of both civil and political rights, as 
well as economic, social and cultural rights in prison. 
</p>
<p>12. The Office followed up on the nationwide census of prisoners pending appeal, which 
it had helped the prison authorities to carry out in early 2011. The data collected were 
analysed and shared with the authorities. In particular, lists were prepared, disaggregating 
the caseload according to a number of criteria (such as prisoners pending appeal for more 
than five, seven or ten years, old age and juvenile prisoners, and prisoners overstaying on 
appeal, namely still detained after the end of the first instance sentence, including prisoners 
acquitted at first instance), so that they could be prioritized for legal assistance and hearing 
at the Court of Appeal. 
</p>
<p>13. A particular area of focus during the year was disaster response and preparedness at 
the prison level. In common with several countries in the region, Cambodia was affected by 
severe flooding at the end of 2011 and prisons were not spared, most particularly in Siem 
Reap province. OHCHR prompt provided affected prisons assistance to help them to 
continue to ensure safe custody while preserving prisoners&#8217; rights, including the right to 
</p>
<p>safe drinking water and sanitation and, more generally, the right to humane treatment, 
including access to the outdoors. Relief support provided by OHCHR included sand and 
sandbags for flood dikes, pumps and fuel to evacuate flood water and chlorine tablets for 
safe drinking water, as well as hygiene and medical items to alleviate the impact on the 
health of staff and prisoners. Besides providing emergency assistance, OHCHR worked 
together with the prison directors and other relevant stakeholders on risk assessment and the 
identification of solutions for flood prevention and mitigation. Since prisoners cannot be 
easily relocated at times of natural disasters, more efforts should be made early on to 
prevent or mitigate the risks in the first place. OHCHR, the Ministry of the Interior and the 
National Committee for Disaster Management held a workshop to discuss flood and fire 
preparedness in July 2012.  
</p>
<p>14. OHCHR continued to promote the right of prisoners to health. Initiatives included 
ongoing advocacy with the authorities for the inclusion of compassionate medical grounds 
in the future royal decree on sentence reduction and pardon in the case of prisoners who are 
terminally ill or whose medical condition is otherwise so serious that they are unfit for 
detention and would no longer be a threat to society if released. Efforts also included 
continued support and advocacy to secure the availability of more hospital rooms so that 
prisoners in need of hospitalization may be hospitalized in such a way that their safe 
custody is ensured and their dignity respected. In 2012, OHCHR is providing the provincial </p>


<p>authorities in Banteay Meanchey with financial and technical support for the availability of 
such a secured room at the provincial referral hospital.  
</p>
<p>15. In the area of education, OHCHR cooperated with and provided financial support to 
the non-governmental organization Soutien &#224; l'initiative priv&#233;e pour l&#8217;aide &#224; la 
reconstruction des Pays du Sud-Est Asiatique to establish libraries in four prisons, a project 
that the organization will extend to 25 prisons nationwide over the next three years.  
</p>
<p>16. OHCHR maintained its focus on assisting the Government in implementing its 
human rights obligations pertaining to safe drinking water and sanitation in prisons. In this 
context, a major undertaking in the period 2011-2012 has been support for the complete 
overhaul of the water distribution network in Correctional Centre No 1,the country&#8217;s largest 
prison, (near Phnom Penh. Previous assessments had revealed shortages of water provided 
to prisoners owing to, inter alia, leakages in the distribution network, associated with a very 
high level of turbidity, which made the water inappropriate for human use. Thanks to 
support from OHCHR, the thousands of prisoners in the facility now have access to cleaner 
water throughout the prison for general use. In five other prisons (Kampong Thom, Oddar 
Meanchey, Kratie and Siem Reap prisons and Correctional Centre No 4), water supply 
support ranged from installing rainwater collection infrastructure to the provision of water 
storage facilities, the construction of a water tower and the distribution of water filters to 
ensure clean drinking water.  
</p>
<p>17. OHCHR continues to evaluate and improve other aspects of prison conditions, 
including by providing appropriate light and ventilation, and promoting more rational use 
of available space in cells (including in Stung Treng and Kratie prisons and Correctional 
Centres 1 and 2), access to the outdoors and to outdoor activities, such as farming or 
gardening (Kampong Speu and Stung Treng), and the preservation of family ties thanks to 
the renovation by the Office of a family visit area in Kratie prison.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Fundamental freedoms and civil society  
</b></p>
<p>18. The Fundamental Freedoms and Civil Society Programme is aimed at strengthening 
the capacity of both individuals and organizations to exercise their fundamental freedoms 
of expression, opinion, association and assembly. The Programme works with the 
Government, civil society, United Nations agencies, embassies and development actors to 
develop and monitor the implementation of legislation and policies that directly pertain to 
the exercise of these freedoms, including monitoring individual cases as they arise. It also 
focuses on capacity-building for both Government and the country&#8217;s vibrant civil society, a 
positive legacy of the Cambodia peace process. Non-governmental organizations continue 
to play a significant role in advocating for and driving social change, delivering social 
services across the country and monitoring the actions of the executive and the private 
sector.  
</p>
<p>19. Training for human rights defenders continued to account for a significant 
proportion of OHCHR work during the reporting period. The Fundamental Freedoms and 
Civil Society Programme provides training to increase the capacity of human rights 
defenders from across the country to monitor, document and report on human rights 
violations. In July, August and October 2011 and in June 2012, OHCHR conducted a series 
of training sessions on human rights monitoring and documentation for grass-roots human 
rights activists. The sessions were held in Kampot, Battambang, Kampong Cham and 
Sihanoukville, and engaged activists from all provinces. An additional session was 
conducted in Kampong Cham, in December 2011, for community activists and non-
governmental organizations focusing on international human rights mechanisms. In March 
2012, OHCHR conducted in Phnom Penh a training session on monitoring and </p>


<p>documenting human rights violations for activists defending the rights of persons with 
disabilities. Lastly, in June 2012, OHCHR, together with the Cambodia Human Rights 
Committee, the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association and the Samreth 
Law Group conducted a training session with members of the Cambodia Human Rights 
Committee, the Senate, the National Assembly and civil servants from the Anti-corruption 
and Anti-terrorism Units of the Government. In total, more than 170 human rights activists 
and 18 State officials benefitted from the training sessions.  
</p>
<p>20. Raising awareness of citizens&#8217; rights to assemble and express peacefully their views 
is also an important part of the OHCHR training programme. Together with the East-West 
Management Institute, the Office conducted training with human rights defenders from 
communities, non-governmental organizations and trade unions, on the Law on Peaceful 
Demonstrations and its implementation guide. Training was in Phnom Penh in November 
and December 2011, in Sihanoukville in December 2011, in Siem Reap in April 2012 and 
in Kratie in June 2012. In addition, in collaboration with the Cambodian Labour 
Confederation, OHCHR held a one-day workshop in Sihanoukville in December 2011, 
attended by more than 400 human rights activists and trade unionists. 
</p>
<p>21. The Office continued to cooperate with the Ministry of the Interior in raising 
awareness among civil servants on how to apply the Law on Peaceful Demonstrations in a 
manner consistent with the country&#8217;s international human rights obligations. Cooperation 
</p>
<p>included the finalization of a joint &#8220;training of trainers&#8221; manual, to be used in the training of 
civil servants at the subnational level during the upcoming reporting period. OHCHR noted 
a degree of uncertainty among civil servants working at the provincial and district levels 
with regard to the application of the law. This resulted in several activities planned by 
communities for the celebration of Human Rights Day in 2011, monitored by OHCHR, 
being disrupted or cancelled. Of further concern is the fact that, in certain instances, 
authorities continue to use instructions issued by the Ministry of the Interior prior to the 
entry into force of the law to prevent citizens from assembling peacefully to discuss 
politically contentious issues. OHCHR hopes that further dissemination of the law and its 
implementation guide with the Ministry of the Interior and the East-West Management 
Institute, as well as advocacy by OHCHR, will help to dispel any uncertainty surrounding 
the application of the Law.  
</p>
<p>22. Protecting and promoting the right of access to information and ensuring press 
freedom continue to be concerns in Cambodia. Despite early progress in assisting the 
Government to formulate an access to information law compliant with international human 
rights standards, OHCHR has had little to no involvement in the Government&#8217;s drafting 
process since 2007. At the time of reporting, a member of the opposition party had tabled a 
draft law that was being reviewed by the Parliament. At the same time, several key 
stakeholders from within and outside of Government continue to acknowledge that an 
independent press is an important cornerstone of democracy in Cambodia. OHCHR worked 
with several of these stakeholders (including journalists and journalist associations, United 
Nations entities, non-governmental organizations and donors) on ways to improve the 
professional ethics of journalists and the protection of their profession. This included 
participating in a community radio training initiative organized by the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Cambodian Centre 
for Independent Media, in Mondulkiri province, in October 2011. Again, in partnership 
with UNESCO, and together with seven national media and press associations, OHCHR 
commemorated World Press Freedom Day on 3 May 2012, focusing on the promotion of 
responsible journalism in Cambodia. The event was attended by representatives of the 
Government and United Nations agencies, and more than 130 journalists, media persons 
and university students.  </p>


<p>23. Despite the above-mentioned concerted efforts to engage in awareness-raising and 
skills training, the ability of individuals and groups to exercise fundamental freedoms 
peacefully continues to be challenged. Of particular concern is the general trend towards an 
increased and disproportionate use of force, including the use of live ammunition against 
protesters, by State authorities and private security guards as a means to control protesters. 
These instances of violence were predominantly unprovoked, and primarily related to land 
disputes. In addition, OHCHR noted at least one instance in which a protest relating to a 
labour dispute resulted in the disproportionate use of force, including the shooting of three 
protestors.1 
</p>
<p>24. The increase in the use of force in responding to the exercise of these freedoms has 
been accompanied by worrying trends in the use of the Penal Code. Cambodians continue 
to risk charges of incitement for exercising their right to freedom of expression. The 
widespread use of disinformation charges under the former criminal code has now been 
replaced by charging individuals with various crimes of incitement under the new code. 
Furthermore, in many cases, the courts did not appear to comply with the obligations set out 
under article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in proving an 
exception to the exercise of this right, nor did the convictions imposed by the courts appear 
to be necessary and proportionate when the facts of the cases are considered.  
</p>
<p>25. Further irregularities were noted in relation to other court cases involving the 
exercise of fundamental freedoms, the most recent of which resulted in the sentencing of 15 
land activists to a jail sentence of two years and six months after proceedings that took half 
a day and during which no defence witnesses were called. On 27 June 2012, the Court of 
Appeal upheld the sentence of the court of first instance, but suspended all but the time they 
had already spent in jail (one month and three days). 
</p>
<p>26. OHCHR notes that Cambodia accepted a number of recommendations made during 
its universal periodic review calling for a review of the Penal Code with a view to ensuring 
its compliance with the permissible limitations to freedom of expression as defined in the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p>27. In addition to monitoring both demonstrations and the courts, OHCHR continued to 
monitor the Prey Speu Social Affairs Centre on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. Serious 
concerns remain concerning the detention and conditions of detention of individuals, 
including children, mentally ill persons, homeless persons and people living with HIV in 
social affairs centres, such as Prey Speu, without judicial supervision. OHCHR notes with 
satisfaction that, since January 2012, the Prey Speu Centre has not been used to house 
people detained arbitrarily in the streets of Phnom Penh. Nonetheless, the arbitrary 
detention of people living on the street, including children, remains a concern, especially in 
the periods preceding major international meetings in Phnom Penh, for example ASEAN 
events.  
</p>
<p>28. In December 2011, the Government issued its fourth draft of the law on associations 
and non-governmental organizations. OHCHR provided the Government with comments on 
the compatibility of the draft law with the State&#8217;s human rights obligations, and continued 
to stress the importance of ensuring broad and meaningful consultations with civil society 
actors prior to the enactment of the law. The Government consequently convened a half-
day consultation with civil society actors on 15 December 2011. The law is yet to be 
adopted, while further consultations with representatives of civil society are planned, a 
</p>
<p>  
 1 On 20 February 2012, during a protest by 1,800 workers of Kaoway Sports factory in Bavet district, 
</p>
<p>Svay Rieng province, three female workers were shot. The Mayor of Bavet has been charged in 
relation to the shootings.  </p>


<p>welcome sign of the Government&#8217;s willingness to take into account the concerns of civil 
</p>
<p>society.  </p>
<p><b> IV. Land and housing rights 
</b></p>
<p>29. The Land and Housing Rights Programme works with all stakeholders to monitor, 
promote and implement the right to adequate housing and an adequate standard of living, 
prevent forced eviction and realize security of tenure. The Programme intervenes in the 
event of threats to or harassment or criminalization of communities and individuals 
claiming their rights to land and housing, and of human rights defenders in the land sector. 
OHCHR works with the Government, civil society organizations, communities, business 
enterprises, professional associations and multilateral and bilateral development actors to 
strengthen the legal framework protecting land use, ownership and housing rights, and 
improve its implementation.  
</p>
<p>30. OHCHR conducts its activities in a context of widespread land disputes, persistent 
land grabbing by powerful individuals or groups (often with the collusion of the State and 
complicity of both domestic and foreign business enterprises), economic land concessions 
for agro-industrial purposes (such as rubber, sugar and cassava plantations), land 
concessions for the exploitation of natural resources (including in protected areas), such as 
for mining and oil extraction and to attract tourism, infrastructure upgrades and industrial 
power generation (such as hydropower dams), urban development and renewal 
characterized by forced evictions and unplanned resettlement.  
</p>
<p>31. During the reporting period, OHCHR was called upon to assist in 63 land disputes 
between affected communities, authorities and businesses, 37 of which related to economic 
and other types of land concessions, including 11 on indigenous land.2 A total of 26 were 
related to other land transactions (one on indigenous land).3 OHCHR interventions involved 
facilitation of dialogue and legal and procedural advice.  
</p>
<p>  
 2 The cases include, but were not limited to, the following: in Mondulkiri province, Pichreada district, 
</p>
<p>Bousra commune, a dispute between 800 families of the Phnong indigenous community and the 
company Socfin-KCD and partners; in Kratie province, Snoul district, Sre Char commune, a dispute 
between 224 families and the CIV Development Company; in Ratanakiri province, Lumphat district, 
Seda commune, a dispute between approximately 500 families of the Tumpoun indigenous 
community and the Jing Zhong Ri company; in Kratie province, Snoul district, Pi Thnu commune, a 
dispute between approximately 600 families and the company TTY; in Koh Kong province, Kiri 
Sakor and Botum Sakor districts, a dispute between approximately 1,000 families and the Union 
Development Group; in Kampong Speu province, Tpong district, Amleang commune, a dispute 
between 1,000 families and the Phnom Penh Sugar Company and the Kampong Speu Sugar 
Company; in Pursat province, Kravahn and Krakor districts, two disputes between 5,000 families and 
the Pheapimex company, and in Veal Veng district, Thmar Da commune, a dispute between 57 
families and the MDS company; in the city of Phnom Penh, Boeung Kak Lake community, a dispute 
between 3,000-4,000 families and Shukaku Inc.; and in Battambang province, Phnom Prek district, 
Sampov Loun commune, a dispute between 1,203 families and the Soun Mean Sambath company. 
</p>
<p> 3 The cases include, but were not limited to, the following: in Ratanakiri province, Oyada district, Pate 
commune, Kong Yuk village, a dispute between 46 families of the Charay indigenous community and 
the wife of a Government official; in Kandal province, Kean Svay district, Samrong commune, a 
dispute between 149 families and the deputy governor of Kratie province; in Kampong Chhnang 
province, Kampong Tralach district, Taches commune, Lorpeang village, a dispute between 64 
families and the KDC International Company; in Kampong Speu province, Oudong district, Damnang 
Raing and Phnom Touch villages (border of Kandal), a dispute between 88 families and the Meng 
Keth Company; in Battambang province, Battambang town, a dispute between 55 families and the 
Asian Development Bank Railway Rehabilitation Project, in Prek Preah Sdach village, a dispute 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>32. OHCHR closely monitors the impact, from a human rights perspective, of the 
Government&#8217;s granting and management of economic and other land concessions. Cases of 
</p>
<p>focus included concessions granted within protected areas, such as national parks, wildlife 
sanctuaries, protected forests and areas inhabited by indigenous peoples. On 7 May 2012, 
the Prime Minister issued a regulation imposing a moratorium on the issuance of new 
economic land concessions and greater scrutiny of existing land concessions with a view to 
protect the interests of communities, a development welcomed by OHCHR. Nevertheless, 
the procedures for implementation of the regulation have been unclear and are, in some 
cases, prone to irregularities.  
</p>
<p>33. Owing to the uneven application of the relatively well-developed legal framework 
governing land and housing rights, demonstrations and protests by affected communities in 
the capital and provinces became increasingly common during the reporting period. 
Although peaceful forms of protest and solidarity continued, the increasing use of tactics 
such as public nudity, the burning of effigies, the blocking of main roads, the destruction of 
company property, the seizure of illicit timber, violent confrontations with authorities and 
business actors (including one instance of hostage-taking) and the chaining together of 
protestors, reflected the increasing frustration of the landless population.  
</p>
<p>34. OHCHR repeatedly intervened to monitor demonstrations and protests with a view 
to prevent violence, and to secure the release of persons wrongfully accused or arbitrarily 
detained as a result. Of the 63 land disputes in which OHCHR was involved, the Office is 
aware of 182 people who were questioned by the court (some incidents pertained to long-
standing land dispute cases), mostly on charges of disinformation, the obstruction of public 
officials with aggravated circumstances, illegal possession of unmovable property (land) 
belonging to public legal entity (the State), destruction of property and encroachment on 
forest land. In some cases, the charges were pending in the court and cases were 
continuously reactivated, while in others, people were detained. OHCHR advocated the 
application of due process of law, which, in certain cases, resulted in the release of 
individuals.  
</p>
<p>35. Women, the elderly and children are often on the front line at protests because 
communities surmise that such categories are less likely to be targeted by the authorities. 
There have, however, been increased cases of violence against women in the context of 
demonstrations and of arbitrary detention of female protesters. Women continue to suffer 
disproportionately in eviction and relocation processes, which have a heavy impact on 
family livelihoods and domestic responsibilities. Domestic violence at resettlement sites is 
reportedly widespread, as is unplanned parenthood. 
</p>
<p>36. OHCHR works to assist in the further development of procedural and legal 
safeguards, as well as to promote their implementation. In early 2010, the Government 
released a draft housing policy, which is still awaiting approval by the Council of Ministers. 
OHCHR stands ready to support the implementation of the policy with the Ministry of 
Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction. OHCHR provided comments on 
</p>
<p>  
between 1,000 families and provincial authorities (garden project); in Samlot district, Kampong Lpov 
commune, a dispute between 78 families and a military operation in region 5, and in Kos Krolor 
district, Daun Bar and Preah Phos communes (three cases), a dispute between 550 families and 
multiple military personnel; in Banteay Meanchey province, Poipet town, a dispute between 943 
families and the Asian Development Bank Railway Rehabilitation Project; in Phnom Penh city, Borei 
Keila community, a dispute between 1,776 families and the Phan Imex Company, and in Trapeang 
Anchang community, a dispute between 148 families and local authorities involving the Asian 
Development Bank Railway Rehabilitation Project. 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p>incorporating a human rights perspective into a draft sub-decree on urbanization to the 
Ministry, and plans to take part in further consultations.  
</p>
<p>37. OHCHR continues to incorporate general principles on business and human rights 
into its Land and Housing Rights Programme, and advocates for State responsibility in 
relation to human rights abuses by third parties. In addition, OHCHR works with selected 
businesses and professional associations to encourage them to apply human rights standards 
to their activities. In December 2011, OHCHR launched a version in English and Khmer of 
the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations 
&#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework.4 During the reporting period, OHCHR 
conducted training workshops for civil society organizations (including a briefing to 
regional organizations at the ASEAN People&#8217;s Forum), technical staff members of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, the Cambodia Human Rights Committee and members of Government 
ministries on business and human rights (including differentiating it from corporate social 
responsibility) and the application of the above-mentioned Guiding Principles on Business 
and Human Rights to the Cambodian context. 
</p>
<p>38. In May 2010, following the Government&#8217;s adoption of a circular on the resolution of 
temporary settlements on illegally occupied land in urban areas, OHCHR began to support 
technical assistance efforts for communities to map their territorial boundaries and basic 
services and infrastructure needs, and to understand their tenure rights in the Cambodian 
legal framework. During the reporting period, OHCHR continued to work with the 
authorities, communities and development partners in Battambang Municipality to ensure 
on-site upgrading and security of tenure. 
</p>
<p>39. To help to protect the traditional livelihoods and culture of indigenous peoples, 
OHCHR supports networks of Government, United Nations organizations, civil society and 
communities to strengthen their capacity to use the domestic legal framework with regard 
to communal land title. OHCHR provided financial and institutional support to seven 
villages inhabited by the Phnong indigenous peoples in Bousra commune, Mondulkiri 
province, and five villages inhabited by the Suoy indigenous peoples in Aoral district, 
Kampong Speu province, undergoing registration as legal entities with the Government, to 
enable them to apply for collective land titles in the future. OHCHR also monitors a project 
whereby more than 800 Phnong families and 238 Suoy families protect themselves against 
the threat of economic and other types of land concessions, in cooperation with 
Government ministries, ILO and non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>40. Despite significant gains in registering indigenous communities for communal land 
title, the exploitation of the land inhabited by indigenous peoples, including the granting of 
land concessions, has outpaced the establishment of security of tenure for most 
communities. OHCHR welcomes the issuance of communal land titles to three indigenous 
communities in Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri provinces, in December 2011.This significant 
development demonstrated the commitment to upholding the rights of indigenous peoples 
to land. Nevertheless, the lack of implementation of interim protective measures for those 
communities, which are in the process of registration (a lengthy and complex legal process 
dependent on donor resources), puts indigenous communities at particular risk of land 
grabbing and of losing their livelihoods owing to land concessions and other development 
projects. 
</p>
<p>41. In the case of forcibly evicted communities, OHCHR continues to advocate for 
planned resettlement, rather than the current practices of relocating communities to sites 
lacking basic infrastructure and distant from livelihood opportunities, schools and health 
</p>
<p>  
 4 See A/HRC/17/31. </p>


<p>clinics. OHCHR continues to monitor multiple resettlement sites included in an internal 
study entitled &#8220;Eviction and resettlement in Cambodia: human costs, impacts and 
solutions&#8221;, in which the Office examines several examples of evictions and relocation, both 
positive and negative, and analyses their impact on the living conditions of affected 
families. The study was shared with the Government for comment; input was received from 
the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Reconstruction. OHCHR also 
monitors the Rehabilitation of the Railway Project in cooperation with the authorities, the 
Asian Development Bank and the communities concerned.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Rule of law 
</b></p>
<p>42. Progress on legal and judicial reform was slow during the reporting period. The 
Ministry of Justice and the courts continued to suffer from a serious lack of resources. 
Respect for the rule of law was also hampered by ongoing credible allegations of 
interference by the executive in the court system, and of widespread corruption. As a result, 
impunity for serious human rights violations continued, and public confidence in the 
criminal justice system did not improve. Despite indications early in 2012 to the contrary, 
the process of adoption of the fundamental laws envisaged in the Constitution of 1993 
(namely the Law on the Functioning and Organization of the Courts, the Law on Statute of 
Judges and Prosecutors and the Law on the Functioning and Organization of the Supreme 
Council of the Magistracy) remained stalled, for reasons that are unclear. OHCHR remains 
of the view that the administration of justice in Cambodia will improve only when these 
laws in place. 
</p>
<p>43. Despite these challenges, the OHCHR Rule of Law Programme has continued to 
assist the authorities, lawyers and non-governmental organizations in their efforts to 
improve the protection of human rights in Cambodia through the legal system. 
</p>
<p>44. OHCHR plays an important role in strengthening the rule of law by encouraging the 
ratification of international human rights instruments. To this end, the Rule of Law 
Programme continued to provide advice to the Government, which announced its intention 
to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In order to raise 
awareness about the Convention, especially among persons with disabilities, OHCHR 
published simplified and audio versions of the Convention. OHCHR has also given several 
presentations on the Convention to civil society actors.  
</p>
<p>45. Given that the issue of the protection of Cambodian migrant workers abroad has 
attracted much attention over the past year, the Rule of Law Programme had the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families translated into Khmer. The publication was launched in March 
2012 during an event organized in cooperation with the United Nations Entity for Gender 
Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) and chaired by the Minister for 
Women&#8217;s Affairs. The event was attended by a wide range of stakeholders, including 
</p>
<p>Government officials, representatives of civil society, recruitment agencies and trade 
unions, and journalists. A member of the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families also participated. Following the event, 
the authorities indicated that interministerial discussions would be held on the possibility of 
Cambodia ratifying the Convention. Lastly, the Rule of Law Programme encouraged the 
Government to consider the ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerning the abolition of the death penalty, in line 
with universal periodic review recommendations. At the request of the Government, 
OHCHR organized a technical briefing of Government officials on the provisions of the 
First and Second Optional Protocol to the Covenant, and the Third Optional Protocol to the 
convention on the Rights of the Child. </p>


<p>46. OHCHR continued to encourage the implementation of existing national laws in 
accordance with human rights standards, focusing on the Code of Criminal Procedure 
(2007). To that end, the members of the Rule of Law Programme meet regularly with court 
presidents and chief prosecutors in the provinces to discuss the challenges faced in applying 
the Code and in the administration of justice in general. Several judicial round tables were 
also organized in the provinces to discuss these challenges using, where appropriate, 
examples from the practice of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. In 
parallel, OHCHR supported regular meetings between the police, the courts and the prisons 
in the north-western provinces to improve cooperation in the criminal justice system and to 
discuss issues relating to the implementation of the Code. In order to increase public 
scrutiny of criminal trials, OHCHR supported trial monitoring in two provincial courts by 
the Cambodian Centre for Human Rights. Lastly, OHCHR, in cooperation with the 
Ministry of Justice, organized a major national review conference on the implementation of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure at the end of June 2012, which was attended by 165 judges 
as well as prosecutors, judicial police officers, lawyers, Government officials and non-
governmental organization representatives from all provinces.  
</p>
<p>47. Besides monitoring the implementation of existing laws, OHCHR continues to assist 
the Government in adopting new laws in accordance with the State&#8217;s human rights 
obligations. The comments made on the draft Juvenile Justice Law, in consultation with 
UNICEF, is one example of this activity.  
</p>
<p>48. OHCHR remains concerned about access to justice, especially for the poor and other 
vulnerable groups. Legal aid services continued to suffer from a serious lack of funding. 
While the Code of Criminal Procedure requires that all persons charged with a felony and 
all juveniles be represented by a lawyer, legal representation is not always available. 
OHCHR formed a partnership with Avocats sans Fronti&#232;res with the aim of providing legal 
aid to poor defendants across Cambodia. In parallel, OHCHR continued to organize 
training for women&#8217;s non-governmental organizations in the provinces on the use of the 
individual communications procedure under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Training sessions were 
organized in cooperation with UN-Women. OHCHR also produced a leaflet explaining 
how to use the above-mentioned procedure. 
</p>
<p>49. Lawyers have a crucial contribution to make to secure access to justice. The Rule of 
Law Programme continued to assist the Bar Association in its efforts to improve standards 
in the legal profession. OHCHR engaged a consultant to review the Law on the Bar, the 
Code of Professional Conduct and the Bar&#8217;s internal rules from the perspective of 
international human rights standards, as well as to draft a new operational manual for the 
Bar. The four documents were circulated to all members of the Bar Association and posted 
on its website for comments. In addition, the Programme organized a series of meetings for 
the Bar Council to discuss the proposed changes to the Code of Professional Conduct and to 
finalize the text for adoption. Moreover, OHCHR recently recruited a legal advocacy 
officer, whose role is to assist lawyers in making human rights-based arguments before the 
courts and pursuing strategic litigation. 
</p>
<p>50. Assisting national authorities to investigate instances of ill-treatment in places of 
detention remained a priority. OHCHR continued to investigate allegations of ill-treatment 
in places of detention and to engage in dialogue with the authorities. In addition, OHCHR 
increased its efforts to help to prevent torture and ill-treatment. Firstly, given that Cambodia 
is a party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which requires the establishment of a 
national preventive mechanism, OHCHR continued to provide the Government technical 
assistance in this regard. A conference on the establishment of such a mechanism, held in 
November 2011, was attended by two members of the Subcommittee on the Prevention of </p>


<p>Torture who provided advice to the authorities. The Government has since pledged to draft 
a new law to establish a preventive mechanism.  
</p>
<p>51. Secondly, OHCHR continued to provide support to the interministerial committee 
established as a precursor to the creation of a national preventive mechanism. In particular, 
training was provided to members of the committee and its secretariat on how to conduct 
preventive visits to places of detention. Their mandate was presented and explained to all 
provincial heads of police and gendarmerie and all prison chiefs at a national conference at 
the Ministry of the Interior, in December 2011. The committee subsequently started a 
programme of visits to several prisons. In addition, OHCHR continued to provide support 
to the Office of the Prosecutor General to conduct visits to places of detention, 
accompanying the Prosecutor General on one such visit.  
</p>
<p>52. Thirdly, the Rule of Law Programme started a series of training sessions in the 
provinces, in cooperation with chief prosecutors, for police and gendarmerie officers on the 
prevention, investigation and prosecution of acts of torture and ill-treatment. Lastly, since 
the Code of Criminal Procedure guarantees access to a lawyer only after 24 hours of police 
custody, and considering that most instances of police brutality occur within that time, 
OHCHR developed, in cooperation with the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of 
Justice, an arrest rights card to inform persons arrested of their rights. The card will be 
distributed at police stations across the country. 
</p>
<p>53. Fair trial standards require that appeals be decided within a reasonable time. Many 
prisoners wait for excessive periods for their appeals to be heard. The Code of Criminal 
Procedure allows for prisoners to be detained even after the end of their sentence, when the 
appeal lodged by the prosecutor is still pending. OHCHR is currently working closely with 
the Court of Appeal to reduce the backlog of pending cases. As a first step, data on pending 
appeal cases collected in 2011 by the prisons are being cross-checked against the 
information available at the Court of Appeal and courts of first instance. In parallel, 
OHCHR and the President of the Court of Appeal will jointly convene a workshop in 
August 2012 to discuss increased cooperation between the courts and prison authorities to 
improve and expedite the appeal process. The new Court of Appeal building, built after a 
proposal of OHCHR (and with financial support from the Government of Australia and 
OHCHR), was completed during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p>54. The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia continued to make 
significant progress towards the completion of its first two cases. The Court&#8217;s chamber of 
final appeal issued its judgement in the case of Kaing Guek Eav alias &#8216;Duch&#8217; (case 001) in 
March 2012, sentencing Duch to life imprisonment. The Trial Chamber also made progress 
in case 002, in which three former leaders of the Communist Party of Kampuchea were 
being tried. 
</p>
<p>55. Despite general praise for the final verdict in case 001, OHCHR is concerned to note 
that a majority of judges reversed an important human rights aspect of the Trial Chamber&#8217;s 
decision, namely, to grant Duch a five-year deduction in his sentence as compensation for 
the prolonged period he had spent in pretrial detention. The Trial Chamber&#8217;s determinations 
on this issue could have served as an important example for the national sector of a 
Cambodian court safeguarding the right to a trial without undue delay, regardless of the 
crimes charged or the person convicted.  
</p>
<p>56. Furthermore, allegations of political interference and judicial misconduct with 
regard to two additional cases continued to mar the Court&#8217;s institutional reputation and to 
jeopardize the credibility of its ongoing investigations. The deterioration in the institutional 
reputation of the Extraordinary Chambers was further exacerbated by a lack of support 
from Member States in continuing to fund the Court, putting significant pressure on the 
institution&#8217;s national and international staff to fulfil the Court&#8217;s mandate using limited </p>


<p>resources, and temporarily halting the Court&#8217;s legacy activities as outlined in its budget for 
2012-2013.  
</p>
<p>57. The above-mentioned developments made it more challenging for OHCHR to 
conduct its programme of promoting the legacy of the Extraordinary Chambers in the 
Courts of Cambodia. Significant parts of the programme did, however, continue to flourish. 
In particular, increased cooperation between OHCHR and the Ministry of Justice led to a 
series of judicial round tables held jointly with five provincial courts, judges, prosecutors 
and lawyers from 14 of the country&#8217;s 24 provinces attending the meetings. The primary 
purpose of the discussions was to consider lessons learned from the experience of the 
Extraordinary Chambers in the domestic criminal justice context, as well as broader issues 
of concern. The meetings were an important space for discussion of several matters of law 
on which the internal rules and decisions of the Extraordinary Chambers provide examples 
of the application of fair trial rights, in particular the provisions on pretrial detention and 
rules of evidence and procedure. In addition, ongoing work on a Code of Criminal 
Procedure annotated with the jurisprudence of the Extraordinary Chambers will ensure that 
lessons are learned for future generations of judges, prosecutors and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>58. In keeping with the commitment of OHCHR to support awareness-raising about 
gender-based violence globally, OHCHR Cambodia is a member of the Advisory 
Committee for the Women&#8217;s Hearings on Gender-based Violence during the Khmer Rouge 
Period, an initiative of the Cambodian Defender&#8217;s Project. The hearings, the first of which 
was held in December 2011, provided an avenue for greater documentation of and 
discussion about gender-based violence committed during the period of Democratic 
Kampuchea, bearing in mind the limited extent to which this has formed, and will form, 
part of the evidence heard at the Extraordinary Chambers. OHCHR is working on this 
initiative with UN-Women, the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on Sexual Violence in Conflict and with civil society. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Public information and human rights education 
</b></p>
<p>59. The OHCHR communications programme promotes human rights awareness and 
education among a diverse group of stakeholders across Cambodia. The programme uses 
various communication approaches and tools to broaden public understanding of human 
rights, and partners with civil society organizations, United Nations entities, Government 
offices and academic institutions.  
</p>
<p>60. A primary focus of the work of OHCHR work has been the dissemination of print 
materials to raise awareness of human rights. OHCHR delivered more than 10,000 books 
and other informative materials to 45 State-run and private universities in 12 provinces, 
including teacher training centres, military and police academies, a Buddhist institution, 
and schools offering courses in law, business and the humanities. Human rights materials 
were also displayed at Government offices. In addition, more than 30,000 copies of human 
rights publications were disseminated to various institutions across Cambodia through the 
Office&#8217;s extensive training and awareness-raising activities; some 16,000 stickers and 40 
posters were distributed during the Human Rights Day activities in December 2011. 
</p>
<p>61. OHCHR also engages with the media to promote human rights. In its efforts to 
promote awareness of indigenous rights, OHCHR coordinated a segment of the &#8220;Equity 
Weekly&#8221; television programme of the United Nations Development Programme, broadcast 
</p>
<p>on a local network provider, pertaining to indigenous issues and World Indigenous Day 
celebrations. Radio broadcasts were also utilized as a medium to promote human rights 
messages on Human Rights Day. Together with the United Nations Population Fund, the 
Office held provincial screenings of short films on human rights and reproductive rights. </p>


<p>Lastly, in conjunction with other United Nations agencies and civil society organizations, 
OHCHR celebrated key international events, including the 16 Days of Activism against 
Gender Violence Campaign, World Habitat Day, International Women&#8217;s Day, World 
</p>
<p>Indigenous People&#8217;s Day, World Press Freedom Day and the International Day in Support 
of Victims of Torture by co-organizing public forums, film projections and press 
conferences, and printing information and advocacy materials, including opinion columns 
in major newspapers. 
</p>
<p>62. Liaising with the media and promoting press engagement on human rights issues is 
another core part of the Office&#8217;s work. In addition to holding coffee briefings for the press 
and supporting the missions of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in 
Cambodia, OHCHR piloted a training programme for 24 local media practitioners on 
human rights standards in journalism in October 2011. In 2011/12, financial grant support 
was focused on children&#8217;s rights. A grant provided to the local non-governmental 
organization Mith Samlanh (&#8220;Friends&#8221;) saw 180 street children and young people gaining a 
better understanding of their basic rights through interactive classroom discussions that 
culminated in art work and a public performance. Financial support was also provided to 
the association Pour un Sourire d&#8217;Enfant to produce videos to raise awareness of sexual 
abuse, domestic violence and slavery, which to date have been screened before more than 
3,200 students from institutions and public schools supported by the association.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Reporting and follow-up  
</b></p>
<p>63. Cambodia continued to evince its strong treaty ratification record. The Government 
committed to the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
by the end of 2012. OHCHR continued to assist Cambodia in complying with its periodic 
reporting obligations under the treaties to which it is a party. The State&#8217;s last outstanding 
report under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is expected to be 
submitted later in 2012. Although the Government has taken steps to implement the report 
of the 2009 visit to Cambodia by the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture, the report 
itself remains confidential. OHCHR urges the Government to make that report public. 
</p>
<p>64. The reporting period witnessed significant developments in the Government&#8217;s 
follow-up to the 91 universal periodic review recommendations accepted by Cambodia in 
December 2009. In July 2011, OHCHR, together with the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland, Sweden and the European Union, supported the Cambodian Human 
Rights Committee in convening a meeting between civil society and ministries to formulate 
a basic framework and plan of action to implement the above-mentioned recommendations. 
This was the first meeting between a broad spectrum of civil society representatives and the 
Government on human rights issues for some years. Participants in the meeting heard from 
a representative of the Human Rights Commission of Malaysian, Suhakam, on that 
country&#8217;s experience in implementing universal periodic review recommendations. The 
</p>
<p>Office worked closely with the Cambodian Human Rights Committee in the preparation of 
plans of action for each ministry, describing how the Government can implement the 
recommendations before Cambodia is considered for the second cycle of the review. 
During the reporting period, OHCHR supported the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in Cambodia during his two missions to the country.5  
</p>
<p>  
 5 A/HRC/21/63 and Add.1. </p>


<p><b> VIII. Staffing  
</b></p>
<p>65. OHCHR maintains a head office in Phnom Penh and a regional office in 
Battambang, with 8 international staff positions, one international United Nations 
Volunteer, 32 national staff and 3 contractual service staff members. Staffing increased by 
four posts during the reporting period.
