<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the right to education, Vernor Mu&#241;oz Villalobos, made an 
official visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina from 24 September to 2 October 2007, invited by the 
Government. He visited Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Mostar, Zenica, Vitez and Prijedor. During his 
visit, the Special Rapporteur had more than 40 different meetings with Government 
representatives in both entities (Republika Srpska and the Federation of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina) and with professors, teachers, parents, trade unions and civil society 
representatives. The Special Rapporteur extends his gratitude to the Government of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina for the invitation and to those whom he met in the course of his visit. 
</p>
<p> The education system in Bosnia and Herzegovina is highly fragmented; there are 
14 ministries of education, as competencies on education have been devolved to the two entities 
and the District of Br&#269;ko. The Framework Law on Primary and Secondary Education and the 
Framework Law on Higher Education form the cornerstone of the legal standards for education. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur analyses the obligations of the State with regard to the enjoyment 
of the right to education using four criteria: availability, accessibility, acceptability and 
adaptability. The Special Rapporteur then comments on two main issues that he identified as 
affecting the enjoyment of the right to education in Bosnia and Herzegovina: the excessive 
fragmentation and politicization of the education system; and the segregation between ethnic 
groups and assimilation processes based on ethnic motives.  
</p>
<p> Finally, the Special Rapporteur makes recommendations addressed to the central 
Government, entity and cantonal authorities as well as to the international community, donor 
countries and institutions and civil society organizations. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The declaration of independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the Socialist Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia in April 1992 was followed by a three-year-long armed conflict. The 
General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Dayton Peace Agreement) 
signed in Paris on 14 December 1995,<b>1</b> ended the war, retained Bosnia and Herzegovina within 
its internationally recognized borders and set up its constitutional framework.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>2. Bosnia and Herzegovina is home to people of different ethnic, religious and cultural 
backgrounds, including Bosniaks, Serbs, Croats, Roma and Jews. It consists of two entities - the 
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska - each with its own 
Government, President, Parliament and various administrative bodies. In addition, the District of 
Brcko is a self-governing administrative unit.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p>3. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a parliamentary democracy, with a bicameral parliament 
consisting of the House of Representatives (42 members) and House of Peoples (15 members: 
5 Bosniaks, 5 Serbs and 5 Croats). It has a rotating three-member Presidency and members are 
directly elected from the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnian and Croat members) 
and Republika Srpska (Serbian members). The Presidency appoints the Chairperson of the 
Council of Ministers, who in turn appoints other ministers. These appointments, however, must 
be approved by the House of Representatives. 
</p>
<p>4. The Dayton Peace Agreement also established the Office of the High Representative, 
which is responsible for overseeing implementation of civilian aspects of the Agreement.<b>4</b> The 
High Representative is now also the European Union Special Representative. In February 2007, 
the Peace Implementation Council decided to postpone the closure of the Office of the High 
Representative until June 2008, a decision to be reviewed later in 2008.<b>5</b>

</b>  In accordance with the Final Award (1998), the territory of the District belongs simultaneously

</p>
<p>5. Even though annex 6 (on human rights) to the Dayton Peace Agreement sets forth the 
direct applicability of 15 international human rights instruments<b>6</b> and the Constitution of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina provides for the direct application of the rights and freedoms set forth in the 
European Convention on Human Rights, which have priority over all other law,<b>7</b> the complex 
constitutional and administrative framework is often an impediment for the implementation of 
international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>6. Depending on how the 1 State, 2 entities, 1 autonomous district and 10 cantons are 
counted, Bosnia is divided into 3, 4 or 14 territorial jurisdictions with separate sets of laws. This 
fragmentation often represents a major obstacle for the effective protection of human rights of all 
citizens in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which will be further discussed in section III. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  GENERAL VIEW OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  National legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina establishes that all persons within its territory 
shall enjoy the human rights and fundamental freedoms set forth in the European Convention for 
the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its Protocols.<b>8</b> The Constitution

</p>
<p>also makes an enumeration of rights, which includes the right to education.<b>9</b> Both entities also 
have a provision in their Constitutions establishing the obligation to ensure the highest level of 
internationally recognized human rights, including the right to education.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>8. The education system in Bosnia and Herzegovina is highly fragmented; there 
are 14 ministries of education.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>9. Responsibilities for education, as distinct from the human right to education, have been 
completely devolved to the entities. This is the result of a combination of dispositions of the 
Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and the Constitution of the Republika Srpska.<b>12</b> Education is managed by entities 
according to their political organization; thus, in the Republika Srpska, authority is concentrated 
in the entity&#8217;s Ministry of Education and Culture, with a reduced participation of 
municipalities;<b>13</b> in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, education is the responsibility of 
each of its 10 cantons, with a limited participation of the entity government - Federal Ministry of 
Education and Science.<b>14</b> Education responsibilities in the Federation of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, may be further devolved from cantons to municipalities, in cases where the 
majority of the population of the municipality is other than that of the canton as a whole.<b>15</b> 
Moreover, education is independently governed by the District of Br&#269;ko.

</b>  Article II.2 of the Constitution of FBiH states that the Federation will ensure the application 
</p>
<p>of the highest level of internationally recognized rights and freedoms provided in the documents 
listed in the Annex to the Constitution, including the right to education (literal m). The 
Constitution of RS provides that the constitutional arrangement of the Republic shall be based 
upon, among others, the guarantee and protection of human freedoms and rights in accordance 
with international standards. In addition, article 38 consecrates the right to education. 
<b>11
</b></p>
<p>  This includes 10 cantonal Ministries, 2 Entities&#8217; Ministries, the State level Ministry of Civil 
Affairs and the Head of the Education Department of Br&#269;ko.

<p>  Article III of the Constitution of BiH which gives an extensive list of the competencies of the 
State of BiH, where education is not included; article II.3 (a) which states that all powers and

</p>
<p>10. The State Government has a very limited role to play in education policies in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. The Ministry of Civil Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of the 
legislation establishing its responsibility for coordinating activities and harmonizing plans of the 
entity authorities and defining a strategy at the international level in the field of education,<b>16</b> does 
not have substantive responsibilities in education, nor the authority vis-&#224;-vis the cantons required 
to carry out its legal obligations.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1. Framework Law on Primary and Secondary  
Education in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Framework Law on Primary and Secondary Education was adopted by the State 
Parliament, on 30 June 2003, as a result of the pressure exerted by the international community, 
in particular the Council of Europe. The adoption of this law was one of the commitments made 
by Bosnia and Herzegovina upon its accession to the Council of Europe in 2002.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>12. The Law regulates the principles of preschool, elementary and secondary education and 
enshrines the obligations of education authorities, including those of both entities and the District 
of Br&#269;ko, to ensure educational services under equal conditions for all students. According to the 
Law, the purpose of education is to contribute to the creation of a society based on the rule of 
law and respect of human rights through the optimum intellectual, physical and social 
development of the individual, according to each one&#8217;s potential and abilities. Furthermore, it 
provides that all public primary schools are to have assigned catchment areas from which pupils 
are drawn. These areas are designed to ensure that all children can attend schools in their 
neighbourhoods and to curtail the practice of sending children to schools based on ethnic criteria. 
</p>
<p>13. The Law establishes the principle of compulsory primary education, duration of which will 
be increased to nine years throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
</p>
<p>14. The Law also establishes a common core curriculum for all public and private schools. 
This common core curriculum consists of the curricula and syllabi of all subjects of primary and 
secondary education that have an agreed common core as broad as possible. According to the 
Law, common core curriculum should be developed by a temporary ad hoc body whose 
members are appointed by the 13 ministers for education and the District of Br&#269;ko. Such a 
curriculum should, among other principles, ensure that positive relations and a feeling of 
commitment to the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina are developed through the educational 
process. Taking into account the best interest of the student, parents, teachers and the society, it

</b>  Article 15 of the Law on Ministries and Other Bodies of Administration of BiH.

<p><b>17
</b>  See OSCE, &#8220;Rising a debate: Is BiH respecting its international commitments in the field of 
</p>
<p>education questions for the citizens of BiH&#8221;, p. 5, document provided to the Special Rapporteur 
by the OSCE Mission to BiH. 
<b>18
</b></p>
<p>  See Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, &#8220;Honouring of obligations and 
commitments by BiH, Doc. 10200, 4 June 2004, paragraph 132. </p>

</p>
<p>should also ensure the consistency of education standards in all schools and at all levels. Its 
application should correspond to the developmental needs of all children. The Law also provides 
that the standards of students&#8217; achievements and assessments are the responsibility of the 
Standards and Assessment Agency established by the inter-entity agreement of 2000. The 
various ministers for education adopted the common core curriculum in 2003 and its 
implementation plan was introduced for the school year 2003/04. However, the curriculum has 
not been implemented uniformly by the entities, in particular in some cantons in the Federation 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>15. With regard to the management of education institutions, the Law provides that each 
school should have its own board. The board is mainly responsible for the setting and 
implementation of school policy. Its members are elected from school staff, school founders, the 
local community and parents. Its composition must reflect the ethnic, religious and cultural 
structure of students and parents, school staff and the local community. The director of each 
public school is appointed by the school board, according to entity and canton laws and school 
rules. In addition, a parents&#8217; council and a students&#8217; council should also be established. Parents 
council members are appointed by the parents of students, according to general school acts. 
Students&#8217; councils are established with the help of the school, according to its rules. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Law on the Agency for Preschool, Primary and Secondary Education 
</b></p>
<p>16. In October 2007, the State Parliament adopted the Law on the Agency for Preschool, 
Primary and Secondary Education. It establishes such an agency and regulates its legal status, 
organization, competences and other issues related to its work. The agency would be an 
independent organization with an expert body - the board - composed of seven members: two 
from each constituent people and one member from the others.<b>20</b> 
</p>
<p>17. The Law derogates some provisions of the Framework Law on Primary, Secondary 
Education in Bosnia and Herzegovina with regard to the authorities responsible for establishing 
education standards: the Curriculum Agency and the Standards and Assessments Agency.<b>21</b> 
According to article 17 of the new law, the entity Governments are to revoke the decisions on 
establishing the education standards and assessment agency for the Federation of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska within three months from the day of its effectiveness.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>19
</b>  See para. 63. 
</p>
<p><b>20
</b>  Constituent people makes reference to the 3 ethnic groups composing BiH: Bosniacs, Croats 
</p>
<p>and Serbs. 
<b>21
</b></p>
<p>  See paras. 11-15. 
<b>22
</b></p>
<p>  The law entered into force on 28 November 2007 (art. 18). </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/10/Add.4 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p>18. The agency for preschool, primary and secondary education would be in charge of 
development of common core curricula in preschool, primary and secondary education. It would 
also be responsible for establishing the standards of knowledge, the assessment of the results 
achieved, standards for other technical affairs in the field of knowledge standards and education 
quality assessment. The agency would monitor, evaluate, advance and develop the common core 
curricula and monitor its implementation. Furthermore, it would provide guidelines for the 
preparation of training programmes on the application of curricula for teachers and other 
education experts. It would also provide them with advice on the development and 
implementation of new syllabi. The agency would therefore centralize the tasks regarding the 
development of the common core curriculum, as well as the quality standards and assessments in 
the field of education at the State level. 
</p>
<p>19. The Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina would be in charge of appointing the 
agency&#8217;s board and the Ministry of Civil Affairs would participate in its work and supervise the 
implementation of the Law, which reinforces the competencies of the State regarding educational 
matters. The board should, inter alia, establish standards of knowledge and assessments of the 
results achieved, approve the common core curricula for the primary and secondary education 
and provide advice and recommendations to competent educational authorities concerning the 
issues within its competence. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Framework Law on Higher Education in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
</b></p>
<p>20. After long political debate and discussions, the Framework Law on Higher Education was 
adopted on 30 July 2007. This should be seen as an example of the country&#8217;s commitment to 
carrying out necessary reforms of the education system, in compliance with the fundamental 
principles and shared values of the Member States of the Council of Europe, as expressed by the 
Declaration of Ministers for Education adopted in Bologna in 1999.<b>23</b> The Law would allow 
diplomas and academic titles and degrees issued by Bosnian universities to be recognized by all 
the countries that have signed the declaration. 
</p>
<p>21. The Framework Law regulates the organization of higher education in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and the responsibilities of competent authorities. It also establishes bodies for its 
implementation and the methods to ensure quality in higher education.  
</p>
<p>22. The Law states that access to higher education regulated by licensed higher education 
institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina shall not be restricted, directly or indirectly, on any actual 
or presumed grounds such as gender, race, sexual orientation, physical or other impairment, 
marital status, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social 
origin, association with a national community, property, birth, age or other status.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>23
</b>  BiH also ratified the Lisbon Convention regarding the recognition of qualifications 
</p>
<p>concerning Higher education in the European region in 2004. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/10/Add.4 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>23. In addition, the Law gives legal personality and institutional autonomy to all licensed 
higher education institutions. It also provides that they enjoy significant freedom with regard to 
teaching and in scientific and research work. The Law also establishes the institutions that are in 
charge of higher education at the State and local levels, determining their competencies.  
</p>
<p>24. The Ministry of Civil Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina is responsible for the 
implementation of the Law, and, among other tasks, for the coordination and development of 
higher education in the country in consultation with relevant ministries.<b>24</b> A Rector&#8217;s Conference 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be established by an agreement of the universities and will 
determine and represent the common interests of universities. In addition, a centre for 
information and recognition of documents is responsible for several tasks regarding the 
recognition of degrees and diplomas.  
</p>
<p>25. Moreover, the agency for development of higher education and quality assurance, which 
would be an autonomous administrative body, would be competent to set criteria for 
accreditation of higher education institutions and adoption of norms setting minimum standards 
in the field of higher education. The agency would give recommendations on criteria and 
standards to the Ministry of Education of the Republika Srpska, cantonal ministries and the 
District of Br&#269;ko for the establishing or closing of higher education institutions and for 
restructuring study programmes.<b>25</b> The agency would be managed by a director and two deputies 
appointed by the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina and would be governed by a 
governing board composed of 10 members, 3 from each constituent people and 1 representing 
others, appointed by the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<b>26</b> The agency 
would be financed by the Bosnia and Herzegovina budget. 
</p>
<p>26. The Law provided that higher education institutions were to have harmonized their statutes 
and other general acts with the provisions of the Framework Law by February 2008; the same 
applied to the laws of the Republika Srpska, and cantonal laws on higher education.<b>27</b> Moreover, 
accreditation for higher education institutions was to be conducted within two years of the date 
of the Law entering into force (August 2007).  
</p>
<p>27. Cantonal ministries and the Ministry of Education of the Republika Srpska are competent 
for all the areas that are not included in the Law. Therefore, the State formulates general 
standards for higher education institutions, while cantonal authorities and the Ministry of 
Education of the Republika Srpska are in charge of licensing the operation of individual 
universities.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>24
</b>  Article 42. 
</p>
<p><b>25
</b>  Articles 48 and 49. 
</p>
<p><b>26
</b>  According to article 62 the Council of Ministers should appoint the Governing Board and the 
</p>
<p>director no later than 8 February 2008. 
<b>27
</b></p>
<p>  Articles 60.1 and 66. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/10/Add.4 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur would like to point out that many interlocutors encountered during 
his visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina, including university authorities, professors and students, 
expressed their concern at the difficulties in implementing the Law, particularly in the cantons. 
Moreover, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the deadlines established by the Law to 
harmonize higher education institutions and cantonal laws on higher education with the 
Framework Law (February 2008) have not been respected. The Special Rapporteur invites 
authorities to reach agreements promptly to allow the implementation of the Law. This would 
help solve one of the most serious problems of higher education in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
namely the problem of recognition of university diplomas. This issue further delays the 
implementation of complex measures required to accelerate the entry into force of the Bologna 
process in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
</p>
<p>29. In addition, it is imperative that the mechanism established by the Law for the 
accreditation of higher education institutions be implemented. This would permit management of 
the uncontrolled growth in Bosnia and Herzegovina of higher education institutes experienced in 
recent years, which has had a very negative impact on the quality of tertiary education in the 
country.<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur invites authorities to establish information mechanisms, such as 
dissemination and sensitization programmes, in order to facilitate the participation of a wide 
variety of stakeholders, such as students, professors and university authorities, to provide input 
to the process. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of the Framework Laws on Primary and 
Secondary Education in Bosnia and Herzegovina, on the Agency for Preschool, Primary and 
Secondary Education and on Higher Education in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He also recognizes 
the efforts made by Bosnian authorities to establish a general framework to reform the education. 
However, he considers that this is only the beginning of a long process of implementation that, to 
be successful, will necessitate the full engagement and support of all the relevant authorities, in 
particular at the local level.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Enjoyment of the right to education 
</b>32. The international obligations of States with regard to the enjoyment to the right to 
education as defined by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant

and of making primary education compulsory and free of charge.<b>29</b>

</p>
<p>33. In order to facilitate the analysis of these obligations, it has been established that the right 
to education is guided by four principles: availability, accessibility, acceptability and 
adaptability.<b>30</b> The Special Rapporteur intends to analyse some aspects of these four principles in 
this section. However, he will also address other related issues in the second part of the present 
report, insofar as they refer to the most important challenges for the right to education in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina.  
</p>
<p><b>1.  Availability 
</b></p>
<p>34. Functioning educational institutions and programmes have to be available in sufficient 
quantity for all school-age children.  
</p>
<p>35. Primary education is compulsory for all children in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as established 
by the Framework Law on Primary and Secondary Education. This provision constitutes a 
positive step in terms of availability. However, according to data compiled by the ministries of 
education and non-governmental organizations in 2003, approximately 1,300 children 
nationwide did not attend school. The Human Development Report /Millennium Development 
Goals for Bosnia and Herzegovina indicated that, in 2002, literacy rates for people aged 15 and 
over was 82.3 per cent for women and 96 per cent for men; the percentage left outside primary 
schools was estimated at 4 per cent.<b>31</b> In this regard, the Special Rapporteur expresses his 
concern regarding the absence of statistics or indicators that would allow adequate and accurate 
analysis of the situation of the enjoyment of the right to education in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
There are no official statistics neither on enrolment, school completion or dropout rates, nor on 
teacher-student ratio and gender parity, which would reflect the general situation of the 
country.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur welcomes initiatives such as the action plan on school enrolment 
and completion in Bosnia and Herzegovina, adopted by 13 ministries of education of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina,<b>33</b> which requests relevant authorities to ensure regular and systematic collection of

<p>  The Action Plan was elaborated by the Task Force on school enrolment and completion of 
BiH with the collaboration of OSCE Mission to BiH in February 2005 and was adopted by the 
Ministries on education in May 2006. This Plan of Action makes part of the Education Reform 
Strategy, which was presented by BiH Entity Education Ministers, the FiBH Deputy Minister of 
Education and the BiH Minister for Human Rights and Refugees to the EU in Brussels in 2002. 
This document goal is to de-politicize education and create conditions that will ensure equal 
access to high quality modern education in BiH.  </p>

<p>data on school enrolment and completion. However, he believes that concerted efforts should be 
made to create an official statistics database at the national level. Such a database would compile 
the information necessary to assess the enjoyment of the right to education in the whole territory 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including all levels of education, from preschool to university, as 
well as non-formal education. Furthermore, it is necessary that the country&#8217;s public authorities 
engage in developing and using indicators that can identify the root causes of segregation and 
discrimination, in a manner that ensure the effectiveness of the policies that guarantee the 
inclusion of all students. In the process of generating and applying indicators, municipalities also 
should play a significant role. 
</p>
<p>37. In addition, there is a gap in the coverage of preschool education. According to unofficial 
statistics, only 6 per cent of children are covered, while there are hardly any preschool 
institutions in rural areas.<b>34</b> The Special Rapporteur invites education authorities to adopt 
measures promptly, such as by-laws and rules and regulations, to implement the framework laws 
on preschool, and on primary and secondary education, which establishes that preschool 
education should be an integral part of the education system and be regulated in detail through 
entity, cantonal and District of Br&#269;ko legislation.<b>35</b> 
38. States have to ensure that the necessary investments are made in order to make education 
available to all children. For instance, it is necessary to provide schools with adequate 
infrastructure and teachers with competitive salaries. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the funds for 
salaries and allowances constitute, on average, over 80 per cent of total resources, which reduces 
infrastructure investments; other expenses required to ensure adequate teaching conditions, such 
as equipment and textbooks, account for less than 20 per cent of total resources.<b>36</b> Moreover, the 
allocation of resources is not uniform; it depends on independent and often uncoordinated 
decisions of the entities and the cantons. 
</p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur believes that improvements should be made to school 
infrastructure. Students and teachers have complained about the lack of resources and the 
inadequate studying and teaching conditions. In addition, schools are not equipped according to 
students&#8217; and teachers&#8217; needs. The equipment in primary and secondary schools is outdated, with 
no computers or access to information technology. Libraries do not have a sufficient number of 
books.<b>37</b>

</p>
<p>40. With regard to the employment conditions of teachers, in spite of the investment of the 
majority of total education resources in salaries, in some cases they are not even sufficient to pay 
the consumption basket.<b>38</b> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the decisions of a few cantons to 
establish a teacher rank aimed to improve teachers&#8217; revenues. However, these measures are not 
generalized and the majority of teachers are still struggling with low salaries. The Special 
Rapporteur encourages all relevant authorities to devote more resources to the education sector, 
not only to improve salaries, but also to improve infrastructure conditions in all schools, in both 
the urban and rural areas. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>41. Education institutions and programmes have to be accessible to everyone, without 
discrimination, which includes economic and physical accessibility. 
</p>
<p>42. According to the Framework Law on Primary and Secondary Education, primary education 
is free of charge and every child has the right to benefit from it. Nevertheless, the Special 
Rapporteur observed that there are economic obstacles in the access to education. Parents are 
responsible for paying certain fees, such as textbooks, transport to school and meals. The 
inability of parents to finance their child&#8217;s education has been identified as one of the reasons for 
non-enrolment and non-completion of primary school.<b>39</b> Another reason is restricted access to 
schools for children in remote rural areas. Families living in remote zones are often discouraged 
from sending their children to school, mainly due to costs of transportation or because of security 
considerations on the way to school.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>43. In addition, over-aged children have to pay very high fees in order to have access to 
education. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur has observed that several education authorities have implemented 
some measures in order to eliminate obstacles in access to education, in particular for vulnerable 
groups.<b>41</b> Moreover, he is aware of the long-term measures to remove financial and 
administrative barriers to schools envisaged by the action plan on school enrolment and 
completion adopted by the ministries of education. The plan includes catch-up classes and 
support for disadvantaged children, as well as procurement of textbooks and meals.<b>42</b>

</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur calls upon education authorities at all levels to implement 
promptly the action plan measures and encourages them to act in an articulated and coordinated 
way, in order to achieve equal access of all children in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in particular to 
primary school. Major efforts must be made to define a common national policy regarding equal 
access to education, based on the legal framework that already exists. Disarticulated policies on 
this matter are generating inequality and are affecting the enjoyment of the right to education of 
children.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  Acceptability 
</b></p>
<p>46. Acceptable education means that acceptable teaching methods and contents should be used 
by States. Education should be relevant, culturally appropriate and of good quality.  
</p>
<p>47. There is a great discrepancy in the quality of education among schools. For many years, it 
was due to the absence of strong coordination mechanisms and quality assurance bodies, as well 
as of adequate legislation that would have set the same quality standards for the whole territory 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<b>43</b> The Law on The Agency for Preschool, Primary and Secondary 
Education provides an appropriate legal framework to overcome this obstacle. The Special 
Rapporteur notes with satisfaction that, in January 2008, the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina issued a number of decisions referring to the implementation of that law and the 
necessary harmonization of lower-level legislations.<b>44</b> Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that 
there is no reference in these decisions to the actual date by which lower-level jurisdictions 
should harmonize their laws with the Framework Law. 
</p>
<p>48. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur has observed that there is insufficient investment in 
teacher training, despite recognition by the authorities that there is a high number of 
non-qualified teachers. There are no incentives for teachers to acquire teaching qualifications.<b>45</b> 
The Special Rapporteur has been informed of cases where teachers have paid out of their own 
pockets to receive training. Universities are in charge of teacher training, although there are no 
clear rules on their role. In addition, there are no adequate channels of communication between 
universities and the bodies in charge of the elaboration of curricula, the pedagogical institutes. 
</p>
<p>49. Given the inaction of the State, some non-governmental organizations and the international 
community are assuming the responsibility for training teachers. The Special Rapporteur would 
like to recall that it is the obligation of the State to continually improve the material conditions of 
teaching staff,<b>46</b> which includes the obligation of providing them with opportunities for 
</p>

<p>professional development. He therefore invites authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina to adopt 
measures that ensure equal access of every teacher to qualification. He also invites authorities to 
establish clear criteria regarding the role of universities in relation to the training of teaching 
staff. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Adaptability 
</b></p>
<p>50. Education has to be flexible so it can adapt to the needs of changing societies and 
communities and respond to the needs of students.  
</p>
<p>51. Currently, human rights education and sexual education are the only cross-cutting topics in 
the curricula, and taught either in democracy or biology courses. In some schools, 
non-governmental organizations provide human rights education and sexual education, thus 
substituting the State, which is responsible for ensuring that the education system is adaptable.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur believes that it is necessary to include programmes on sexual 
education and human rights as individual subjects into the curriculum of the Federation of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska.  
</p>
<p>53. In addition, he encourages the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to implement the 
plan of action for the first phase of the World Programme for Human Rights Education.<b>47</b>  
</p>
<p><b>III.  MOST IMPORTANT CHALLENGES 
</b></p>
<p>54. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur identified two main issues which affect the 
enjoyment of the right to education in Bosnia and Herzegovina: the excessive fragmentation and 
politicization of the education system; and the segregation between ethnic groups and 
assimilation processes based on ethnic motives.  
</p>
<p><b>A.  Fragmentation and politicization 
</b></p>
<p>55. As stated above, education in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the responsibility of 14 ministries 
of education, each with its own education policies and budget. There is no coordination or 
cooperation between them. The State Ministry of Civil Affairs acts as mediator between the 
ministries, but has no power to give instructions. Likewise, the Ministry of Education and 
Science of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina operates as a mediator between cantonal 
ministries and the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and has no power to address instructions to cantonal 
ministries. The Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic Srpska has its own policies 
and is completely independent of the Ministry of Civil Affairs. 
</p>
<p>56. There are some initiatives that promote coordination between ministries. Most of them 
are implemented by the international community, such as the coordination board for the 
interim agreement on returnee children and the task force on the education of Roma. The 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>47
</b>  See A/59/529/Rev.1. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/10/Add.4 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur commends these initiatives; nevertheless, he is concerned about the lack of 
mechanisms to ensure implementation throughout the country once recommendations have been 
made.<b>48</b>  
</p>
<p>57. With regard to the inter-ministerial conference, in which all ministries of education are 
convened to discuss information regarding the field of education and to harmonize its activities, 
the Special Rapporteur is concerned that this body does not meet regularly and has not been 
given any binding decision-making powers. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur encourages 
the recently established conference of ministers for education in Bosnia and Herzegovina<b>49</b> to 
play an effective role in ensuring coordination and cooperation among the 14 ministries of 
education. He calls on its members to overcome their differences<b>50</b> and start to work together in 
view of the unification of the Bosnian education system. 
</p>
<p>58. Currently, as a result of the lack of coordination between ministries responsible for the 
implementation of laws, national laws are simply not implemented. In addition, this lack of 
clarity opens the door to politicization in all issues related to education.<b>51</b> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Fragmentation 
</b></p>
<p>59. The Framework Law on Primary and Secondary Education is the most representative 
example of the non-implementation of national laws. According to article 59 of the Law, all 
State, entity, cantonal and District of Br&#269;ko laws, as well as other relevant regulations in the field 
of education, were to have been harmonized with its provisions within six months of the date of 
entering into force, 1 January 2004. This did not occur. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>District and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers on January 2008. 
<b>50
</b></p>
<p>  The Special Rapporteur has been informed about some difficulties in coordination among the 
Ministries of FBiH. Four Croat-majority canton Ministers of education refused to attend a 
meeting of the Text Book Council chaired by the Minister of education of FBiH, alleging that 
strengthening the education system at the federation level is unacceptable. 
<b>51
</b></p>
<p>  In February 2005 the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights analyzed this first 
report submitted by BiH. It recognized the difficulties preventing the implementation of the 
Covenant - the effects of the armed conflict - but noted that the constitutional framework for BiH 
imposed by the DPA &#8220;confers limited responsibility and authority to the Government at the State 
level, in particular in the field of economic, social and cultural rights, and creates a complex 
administrative structure, which often results in the lack of harmonization and implementation of 
laws and policies relating to the equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by the 
population&#8221;. UN E/C.12/BIH/CO/1 24 January 2006. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/10/Add.4 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>60. For example, the nine-year education provision (article 16.3) is not implemented uniformly 
in all parts of the country.<b>52</b> The Republic of Srpska introduced it before the adoption of the law, 
at the start of the 2003/4 school year. In the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federal 
Ministry of Education coordinated the development of this model, as well as a model curriculum 
for the first grade for the 2004/5 school year. However, when the models were presented to the 
cantonal ministries of education for their adoption, some of them refused to endorse them. As a 
result, children in Bosnia and Herzegovina are following different study programmes, depending 
on the place where they live. In addition, even in those cantons where the nine-year module was 
adopted, there are different levels of implementation. Complaints were heard about the lack of 
clear guidelines to implement the provision in a cohesive manner, as well as the lack of trained 
teachers, in both The Republic of Srpska and The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur considers the lack of uniform implementation of the nine-year 
education a potential impediment for the mobility of pupils and a threat to their freedom of 
movement.<b>53</b> 
</p>
<p>62. There is a variety of curricula in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Each ministry of education 
decides which curriculum should be taught in the schools under its jurisdiction. The Framework 
Law on Primary and Secondary Education attempted to address this situation, with the 
provisions of a common core curriculum (arts. 42 and 43). The objective was to ensure that 
students across the country learn a minimum of common elements and to facilitate the mobility 
of pupils. Nevertheless, as already mentioned, it has not been implemented in all schools of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, in spite of its adoption in 2003.<b>54</b> 
</p>
<p>63. With regard to the subjects covered by the common core curriculum, some are the same for 
all the pupils in Bosnia and Herzegovina, while the remainder vary according to the canton or 
entity curricula. Subjects such as maths and sciences are almost entirely covered by the common 
curriculum, while language, literature, history, geography, nature and society and religious 
instruction are almost completely different, depending on the area of the country where they are 
taught and the ethnic majority. For example, countries used as references in history curricula are 
the neighbouring countries, such as Serbia and Croatia, and not Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
</p>
<p>64. The adoption of the Law on the Agency for Preschool, Primary and Secondary Education 
constitutes a step in the right direction. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur is concerned that 
this Law risks having the same fate as the Framework Law on Primary and Secondary 
Education, especially when considering that most of the problems in the implementation of the 
common core curriculum derive from the difficulty in reaching agreements on sensitive subjects. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>52
</b>  According to article 16 of the Framework Law on Primary and Secondary Education, the 
</p>
<p>deadline to implement the nine years education was 2004. 
<b>53
</b></p>
<p>  See OSCE, op. cit., p. 9. 
<b>54
</b></p>
<p>  See note 23 Framework Law on Primary and Secondary Education in BiH. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/10/Add.4 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>65. Textbooks also constitute a challenge. In spite of efforts, mainly promoted by the 
international community, in particular by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (OSCE),<b>55</b> textbooks on sensitive subjects remain ethnically oriented. 
66. The Special Rapporteur encourages ethnic group leaders and politicians to actively 
collaborate with the Agency for Preschool, Primary and Secondary Education to define and 
implement an ethnically sensitive common-core curriculum. The new curriculum should 
incorporate an intercultural approach, through which the cultural specificities can be preserved, 
in conformity with international human rights standards, in particular with article 28 of the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. In other words, this curriculum must be objective, not 
ethnically coloured and should integrate minimum quality standards. 
</p>
<p>67. Moreover, the provisions of the Framework Law on Primary and Secondary Education on 
catchment areas are not implemented. According to article 12, all public primary schools should 
have a catchment area. All students of compulsory school age living within that area have a right 
to enrol and attend school. Attendance at school is mandatory, unless the student attends a 
private school or is exempted from attendance as further provided in the Law. 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur has observed that this principle is not being uniformly applied in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. One of the main reasons is the inadequate content of curricula. In some 
areas, parents prefer to send their children to a school outside the catchment area because of the 
curriculum content.<b>56</b> 
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur believes that the high level of fragmentation of the education 
system in Bosnia and Herzegovina constitutes a serious obstacle to the enjoyment of the right to 
education. It has an important impact on all its components: availability, accessibility, 
acceptability and adaptability.<b>57</b> The difficulty in reaching agreements between all the actors 
involved in the decision-making process on the implementation of education policies is seriously 
jeopardizing the education system itself. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>55
</b> For example, in 2004, the OSCE mission together with the Council of Europe and the Georg 
</p>
<p>Eckert Institute, supported the establishment of a commission for history and geography 
textbook authors. The commission developed a set of guidelines. However those guidelines do 
not bind education authorities. Moreover, there is another project of the canton of Mostar, jointly 
with the OSCE, aimed to issue history textbooks, which reflects different views on BiH&#8217;s 
history, including representatives of constituent nationalities. However, due to a lack of 
consensus these textbooks skip the war period. 
<b>56
</b></p>
<p> For example, the Special Rapporteur was informed that this occurs in schools located at the 
Entities&#8217; border, in schools located at canton&#8217;s borders or even within cantons. 
<b>57
</b></p>
<p> The Committee on the Rights of the Child has expressed the same concern. 
CRC/C/15/Add.260, para  8. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/10/Add.4 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur believes that it is imperative to implement the national legislation 
that already exists. In this regard, he encourages Bosnian authorities, in particular the ministries 
of education, to implement more effective mechanisms of cooperation between ministries.  
</p>
<p>71. The Special Rapporteur also invites all stakeholders involved in the education process, in 
particular political authorities, to start considering the possibility of enlarging the responsibilities 
of the State in the field of education. The Ministry of Civil Affairs could play a leading role. For 
this purpose, it would be necessary to grant more faculties or prerogatives to the ministry. This 
would allow it to play an active role in the implementation of national legislation with regard to 
education. Such increased powers should be accompanied by the provision of necessary 
resources, as well as mechanisms aimed to ensure equal representation of all ethnic groups and 
minorities. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Politicization  
</b></p>
<p>72. Education in Boznia and Herzegovina is widely perceived as a political tool; in practice, 
the school becomes a sort of &#8220;cold war&#8221; zone where students become victims of the bitterness 
and stereotypes projected by adults. This is not only reflected in the organization of the 
education system, but also in the lack of implementation of national laws. It also has an impact 
on the lack of coherent and uniform education policies. 
</p>
<p>73. According to OSCE, the 10 cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while all 
ethnically mixed to some extent, are often described in terms of the majority that dominates each 
one: five cantons are said to be Bosniak majority cantons, three are Croat majority cantons, and 
two are mixed and effectively divided among Bosniaks and Croats. In each of these cantons, the 
dominant majority tends to determine the shape and content of education. This is also true in the 
case of the Serb-dominated Republic of Srpska.<b>58</b>  
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur observed that, in spite of the provision of the Framework Law on 
Primary and Secondary Education aimed at forbidding activities of political parties in schools,<b>59</b> 
those parties still have a considerable influence. School boards are generally controlled by the 
main political party, which often has a nationalist and/or ethnic orientation. 
</p>
<p>75. According to the Framework Law, the director of each public school is appointed by the 
school board, in accordance with the proceedings envisaged by entity, cantonal and District of 
Br&#269;ko laws, and school rules. The Framework Law contains some provisions aimed at protecting 
schools from political influence.<b>60</b> However, the Special Rapporteur observed that these 
provisions are not sufficient.

<p>76. The Special Rapporteur was informed about a case in Zenica, where a school director 
appointed by the school board was not confirmed by the cantonal ministry, which did not invoke 
any legal basis. As a result of the insistence of the school board to maintain the appointment, 
three of its members were changed by the ministry. The new school board appointed a different 
candidate, who was not qualified for the position. The dismissed candidate brought his case 
before a tribunal, which decided to nullify the procedure, declaring that the second candidate was 
not qualified, and ordered a new appointment process to be held. 
</p>
<p>77. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the above case indicates a trend of political 
influence in the nomination of school directors and teachers in general. He is also concerned by 
denouncements regarding the impunity of these kinds of actions. The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the decision of the tribunal of Zenica. However, he remains concerned by the fact that 
this is an isolated case. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur therefore calls on the Bosnian authorities to ensure employment 
stability of education staff, based on objective, predetermined criteria for selection. In addition, 
he invites authorities to establish effective procedures to eliminate political interference in 
schools, for example, by eliminating the prerogative of ministers to confirm school directors. 
</p>
<p>79. Moreover, the excessive fragmentation makes cantons more vulnerable to political 
influence. In cantons with a very limited jurisdiction, for example over only five primary 
schools, political groups have the possibility of exerting more pressure on local authorities.<b>61</b> In 
addition, ministers for education are often changed, which constitutes an obstacle to the 
continuity of education policies. 
</p>
<p>80. The absence of a national teachers&#8217; trade union in Bosnia and Herzegovina, reflects the 
politicization of education. Bosniak and Croat teachers&#8217; trade unions have not reached an 
agreement to constitute a unified trade union federation. In addition, teachers&#8217; trade unions play 
an active role neither in education reform nor in the implementation of education legislation. 
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur welcomes efforts made by some trade unions to fight 
discrimination in schools, such as campaigns against segregation in schools. However, he 
considers that teachers should be much more involved in the education reform process in the 
fight against all forms of discrimination in schools and in the protection of the human right to 
education. 
</p>
<p>82. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina acknowledges the politicization of education 
and that it constitutes an obstacle to the establishment of an education system in compliance with 
its international obligations.<b>62</b> The Special Rapporteur believes that this acknowledgement is a

<p>

<p><b>61
</b>  For example, two new textbooks on history and geography have been withdrawn from a 
</p>
<p>canton&#8217;s education system, because of a demonstration of a group of veterans against them. 
These textbooks were the result of a project sponsored by the OSCE and the CoE, which was 
aimed to exclude ethnically coloured references in those textbooks.

</p>
<p>good sign. Nevertheless, he is very concerned about the lack of political willingness at the local 
level to transform the Bosnian education system into a system that respects human rights. He is 
also concerned by the fact that most of the initiatives to reform the education system have come 
from the international community. This reinforces the perception of a lack of interest of local 
politicians to improve the education system. 
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur urges political leaders, at both the federal and local levels, to 
overcome their differences and work together on the reform of the education system. The fact 
that local authorities use their autonomy in education matters to maintain discrimination on 
ethnic grounds constitutes a high risk of destabilization in the whole country. It could become a 
security issue in itself, as it hinders the development of a functional democratic State.<b>63</b>  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>84. Non-discrimination is a fundamental human rights principle, enshrined in article 26 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed in many other treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in which it is stated that the 
rights enunciated in the Covenant are to be exercised without discrimination of any kind as to 
race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, 
birth or other status.<b>64</b> 
</p>
<p>85. With regard to the right to education, the specific issue of equal rights in education is 
addressed in different human rights instruments, such as the Convention against Discrimination 
in Education, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. The right to education is also noted and protected by the 
First Protocol to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms, equally binding on Bosnia and Herzegovina<b>.</b> 
</p>
<p>86. As stated above, education institutions must be available and accessible to everyone, 
without discrimination. Furthermore, education must be acceptable and adaptable, responding to 
the needs of students in their diverse social and cultural settings.<b>65</b>In order to respond to the 
needs of changing societies and communities, education must therefore remain open for review 
and revision. 
</p>
<p>87. Sadly, discrimination on different grounds and in different forms still exists in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and has negative effects on the full enjoyment of human rights. One of the main 
challenges for Bosnia and Herzegovina today in the field of education is therefore to identify

<p>policies and implement strategies that are based on equality and non-discrimination. An inclusive 
approach would improve access to education for all and guarantee that national norms fully 
integrate overall values of justice, equality and human dignity. 
88. Although the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the right of parents to ensure that the 
religious and moral education of their children is in accordance with their own convictions, as 
stipulated in article 13 (3) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, he notes that the precise content of this provision is disputed worldwide. However, the 
Special Rapporteur notes with concern the increasing influence of religious leaders and 
communities on education and curricula. He is particularly concerned by a recent initiative 
aimed at introducing religious education in preschool institutions in Sarajevo and Tuzla canton. 
Most experts would agree that such a subject should not be taught until students are older. This 
initiative could increase the potential for further divisions based on religion and for subsequent 
discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b>1.  Assimilation 
</b></p>
<p>89. Before the 1992-1995 war, Bosnia and Herzegovina was distinguished by its 
multi-ethnicity and multiculturalism. It developed its education system to respond to its needs 
and realities. However, the system suffered not only from physical destruction during the war, 
but remains today under political, nationalist and ideological pressures that were compounded by 
the war. Besides the killings, destruction and other hardships of the war, thousands of Bosnians, 
including Bosniaks, Serbs, Croats, Jews, Roma and others, were forced to leave their homes and 
resettle. 
</p>
<p>90. Major problems arose when people started coming back to their homes that had been 
&#8220;ethnically cleansed&#8221; during the war. The domination of majority groups over minorities was to 
a large extent reflected in education policies. Some children from majority groups were openly 
hostile towards children from minority groups, the latter ones having access only to education 
that suited the needs of children belonging to the majority community. Obviously, there was also 
an unwillingness to accept living in multinational communities; introducing principles seeking 
common policies in education remained a major challenge. In addition, the complexity of the 
political system and disorganization left the education system open to manipulation by those in 
power. 
</p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur observed that, in some areas, children belonging to a different 
ethnic group than the majority faced a lack of educational structures suited to their specific 
cultural needs. This was true for all ethnic groups, including Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats, 
depending on the area they are located. However, he observed that this phenomenon 
predominates in the Republic of Srpska. 
</p>
<p>92. The Special Rapporteur calls upon federal, entity and cantonal authorities to offer all 
children, regardless of their ethnic origin, an acceptable and adaptable education in particular 
concerning the so-called national subjects: language, literature, history, geography, nature and 
society and religious instruction. It is unacceptable that children belonging to a minority in a 
specific area of the country are compelled to follow a curriculum that does not respect their 
cultural specificities.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/10/Add.4

</p>
<p><b>2.  Segregation 
</b></p>
<p>93. &#8220;Two schools under one roof&#8221; is a phenomenon that emerged after the war and has existed 
ever since. This practice sees children of different ethnicities attend the same school but are 
taught different curricula and at separate times. Children do not even meet during breaks and 
teachers use separate teachers&#8217; rooms. The same also applies to the school administration. 
</p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur notes with regret that, although there was no segregation at schools 
before the war, some political authorities erroneously find that such separation is unavoidable. 
Many argue that each child must learn in his or her mother tongue. They affirm this even though, 
according to a citizen opinion survey conducted in 2006,<b>66</b> 90 per cent of respondents believed 
that, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, there were three languages with minor differences 
(44 per cent), or &#8220;who cares, as long as we all understand each other&#8221; (46 per cent). Only 
8 per cent stated that the three languages were significantly different.<b>67</b> Although respect for 
diversity and multi-ethnicity is formally supported by the majority of relevant authorities, the 
presence of 54 &#8220;two schools under one roof&#8221; in the country indicates otherwise.<b> 68</b> 
</p>
<p>95. Even though Bosnia and Herzegovina was, and still is, under great political pressure from 
different international forums to solve the problem of &#8220;two schools under one roof&#8221;, it has still 
not identified measures to do it in an effective and sustainable manner. 
</p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur believes that segregation on ethnic grounds constitutes an 
unacceptable practice and can only reinforce existing prejudices, intolerance and social divisions. 
97. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur believes that, if students are neither given 
opportunities nor encouraged to build strong networks of friendship, tolerance and mutual 
respect as a basis of the educational process, the country risks failing to build a peaceful and 
developed society. 
</p>
<p>98. The situation, however, differs from one canton to another and some progress has been 
made. For example, in Mostar, a secondary school decided to merge both Bosniak and Croat 
school administrations into one legal entity. In that school, Bosniak and Croat children learn 
some subjects in the same classroom. The Special Rapporteur observed that students in the 
school had no objections to studying together with persons belonging to a different ethnic group 
and were open to going further in the ethnic integration process. The Special Rapporteur 
acknowledges that this is far from being a model of successful multi-ethnicity, but believes that 
it is a step in the right direction.

</p>
<p>99. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur considers that District of Br&#269;ko constitutes an 
example that should be followed in the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosniak, Croat and Serb 
students study together with the same curriculum, with respect for their own language and 
cultural specificities. The Special Rapporteur is aware of the objections against the adoption of 
this model in the rest of the country, but he shares the opinion of the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe that, with sufficient political will, it would be possible.<b>69</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Minorities 
</b></p>
<p>100. Bosnia and Herzegovina ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National 
Minorities of the Council of Europe in 2000. In addition, a law on the protection of national 
minorities was adopted in 2003. According to the law, entities and cantons should ensure that 
persons belonging to a national minority may, if they so request, receive teaching in their 
language.  
</p>
<p>101. With regard to the Roma population, an action plan on the education needs of Roma and 
members of other national minorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted in 2004.<b>70</b> Its goals 
included the removal of financial and administrative barriers to Roma school enrolment and 
completion, the participation of Roma parents and communities in the education process, 
increasing Roma teaching staff and sensitizing non-Roma teaching staff to the needs of Roma 
students. 
</p>
<p>102. The Special Rapporteur welcomes these initiatives. Nevertheless, he is concerned that they 
may remain on paper without measures taken to ensure their practical implementation. He is 
particularly concerned by the lack of access to education for a large number of Roma children 
because of the absence of identity documents.<b>71</b> 
</p>
<p>103. The Special Rapporteur encourages Bosnia and Herzegovina to implement expeditiously 
the recommendations made by the Committee on the Rights of the Child regarding 
discrimination suffered by minority children in Bosnia and Herzegovina, that the State Party 
strengthen its administrative and judicial measures to prevent and eliminate de facto 
discrimination against children, in particular, Roma children and children belonging to ethnic 
and/or religious minorities and other nationalities.<b>72</b>
